			<span class="indent">&nbsp;</span><p>Dear Alumnus / Alumni, <span align="right"><img align="right" valign="middle" style="margin-top:-120px;" width="125" height="133" src="images/spgfee.jpg" /></span></p>
<p>We wish to introduce a new section “<i>Student-Alumni Mentorship Programme</i>” on our portal which is being started with the aim of helping the students by bringing a wealth of knowledge and information that can positively impact students’ choices about their career and personal paths thereby making a profound difference on the life of a student and become a vital part of strengthening student success. Initially, the programme is being launched for the pre-final and final year students which will be expanded further depending on your vital inputs, time and guidance to the students.</p>

<p>I invite you to become a part of this initiative. As a mentor, you will play an important role in inspiring your student mentee to reach his/her full potential. Whatever your profession or career may be, your knowledge and experience will help your mentee navigate their transition from student to graduate to working professional.</p>

<p>Your role as an alumni mentor will be to <b>inspire, inform, guide, encourage and nurture</b>. You may offer up lessons learned from your own experiences, share with your mentee the keys to maintaining a healthy work-life balance, engage in discussions around setting career goals, or help in settling in a new place or environment</p>

<p>We are looking for alumni with vision, creativity, energy and time to share their advice and knowledge with pre-final and final year students. As a mentor, you can help the students by:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Encouraging</b>  student(s) to explore all of their options by sharing information about professional opportunities and helping to develop their networking, interviewing and job search skills.</li>
<li><b>Inspiring</b> the leaders of tomorrow to discover their talents and abilities and equipping them with the confidence they need to achieve their goals.</li>
<li><b>Guiding and nurturing</b> them by extending help in settling down at a new place, country or environment.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We would like to invite you all to share your expertise and become a part of our exciting programme by dedicating your valuable time for the students and strengthening your bond with the Alma Mater.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that you will be able to spare some of your valuable time for this activity by agreeing to become a mentor</p>
