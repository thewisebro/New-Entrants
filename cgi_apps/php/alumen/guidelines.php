<li>The alumni would be broadly categorized based on the industry, the area of mentorship, the number of students they would be willing to mentor, etc.</li>
<li>The student interface is initially for the 3rd yearites and 4th year U.G students but later may be extended to other students also.Here students would be able to search for mentors according to the location, area of interest, industry etc. Again, the contact information/Name/etc.All would not be revealed to the students.</li>
<li>The student would be able to, from the student interface of this application, “Express Interest” for being mentored by a particular Alumni. The mentor shall then, receive an email, along with brief bio of the student. The Alumni may then decide whether he/she would like to the student or not.

<li>After a relationship between them is formed, the interaction between the student/mentor is upto them.</li>
<li>If a student wants to contact an alumnus, who is not his/her mentor, he may do so by sending a private message to the alumni, without getting to know of the mentor's actual E-mail Id.</li>
