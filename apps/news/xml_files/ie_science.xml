<p>Apple is now India&#8217;s third largest tablet vendor and closing in on No 2 Micromax which now has a 8.9% market share. However, Apple&#8217;s 7.5% market share,  gained with help from its popular Apple Mini tablet, pales in comparison with market leader Samsung&#8217;s 18.7%, says IDC&#8217;s Worldwide Quarterly Tablet Tracker data for CY 2013.</p>

<p>According to IDC, India&#8217;s overall tablet shipments for CY 2013 stood at 4.14 million units representing a year-on-year growth of 56.4% over CY 2012. However, the high growth in the first half of 2013 driven by low-end devices, contracted substantially in the second half with adoption reaching levels of maturity.</p>
<p>In India, there is more acceptance for the 8 to 9 inch segment.</p>
<p>“The popularity of phablets has in fact crossed over the demand for 7 inch tablets. For a price conscious market like India, it is about owning a combination device, meeting the needs with one device instead of two. Also, the return rates on low cost 7 inch tablets have been unexplainably large. First time users latching onto such devices are now looking to move to products that offer better experience in terms of life span and quality” said, Karan Thakkar, Senior Market Analyst with IDC.</p>
<p>IDC anticipates the overall tablet market to remain flat in CY 2014. “The government mandate on BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) Certification mixed with the growing popularity of phablets is likely to obstruct the growth in the tablet category”, said Kiran Kumar, Research Manager with IDC.</p>
<p>However, there has been an uptake in the adoption of tablets amongst commercial users. These are primarily meeting relevant needs in industries such as financial services, healthcare, media and education, amongst others. “Activities such as interactive digital presentations, collecting KYC (Know your Customer) documents, and point-of-sale transactions are typical use cases”, added Karan Thakkar.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002505&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mwc-8.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1993610" alt="The Nokia X series phones will rely upon an open version of the Android mobile software system created by Google that has become the world's most popular software used in smartphones.  " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mwc-8.jpg?w=600" /></a> The Nokia X series phones will rely upon an open version of the Android mobile software system created by Google that has become the world&#8217;s most popular software used in smartphones.
<p>Nokia X, the Finnish phonemaker&#8217;s first tryst with Google&#8217;s Android plaform, seems set to come to India on March 10.</p>
<p>The company has sent invites for an event on March 10, which has to be the launch of the new phone. If you mix India&#8217;s fascination for</p>
<p>Android and the goodwill Nokia still commands in the country, the Nokia X family of phones could be a big hit. Add to this mix the fact that these phones will be priced as low as Rs 8,500.</p>
<p>However, while the Nokia X range will undoubtedly cut into the entry-level Android segement of local manufactuers. But on the other hand, there is a possibility that this will also cannibalise the sales of Nokia&#8217;s popular Lumia 520 smartphones.</p>
<p>This week at least one Indian e-commerce site has listed the Nokia X phone as coming soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/facebook.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000557" alt="Facebook said its policy change was made in consultation with a number of individuals and organizations" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/facebook.jpg" /></a> Facebook said its policy change was made in consultation with a number of individuals and organizations
<p>Facebook Inc  and its photo sharing subsidiary, Instagram, will delete posts offering to buy or sell guns without background checks, Facebook announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In an effort to curb what gun control advocates say is the increasing use of the social networks to circumvent checks and controls on firearms sales, Facebook and Instagram will also bar users under 18 from viewing gun offers posted by individuals or groups. &#8220;We will not permit people to post offers to sell regulated items that indicate a willingness to evade or help others evade the law,&#8221; Facebook said.</p>
<p>The move by the world&#8217;s largest social network and Instagram may add fuel to an already intense debate over U.S. gun rights, following a series of mass shootings across the country. A spate of shootings in recent weeks across the United States has renewed questions about the vulnerability of public places like shopping centers and schools and sparked fresh calls for stiffer gun controls such as universal background checks and limitations on the sale of ammunition.</p>
<p>States like Connecticut and New York have passed a series of new gun measures. But opponents, including the National Rifle Association, the nation&#8217;s leading gun rights lobby, argue that tighter restrictions would unfairly limit the rights of responsible gun owners.</p>
<p><strong>PLEADING THE SECOND</strong></p>
<p>Facebook said its policy change was made in consultation with a number of individuals and organizations, including New York state Attorney General Attorney Eric Schneiderman, Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Sandy Hook Promise and Moms Demand Action, which drew attention to loopholes on the Internet that allowed private sales of firearms without background checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our campaign exposed how simple it is for dangerous people to get their hands on guns, no questions asked &#8211; not only on Facebook and Instagram &#8211; but across the Internet,&#8221; Mayors Against Illegal Guns Chairman John Feinblatt said in a joint statement with Moms Demand Action.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, the ‘private sale loophole&#8217; allows anonymous parties to sell guns without background checks, and there are simply too many ways for criminals, minors and other prohibited gun purchasers to get them easily &#8211; with just the click of a mouse,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the NRA accused Mayors Against Illegal Guns of previously trying to inhibit free expression on Facebook.</p>
<p>The groups &#8220;tried to pressure Facebook into shutting down discussion of Second Amendment issues on its social media platforms,&#8221; said Chris Cox, executive director, NRA Institute for Legislative Action.</p>
<p>&#8220;NRA members and our supporters will continue to have a platform to exercise their First Amendment rights in support of their Second Amendment freedoms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects freedom of expression, as well as freedom of religion.</p>
<p>The Second Amendment says, &#8220;A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.&#8221; Whether the amendment protects an individual&#8217;s right to own firearms or solely a state&#8217;s right to self-defense has been heavily debated.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2002036" alt="D5300_BK_18_140_LCD_1.low" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/d5300_bk_18_140_lcd_1-low.jpg" /> Nikon D5300 costs Rs 71,950 with the Nikkor 18-140mm VR lens
<p dir="ltr">I have been using a Canon 400D for almost seven years now. Though just an entry-level DSLR, it was a big investment for me at the time, and the installment stretched over a year. Now, having used that camera to the maximum, I am looking at upgrade options.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Obviously, it would make more sense for me to buy a Canon, a 60D for instance. This is more so because I already have two Canon lenses and don’t need to buy kit lenses for the upgrade and can spend on something different like a prime lens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, I have been tempted to try out new cameras. For instance, the mirrorless cameras have been really good of late, and the portability they provide is something to kill for. On the other hand, Canon’s rival Nikon has been giving more pixels for the buck even as Canon sticks to its this is enough rule.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So when the opportunity to review the new Nikon D5300 came along, I had a personal reason to give it a spin. Upgrading from a Canon 400D, I was looking at three things in the D5300 &#8212; more pixels, video capabilities and ease of use. And those are the parameters in which I am going to review the D5300, which I tested with a Nikkor 18-140mm VR lens during a short trip to Bali, Indonesia.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002038" alt="D5300_BK_18_140_front.low" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/d5300_bk_18_140_front-low.jpg?w=480&#038;h=325" width="480" height="325" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Ease of use</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Canon 400D is among the easiest cameras to use. It took me a day to master the control though it took me ages to understand how a DSLR works. But the learning was fun and easy on the 400D. But with an upgrade I want a camera that will built for the new connected age.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I packed the D5300 into the Tamrac quick-draw bag that had been home to my Canon camera and two lenses for so many years, one thing was certain. I was taking a much more capable camera in the same bag. And, the 18-140 lens was good enough to replace the other two, and 18-55mm and a 75-300mm.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002037" alt="D5300_BK_top.low" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/d5300_bk_top-low.jpg?w=480&#038;h=323" width="480" height="323" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">My old camera uses a now-archaic CF card, but the D5300, like all cameras these days, uses a SD card that is faster and much more convenient. With a CF card and essential part of your camera kit if the card reader. But an SD card works almost anywhere and can be read directly by my laptop and host of other cameras and devices out there. Now, that is convenience that has been afforded by the natural progression of technology over the years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">My old camera has a tiny 2-inch LCD, so a 3.2&#8243; vari-angle LCD monitor is something that change the whole ball game for me. I now have angles that I did not have before and then shooting video is much easier with a large screen. But then my old camera hadn’t even heard of digital video.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, one thing bugged me a lot. The Live mode, which you use to record video, is activate by a lever alongside the control dial. In earlier Nikon cameras it used to be beside the screen. In its new location, it kept reminding me of the on/off switch in Canon cameras and I kept using it likewise.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Score: 4/5</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002035" alt="D5300_BK_18_140_LCD_2.low" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/d5300_bk_18_140_lcd_2-low.jpg?w=480&#038;h=266" width="480" height="266" /></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>More pixels</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The camera has a 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor. So that is a big jump for me from the 8MP sensor on my Canon. But this also means that I have a bigger canvas to play with. However, the camera did not give the sort of clarify I have come to expect from Nikon in recent times, especially having tested the superb D800. It is definitely not bad, but there were some low light pictures that could have used a bit more sharpness. But I am pretty certain that was because of the zoom lens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the other hand, the auto-focus is super fast and thanks to the Expeed 4 processor you move from one click to another even before you realise. The burst mode can be as fast as it can be and capturing pictures of moving subjects was real easy. The ISO12800 can be used by steady hands to create some superb compositions. My only issue is that there is no dedicated ISO button on the body and you have use the screen or the Fn buttons to change.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Score: 3.5/5</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Video capabilities</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Half a decade back I would not have dreamt of buying a still camera to shoot video. These days I don’t mind a chuckle at the expense of someone who has spent a packet to buy a handycam just for video. For me, the primary aim of an upgrade is the ability to shoot high quality video. And the D5300 is just amazing in that. For instance, I shot the video of a volcanic rock through which the sea has cut through over the millenia. The video was almost always in focus.Even when I zoomed away, the AF took milliseconds to lock on to the subject. Later, reviewing the results on a laptop, I was convinced that this is as good a video as any non-professional camera could shoot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, with long durations of video shooting I noticed that the LCD was heating up a bit. I have never seen this happen in any camera before and I think it must have been a minor defect with the review unit. Still, there is no doubt that the video was amazing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='475' height='356' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/aP_XNoLWVfI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Well, I might not upgrade to this camera. And that is not because there is anything wrong with the Nikon D5300. It is just that I have spent so much on the Canon ecosystem. However, if you are someone upgrading from an entry-level DSLR or even a prosumer, the Nikon D5300 is one of the best bets out there. This is one camera that can cover all your needs and still come out unscathed in the end.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They may look like guts stuffed in cellophane, but five fish hauled up from near-record depths off the coast of New Zealand are providing scientists with new insights into how deep fish can survive.</p>
<p>In a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists from the US, Britain and New Zealand describe catching translucent hadal snailfish at a depth of 7 km.</p>
<p>By measuring levels of a compound in the fish that helps offset the effects of pressure, the scientists say they&#8217;ve concluded that fish likely can&#8217;t survive below about 8,200 metres. That would mean no fish at all live in the deepest one-quarter of the world&#8217;s oceans.</p>
<p>The snailfish have little pigmentation due to the lack of light in their environment, hence their translucent appearance.</p>
<p>New Zealand marine ecologist Ashley Rowden, a co-author of the paper, said nobody had caught a snailfish in nearly 60 years and so he wasn&#8217;t overly hopeful when they sent down a box-like trap into the Kermadec Trench near New Zealand in late 2011.</p>
<p>He said they used mackerel as bait to attract the small sandhopper-like creatures the snailfish feed upon.&#8221;When it came up, it was just amazing to see. It was &#8216;Oh my God, we&#8217;ve got the fish, and we&#8217;ve got more than one,&#8217;Rowden said.</p>
<p>Rowden said he put on gloves and carefully picked up one of the fish.&#8221;It was like a water-filled condom,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The fish are the second-deepest recorded catch. In 1970, a boat off the coast of Chile reported catching a cusk eel at a depth of 8,370 meters in a trawl net, although questions remain whether that fish was caught at the ocean floor or higher up as the net was hauled in.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001548&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yahoo-llll.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001435" alt="&quot;Yahoo is continually working on improving the user experience, the company said in a statement. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yahoo-llll.jpg" /></a> &#8220;Yahoo is continually working on improving the user experience, the company said in a statement. (Reuters)
<p>Yahoo Inc will stop letting consumers access its various online services, including Fantasy Sports and photo-sharing site Flickr, by signing-in with their Facebook Inc or Google Inc credentials.</p>
<p>The change, which will be rolled out gradually according to a Yahoo spokeswoman, will require users to register for a Yahoo ID in order to use any of the Internet portal&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>The move marks the latest change to Yahoo by Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, who is striving to spark fresh interest in the company&#8217;s Web products and to revive its stagnant revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yahoo is continually working on improving the user experience,&#8221; the company said in a statement, noting that the new process &#8220;will allow us to offer the best personalized experience to everyone&#8221;.</p>
<p>The first Yahoo service to require the new sign-in process is Yahoo Sports Tourney Pick&#8217;Em, a service focused on the NCAA college basketball tournament which begins later this month. News of the change to Yahoo&#8217;s Tourney Pick&#8217;Em sign-in process was first reported by the technology blog Betanews.</p>
<p>Since Mayer took the reins in 2012, the company has rolled out new versions of many of its key products, including Yahoo Mail and Yahoo Finance. Last year, Yahoo announced a program to recycle inactive Yahoo user IDs, letting new users claim email addresses that have not been used for more than 12 months.</p>
<p>In eliminating the Facebook and Google sign-in features, Mayer, a former Google executive, is effectively reversing a strategy that Yahoo adopted in 2010 and 2011 under then CEO Carol Bartz.</p>
<p>The change to the Tourney Pick&#8217;Em sign-in process began on Monday, the Yahoo spokeswoman said, noting that users could still access other services with Google or Facebook IDs.</p>
<p>The sign-in buttons for Facebook and Google will eventually be removed from all Yahoo properties, the Yahoo spokeswoman, though she declined to provide a timeframe.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001404&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2001110" alt="Micromax Canvas Knight will be priced at Rs 26,999" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/canvas-knight4.jpg" /> Micromax Canvas Knight will be priced at Rs 19,999
<p>First things first. This is a phone from Micromax, but it does not look like a phone from Micromax. In fact, it looks like a phone from a well-heeled international brand, the sort that Micromax wants to become in the near future. This is the Micromax Canvas Knight, the phone that will take over the flagship mantle for the company from today.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 5-inch IPS display (1920&#215;1080 pixels, 443 ppi) | 2GHz Tru Octa core MediaTek MT MT 6592 processor | 2GB RAM | 32 GB storage + no microSD slot | 16MP rear camera, 8MP front camera, 1080p Full HD video | 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 | 2350mAh battery | Android 4.2 JellyBean<br />
<strong>Price: Rs 19,999</strong></p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-2001114" alt="Power and volume keys on the side" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/canvas-knight2.jpg" /> Power and volume keys on the side
<p><strong>Design:</strong> As I said this phone does not look like a Indian phone. In fact, it has the cuts and sides of the Apple iPhone 5s and even reminded me a bit of the Lava Iris Pro 30, which also had a similar design language. The unibody design is reinforced by what seems, and feels, like a graphite frame. There are mico-SIM slots on both sides that can be accessed by a pin. And, no there is no space for a SD card. Another thing that sets this phone apart is the power key, that is now placed along with the volume keys on the right. This take a bit of getting used to.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2001115" alt="canvas-knight1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/canvas-knight1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=586" width="480" height="586" /></p>
<p>The camera, the 16 MP sensor that it houses, results in a significant bump on the rear and there is an extra rear cover to sort of protect it. This feature is a bit like the one on the Nokia Lumia 502 and it becoming common in slim phones with large cameras. The phone is very light and easy to handle despite the large screen.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2001113" alt="canvas-knight3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/canvas-knight3.jpg?w=447&#038;h=600" width="447" height="600" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Screen &amp; Audio:</strong> The Full HD IPS panel is one of the best features of this phone. To start with, there is hardly any light bleed on the sides. The phone can be bright enough to be legible in bright sunlight. The audio quality is good, but not great. The overall experience, however, is quite good.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> This is a Tru Octa core phone. So performance should not be, and is not, and issue at all. In fact, the Antutu benchmark scored it in the top draw and exclaimed &#8216;amazing&#8217;. Yes, that doesn’t mean much for an average used. What matter for him is the fact that there is no lag anywhere and that multi-tasking is a breeze. We tried multi-tabbed browsing on Chrome and the experience was superb. However, with some games we noticed that the device did heat up quite a bit near the camera. Remember, the heat is coming through an extra layer of protection due to the rear cover.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2001579" alt="MMX Canvas Knight 3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mmx-canvas-knight-3.png?w=403&#038;h=224" width="403" height="224" />Memory:</strong> The phone has 32GB internal memory, out of which you get to use about 24GB. That is decent as you can download large apps and run them comfortable. The 2GB RAM should also stand you in good stead.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> The phone runs Android Jelly Bean with a tweaked UI that I did not like all that much. I suggest you switch to a new launcher that gives the slick look a phone with these specs needs. There is quite a bit of bloatware that you can easily delete.</p>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong> The two cameras certainly show a lot numbers. The rear camera for a change gives decent pictures even in low light and indoors. It is not great, but much better that most other Android cameras in this price range. There is a bit of noise in the images, but then there is also good detail when needed. The 8MP front camera is better than most phones, but is sluggish and is best used only for video calls and the occasional selfie. The camera comes with features like 3D panaroma, which is too much of work if you ask me.</p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-2001112" alt="Micromax Canvas Knight low-light test image. See the moon, that is quite an achievement" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/canvas1.jpg" /> Micromax Canvas Knight low-light test image. See the moon, that is quite an achievement
<img class="size-full wp-image-2001116" alt="This is shot early in the morning with hardly any sunlight. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/canvas3.jpg" /> This is shot early in the morning with hardly any sunlight.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2001117" alt="See the detail here. There is a bit of noise too if you blow up." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/canvas2.jpg?w=600" /> See the detail here. There is a bit of noise too if you blow up.
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> The 2350 mAh battery lasted a full day with average use and on low brightness. With full brightness and regular use with video and gaming, you will be lucky to get 10 hours out of this battery. This means the phone will be good for a regular day in office or college and last till the time you come back home. But if you are planning to hang out with friends on a gaming face-off, or want to go on a binge  video watching spree on a long train journey, you will need to invest on a power bank.</p>
<p><strong>Special Mention:</strong> For some time now, Micromax has been packaging its phones in boxes that mean business. It does this again with the Canvas Knight, the packaging gives a reassurance to the customer that they have bought something good. Even the printed material in the box and the accessories make you feel good.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> If you are looking for a high-end phone, but don’t want to spend a month’s salary on the same, the Micromax Canvas Knight can be a good pick. It packs almost everything you expect from an Android phone. The Micromax canvas Knight shows how Indian companies can also produce world class hardware that is stylish, functional and durable (or feels like it). The Knight is right there in the league of top-end Android phones, even though we know that it won&#8217;t cost that much. This one costs just Rs 19,999.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001106&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/astroid-lll.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001265" alt="The asteroid 2014 DX110, is expected to make its closest approach on Wednesday " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/astroid-lll.jpg" /></a> The asteroid 2014 DX110, is expected to make its closest approach on Wednesday. (Reuters)
<p>A newly discovered <a title="Astronomer spots asteroid smashing into Moon" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/astronomer-spots-asteroid-smashing-into-moon/" target="_blank">asteroid</a> will hurtle between the moon and the Earth on Wednesday. It will be passing by Earth on March 5 at around 21:06 Universal Time (UT)/ 4:06 PM EST close enough to dip inside the orbit of the moon.</p>
<p>The<a title="Rock science: Asteroids as space mines" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/rock-science-asteroids-as-space-mines/" target="_blank"> asteroid</a>, named 2014 DX110, was revealed just four days ago by the Pan-STARRS 1 survey and astronomers tracking it already have a good idea of its size and its orbit around the sun.</p>
<p>It is about 20-30 metres wide and about 16,000 metric tons. It&#8217;s specifically an Apollo asteroid — so called because its orbit is larger than Earth&#8217;s orbit and takes it on a path that crosses Earth&#8217;s orbit.</p>
<p>It is approximately 217,000 miles from the Earth.</p>
<p>The <a title="Large asteroid not likely to hit Earth in 2032: NASA" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/large-asteroid-not-likely-to-hit-earth-in-2032-nasa/" target="_blank">asteroid</a> is no threat to Earth or the Moon &#8211; it makes a pass 232,800 miles from our natural satellite one hour and 22 minutes after its closest passage from the Earth.</p>
<p>But if 2014 DX110 actually did hit Earth at some point, it would be comparable to the asteroid that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, back in February of last year.</p>
<p>Both the Slooh Space Camera and the Virtual Telescope Project will be broadcasting their flies of the asteroid on Wednesday starting at 4 am ET from the Slooh site, and at 3:30 pm ET from the Virtual Telescope page.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the moon, though, it&#8217;s not in the path of 2014 DX110 — the asteroid actually misses the moon with a wider margin than it does the Earth.</p>
<p>Since October 2008, dozen of asteroids have passed through the Earth. Although the closest one was found to be the asteroid 2011 CQ1 passed within 7,294 miles of us on Feb 4, 2011.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001223&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2001209" alt="AudioCase will work with iPhone 5s, 5c" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/phones-480.jpg" /> AudioCase will work with iPhone 5s, 5c
<p>To put it mildly, smartphone audio quality is horrible. Even as companies bring in Full HD screens and start thinking about 4K, they have not really been able to improve sound quality.</p>
<p>There seems to be a solution in sight. US-based Prescient Audio is planning to launch an audio-enhancing smartphone case through Kickstarter. The Illinois-based company is the developer of the ThinDriver TD-12, the world&#8217;s thinnest, lightest, coolest-running 12&#8243; subwoofer. Its Prescient AudioCase will be a sleek new audio-enhanced smartphone case for iPhone 5/5s and Samsung Galaxy S4.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crowdfunding is the perfect way for a cutting-edge company like ours to launch this newest product,&#8221; said Prescient founder and CEO Paul Niedermann in a release. He said the AudioCase will bring the highest quality audio possible to &#8220;people who care about smartphone sound &#8211; without awkward external speakers&#8221;.</p>
<p>A $99 Kickstarter Campaign pledge allows individuals to be among the first to own the AudioCase, a smartphone case featuring both TrueVoice and ThinDriver technology to enable high quality, high-volume, two-way audio. Kickstarter backing affords a significant discount to the planned retail price of $149.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001213&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-medium wp-image-1887939" alt="M_Id_387939_BlackBerry_Z10" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/05/m_id_387939_blackberry_z10.jpg?w=600" /> The BlackBerry Z10 is now selling for Rs 17,990
<p>If you were planning to cash in on the price cut and buy BlackBerry Z10 then you might have to wait a week or so to get your phone, for the smartphone has almost vanished from stores across India.</p>
<p>Now, available for a limited period offer price of Rs 17,990, the phone is sold out at most online as well as brick and mortar dealers. We could not find the phone is stock with most top NCR dealers. Some of them said new stock should be in by March 10.</p>
<p>When contacted, Sameer Bhatia, Director, Distribution, BlackBerry India, confirmed to indianexpress.com that the phone had indeed been &#8220;stocked out&#8221;. &#8220;We have seen great response to the commemorative offer for BlackBerry Z10 and it is true that we have been stocked out.</p>
<p>MUST-READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/at-rs-17990-blackberry-z10-seems-like-a-killer-offer-here-is-why/" target="_blank"><strong>BlackBerry Z10 is a big deal at Rs 17,990. Here is why</strong></a></p>
<p>Yes, we are looking at bringing fresh stocks in the next few days, so as to  ensure that more and more users are able to enjoy the cutting edge experience of a full-touch device combined with a revolutionary operating system,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>However, despite the huge price cut, marking BlackBerry&#8217;s tenth anniversary in India, online portals like Flipkart still have units selling for as high as Rs 22,990. Bhatia said this was because in the market place model any seller could list any product at their own price. &#8220;On Flipkart, authorized BlackBerry product is sold via WS Retail. At present, WS Retail is stocked out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BlackBerry Z10, the first smartphone to feature the new BB10 OS, was launched at a price of Rs 43,990.</p>
<p>There are suggestions that BlackBerry is working on a new flagship phone to win over new customers. Recently, <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-13970_7-57619525-78/blackberry-ceo-were-readying-another-flagship-to-win-over-new-customers/" target="_blank"><strong>BlackBerry CEO John Chen</strong> </a>said in Barcelona that a new flagship is on the way, though he did not guarantee when.  The new price cut could be a way to get rid of old stocks before it brings in the new devices.</p>

<p><strong>By Mohit Gundecha</strong><em></em></p>
<p>How many times were you uncomfortable when your brother-in-law or father sent you a friend request on Facebook? How often have you resisted posting about a wild night you had, fearing reprisal from office colleagues? Haven&#8217;t you felt embarrassed when a friend &#8216;tags&#8217; you in a picture that you don&#8217;t want everyone to see? Have you felt obligated to respond to someone&#8217;s WhatsApp message?</p>
<p>We all censor ourselves on Facebook. It is a &#8216;real&#8217; network’ of your real friends and family just like WhatsApp groups. We want to project an image of ourselves there for we know that every activity is watched and documented and it leaves a trail! This consciousness spoils the fun. You can&#8217;t be your real self the way you were say during your school days!</p>
<p>Facebook has now become a place of blurt, not just by our intimate circle of confidants, but also by the 900 &#8220;friends&#8221; we have on Facebook. There&#8217;s nothing wrong about but, what if we get bored of a Facebook or a WhatsApp in India? What will it take to get Indian people to be &#8216;real&#8217; online? What if you were on a social network where no one knows your name? Wouldn&#8217;t it be fun to say everything on your mind without worrying about alienating or offending or being judged by anyone?</p>
<p>As and when India gets bored of a Facebook, it could follow one of the two trends of social networking &#8211; Chinese or the US. China indulges in anonymous social networking. Most Chinese have their avatars or a virtual identity on networks like QQ or YY. They decorate their avatars, have virtual pets, send virtual gifts, buy virtual merchandise and play social games. QQ boasts of more than 800 million active users. Even in the smallest village in China, you will find QQ being extensively used. And does QQ make money? Well, yes! Tencent, the parent company of QQ is a 120 billion dollar company today.</p>
<p>Else, India could go with what&#8217;s emerging in the US today &#8211; ephemeral social networking &#8211; where nothing is permanent. US teens are flocking to a social network call SnapChat &#8211; which allows people to send ‘snap’ pictures or videos that disintegrate within 10 seconds. You can post a naughty picture or a selfie and it disappears in moments. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas! You may not want to give unnecessary visibility into your life to your extended family or your office friends. SnapChat&#8217;s early success is representative of increased desire for privacy. There are other apps like Secret or Whisper that allow users to post updates (aka secrets) under a cloak of semi-anonymity.</p>
<p>Most of us want entertainment. We may want to share our photos and views in a different way than a mere trail on our timeline. So, many look at their online social networks for entertainment apart from just a social communication channel. And from my personal experience of growing mig33 (a virtual social network with 60 million users in South Asia) in tier 2 and tier 3 cities of India, people come online for entertainment! Check someone&#8217;s mobile phone in Patna or Bhagalpur &#8211; Apart from a Facebook or a WhatsApp, you will see them active on at least one virtual social network &#8211; say a mig33 or Nimbuzz or Rocketalk.</p>
<p>These are early trends, but they are here to stay. Teens are fickle and they move really fast. No wonder Facebook bought WhatsApp to cover its insecurity. It had earlier offered to acquire SnapChat for $3 billion! Would these virtual or ephemeral social networks make money? They are actually much more monetisable compared to Facebook. The dominant business model for social networks is advertising.</p>
<p>You can charge a premium on advertising if you can show targeted ads to your audience. These virtual networks have a real potential to actually feel the human being. Thus, monetary benefits are obvious! Facebook sure knows a lot about us &#8211; and hence can claim to push targeted ads. Say, if you &#8216;like&#8217; a lingerie brands fan page on Facebook, it will show you ads of lingerie ecommerce companies on the right menu bar.</p>
<p>But, the big argument is &#8211; if we are not our real self on Facebook, and always have a projected image of ourselves, Facebook doesn&#8217;t know its users enough!</p>
<p>Plus, history shows that &#8216;utilities&#8217; are hard to monetize. An email or a messenger is a utility. How many of us will be willing to pay a subscription for using a Google talk or Skype messenger or even a WhatsApp? We expect that for free as it was always like that on the web.</p>
<p>Contrast this against a virtual social network &#8211; where you have no social or peer pressure. You will openly talk about your favourite alcohol brand, school crush, your desire to gift something personal to your partner etc. The virtual social network knows a &#8216;real&#8217; you. And hence has a higher possibility of targeting the ads that are relevant to you! Plus, people have a higher propensity to pay for entertainment online (not utilities).</p>
<p>Is virtual social networking new to India? Not really &#8211; Internet&#8217;s big pull in early days was anonymity. Remember the days of Yahoo groups? So, with a strong business model and a stronger value proposition to the end user, I won&#8217;t be very surprised that Virtual or Ephemeral Social Networks will make a comeback to India.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/usainbolt.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000666" alt="World-record holding sprinter, Usain Bolt, has reached top speeds of 12.27 metres per second. (PTI Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/usainbolt.jpg" /></a> World-record holding sprinter, Usain Bolt, has reached top speeds of 12.27 metres per second. (PTI Photo)
<p>Usain Bolt, the fastest man on Earth, is so fast that he could fly like a bird on Saturn&#8217;s moon Titan while wearing a wingsuit, according to a new study.</p>
<p>The world-record holding sprinter, Bolt, has reached top speeds of 12.27 metres per second, which would be fast enough for him to take off on Titan while wearing a regular wingsuit.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the Olympic athlete would then be able to soar above the planet &#8211; without any need for propulsion, said researchers at the University of Leicester in the UK.</p>
<p>Physics students at the university made the calculations in their final year paper for the Journal of Physics Special Topics, a peer-reviewed student journal run by the Leicester University&#8217;s Department of Physics and Astronomy.</p>
<p>Titan is Saturn&#8217;s largest moon, and has a dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere with a surface pressure almost 50 per cent stronger than Earth&#8217;s.</p>
<p>As a result, it has long been predicted that humans would  be able to lift off into the moon&#8217;s atmosphere if they were wearing wing-type devices on their arms.</p>
<p>But now, the students have shown that it would even be possible with a regular wingsuit used by skydivers here on Earth &#8211; provided you could get a fast enough run up.</p>
<p>To calculate the speed needed, the group factored in: the density of air at the surface of Titan; the acceleration due to gravity; an average wingsuit wing area (approximately 1.4 metres squared); and the ratio of the streamline path of the air above the aerofoil to that below the aerofoil.</p>
<p>They found that, for a normal-sized wingsuit, a run up speed of 11 metres per second would be required.</p>
<p>While not many people in the world can run at this speed, the fastest sprinters have been shown to reach top speeds above 11 metres per second.</p>
<p>Usain Bolt has clocked top speeds of 12.27 metres per second, meaning he would be able to take off as he got to the finish line of a 100-metre race.</p>
<p>The students also found it might even be possible for those of us who can&#8217;t reach Bolt-like velocities to spread our arms and fly &#8211; but it would be a lot less comfortable, and we would look a lot dafter.</p>
<p>The group found you would be able to take off with a more manageable running speed of 6 metres per second &#8211; as long as you were wearing a wingsuit with a surface area more than three times larger than a regular-sized.</p>
<p>This would be a lot more cumbersome, and the students were unsure whether it would even be feasible in practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had seen a lot of claims online that humans would be able to fly on Titan, but no one had given the physics behind it,&#8221; said student Hannah Lerman, 21, from Mill Hill, North London.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it would be interesting to try it with a wingsuit &#8211; something that you actually use on Earth. It is a really exciting idea that someone like Usain Bolt could actually fly unaided. It would give a whole new dimension to travelling,&#8221; Lerman said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000654&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">&#8220;In 2013, tablets became a mainstream phenomenon, with a vast choice of Android-based tablets being within the budget of mainstream consumers while still offering adequate specifications,&#8221; said Roberta Cozza, research director at Gartner. &#8220;As the Android tablet market becomes highly commoditized, in 2014, it will be critical for vendors to focus on device experience and meaningful technology and ecosystem value — beyond just hardware and cost — to ensure brand loyalty and improved margins.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2013, the share of Apple&#8217;s iOS dropped 16.8 percentage points as more people looked at smaller low-cost tablets in emerging markets. In emerging markets the growth was as high as 145 per cent, while mature markets grew 31 percent. &#8220;Apple&#8217;s tablets remain strong in the higher end of the market and, Apple&#8217;s approach will continue to force vendors to compete with full ecosystem offerings, even in the smaller-screen market as the iPad mini sees a greater share”, added Cozza.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Microsoft&#8217;s tablet volumes improved, but still at a low base. &#8220;To compete, Microsoft needs to create compelling ecosystem proposition for consumers and developers across all mobile devices, as tablets and smartphones become key devices for delivering applications and services to users beyond the PC,&#8221; said Cozza.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From a vendor perspective, Apple&#8217;s strong fourth quarter helped it maintain the top position with around 36% market share, compared to Samsung’s 19%. Samsung, however, recorded a 336 percent growth. Lenovo did particularly well in 2013 with tablet sales growing 198 percent, but is still number five with just over 3% market share.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000298&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2000243" alt="Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini A200 versus the Lava Iris Pro 30" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/combine-vs.jpg" /> Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini A200 versus the Lava Iris Pro 30
<p>The budget Android segment is becoming a bit too cluttered with all Indian manufacturers trying to plug all possible price points between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000. However, in this space it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a differentiator in the Android phones.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recently, two products caught our attention in this price range &#8212; the Lava Iris Pro 30 and Micromax&#8217;s Canvas Turbo Mini A200.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Lava Iris Pro 30 is the first of the company’s new premium range of smartphones and is priced at Rs 15,499. The Canvas Turbo Mini A200, on the other hand, is a stripped down version of Canvas Turbo priced at Rs 14,490.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here is a face off:</p>
<p><b></b><b> </b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In terms of design, the Lava Iris Pro 30 is undoubtedly better looking than the Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini A200. The Lava will remind you of the iPhone 4 and has a smooth, rubberised back panel and a metallic chrome rim frames the phone which has a rectangular monoblock design. Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini, like most other Android devices, has rounded corners and curved edges with a visible camera bump. This is a plain jane in comparison to the Iris Pro 30.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Common grounds</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The two phones have loads of similarities. For starters, both flaunt 4.7-inch 720p HD displays. The Iris Pro gets an added advantage of having IPS display constructed using Gorilla Glass technology coupled with one-glass solution technique. Both smartphones run Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, have 4 GB internal storage and 32 GB micro SD card slots. Both smartphones offer Bluetooth 4.0 and WiFi (802.11 b/g/n) for wireless connectivity. Better location services are promised with GPS chip. Lava Iris Pro 30 weighs about 114 grams while the Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini is a shade lighter at 111 grams. Very close in terms of weight, the difference can be negligible.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Spec to spec</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Both are powered by MediaTek processors. The Canvas Turbo Mini A200 has a quad-core 1.3 GHz MediaTek MT6582, while Iris Pro 30 is powered by a 1.2 GHz MediaTek MT6589 mobile processor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Lava Iris Pro 30 has an 8 megapixel backside illumination image sensor that can record full HD videos at 30 frames per second. The Canvas Turbo Mini A200 also comes with an 8 megapixel auto focus camera with HD videos at 30 frames per second. Both have LED flashes. The Iris Pro 30 has a 3 megapixel camera in the front, while the Canvas Turbo Mini A200 puts a 5 megapixel wide angle camera in the front.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both are dual SIM phones, with Micromax option for normal SIMs and Laval favouring a mix of micro and normal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Iris Pro 30 packs in a slightly better battery at 2000 mAh battery, while the Canvas Turbo Mini has a 1800 mAh cell. This could give the former about an hour more of juice when needed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both come pre-loaded with a bunch of apps and even have a some curated lists.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>
<p>The Lava Iris Pro 30 is ahead of the Canvas Turbo Mini A200 in design, camera and battery, but the latter has an advantage in terms of the processor and, of course, the cheaper price tag. Now, it is your pick.</p>

		<title>From Indian minds comes Jarvis, an intelligent OS inspired by Iron Man</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1999840" alt="At the core of Jarvis is artificial intelligence, which the duo think can be included in the system as a component. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jarvis.jpg" /> At the core of Jarvis is artificial intelligence, which the duo think can be included in the system as a component.
<p>Personal technology has always been inspired by fiction. For instance, the world got its first glimpse of the mobile phone in the popular TV series Star Trek. Now, taking a cue from Iron Man, two young Indian technologists want to play Tony Stark and ask their computer to do stuff for them. To make things easy, their intelligent assistant is also called Jarvis after Stark’s virtual butler.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1999843" alt="jarvis2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jarvis2.jpg?w=600" /> Chirag Dewan and Himanshu Vaishnav explaining the concept
<p>Delhi-based Chirag Dewan and Jaipur’s Himanshu Vaishnav, both computer science students in their early twenties, think their idea of artificial intelligence can change computing for ever. While start-ups the world over are working on solutions that make input methods for computing more natural, Jarvis Corp is working on an entire operating system that is fully automated and learns as it goes. Of course, it will interact with the user with the help of voice and gestures along with traditional input methods.</p>
<p>“From the origin of operating systems, everyone has been following the same thing. All of them have the same internal structure with a similar skin and flesh. With each new version of an operating system we are just seeing a new set of features being added to this legacy,” says Dewan, on a Skype call from the US. He says Jarvis is a totally redesigned OS. “We are not changing the paradigm, but we will change user experience for sure.”</p>
<p>At the core of Jarvis is artificial intelligence, which the duo think can be included in the system as a component. “So, the next time it performs even better. With the inclusion of unconventional inputs as the standard, you will communicate with the system as if it is an individual,” adds Vaishnav.</p>
<p>Now you know that it is called Jarvis. But if you thought this would be an ideal solution for a mobile operating system, where users are already using voice and gestures for input, you are mistaken. Jarvis Corp, strangely does not want to tackle what for everyone is the fastest growing computing segment. They want to start with the traditional desktops and maybe other connected devices and home automation. But not smartphones. That would be too easy.</p>
<p>“We are a start-up and would like to see how it works before scaling up,” adds Dewan, who is the CFO of the company which now has 10 people working on the project in multiple countries. The two, who met on the Internet due to their shared passion for artificial intelligence, scouted for like-minded talent by launching a website seeking applications. They got 3,000 bios, of which they have roped in eight so far.</p>
<p>But don’t expect Jarvis to be running your computer, or your lives, in the near future. The company has set a deadline of 18 months from the time they get the first level of funding to come out with the first version. During this period they plan to make the SDK available to developers so that they can make applications to run on the new OS.</p>
<p>Where you will run Jarvis seems to be the question that might illicit no answers soon. The company wants to create its own hardware for the OS. It could be a smartwatch or a desktop, but that is not going to be an easy task, especially since the two at the top are adamant on doing everything on their own. “We are not that keen to talk to the big players. We are not doing what they are doing, they are working on methods,” says Vaishnav, the CTO.</p>
<p>They also have no idea of starting with apps or programmes for people to see what they are up to. “If we come up in parts, it defeats the purpose of what we are trying to do. Our main objective is to give the user a companion so that he does not think he is using a machine,” explains Vaishnav.</p>
<p>The company declined a $2 million angel investment. “Samsung approached us to make a mobile version first, but we declined that too as we didn’t want to lose focus on what we are planning to do. I know it sounds stupid that a startup is declining offers, but we would like to choose partners carefully,” says Dewan. They duo are meeting other investors and VCs too. But it remains to be seen if any of the investors will impress them.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999838&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1999796" alt="WebOS is very intuitive and easy to use" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/webos-tv.jpg" /> WebOS is very intuitive and easy to use
<p>I have tried most of the smart televisions available in the market. I have also tried some external hardware that can make televisions smart. However, very few people actually use the smart features on a regular basis, mostly because it is not that easy to shift from live TV to the smart features.</p>
<p>However, LG hopes to change that with its new WebOS for televisions. This new software is different from the earlier UIs used by LG as well as other television manufacturers and it far more intuitive and easy to use. In fact, it is as easy as swiping from one feature to the other.</p>
<p>The unique Launcher &#8212; a left-to-right scrollable menu that runs across the lower portion of the screen &#8212; makes it possible to switch between broadcast TV, VoD movies, games, apps, media files stored on connected devices without returning to the ‘home’ screen. The Launcher is accessible from any screen, without interrupting their current content selection.</p>
<p>Rishi Tandan, LG India&#8217;s marketing head for home entertainment, said the feature could make people actually use the smart features of their televisions.</p>
<p>Speaking at the LG Tech Show 2014, he said the company&#8217;s be launch for this year will be the 4k curved OLED TV, the first time OLED was being used for ultra high defenition content. The company showcased its award winning 77-inch model from CES at the show.</p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1999795" alt="LG's 77-inch 4k curved OLED TV" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lg-77-inch-4k-ultra-hd-oled-tv.jpg" /> LG&#8217;s 77-inch 4k curved OLED TV
<p>Tandan said the company will offer 4K models that are at par in pricing with the cheapest models in the market. &#8220;But it won&#8217;t take long for customers to realise that they can buy a better model from HT for a small premium. That wouldn&#8217;t matter as they are anyway spending so much on the television.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most affordable 4K televisions are priced around Rs 3,00,000.</p>
<p>LG&#8217;s Ultra HD TV range of TVs deliver 8.3 million pixels per frameand come with an ULTRA HD Engine that up scales any video format into 4k quality. LG Ultra HD lineup is available in 49, 55, 65 and 84 inches.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999791&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1983005" alt="appleiphone5c" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/appleiphone5c.jpg" /> CarPlay will work with the new series of iPhones
<p>It is time for CarPlay after AirPlay. Apple has announced that leading auto manufacturers are rolling out its &#8220;smarter, safer and more fun way&#8221; to use iPhone in the car.</p>
<p>A company release said CarPlay gives iPhone users an intuitive way to make calls, use Maps, listen to music and access messages with just a word or a touch. &#8220;Users can easily control CarPlay from the car’s native interface or just push-and-hold the voice control button on the steering wheel to activate Siri without distraction,&#8221; is said.</p>
<p>The feature will first appear in vehicles from Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo this week, while Group, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai Motor Company, Jaguar Land Rover, Kia Motors, Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan Motor Company, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Subaru, Suzuki and Toyota Motor Corp are line for adoption soon.</p>
<p>“CarPlay has been designed from the ground up to provide drivers with an incredible experience using their iPhone in the car,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of iPhone and iOS Product Marketing.</p>
<p><strong>This is how it will work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once iPhone is connected to a vehicle with CarPlay integration, Siri helps you easily access your contacts, make calls, return missed calls or listen to voicemails.</li>
<li>When incoming messages or notifications arrive, Siri provides an eyes-free experience by responding to requests through voice commands, by reading drivers’ messages and letting them dictate responses or simply make a call.</li>
<li>CarPlay makes driving directions more intuitive by working with Maps to anticipate destinations based on recent trips via contacts, emails or texts, and provides routing instructions, traffic conditions and ETA.</li>
<li>You can also simply ask Siri and receive spoken turn-by-turn directions, along with Maps, which will appear on your car’s built-in display.<br />
CarPlay gives drivers access to all of their music, podcasts and audiobooks with easy navigation through listening choices from the car’s built-in controls or simply by asking Siri to pull up what you’d like to hear.</li>
<li>CarPlay also supports select third-party audio apps including Spotify and iHeartRadio, so you can listen to your favourite radio services or sports broadcast apps while driving.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers, including those of Indian-origin, have proposed a variety of innovative methods that can add a strong second layer of security to your password, protecting it from hackers.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, along with the University of California at Irvine, offered new options to increase password security against hacking.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been many attacks on servers that store passwords lately, such as the breaches at PayPal and LinkedIn,&#8221; said Nitesh Saxena, associate professor in the Department of Computer and Information Sciences at UAB.</p>
<p>Many people use the same few uncomplicated passwords repeatedly, making them easy to remember. Passwords are typically stored on servers in a hashed form.</p>
<p>Hackers can garner passwords either by an online brute-force attack, or by hacking a server with poor security and using a &#8216;dictionary&#8217; of passwords to test offline.</p>
<p>Two-factor authentication schemes, such as Google Authenticator, or hardware tokens, such as RSA SecureID, use a second device to generate a temporary personal identification number, or PIN, that the user must enter along with their password.</p>
<p>But current two-factor schemes present the same vulnerabilities to server hacks as password-only authentication, Saxena said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If someone hacks into the server, they could learn the passwords via an offline dictionary attack,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Learning the passwords wouldn&#8217;t compromise the second authentication factor, but the user might be using that same password elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hacker might not be able to log into Facebook if Facebook uses two-factor authentication, but they could log into Twitter if Twitter uses the single-factor authentication using the same password,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Researchers proposed and tested four two-factor schemes that require servers to store a randomised hash of the passwords and a second device, such as the user&#8217;s security token or smartphone, to store a corresponding secret code.</p>
<p>They present these schemes at several levels of computer system bandwidth, effectively turning four schemes into 13 security options.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than requiring the user to enter both their password and a PIN generated by an app, the user could enter a password, and their smartphone could automatically send a PIN over a Bluetooth connection or through a simple QR code,&#8221; Saxena said.</p>
<p>Saxena and his co-authors, UAB graduate student Maliheh Shirvanian, Stanislaw Jarecki and Naveen Nathan of the University of California at Irvine, have analysed each scheme in terms of security provided, usability and deployability.</p>
<p>&#8220;With each of our proposals, you get a high level of security with the same or better level of usability than the current two-factor authentication schemes,&#8221; researchers said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997746&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-medium wp-image-1993610" alt="MWC (8)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mwc-8.jpg?w=600" /> The home screen resembles the one on Nokia&#8217;s Windows-based Lumia phones, even though it&#8217;s Android underneath
<p>By design, Nokia&#8217;s new Android smartphones will underwhelm users of high-end phones. The Nokia X line was created with emerging markets in mind, so the company emphasized keeping prices low, meaning the user interface is relatively simple.</p>
<p>The home screen resembles the one on Nokia&#8217;s Windows-based Lumia phones, even though it&#8217;s Android underneath. But Nokia Corp. added a Fastlane feature, a screen with quick access to your most-used apps. You get to it by swiping from the left or right edge of the home screen or tapping the back button at the bottom.</p>
<p>The basic Nokia X phone costs 89 euros ($122) and has a 4-inch screen, measured diagonally, and a 3 megapixel camera. A X+ version with an SD storage card costs 99 euros, while an XL with a 5-inch screen and 5 megapixel camera goes for 109 euros.</p>
<p>In the brief time I&#8217;ve had with the Nokia X at this week&#8217;s Mobile World Congress wireless show in Barcelona, Spain, I have found the Fastlane feature to be a good start. It&#8217;s something I would like to see on more phones, including Nokia&#8217;s Windows devices.</p>
<p>I hate to spend time customizing gadgets, getting the icons for the most-used apps on the main home screen. The nice thing about Fastlane is that you don&#8217;t have to spend any time on that. Your favorite apps are just one swipe away — sort of.</p>
<p>The top of Fastlane shows you what&#8217;s coming up, whether that&#8217;s alarms about to ring or future events in your calendar. Below that are your recently used apps. The ones you just used will be at the top, so you don&#8217;t have to scroll down.</p>
<p>For some apps, you get information that normally comes with notifications, such as previews of text messages or alerts that three people have tried to reach you on WeChat, a Chinese social network. You see small versions of recent photos and can tap for the larger version in the photo gallery app. You see calls you missed, songs you heard and websites you visited.</p>
<p>It could get overwhelming, so you can block certain apps and certain notifications from appearing in Fastlane. In the settings, you can also add a shortcut to one social network, such as Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where Fastlane can improve — understanding better which apps I use most over a period of days or months and creating a section at the top for those.</p>
<p>This week, for example, I was too busy to check Facebook, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t use it regularly. But in Fastlane, Facebook would drop toward the bottom in a matter of days, unless I happen to choose it as my one shortcut.</p>
<p>Why not make sure the most-used apps are stored as favorites at the top of the screen? Nokia says it&#8217;s considering that.</p>
<p>Likewise, if I haven&#8217;t used something for months after using it daily, Fastlane can assume I&#8217;ve grown tired of it and automatically remove it. Myspace anyone?</p>
<p>Nokia doesn&#8217;t plan to make Fastlane for its Windows phones, and I doubt it&#8217;ll extend it to rival Android phones, such as my Samsung Galaxy S III. It&#8217;s something it wants to keep exclusive to its own phones to compete.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s understandable, yet a shame.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997542&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

But here is some detail. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997042&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1997049" alt="Motorola Moto G 8GB is priced at Rs. 12,999 and the 16GB at Rs. 13,999" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/moto-g-480.jpg" /> Motorola Moto G 8GB is priced at Rs. 12,999 and the 16GB at Rs. 13,999
<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard about the Moto G already. Motorola&#8217;s comeback phone has got rave reviews as the best budget handset. There are <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/moto-g-5-negative-things-to-know/" target="_blank"><strong>five negative points</strong> </a>you should know before buying the Moto G, but despite those, is it still value for your money?</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 4.5-inch display (1280&#215;720 pixels, 329 ppi) | 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor | 1GB RAM | 8GB/16GB storage + no microSD slot | 5MP rear camera, 1.3MP front camera, 720p HD video | 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 | GPS with A-GPS | 2070mAh battery | Android 4.4 KitKat<br />
<strong>Price: 8GB &#8211; Rs. 12,999 | 16GB &#8211; Rs. 13,999</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1997047" alt="Moto G_Black_Front_NA" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/moto-g_black_front_na.png?w=318&#038;h=600"   /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> There is a sturdiness and simplicity to the Moto G that is lacking in most handsets: no logos on the front, rounded edges, a rubber-finish matte back that won&#8217;t attract fingerprints, and a straight line in the middle for the camera, flash, logo and headphone port. The phone also has water-repellant coating, but don&#8217;t read too much into that—the ports are open, so it&#8217;s not like you can use it in the rain. Drops don&#8217;t affect the phone either. For most people, it&#8217;s comfortable to hold it in one hand and use. But what bothers me are the large bezels. It&#8217;s got a smaller screen than most phones at this price, but Motorola still insists on using virtual touchscreen buttons taking up valuable screen space while having a 1.5cm bezel under it that&#8217;s just wasted space.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1997045" alt="Moto G_Black_Left_Side" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/moto-g_black_left_side.png?w=480&#038;h=45" width="480" height="45" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Screen:</strong> The bezel and virtual buttons mean that you aren&#8217;t getting the full 4.5 inches of promised screen space. That said, the screen is sharp and reproduces true colours. It has Gorilla Glass 3 scratch protection, and while it&#8217;s not clearly legible in direct sunlight, it&#8217;s not bad either.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> The Moto G can go toe-to-toe with any other smartphone in this price range. Most of its competitors use the Mediatek MT6589 quad-core processor, so we ran our usual performance tests on phones with that processor and the Moto G. In all tests, the Moto G was on par or better. The only place it struggles is with high-end gaming—you&#8217;ll need to play games like <em>FIFA 14</em> and <em>Call Of Duty: Strike Team</em> on Medium settings here, not High.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-1996670" alt="Moto G can be yours for Rs 12,499 " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/moto-g-front-480.png?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></p>
<p><strong>Memory:</strong> The Moto G is available in either 8GB or 16GB capacities. If you aren&#8217;t a gamer, this is going to be sufficient for most users—even with a few casual games. But as a gamer, the space will prove too little in a short time as many HD games are clocking in disk space requirements of 1.2-1.5GB now.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> In terms of antenna performance, the Moto G is undoubtedly among the better smartphones you can buy right now. I usually test for dropped calls while in transit and a few spots where I know reception is weak—the Moto G performed as well as or better than any phone out there.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> One of the major features of the Moto G is that it comes with the latest flavour of Android, v4.4 KitKat, without any customisations. If updates are important to you, the Moto G is great. But for most average users, this shouldn&#8217;t be a big factor in deciding your smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong> Like most budget handsets, the camera is the biggest problem on the Moto G. While outdoors in the sun or in a very well-lit room, you&#8217;ll be all right and get good photos—the detailing is good and the colours are true. However, in low light, the Moto G gives up. It doesn&#8217;t match up to some of its peers like the Wickedleak Wammy Passion Z+. Images are noisy, out of focus (and it takes a really long time to focus in the first place) and lack the detail you get in bright environments. It&#8217;s the same with videos: in bright light, you&#8217;re fine, and as soon as lighting is an issue, the Moto G camera is worthless.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> The 2070mAh battery of the Moto G is brilliant. On an day of high usage (including gaming, social networking, calling, photography, music playback and video playback), the phone lasted for 16 hours before needing to be recharged. It can continuously play video for a little over four hours. But do note that while you can remove the back panel, the battery isn&#8217;t removable—if you&#8217;re a power user who needs to swap out batteries, this isn&#8217;t the phone for you.</p>
<p><strong>Special Mention:</strong> For all the savings offered by the Moto G, you need to know that the box it comes with is bare-bones. There&#8217;s only a charger, but that doesn&#8217;t even double up as a USB cable to connect your phone to your PC. So you will have to buy a separate USB cable and a pair of headphones. The Moto G is available from Flipkart, so adding the cost of a USB cable (Rs. 140) and a decent pair of in-ear headphones (Rs. 400), that&#8217;s an additional Rs. 540 to add to the price tag.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> For most average users, the Moto G is a practical purchase. It&#8217;s got a fantastic screen, good build quality, strong battery life and is easy to use for most things. I wouldn&#8217;t advise the 8GB version, it makes more sense to spend an extra Rs. 1,500 and buy the 16GB model for Rs. 13,999—that&#8217;s excluding the cost of a data cable and headphones.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to be gaming, steer away from the Moto G—the performance is as good as any other in this range but the limited memory is a problem. Plus, a bigger screen is more fun in those cases. And yeah, if you talk on the phone a lot and need to swap out batteries, the Moto G is again not for you. Also, don&#8217;t go by the brand name—Motorola&#8217;s after-sales service has plenty of critics. In my books, the Micromax Canvas 4 (available for around Rs. 13,000) is a better purchase for such users. Plus, you won&#8217;t have to spend any extra for a data cable and headphones.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1996949" alt="GOQii band will cost Rs 5,999 for six months" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/goqiiband.jpg" /> GOQii band will cost Rs 5,999 for six months
<p>The craze for the quantified self is finally coming to India. Yes, there are thousands of people who already use Nike Fuels and Fitbits. Then there are those who are planning to buy the new Samsung Fit to go with their new Samsung Galaxy S5. But why not look at a device that is very Indian at heart and in origin.</p>
<p>GOQii is a fitness band, but it also coming with a personalised coach, something none of the other fitness devices have been able to integrate so far. So along with the band, which tracks your daily activities and calories burned, there are experts who try and make sense of this data and coaches who help you make “sustainable and incremental changes towards a more healthy and active lifestyle”. To aid the band in connecting with the experts and the coaches there will be a GOQii app.</p>
<p>An integral part of the whole GOQii idea are Karma points which you earn by meeting your daily goals. The points can be used to donate to good causes and GOQii has already tied up with Oxfam India as its Karma partner.</p>
<p>The venture is backed by some very familiar names. For instance, Vishal Gondal, who founded Indiagames, is the founder and CEO of GOQii, which is headquartered in California with offices in Mumbai and Shenzhen.</p>
<p>A self confessed fitness freak, Vishal says he tried out every fitness band out there to keep fit, but it was a physical coach that actually started making an impact on his health. That could explain why GOQii is a mix of a gadget along with handholding from the coach via the app and pre-scheduled monthly video/audio calls. He got people from diverse backgrounds to collaborate on the project. So you have well known names like Amit Singhal of Google, Anil Godhwani of Habitera and Kanwaljit Bombra of Dell who have backed the project along with veteran actor Madhuri Dixit-Nene and her husband Dr Shriram Nene.</p>
<p>“There is no right and wrong with GOQii. It is about removing certain negatives and adding some positives to your life,” explains Gondal in a YouTube video. And there is also a serious element of gamification to the entire exercise. That was expected, with Gondal being part of the show. “The GOQii is centred aroun the coach and the band is a just a tool for data collection,” he explains how it is different from the other bands. The band itself is an advanced fitness tracker with a full touch display and a ultra-lightweight water resistant construction. It syncs wirelessly with a smartphones using Bluetooth LE and includes a watch, a motion sensor which can track steps, calories, distance and active time.</p>
<p>But, yes, you have pay for the coach too. So a six month plan, including the band and the coach, will cost Rs 5,999, while a 12-month plan will set you back by Rs 9,999. The band will be available from this April.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996944&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed a new battery that consumes sugar to generate electricity enough to power a smartphone for 10 days after a single charge.</p>
<p>The bio-battery designed by researchers at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University has a greater output per weight than the typical lithium-ion batteries used in most electronics.</p>
<p>The prototype version has the potential to be lighter and more powerful than the batteries typically found in today&#8217;s portable electronic devices, including smartphones.</p>
<p>In the body, sugar is converted into energy in a process called metabolism, which decomposes sugar into carbon dioxide and water while releasing electrons.</p>
<p>Bio-batteries produce energy though the same conversion process by capturing the electrons that are generated in the decomposition of sugar with the same tools that the body uses.</p>
<p>As bio-batteries use materials that are biologically based, they are renewable and non-toxic, making them an attractive alternative to traditional batteries that need metals and chemicals to operate.</p>
<p>&#8220;By using the lithium-ion battery, for example, your phone can only last for one day, but in the future it will use sugar as the fuel then the phone could last 10 days,&#8221; said Zhiguang Zhu, a researcher at Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>The new bio-battery gets its efficiency by using a novel system of enzymes, which are proteins that help the reaction to take place, Inside Science News Service (ISNS) reported.</p>
<p>The system uses two active enzymes that liberate two pairs of electrons from the sugar, while 10 other enzymes help to reset the reaction inside the bio-battery.</p>
<p>Once the reaction is reset, the active enzymes release another quartet of electrons.</p>
<p>After six cycles, the bio-battery extracts all of the energy bound in the sugar molecule, along with carbon dioxide and water.</p>
<p>The research was published in the journal Nature Communications.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996878&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1994540" alt="Moto X is priced $299 onwards" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/moto-x-ebony.jpg" /> Moto X is priced $299 onwards
<p>A few years back, Motorola was one of the most visible, and popular, phone brands in India. But in 2012, Motorola Mobility pulled out of this market, even though it was still selling phones here.</p>
<p>Things changed earlier this month when the company, now owned by Google,  tied up e-commerce giant Flipkart to launch its budget smartphone Moto G in India. With a very competitive price of Rs 12,499, the phone was an instant hit in the country and was sold out within days.</p>
<p>MUST-READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/moto-g-5-negative-things-to-know/" target="_blank"><strong>Moto G: 5 negative things to know before you commit yourself</strong></a></p>
<p>That success seems to have spurred Motorola to bring its <a href="http://www.motorola.com/us/FLEXR1-1/moto-x-specifications.html" target="_blank">Moto X </a>to the market. In a twitter conversation as part of the Mobile World Congress, the company confirmed that Moto X is headed for India and Australia in the coming weeks.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Q: When will see Moto X in Aisa A: In next few weeks Moto X will launch in India and Australia <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MotoMWC&amp;src=hash">#MotoMWC</a></p>
<p>— Motorola Mobility (@Motorola) <a href="https://twitter.com/Motorola/statuses/438401118687604736">February 25, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The Moto X is priced at $299 and is highly customisable as far as design is concerned. A new version of the phone is expected this summer.</p>
<p>Significantly, with Lenovo now buying the company from Google, you might get to see a lot more of the familiar M logo on devices. In fact, Lenovo has been slowly, but surely, shifting focus to smartphones over the last couple of quarters and having a strong mobility player like Motorola in its kitty will be a big boost for their plans.</p>
<p>Yes, Motorola truly seems to be on the way back to India.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994532&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/and4800.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1990793 " alt="Android Customisation" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/and4800.jpg" /></a> The suspicious activity has been noticed in two Android versions &#8212; 4.3 known as &#8216;Jelly Bean&#8217; and the latest version 4.4 called &#8216;Kit Kat&#8217;.
<p>A &#8220;critical flaw&#8221; has been detected in the virtual private network offered by Android operating systems in the Indian cyberspace leading to &#8220;hijack&#8221; of personal data of users.</p>
<p>Internet security sleuths have alerted consumers of this web-based service to guard against the spread of this virus which affects computer systems and mobile phones using the Android system.</p>
<p>The suspicious activity has been noticed in two Android versions &#8212; 4.3 known as &#8216;Jelly Bean&#8217; and the latest version 4.4 called &#8216;Kit Kat&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;A critical flaw has been reported in Android&#8217;s (virtual private network) VPN implementation, affecting Android version 4.3 and 4.4 which could allow an attacker to bypass active VPN configuration to redirect secure VPN communications to a third party server or disclose or hijack unencrypted communications,&#8221; the Computer Emergency Response Team of India (CERT-In) said in a latest advisory to users of this network.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/cert-in-google-chrome-mozilla-firefox-virus/"><strong>CERT-IN warns of vulnerabilities in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox</strong></a></p>
<p>The CERT-In is the nodal agency to combat hacking, phishing and to fortify security-related defences of the Indian Internet domain.</p>
<p>VPN technology is used to create an encrypted tunnel into a private network over public Internet. Organisations and group of people use such connections to enable employees or acquaintances to securely connect to enterprise networks from remote locations through multiple kinds of devices like laptops, desktops, mobiles and tablets.</p>
<p>The agency said the current malicious application is capable of diverting the VPN traffic &#8220;to a different network address&#8221; and successful exploitation of this issue &#8220;could allow attackers to capture entire communication originating from affected device.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lethality of the virus to disrupt a system is large.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is noted that not all applications are encrypting their network communication. Still there is a possibility that attacker could possibly capture sensitive information from the affected device in plain text like email addresses, IMEI number, SMSes, installed applications,&#8221; the advisory said.</p>
<p>Cyber experts said that this anomaly could only lead to capture and viewing the data which is in plain text and Android applications directly connecting to the server using SSL will not be affected.</p>
<p>Websites which use &#8216;https&#8217; in their URL will also be safe.</p>
<p>The cyber agency has also suggested some countermeasures to beat this threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apply appropriate updates from original equipment manufacturer, do not download and install application from untrusted sources, maintain updated mobile security solution or mobile anti-virus solutions on the device, exercise caution while visiting trusted or untrusted URLs and do not click on the URLs received via SMS or email unexpectedly from trusted or received from untrusted users&#8221; are some of the combat techniques which have been suggested by the agency.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996713&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1996670" alt="Moto G can be yours for Rs 12,499 " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/moto-g-front-480.png" /> Moto G can be yours for Rs 12,499
<p>Motorola&#8217;s Moto G is arguably the best budget smartphone you can buy right now, but it is not without its shortcomings. It&#8217;s easy to go ga-ga over a handset that offers so much for so low a price, but there are certain things you should know about it before you plonk down your hard-earned money.</p>
<p><strong>1) There&#8217;s no USB cable and no headphones, so you&#8217;ll have to buy your own </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite disappointing that these two basic amenities aren&#8217;t packaged with the Moto G when devices at less than half its price ship with them. That&#8217;s going to be an added cost to you, so don&#8217;t forget to factor it in. For a basic cable and in-ear headphones, you&#8217;ll have to spend an extra Rs 550—and more if you want quality materials. By comparison, the Micromax Canvas 4 ships with flat tangle-free cables while several other manufacturers like Wickedleak and iBall throw in an additional battery to swap.</p>
<p><strong>2) The battery cannot be removed or swapped for a different one</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of swappable batteries, while the 2070mAh battery of the Moto G is going to be enough for most users, power users will want more. But if you absolutely must have a smartphone with a removable battery that you can swap out when the need arises, then the Moto G isn&#8217;t for you.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996668" alt="Moto G Black Back" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/moto-g-black-back.jpg?w=480&#038;h=377" width="480" height="377" /></p>
<p><strong>3) There is no microSD card slot for additional memory</strong></p>
<p>The lack of a microSD memory card slot can be a major drawback and even a deal-breaker for many. If you like to store a lot of music and movies on your phone, the Moto G&#8217;s 8GB or 16GB of internal memory is going to be too little. Plus, just three HD games—<em>FIFA 14, Asphalt 8</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Strike Team</em>—take up 5GB of space now, so what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>4) The camera is a major letdown</strong></p>
<p>The Moto G has a 5-megapixel snapper on the back which is only good for photographs to be taken in bright daylight. There are a number of issues which we touch upon in our quick-read review of the Moto G, but its shoddy low-light performance means that anyone who likes shooting photos indoors, at parties or at nights will not be happy with the results of this. You should not get rid of that point-and-shoot camera.</p>
<p><strong>5) After-sales service</strong></p>
<p>One of the main reasons to consider a reputable company like Samsung over local manufacturers is the superior after-sales service that international firms typically offer. But that&#8217;s not the case with Motorola. The metros are well served, but move outside those, and you&#8217;ll find only one or maybe two service centers for cities and states the size of Chattisgarh, Pune, Goa, Mangalore, Chandigarh, etc.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, does it make sense to buy the Motorola Moto G?<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/motorola-moto-g-quick-read-review/" target="_blank"><strong> Read the Motorola Moto G quick-read review</strong> </a></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996667&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP photo)
<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook is still trying to convince shareholders that the iPhone maker remains a step ahead in the race to innovate, even though recent performance of the company&#8217;s stock lags behind other technology trendsetters.</p>
<p>In making his case Friday, Cook struck a familiar refrain during Apple&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting at the company&#8217;s Cupertino, California headquarters.</p>
<p>Cook promised that Apple Inc. is working on new gadgets that will expand the company&#8217;s product line-up beyond smartphones, tablets, music players and personal computers without divulging any details. He cited the company&#8217;s nearly $4.5 billion investment in research and development during the last fiscal year and the completion of 23 acquisitions in the past 16 months as a precursor of the big things to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a ton of stuff going on,&#8221; Cook said.</p>
<p>On the financial side, Cook told shareholders that Apple&#8217;s board will announce whether the company will increase its dividend and spend more money buying back its own stock by the end of April. Money management is a major issue for Apple because the company is sitting on nearly $159 billion in cash, including $124 billion held in overseas accounts to avoid U.S. taxes.</p>
<p>On the labor front, Cook pledged to continue Apple&#8217;s fight for the rights of the low-paid workers who build the company&#8217;s devices in overseas factories. The workplaces are frequently depicted as oppressive sweatshops.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there is any CEO who talks about human rights more than I do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I get a lot of spears for it, but I don&#8217;t give a crap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cook, who became Apple&#8217;s CEO shortly before the October 2011 death of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, also showed a playful side. He tantalized the crowd by telling them he planned to provide a glimpse at Apple&#8217;s upcoming products, but it turned out to be a tease. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to have some fun,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The meeting looked like it would be a tense affair until earlier this month when activist investor Carl Icahn abandoned a high-profile campaign aimed at pressuring Apple&#8217;s board to increase the company&#8217;s $60 billion budget for buying back its stock. The company has already spent more than $40 billion of that amount.</p>
<p>Most shareholders at Friday&#8217;s meeting seemed supportive of Cook, although a couple expressed frustration with Apple&#8217;s stock price when he took seven questions from the audience.</p>
<p>Investors are worried about the company&#8217;s shrinking market share in the smartphone market as its rivals introduce a wider selection of devices offering lower prices and larger screen sizes. Wall Street is also wondering if Apple lost some of its inventiveness with the death of the visionary Jobs.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s stock dipped $1.43 to close Friday at $526.24. That&#8217;s 25 percent below its peak price of $705.07 reached September 2012. Over the same stretch, the stock of Google Inc. — a bitter rival — has surged by 66 percent and the technology-driven Nasdaq composite index has gained 35 percent.</p>
<p>Cook told shareholders he isn&#8217;t worried, noting that Apple&#8217;s stock has struggled over other stretches in the past 15 years, only to soar after the company released breakthroughs such as the iPod, iPhone and iPad. The stock might fare better if Apple revealed more about its future plans, Cook conceded, but he said the company intends to hew to Jobs&#8217; hush-hush philosophy to build consumer anticipation and prevent rivals from getting an early start on copying its ideas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think the element of surprise is important,&#8221; Cook said.</p>
<p>Analysts are convinced the next iPhone will feature a larger screen than the four-inch display that was introduced in 2012. Other smartphones boast five-inch (12.5-centimeter) and even six-inch (15-centimeter) screens that appeal to people who play a lot of games or watch a lot of video. Speculation on new product categories that Apple might enter includes a high-tech watch that could monitor the user&#8217;s health and a long-rumored television set that would run on the same software as the iPhone.</p>
<p>Although he didn&#8217;t discuss a potential TV set Friday, Cook revealed a new statistic indicating the company&#8217;s $99 set-top box for streaming Internet video is becoming increasingly popular. He said the box, called Apple TV, generated more than $1 billion in revenue during Apple&#8217;s last fiscal year. That figure implies Apple sold more than 10 million of the boxes last year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996413&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class=" wp-image-1993623" alt="MWC (27)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mwc-27.jpg?w=600" /> Firefox OS
<p>When it comes to smartphones, consumers have an array of choices from Apple to&#8230; well, Android.</p>
<p>The impression you get stepping into most phone carriers&#8217; showrooms is that the programmers behind Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android are driving most of the innovation in smartphones. You&#8217;ll find few phones on display that run other software systems.</p>
<p>Research firm Gartner says 94 percent of smartphones sales last year were either iPhones or Android devices. Windows Phone and BlackBerry devices made up another 5 percent combined.</p>
<p>But what about the remaining 1 percent? They are the wannabes such as Firefox and Sailfish —and many of them are introducing innovative advancements in features and functions.</p>
<p>I had a chance to try out some of these little-known systems at the Mobile World Congress wireless show in Barcelona, Spain, this week. Many of these systems aren&#8217;t even available in the U.S., where I live. Although I don&#8217;t see myself replacing my Samsung Android phone even if I could, some of these alternative phones have features I envy.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996286" alt="alcatel-onetouchfire" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alcatel-onetouchfire.png?w=200&#038;h=366" width="200" height="366" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Firefox OS, from Mozilla</strong></p>
<p>Firefox is better known for its Web browser. Now, the people behind it are trying to adapt it to run smartphones targeted at emerging markets. Firefox OS launched last summer with three phones, priced around $50 to $70. They are in available in 15 countries, but not in the U.S.</p>
<p>At the Barcelona show, Mozilla unveiled plans to expand to additional markets in Latin America and eastern Europe, while ZTE announced two new models. Chipmaker Spreadtrum Communications Inc. also announced a blueprint for any phone maker to make $25 smartphones.</p>
<p>The home screen and icons resemble what&#8217;s found on iPhones and Android.</p>
<p>Where Firefox OS starts to differ is in apps. With iPhones and Android, you go to an app store to get new apps. With Firefox OS, you typically have instant access to all apps, the same way you can visit a website for the first time without installing anything.</p>
<p>The catch is you need an Internet connection to use apps that aren&#8217;t on your phone, but many apps need that access anyway to refresh news, social networks or restaurant guides.</p>
<p>Firefox OS also has a universal search for all content on the phone and online.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another neat feature coming to Firefox OS. Swipe from the left side of the screen to flip through recent apps one by one, just like hitting the back button on a Web browser.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996287" alt="Device_icon" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/device_icon.png?w=386&#038;h=500" width="386" height="500" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sailfish OS, from Jolla</strong></p>
<p>Sailfish is based on the Linux operating system and comes from the Finnish company Jolla (pronounced &#8220;yolla&#8221;). Former Nokia employees created Jolla after that struggling cellphone maker abandoned an in-house operating system in favor of Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one phone out so far, and it&#8217;s sold only in Europe for 399 euros ($546). But Jolla has ambitions to reach Russia and Asia and to partner with other phone makers.</p>
<p>Jolla Ltd. also announced last week that it will release a free app that Android users can install to replace the regular Android interface with Sailfish&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I can see getting the hang of Sailfish over time. It emphasizes gestures over tapping. Access many functions by swiping from an edge on the screen.</p>
<p>The home screen has nine large rectangles, similar to an elongated tic-tac-toe board. These are filled with up to nine of your open apps, so you can instantly get to any one.</p>
<p>You can tap to open an app, but what&#8217;s neat is you can reach a task directly by pressing gently on the rectangle and dragging your finger. For the mail app, drag from the left to create a new message, or drag from the right to refresh messages. For the phone app, drag from the left to get the dialer, or drag from the right to get your list of contacts. This saves time once you get used to the gestures.</p>
<p>To close an app, you can swipe down from the top edge like a window shade. If you&#8217;re already on the home screen, swipe down to lock the phone. Swipe from the left or the right edge within an app to get the home screen. Do that from the home screen to change background, ring tones and other settings. Or if you replace your phone&#8217;s back cover with a promotional cover, you get special content, such as social media feeds on &#8220;Angry Birds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple introduced similar gesture controls with its iOS 7 update last fall, but Sailfish goes much further.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t many apps written for Sailfish yet, but Sailfish phones have a special tool for running most Android apps. You won&#8217;t get some of the gesture functions, though.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996288" alt="phone-naturally-neat" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/phone-naturally-neat.jpg?w=480&#038;h=195" width="480" height="195" /><br /><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ubuntu, from Canonical</strong></p>
<p>Like Sailfish, Ubuntu is based on Linux. Unlike Sailfish, there aren&#8217;t any Ubuntu phones yet. But the company behind it announced partnerships with two phone makers last week. Phones are due to come out this year, likely to European and Asian markets at first.</p>
<p>Ubuntu&#8217;s home page has a series of so-called scopes, arranged by category. One video scope might consist of icons for movies on your phone. Another might have items in your Netflix queue. You can refine what&#8217;s presented through a universal search. The idea is to let you access content easily, without having to open an app first.</p>
<p>Swipe from the left edge to get a launcher. The top has all your open apps, while your favorite apps are underneath those. There&#8217;s also a home screen scope to search for installed apps and those in the app store. Swipe from the right edge to get your most recently used app. Swipe further for a carousel of all open apps. Just pick one to go straight to it.</p>
<p>These systems all have good innovations to help users, but people will find the phone and app selections quite limiting. Sailfish has potential if it can indeed run well on existing Android phones, while Android apps can run on it. I look forward to trying that out when it&#8217;s released in the first half of the year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996279&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A tiny personal computer that is worn on the ear and can be controlled with the blink of an eye or the click of a tongue is being tested in Japan.</p>
<p>The 17-gram (0.59-ounce) wireless device has blue tooth capability and is equipped with a GPS, compass, gyro-sensor, battery, barometer, speaker and microphone. We are able computing is thought by many commentators to be the next big thing  in technology, with products such as Google Glass at the forefront.</p>
<p>The device, known at the moment as the &#8220;Earclip-type Wearable PC&#8221; has a microchip and data storage, enabling users to load software, said engineer Kazuhiro Taniguchi of Hiroshima City University. Its designs are based on traditional  &#8221;ikebana&#8221; flower arrangements.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have made this with the basic idea that people will wear it in the same way they wear earrings,&#8221; Taniguchi told AFP in a recent interview as he showcased a black prototype. The system, which developers are hoping to have ready for Christmas 2015, can be connected to an iPod or other gadget and would allow the user to navigate through software programmes using facial expressions, such as a raised eyebrow, a stuck-out tongue, a wiggle of the nose or by clenching teeth.</p>
<p>The device uses infrared sensors that monitor tiny movements inside the ear, which differ depending on how the eyes and  mouth move. Because the user does not have to move either hand, its developers say it can serve as &#8220;a third hand&#8221; for  everyone from caregivers to rock-climbers, motorbike riders to astronauts, as well as people with disabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supposing I climb a mountain, look at the sky at night and see a bright star up there, it could tell me what it is,&#8221; Taniguchi said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As it knows what altitude I&#8217;m at, which direction I&#8217;m looking and at what angle, it could tell me, &#8216;The bright star you are seeing now is Sirius&#8217;.&#8221; Using a smartphone to connect to the Internet would mean you could be automatically put in touch with people in faraway places who are doing the same thing as you.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">&#8220;This could connect you with a person who is looking at the same star at a remote place at the same time,&#8221; enabling </span>the people to swap impressions, Taniguchi said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996242&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/galaxie-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996212" alt="Our own Milky Way is a relatively flat disc with only a small bulge, the shape of which can be seen in the night sky. says Australian Astronomer. (Express photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/galaxie-480.jpg" /></a> Our own Milky Way is a relatively flat disc with only a small bulge, the shape of which can be seen in the night sky. says Australian Astronomer.  (Express photo)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Australian astronomers have discovered what makes some spiral galaxies fat and bulging while others flat discs &#8211; it&#8217;s  all about how fast they spin.</span></p>
<p>The research, led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) in Perth, found that fast-rotating spiral galaxies are flat and thin while equally sized galaxies that rotate slowly are fatter.</p>
<p>ICRAR Research Associate Professor Danail Obreschkow, from The University of Western Australia, said it is a much- debated mystery why galaxies look so different to each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some galaxies are very flat discs of stars and others are more bulging or even spherical,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Much of the last century of research has been dedicated to understanding this diversity of galaxies in the Universe and with this paper we&#8217;ve made a step towards understanding how this came about by showing that the rotation of spiral galaxies is a key driver for their shape,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The study looked at 16 galaxies &#8211; all between 10 million and 50 million light years from Earth &#8211; using data from a survey called THINGS.</p>
<p>&#8220;The THINGS survey shows you the cold gas in the galaxies, not only where it is but how it moves,&#8221; Obreschkow said.</p>
<p>&#8221; That&#8217;s a crucial point if you want to measure the spin, you can&#8217;t just take a photograph, you have to take a special picture that shows you the motion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Obreschkow said the shape of a spiral galaxy is determined by both its spin and its mass and if you leave a galaxy on its own for billions of years both quantities will stay the same. He said the way galaxies are formed looks a bit similar to a carousel made of an elastic disc.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the carousel is at rest, the elastic disc is quite small. But when the whole thing is spinning the elastic disc becomes larger because it&#8217;s feeling the effects of centrifugal force,&#8221; Obreschkow said.</p>
<p>Our own Milky Way is a relatively flat disc with only a small bulge, the shape of which can be seen in the night sky. &#8220;The white band of the Milky Way across the sky is a relatively thin band of constant thickness.</p>
<p>However when you look right at the centre near the Sagittarius constellation you can actually see a thickening of the Milky Way, which is the bulge,&#8221; Obreschkow said. The study was published in the Astrophysical Journal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996184&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1996169" alt="The Chargekey has a lightning connector on one end and a USB connector on the other" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/11-22-2013_chargekey_biker_bridge_1200x627.jpg" /> The Chargekey has a lightning connector on one end and a USB connector on the other
<p dir="ltr">Every day in office there is someone asking you for a charger. If you change your backpack or handbag, you might forget to carry the charger and as a result, end up with a dead phone when you need it the most.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you have an iPhone, the chances are that your colleagues don&#8217;t own the latest version with the small lightning port. To save you the headache associated with a dead phone, Nomad, a US-based company, has made a portable charging cable called Chargekey. It&#8217;s less than three inches long and will easily fit in your palm. Note that a variant with the microUSB port is also available.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996171" alt="ChargeKey-iPhone5" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/chargekey-iphone5.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chargekey has a lightning connector on one end and a USB connector on the other. The part linking these two connectors is made of bendable rubber, which reduces chances of breakage. This part has a hook that lets you attach the Chargekey to a keychain. This is a good idea because phones and keys are two things we always carry. So you&#8217;re less likely to forget it at home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chargekey worked well with laptops, wall adapters and desktop USB ports too. It can also be used to transfer data and sync with iTunes. There was no noticeable difference in the time it took to charge an iPhone 5S, when compared with Apple&#8217;s lightning cable.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996168" alt="11-21-2013_ChargeKey_Hero_Sidebyside_1200x1200" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/11-21-2013_chargekey_hero_sidebyside_1200x1200.jpg?w=475&#038;h=475" width="475" height="475" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Chargekey&#8217;s best feature – portability – becomes a weakness when you try to plug it to a wall adapter or a desktop computer. We tested it with both and found that the cable length is too short for either port. Do you really want to leave your iPhone, which cost more than Rs 40,000, dangling just to charge it? Most of us wouldn&#8217;t. So it is best to make sure that the iPhone is resting on a flat surface while charging. The Nomad website says Chargekey can hold your iPhone even if it is hanging, but we wouldn&#8217;t want to take the risk. This works best when you are charging the device from a laptop.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although the build quality of the cable is excellent, we would have been happier with it if it had some kind of protection for the two connectors. A lot of people are going to be keeping this close to several keys, which means there is a slight chance of damage. Also, before you charge, make sure that you wipe dust off the Chargekey.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996167" alt="Built-to" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/built-to.jpg?w=475&#038;h=429" width="475" height="429" />Overall, this is a great product that solves a problem we face regularly. Nomad Chargekey works well with a battery packs too, which is a plus if you live in a powercut-prone area.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nomad&#8217;s Chargekey costs $25 (~Rs 1,300) and shipping to India is free if you buy two. You can order it on hellonomad.com.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros:</strong> Portable, excellent build quality, bendable rubber cable</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons:</strong> No protection for connectors</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996139&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/06/m_id_397589_blackberry_z10.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1897589" alt="M_Id_397589_BlackBerry_Z10" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/06/m_id_397589_blackberry_z10.jpg?w=600" /></a> The new price is less than half of the BlackBerry Z10&#8242;s launch price
<p>The BlackBerry Z10 is now available as a limited period offer of Rs 17,990. That is almost a 60 per cent cut on its launch price and the second price cut in recent months. The offer is open for 60 days.</p>
<p>Running the latest BlackBerry 10 OS version 10.2.1 and with the best touch keyboard in the market, the Z10 is a good buy at this price. But you will have to live without the popular apps on other platforms, BlackBerry&#8217;s biggest pain point.</p>
<p>However, with the new OS you have the option of sideloading any Android app. So look at this phone as a top-end Android phone a mid-level price, with the added security and mail features of the Blackberry. Yes, this could be one of the best smartphone deals in the market at the moment.</p>

</script>
<p>Announcing the price cut, BlackBerry India MD Sunil Lalvani said:  “BlackBerry has a vast and loyal user base in India and we’re keen to provide these consumers with the unique communication experience that BlackBerry 10 offers. This commemorative offer puts the BlackBerry Z10 at Rs 17,990 and will ensure users are able to enjoy the cutting edge experience of a full-touch device combined with a revolutionary operating system – all at an attractive price point.”</p>
<p>The BlackBerry Z10 has the latest BlackBerry 10 atOS version 10.2.1, that supports Hinglish and Hindi typing and Android apps. it runs on 3G and 2G plans without a special BlackBerry Plan.  The phone has a 1.5 GHz dual-core processor with 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, and an expandable memory card slot that supports up to 32GB of additional storage. Plus, there is a superb screen, NFC (near field communications) and BBM service voice and video chats. Now get that in an Android phone for Rs 18,000.</p>
<p>The beleaguered Canadian smartphone company must be hoping that a lot of its loyal user will upgrade to the new phone with this offer.</p>

<p>Ever heard of a phone that hates water? Well, we think the WickedLeak Wammy Passion ‘X’ could be the phone that fits this sobriquet. In fact, the company calls its device, the first Octa core from its stables, the world’s first Super Hydrophobic phone.</p>
<p>The phone uses AquaProtect Technology, a specialised process that applies a liquid repellent substance inside and outside the phone. This, the company claims, gives it a sustenance power of more than 30mins in water and any water based liquid.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='475' height='267' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/CPMw1PBAsnw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>“AquaProtect nano coating procedure coats all the internal and external components of the device with water-resistant molecular layer which is invisible to the naked eye (1/1000th the size of the Human hair). So it will survive most splashes and quick dips that would instantly destroy most smartphones. We see aquaprotect becoming and industry standard in the near future,&#8221; said Aditya Mehta, Founder,WickedLeak.</p>
<p>The Wammy Passion’X’ boasts of a 5-inch Full HD display, with a of MediaTek Octa Core (MTK6592) processor, 13 megapixel Full HD camera and a 2500mah battery. The phone will come with dual sim slots and will run Android 4.2 OS.<br />
The phone will be available for Rs 22,500 on <a href="http://www.wickedleak.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wickedleak.org/</a></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993875&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Lumos unPlug solar backpack is a decent concept, but the execution needs a lot of fine tuning.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985106&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lumos-unplug-backpack.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985116" alt="Lumos unPlug solar backpack costs Rs 4,999" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lumos-unplug-backpack.jpg" /></a> Lumos unPlug solar backpack costs Rs 4,999
<p>Charging-on-the-go is becoming innovative by the day.While more and more people are carrying power banks to back up their power hungry smartphones and tablets, there are people who are trying to take this solution to new places. The Lumos unPlug Solar Backpack is a step in this direction. Yes, you read it right, it is a solar backpack, a bag which charges devices when exposed to direct sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>First impressions:</strong> The bag is black in colour &#8212; may be because of the colour’s high reception for sunlight &#8211;  and heavier than the usual. Plus, it takes a while to figure out where this thing opens from. I observed the design very minutely and when I ventured to open it, the process seemed unending. There was a zip, just like the usual ones, surrounding this backpack. So like a rookie user, I unzipped to gain access towards the business end of the device. To my surprise, the zip was like those fake doors that lead to concrete walls. This zip too did not lead anywhere.</p>
<p>I rotated the bag and turned it upside down to solve the mystery. Just when my patience began to run out, I saw a little opening towards the lower half with two old-school buckle locks. Unbuckle the locks, lifted the lid, and there it was – the small rectangular power bank. A solar power bank.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bag1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1985126" alt="bag1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bag1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=359" width="480" height="359" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What we know?</strong><br />
After the first check, I know this is a bag with more than a couple of storage slits and a rain cover.</p>
<p><strong>What we learnt?</strong><br />
Not all bags open with the zip, even if they have one.</p>
<p><strong>Business end never ends</strong></p>
<iframe width="475" height="267" src="//www.thinglink.com/card/490847875807313921" type="text/html" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe>
<p>With a lot of backpacks, by top brands, selling like hot cakes in the market, the only way for this little gadget to gain popularity was by a catchy design and a simpler interface. Both, however, are not be be found in the current design. Inside, there are multiple slots for a 15&#8243; laptop, a tablet, a couple of chargers, and even a handful of books. But, the way they are placed, stacked one over the other, is a bit confusing. It will take at least a couple of weeks to get used to this set up, and smoothly inserting the gadget in their slots.<br />
Now, let us come to the solar charger part of the bag. One USB slot, a small pin &#8212; for both in and out &#8212; and a dozen jacks, compatible with even out-of-the-market handsets/devices. There is definitely a lack of vision here. Technology, they say, is to make the job simpler. With such a complex interface, it only adds to confusion and consumes a lot of time. For instance, switching to the alternate mode of charging the internal battery using a power point is a pain. The tiny pin, next to the USB slot, doesn&#8217;t hold on properly. You move, you unplug.</p>
<p><strong>What we know?</strong><br />
Plenty of space, but with its share of confusion.</p>
<p><strong>What we learnt?</strong><br />
Patience is the key to charge this backpack.</p>
<p><iframe width="475" height="294" src="//www.thinglink.com/card/490849569043644417" type="text/html" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe><br />
<strong>The decision</strong><br />
With so much confusion and definitely a problem of plenty, the question is whether one should actually go ahead and spend close to rs 5,000 for a very ordinary backpack with supernatural, but super confusing powers?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>It is better advised to buy a decent battery power bank and tag it with your super cool college backpack. It will charge your devices and serve your purpose. Saves you the confusion and a whole lot of money. Buy this is you are a junky for geeky devices which no one else picks up.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985106&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/samsung-galaxy-notepro-and-tabpro-lifestyle-images-2-5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987822" alt="Enterprise friendly Samsung Galaxy NotePRO 3 is priced at Rs 64,990" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/samsung-galaxy-notepro-and-tabpro-lifestyle-images-2-5.jpg" /></a> Enterprise friendly Samsung Galaxy NotePRO  is priced at Rs 64,990
<p>Samsung seems to be shifting its focus towards the high growth tablet segment with the launch of two new tablets aimed at different segments of users.</p>
<p>The high-end enterprise segments, which it would like to have a considerable presence in, will now have the option of purchasing a 12.2-inch productivity oriented Samsung Galaxy NotePRO at Rs 64,900, while the budget conscious buyers will get another seven-inch tablet in the Galaxy Tab3 Neo at a more affordable Rs 16,490.</p>
<p>The more interesting device of the two is definitely the NotePRO which will offer enterprise users a bunch of productivity option. For instance, they will be  able to open four windows simultaneously. That is thanks to the larger screen and the 2560x1600p display. This is topped up with a virtual keyboard that will let users type easily, or get what Samsung calls the &#8220;more realistic typing experience.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/notepro-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1987616" alt="NotePRO 1-" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/notepro-1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>This tablet will have Samsung&#8217;s popular S Pen along with a Pen Window where users will be able to access in-application features anywhere on the screen. Plus, Samsung has tied up with Cisco for WebEx meetings, the first time in Android tablets. It will be available in 3G and LTE versions too.</p>
<p>It will also support Knox, Samsung&#8217;s effort to make Android accessible to enterprise.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab3 Neo will be aimed at the younger crowd and have a 600x1024p screen. It will be powered by a 1.2Ghz dual-core processor with 1GB RAM and run Android 4.2 Jelly Bean.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987599&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1957047 " alt="Great White Shark" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/800px-white_shark.jpg" /> The instruments can help researchers understand where, when and how much sharks and other predators are eating
<p>Instruments strapped onto and ingested by sharks have provided novel insights into how one of the most feared and least understood ocean predators swims, eats and lives, scientists say.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For the first time, researchers outfitted sharks with sophisticated sensors and video recorders to measure and see where they are going, how they are getting there, and what they are doing once they reach their destinations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scientists are also piloting a project using instruments ingested by sharks and other top ocean predators, like tuna, to gain new awareness into these animals&#8217; feeding habits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The instruments, which use electrical measurements to track ingestion and digestion of prey, can help researchers understand where, when and how much sharks and other predators are eating, and what they are feasting on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The instruments are providing scientists with a &#8220;shark&#8217;s eye&#8221; view of the ocean and greater understanding than ever of the lives of these fish in their natural environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;What we are doing is really trying to fill out the detail of what their role is in the ocean,&#8221; said Carl Meyer, an assistant researcher at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;It is all about getting a much deeper understanding of sharks&#8217; ecological role in the ocean, which is important to the health of the ocean and, by extension, to our own well-being,&#8221; said Meyer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Using the sensors and video recorders, the researchers captured unprecedented images of sharks of different species swimming in schools, interacting with other fish and moving in repetitive loops across the sea bed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They also found that sharks used powered swimming more often than gliding motion to move through the ocean, contrary to what scientists had previously thought, and that deep-sea sharks swim in slow motion compared to shallow water species.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;These instrument packages are like flight data recorders for sharks. They allow us to quantify a variety of different things that we haven&#8217;t been able to quantify before,&#8221; Meyer said. &#8220;It has really drawn back the veil on what these animals do and answered some longstanding questions,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sharks are at the top of the ocean food chain, Meyer noted, making them an important part of the marine ecosystem, and knowing more about these fish helps scientists better understand the flow of energy through the ocean.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Until now, sharks have mainly been observed in captivity,  and have been tracked only to see where they travelled. These new observations could help shape conservation and resource management efforts, and inform public safety measures, Holland said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995478&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1995417 " alt="Nissan Motor Co., the Japanese automaker's electric car Leaf, right, runs in Thimphu in Bhutan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nissan.jpg" /> Nissan Motor Co&#8217;s electric car Leaf runs in Thimphu, Bhutan
<p>The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has tapped Nissan Motor Co. to supply electric cars for its taxis and government fleet, hoping to reduce reliance on imported oil. Under the agreement,Nissan will supply its Leaf electric car and set up charging stations in Bhutan.</p>
<p>Bhutan, with a population of 720,000, produces and exports hydroelectricity. But it&#8217;s eager to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels shipped in from abroad.</p>
<p>The tiny landlocked country was long known for measuring &#8220;gross national happiness&#8221; instead of traditional indicators of prosperity such as GDP. But since 2013, a new government under Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay has downplayed that as a distraction from problems of poverty and corruption.</p>
<p>The Leaf is the world&#8217;s best-selling electric car, selling a cumulative 100,000 so far since going on sale in late 2010, comprising 45 percent of the global electric vehicle market.</p>
<p>The car has struggled to reach a critical mass in sales, especially when compared to hybrid models, for instance, but the Leaf remains the symbol of Nissan&#8217;s commitment to the environment and shows off its engineering prowess.Nissan has agreements with more than 100 nations, states and cities globally to promote electric cars, including the Spanish city of Barcelona and Sao Paulo in Brazil.</p>
<p>Most deals in electric cars tend to be with developed nations, making Bhutan a relatively unusual case. Nissan wants to study how its electric vehicle business fits with a developing nation that has substantial clean energy resources.</p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1995416" alt="nissan1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nissan1.jpg" /> Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay and Nissan President Carlos Ghosn
<p>Nissan President Carlos Ghosn said the deal would involve hundreds of electric cars in the short term as Bhutanese government officials start driving them, and then thousands as the whole nation goes electric and similar deals with other places were in the works, as increasingly emerging markets combine protecting the environment through electric cars with development, as Bhutan is doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many emerging markets want to protect the environment,&#8221; Ghosn said by phone from Bhutan&#8217;s capital, Thimphu.<br />
The thinking has been that development goes hand in hand with pollution, but Ghosn said that was changing, and that Nissan was supporting Bhutan&#8217;s transportation vision. Bhutan and Nissan will study how to further cooperate on green technology, both sides said.</p>
<p>Ghosn presented two Leaf vehicles to Bhutan on the birthday of Bhutan&#8217;s king.<br />
Sandwiched between Asian giants China and India, Bhutan was long closed to the rest of the world before starting to open up in the 1960s. Foreigners and the international media were first admitted in 1974, and television arrived only in 1999.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nissan&#8217;s global experience will be invaluable as we make progress toward an electrified national transport infrastructure,&#8221; Tobgay said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995370&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[If you are looking for a high-end Android phone and don’t mind spending Rs 39,999 then consider the Oppo N1 <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995182&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1995189" alt="camera-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/camera-480.jpg" /> The Oppo N1 has the world&#8217;s first rotating camera
<p>Over the years, my biggest grouse with Android devices have been their lack of variety. Once you swithc them on all these phones and tablets look, and work, alike. The differentiator is usually in the design and that too is more often subtle. But recently there was a big exception to this rule, the Oppo N1. If you haven’t heard of Oppo, it is a global brand that is quite popular in some parts of the world. Interestingly, the company also chose to enter the market with high-end device that wants to take on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and the Nokia Lumia 1520, not the mid-range Galaxy devices or the Micromaxs.<br />
Here are five things that set the Oppo N1 apart.</p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-1995187" alt="This is how the camera is constructed" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lens-design.jpg" /> This is how the camera is constructed
<p><strong>1. Just one camera, not two:</strong> Android device manufacturers have struggled to offer one great camera in their phones, let alone two. So as a rule, the front camera is much lower specced than the rear one and can at the most be used for a Skype call or a dark looking selfie. Oppo has thought around this problem giving the phone a good 13MP camera and giving it the ability to rotate on an axis. So you have a 13MP front and rear camera. It helps that this camera is really good, though it gives an over-saturated feel at time. But the details are amazing and rare of camera phones. That is good enough for me to overlook the noise that comes with it. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/technology-gallery/oppo-n1-camera-review-a-rotatable-camera-with-a-character/" target="_blank"><strong>See photo gallery</strong></a></p>

<p>And yes, the video quality is really good, with a smooth zoom.</p>

<p><strong>2. The OS is different:</strong> There is no doubt that the plain vanilla Android is the best there is. There have been many attempts to give the users something new, and some like the HTC Sense have been quite good. The Oppo N1 tweaks Android and calls it the Color OS. This was my first tryst with this overlay and I can definitely live with it. It is very intuitive and uses gesture better that most other phones. I also like the homescreen that gives a camera windows inside in case you want to add stuff to remember. The music and video players are much more fun and easier to use.</p>

<p><strong>3. The gestures work:</strong> Everyone has  been trying to make use use of gesture on Android phones. I think Oppo has pretty much cracked the best way to do it. You can pull down a screen from the top to use gestures that you have preset for certain apps or functions. For instance, I calibrated it to open the camera every time I scribbled C on this screen. There is more. A simple three finger scroll up saved a screenshot. As this is a feature I use a lot, I loved the fact that it had become so easy. And gesture work no just on the screen. You can swipe you finger behind the body to click pictures. However, we felt this only added to the shake in images.</p>

<p><strong>4. This one has a remote:</strong> The phone ships with a small device called the O-click. This small white disk works like a remote that connects to the phone over Bluetooth 4.0. It takes seconds to pair the two devices and once done, it will beep when there is an incoming call or message. We used it to trigger a shot when the camera window is open. It also alerts you if you move too far away from the phone and call also lets you track the phone when you can’t find it. The remote can be worn as a band around your arm. It is all a bit gimmicky and I doubt if anyone will use it on a daily basis. But this is something that works.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1995186" alt="main-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/main-1.png?w=358&#038;h=600"   /><br />
<strong>5. It is built like a tank:</strong> At a time when we end up writing the word plasticky in every Android phone review, Oppo shows us that good design and build quality is not something that needs to be compromised on. You start feeling confident about the device from the time you see the packaging for the first time. Only Apple devices have been able exude such confidence with its packaging. This confidence show up inside the box too, with the phone’s all while body reminding me of the HTC One, arguably the best built Android device. This comes close, and maybe goes a step ahead as it has been able to create a camera that rotates but does not feel like it will fall off.</p>
<p><strong>So should you buy this?</strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for a high-end Android phone and don’t mind spending Rs 39,999 then this is definitely a phone that is worth a look. The only cause for worry is the fact that this is a new company and you might be stuck if something happens to the phone. We expect the company to have a service network in place in the coming months, just take care of your phone till you town gets one.</p>
<p>Price: <b><i>Rs 39,999</i></b></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995182&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1994812" alt="Vertu Constellation runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean on a  Qualcomm Snapdragon dual-core 1.7 GHz processor" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/constellation_office.jpg" /> Vertu Constellation runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean on a Qualcomm Snapdragon dual-core 1.7 GHz processor
<p>This is one phone where the specs don&#8217;t really matter. What matter is the name and, of course, the price tag. This is the Constellation from Vertu, the world’s top premium phone maker.</p>
<p>It is not that the specs are not there. Vertu Constellation runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean on a  Qualcomm Snapdragon dual-core 1.7 GHz processor and has 32GB of internal memory. The 13 MP rear-facing camera can record full HD video (1080p), while the a front-facing Skype compliant camera is 1.3MP. The phone obviously has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and NFC.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994811" alt="Constellation_High Re_010" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/constellation_high-re_010.jpg?w=480&#038;h=537" width="480" height="537" /></p>
<p>But then most of the top end Android phones have similar features. So what are you paying the Rs 4,74,995 for?</p>
<p>That would be the “melodicring tones” especially composed for Vertu and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and a set featuring English bird songs.  “All of these ringtones benefit from Vertu engineers’ meticulous approach to mobile audio engineering, resulting in unparalleled acoustic clarity. Constellation also features uplink noise cancellation software, as well as aptX support, which guarantees superior playback quality when streaming audio to Bluetooth headphones or speakers,” says a release.</p>
<p>Then there are Vertu’s range of exclusive services, Vertu LIFE and Vertu CERTAINTY. The former offers customers a personalised selection of exclusive privileges and unrestricted access to elite events , while the latter protects the customer, their phone and data through best-in-class technology and expert partners. Users will be entitled to encrypted communications in partnership with Silent Circle, global Wi-Fi access via iPass, personal and corporate security with Protector Services Group and anti-virus by Kaspersky.</p>
<p>So, ready to pay the price of exclusivity?</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994802&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nasa-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994685" alt="The discovery marks a significant increase in the number of known small-sized planets, said NASA." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nasa-med.jpg" /></a> The discovery marks a significant increase in the number of known small-sized planets, said NASA.
<p>NASA&#8217;s planet-hunting Kepler telescope has confirmed a record-setting bonanza of 715 newly discovered planets outside our solar system, nearly doubling the count of exoplanets discovered to around 1,700.</p>
<p>These newly-verified worlds orbit 305 stars, revealing multiple-planet systems much like our own solar system. Nearly 95 per cent of these planets are smaller than Neptune, which is almost four times the size of Earth. The discovery marks a significant increase in the number of known small-sized planets more akin to Earth than previously identified exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar system, said NASA.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kepler team continues to amaze and excite us with their planet hunting results,&#8221; said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA&#8217;s Science Mission  Directorate in Washington. Scientists used a statistical technique that can be applied to many planets at once when they are found in systems that harbour more than one planet around the same star.</p>
<p>To verify this bounty of planets, a research team co-led by Jack Lissauer, planetary scientist at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center in  California, analysed stars with more than one potential planet, all of which were detected in the first two years of Kepler&#8217;s observations &#8211; May 2009 to March 2011.</p>
<p>The research team used a technique called verification by multiplicity, which relies in part on the logic of probability. Kepler observes 150,000 stars, and has found a few thousand of those to have planet candidates. Kepler observed hundreds of stars that have multiple planet candidates.</p>
<p>Through a careful study of this sample, these  715 new planets were verified. &#8220;We&#8217;ve now developed a process to verify multiple planet candidates in bulk to deliver planets wholesale, and have used it to unveil a veritable bonanza of new worlds,&#8221; said Lissauer.</p>
<p>These multiple-planet systems are fertile grounds for studying individual planets and the configuration of planetary neighbourhoods. This provides clues to planet formation. Four of these new planets are less than 2.5 times the size of Earth and orbit in their Sun&#8217;s habitable zone &#8211; range of distance from a star where the  surface temperature of an orbiting planet may be suitable for life-giving liquid water.</p>
<p>One of these new habitable zone planets, called Kepler-296f, orbits a star half the size and 5 per cent as bright as our Sun. Kepler-296f is twice the size of Earth,  but scientists do not know whether the planet is a gaseous world, with a thick hydrogen-helium envelope, or it is a water world surrounded by a deep ocean.</p>
<p>The findings will be published in The Astrophysical Journal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994610&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1994480" alt="Project Ara is promoted by Motorola" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ara1blogpost.png" /> Project Ara is promoted by Motorola
<p dir="ltr">How many times have you wanted to add a feature to your phone or remove something you never use?  Well, it might not be long before you are able to do just that. There are at least three different teams working on what could be called a build-your-own phone concept.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A BYO phone is essentially a modular device in which you can add and remove features or modules as you go. In an ideal scenario, when a great new processor comes along, you should be able to change just the chip and not the entire phone.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Project Ara</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994481" alt="ara-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ara-1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">When Google throws its weight behind an project and adds the Motorola brand to it, then it is sure going to be worth the effort. That is Project Ara for you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Motorola’s Advanced Technology and Projects group has a simple mission: &#8220;Do for hardware what the Android platform has done for software: create a vibrant third-party developer ecosystem, lower the barriers to entry, increase the pace of innovation, and substantially compress development timelines.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994479" alt="ara2blogpost" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ara2blogpost.png?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Project Ara is at least a couple of years old and consists of endoskeleton and modules. &#8220;The endo is the structural frame that holds all the modules in place. A module can be anything, from a new application processor to a new display or keyboard, an extra battery, a pulse oximeter&#8211;or something not yet thought of,&#8221; says a Motorola blogpost.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If latest reports are right, Google wants a phone coming out of Project Ara to cost as low as $50. That will be a game changer for sure.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://dscout.com/ara#about-dscout" target="_blank">You can also be a part of Project Ara.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Phonebloks</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994475" alt="phonebloks" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/phonebloks.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Led by Dave Hakkens, Phonebloks.com is a community that, like Motorola, believes in developing &#8220;a phone platform that is modular, open, customisable, and made for the entire world&#8221;. The community now has nearly a million supporters, all of whom plan to collaborate towards the common goal of creating a prototype for the modular phone. Obviously, one of their largest partners is Motorola.</p>
<p><b></b><b><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='475' height='267' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/zG_uwDqLsZY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></b></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>ZTE Eco-Mobius</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994477" alt="eco_mobius2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/eco_mobius2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=354" width="480" height="354" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">At CES, ZTE showed off its modular phone and tablet concepts, stunning design to say the least. This concept phone will let users change everything from cameras to GPU, with the components snapped together inside a case. But the Eco-Mobius is nothing more than a prototype.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1994476" alt="ZTE-" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/zte.jpg?w=540&#038;h=301" width="540" height="301" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">But all these are definite indicators that customisable phones are not all that far away. In fact, with the Moto X, Motorola is already giving users a bunch of customisations, at least with design. What it could do for the world of smartphones is bring prices down like never before. After all, you will pay only for the features you need in the phone.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994467&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/boeing-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994382 " alt="Boeing Co on Wednesday unveiled a smartphone that deletes all data and renders the device inoperable." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/boeing-480.jpg" /></a> Boeing Black is built by Boeing.
<p>Boeing Co on Wednesday unveiled a smartphone that appears to come straight from a James Bond spy movie.</p>
<p>In addition to encrypting calls, any attempt to open the casing of the Boeing Black Smartphone deletes all data and renders the device inoperable. The secure phone marks an extension of the communications arm of the Chicago-based aerospace and defense contractor, which is best known for jetliners and fighter planes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994495" alt="black_smartphone_250x200" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/black_smartphone_250x200.jpg?w=250&#038;h=200" width="250" height="200" /></p>
<p>Such a phone might have prevented damage to Washington&#8217;s diplomacy in Ukraine from a leaked telephone call. A senior U.S. State Department officer and the ambassador to Ukraine apparently used unencrypted cellphones for a call about political developments in Ukraine that became public.</p>

<p>Boeing&#8217;s tamper-proof phone is aimed at government agencies and contractors who need to keep communication and data secure, according to Boeing and filings with  the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Made in the United States, the phone runs on Google Inc&#8217;s  Android operating system.</p>
<p>The 5.2-by-2.7-inch (13.2-by-6.9 cm)  handset, slightly larger than an iPhone, uses dual SIM cards to enable it to access multiple cell networks instead of a single network like a normal cellphone.</p>
<p>Due to the phone&#8217;s security features, Boeing is releasing few details about the wireless network operators or manufacturer it is working with, and has not provided a price or date by which the phone might be widely available, but said it has begun offering the phone to potential customers.</p>
<p>Boeing&#8217;s website says the phone can be configured to connect with biometric sensors or satellites. Other attachments can extend battery life or use solar power. The  phone can operate on the WCDMA, GSM and LTE frequency bands and offers WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The company has been developing the phone for 36 months,  said Boeing spokeswoman Rebecca Yeamans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw a need for our customers in a certain market space&#8221; that Boeing could meet with its technology  expertise, she said. A sample purchase contract submitted  to the FCC says the phone would be sold directly by Boeing or its agents.</p>
<p>Yeamans said Boeing combined its own engineers with the talent of people who joined Boeing recently through acquisitions that included Argon ST Inc, Digital Receiver Technology Inc, Kestrel Enterprises Inc, Ravenwing Inc, and Solutions Made Simple Inc.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1994341" alt="The Google Nexus 7 is built by Asus" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nexus7.jpg" /> The Google Nexus 7 is built by Asus
<p>Here is why we think the Google Nexus 7 is the best seven-inch tablet out there.</p>
<p><strong>Unboxing</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, the Nexus 7 does not come in fancy packaging; you know, the kind that would require you to solve a Rubik’s Cube before you can lay your hands on the device. Moreover, you cannot always figure out from which end of the box should the unboxing be done.</p>
<p>I remember a store assistant once using her nail extensions – as forceps – to unbox my current phone. The box had such tiny crevices that made it almost impossible to pull the flaps out without tearing off the cover. It had very little wiggle room for even a newborn’s finger to coax the box to open.</p>
<p>Unboxing the Nexus 7 is a breeze compared to the stress that the store assistant’s nails went through. Push your hand through the Nexus front cover and the box slides out of its pocket, like a turtle poking its head out from a shell. Now, lift the second cover to access the contents inside. See, It is simple.</p>
<p><strong>First impressions</strong></p>
<p>I did not beat my chest and jump around the Nexus 7 like the apes in Stanley Kubrik’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. Though, it does look like a miniature version of the mysterious monolith that falls out of the sky in the film.</p>
<p>I, however, was intrigued by its size; for I have never seen or held a seven-inch tablet before. Yes, tech geeks, this is your cue to close the browser window and trawl the internet for updates from the<a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/mwc/" target="_blank"> Mobile World Congress</a>, which is currently underway in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
<p>The Nexus 7 felt light as a feather when I first picked it up. When you wrap your fingers around its smooth edges, you will realise that it has a good grip; props to its semi-rubbery backside with the word Nexus elegantly stenciled on it. It is, definitely, not something that you would put down immediately without toying with for a while.</p>
<p>I powered up the Nexus 7 and then deferentially synced my Google account, since it is standard procedure for first-time boot ups. If you do not have a Google ID I think it insists that you create one, like Microsoft eggs you on to create a Windows Live account for devices powered with Windows 8.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994342" alt="nexus7-long" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nexus7-long.jpg?w=480&#038;h=477" width="480" height="477" /></p>
<p><strong>App installation</strong></p>
<p>Once you are sorted with the sign-in process, your tablet will be up and running within seconds the next time you use it. Readwhere was, probably, the first app that I installed from the Google Play Store. For the uninitiated, it is digital newsstand that provides access to e-papers, magazines and books. The Indian Express e-paper was a joy to read on the Nexus 7. The images were sharp, the text was crisp, and I must begrudgingly accept that it felt better than the print version.</p>
<p><strong>Screen responsiveness</strong></p>
<p>To test the responsiveness of the screen, I installed two of the most popular games on the Play Store. Subway Surfers and Temple Run 2 are rated highly for their gameplay. Both games require quick swipe gestures, and I could not think of anything better that would set a high benchmark for the screen’s responsiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Display &amp; Sound</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Moving on, the Nexus 7’s speakers pack a punch. I used a single composed by the English indie rock band Alt-J to test the bass and treble. Needless to say, Fitzpleasure (single) hit all the right notes. The voice was clear, and so was the guitar riff and drum beats.</p>
<p>Watching videos on the Nexus is a great experience. The colours are vivid thanks to its superior resolution. It also offers excellent viewing angles unlike any run-of-the-mill laptop with a LCD screen.</p>
<p>I am going to hit the +1 button for its on-board graphics. This time I used the game Injustice: Gods Among Us, to test the graphics; and the result was excellent for a game which emphasizes a lot on graphic detail.</p>
<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p>
<p>My only complaint about the Nexus 7 is that it does not come with a three-axis accelerometer. The screen alternates between landscape and portrait mode without any glitch. But when you are reading an eBook or scrolling an article under your bed sheets, it can get a bit cumbersome when you are lying on your side. The tablet does not quite know which viewing angle to use and it keeps alternating at the slightest of movements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it takes a long time to charge. I would not be surprised if I completed watching the extended edition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy before the tablet reaches its full charge. And it is only fair to say that the Nexus 7 has a good battery life.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, the Nexus 7 is the king in the seven-inch tablet segment. I wouldn’t judge you, if you would place it on a velvet cushion and drape it with fine woolens.</p>
<p>Rs 20,999 for 16 GB version. Rs 23,999 for 32GB.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994339&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want your computer to go faster? Add light!</p>
<p>Scientists, including one of Indian-origin, have developed novel devices that could usher in a new wave of<br />
highly efficient electronics, including computers, that can be turned on and off using light.<br />
Every second, your computer must process billions of computational steps to produce even the simplest outputs.<br />
Imagine if every one of those steps could be made just a tiny bit more efficient, researchers said.<br />
&#8220;It would save precious nanoseconds,&#8221; said Northeastern University Boston, assistant professor of physics Swastik Kar.  Kar and his colleague Yung Joon Jung, have developed a series of novel devices that do just that. The duo combined their expertise &#8211; Kar&#8217;s in graphene, a carbon-based material known for its strength and conductivity, and Jung&#8217;s in the mechanics of carbon nanotubes, which are nanometre-sized rolled up sheets of graphene to unearth a physical phenomenon that could usher in a new wave of highly efficient electronics.<br />
They discovered that light-induced electrical currents rise much more sharply at the intersection of carbon nanotubes and silicon, compared to the intersection of silicon and a metal, as in traditional photo diode devices.   &#8220;That sharp rise helps us design devices that can be turned on and off using light,&#8221; Kar said. This finding has major implications for performing computations, which, in simple terms, also rely on a series of<br />
on-off switches, researchers said.<br />
&#8220;People believe that the best computer would be one in which the processing is done using electrical signals and the signal transfer is done by optics,&#8221; Kar said. This isn&#8217;t too surprising since light is extremely fast,<br />
researchers said.</p>
<p>Kar and Jung&#8217;s devices &#8211; which are the first to integrate electronic and optical properties on a single electronic chip represent a critical breakthrough in making this dream computer a reality.<br />
The study was published in the journal Nature Photonics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993952&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A tiny new hearing aid that is controlled by a smartphone app has been developed, eliminating the need for wearers to carry a pendant-like device.</p>
<p>Hearing aid wearers need to carry a cumbersome pendant or other wireless device to change settings on their hearing aid, but the new app allows users to make those changes directly on the smartphone. Wearers control the hearing aid with the app which can programme specific settings.</p>
<p>The ReSound Smart app allows users to adjust everything from the volume to the bass and tremble in each ear on the app. The ReSound LiNX hearing aids can also be used to stream music, listen to GPS directions and talk on the phone through Bluetooth.</p>
<p>There is also a &#8216;Find My Hearing Aid&#8217; feature that helps the user locate their device if it has been misplaced. The batteries on the hearing aid will last about five days, &#8216;New York Daily News&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>Small devices are great for hearing-impaired people who are worried about being seen wearing hearing aids, according to Danish company GN ReSound which developed the ReSound LiNX hearing aid. Everyone is constantly checking their phones, so the people you are with don&#8217;t have to know you&#8217;re really adjusting your hearing aid instead of checking your email, the company said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993835&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/glam_gear-fit-galaxy-s5-white.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993677" alt="Samsung will bank on the fitness features to get new buyers for the Samsung Galaxy S5" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/glam_gear-fit-galaxy-s5-white.jpg" /></a> Samsung will bank on the fitness features to get new buyers for the Samsung Galaxy S5
<p>Samsung is banking on you shaping up this spring.</p>
<p>The company on Monday unveiled its new Galaxy S5 smartphone, which is set to go on sale in April, along with a pair of watches. And many of the features included on the devices focus on fitness.</p>
<p>Considering America&#8217;s continued fascination with personal health and health-related products, this is probably a good idea. What Samsung has attempted to do is combine the best attributes of the top-of-the-line fitness trackers currently on the market with those of its own phones and smartwatches.</p>
<p>The S5 and the watches were unveiled at an event at the Mobile World Congress wireless show in Barcelona, Spain. I had a chance to briefly test out all three products in New York on Monday.</p>
<p>The S5 includes a built-in heart rate monitor, pedometer and fitness tracker, though I&#8217;m not sure how useful they actually are. For instance, to check your heart rate, you hold your finger over a sensor on the back of the phone — something I can&#8217;t imagine doing in the middle of a jog.</p>
<p>True fitness buffs will probably head straight for Samsung&#8217;s Gear Fit smartwatch, which also does all of those things, but in a much more user-friendly way. Want to check your heart rate? Just open up the app for that and it gives you a reading within seconds.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lifestyle_15.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993680" alt="Lifestyle_15" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lifestyle_15.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>While many people have become accustomed to wearing fitness bands either constantly or for their workouts, I think a lot of them would balk at going running with, or perpetually being tethered to, a phone as big as the S5.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth mentioning too that the Fit Gear is very nicely styled. I have to admit, I wasn&#8217;t a fan of Samsung&#8217;s first Galaxy Gear smartwatch, because it felt heavy and clunky and was just too big for a normal-sized woman&#8217;s wrist. But the Fit solves that problem. It&#8217;s thin, light and features a curved color screen. If you don&#8217;t mind wearing something like a Fitbit Force or a Nike FuelBand, you won&#8217;t mind this product either.</p>
<p>The trade-off is you can&#8217;t place or answer a call from the Fit, but it will notify you of things like calls, emails and text messages. There&#8217;s also no camera.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lifestyle_11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993679" alt="Lifestyle_11" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lifestyle_11.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>Samsung&#8217;s new Gear 2 watch also comes with basic fitness features including the heart rate monitor and pedometer. While it&#8217;s still too chunky for me, it is significantly lighter and thinner than the original version.</p>
<p>Unlike the Fit, you can still place calls from it and shoot pictures and video from its camera. But are those features really important? It was tough to shoot a decent picture with the original watch&#8217;s camera and making or taking a call from the phone wasn&#8217;t easy either, especially with any kind of noise in the background.</p>
<p>One nice change is that unlike Samsung&#8217;s first smartwatch, the new ones pair with a host of Samsung phones, giving consumers more options for their primary device.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lifestyle_06.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993678" alt="Lifestyle_06" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lifestyle_06.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>Samsung also plans to introduce a slightly cheaper version called the Gear 2 Neo, which won&#8217;t have a camera or come in as many colors. The company has yet to announce pricing for any of the new products.</p>
<p>Fitness aside, the S5 phone includes some other significant upgrades from its predecessor. Some of the biggest changes are in its camera. Its 16 megapixels make it sharper than the S4, which had just 13. It&#8217;s also designed to focus faster and lets you blur the foreground or background of an image to emphasize a subject.</p>
<p>The phone also has a fingerprint sensor to use in place of a passcode to unlock the phone or make mobile payments. And it is splash and dust resistant, which is bound to prolong the phone&#8217;s life for many people.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gear_fit_group.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993676" alt="Gear_Fit_Group" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gear_fit_group.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>An added incentive for parents is the phone&#8217;s &#8220;Kids Mode,&#8221; which lets you hand your phone off to your child without fear that they&#8217;ll stream something inappropriate from your Netflix cue or access your email.</p>
<a name="pd_a_7828550"></a>
<div class="PDS_Poll" id="PDI_container7828550" data-settings="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/static.polldaddy.com\/p\/7828550.js&quot;}" style="display:inline-block;"></div>
<div id="PD_superContainer"></div>
<noscript><a href="http://polldaddy.com/poll/7828550">Take Our Poll</a></noscript><script type='text/javascript'>
(function(d,c,j){if(!d.getElementById(j)){var pd=d.createElement(c),s;pd.id=j;pd.src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/shortcodes/js/polldaddy-shortcode.js';s=d.getElementsByTagName(c)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(pd,s);}  else if(typeof jQuery !=='undefined')jQuery(d.body).trigger('pd-script-load');}(document,'script','pd-polldaddy-loader'));
</script>
<p>In short, the S5&#8242;s improvements might be enough to entice current Samsung fans to upgrade their devices, while its fitness features could draw some converts as well, especially those interested in purchasing a smartwatch to go along with it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993662&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is here, and can the jokes be far behind? The Twitterati poked gentle fun at every feature of the S5, from its appearance to its waterproof nature. What we were most surprised at is that some competitors of Samsung got involved, too.</p>
<p>Here are the funniest Galaxy S5 jokes from Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>The most viral funny picture of the S5</strong><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/s5-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993478" alt="S5 1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/s5-1.jpg?w=470&#038;h=501" width="470" height="501" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Size does matter</strong><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/s5-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993479" alt="S5 2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/s5-2.jpg?w=470&#038;h=209" width="470" height="209" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Nokia and nuclear war survival jokes never get old</strong><br />

<p><strong>Paid publicity tweet or not, this was still very funny</strong><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/s5-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993481" alt="S5 4" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/s5-4.jpg?w=470&#038;h=210" width="470" height="210" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Recycled iPhone 4 / 5 jokes</strong><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/s5-5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993483" alt="S5 5" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/s5-5.jpg?w=470&#038;h=206" width="470" height="206" /></a></p>

<p><strong>&#8230;as does Nokia. Sadly, they use a pun first created more than ten years ago</strong><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/s5-7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993485" alt="S5 7" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/s5-7.jpg?w=470&#038;h=391" width="470" height="391" /></a></p>

<p>Google Inc is making it a bit easier to get rid of spam mails. It is planning to add an unsubscribe button to Gmail that will automatically appear in the header of emails that it detects might be unwanted messages from marketers.</p>
<p>According to reports, Google announced the new feature at an event last week, and the unsubscribe option began to roll out thereafter. Clicking the button won&#8217;t lead you through the marketers&#8217; standard unsubscribe dialogue though — it will instead have Google send an automated email to the marketer requesting that it remove you from future mailings.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993386&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona churns out phone after phone, taking Android to price points where a smartphone has never been before, comes the stark reminder that cyber criminals are also licking their lips at the sight of a larger target.</p>
<p>Incidentally, 2014 marks the tenth anniversary of SymbOS.Cabir, the first mobile malware. This worm targeted the then popular Symbian OS and made infected phones search for nearby Bluetooth devices and push the worm onto them. Mobile malware has only become more potent since.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mwc_10years_tube_map_infographic.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1993373 aligncenter" alt="mwc_10years_tube_map_infographic" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mwc_10years_tube_map_infographic.png?w=287&#038;h=600" width="287" height="600" /></a>In fact, in 2013 Symantec discovered an average of 272 new malware variants and five new malware families per month targeting the now dominant Android mobile operating system. The internet security giant warns that with people increasingly using phones for financial transactions, cyber criminals have developed Android malware to steal these two factor authentication (2FA) codes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Threats such as Android.Hesperbot and Android.Perkel intercept SMS messages with 2FA codes and send them directly to attackers. They can also either steal other banking credentials or work with other computer-based threats to compromise victims’ accounts,&#8221; says a Symantec blog post by Threat Researcher Candid Wueest.</p>
<p>The blog says Android bootkits are being used to Windows computers and infect the computer’s startup code. This allows the malware to execute even before the operating system starts up.</p>
<p>Symantec says that with increased screening of applications making it more difficult for attackers to get their malicious apps onto the marketplace, they are looking to use desktop computers as a vehicle onto Android handsets, leading to the birth of hybrid threats.&#8221;To avoid this threat, users should be wary of connecting their mobile device to untrustworthy desktop computers and ensure that they have security software on both their desktop and mobile devices,&#8221; says the blog.</p>
<p>In the future, the hybrid threat could come from the Internet of Things with infected home automation systems, warns the blog.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993372&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/phones.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993367" alt="Visitors check the new devices of Samsung at the Mobile World Congress, the world's largest mobile phone trade show in Barcelona.

<p>Here&#8217;s the rub for companies: A good part of the key markets they serve already own smartphones and use them to connect various Internet services. How do you grow from there?</p>
<p>Services from Facebook to Firefox are looking to emerging markets for the next few billion people. They are not only targeting the obvious high-population countries such as India and China, but also see potential in Latin America, Africa and just about everywhere beyond the U.S., Canada, western Europe and a few Asian nations.</p>
<p>One message has been clear this week at the Mobile World Congress wireless show in Barcelona, Spain: Even as the affluent crave the latest iPhones or Android phones, most of the world can&#8217;t afford the hundreds of dollars they cost.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s been a push to get mobile devices cheap enough to reach emerging markets without sacrificing so much performance that first-time smartphone owners will give up on the Internet and forgo a second smartphone down the road.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a delicate balance.</p>
<p>When Motorola Mobility introduced the low-cost Moto G smartphone last fall, the company emphasized how it was bringing the features of high-end smartphones to a device that starts at just $179. Even then, it had to sacrifice camera resolution and connectivity to the faster 4G LTE cellular networks. And $179 is still expensive for many.</p>
<p>At the Barcelona show this week, Nokia Corp. unveiled the Nokia X series, starting at 89 euros ($122).</p>
<p>&#8220;In the growth market &#8230; a couple of bucks make a huge difference,&#8221; said Timo Toikkanen, Nokia&#8217;s executive vice president for mobile phones.</p>
<p>Still too expensive? Try some of the $50 to $70 smartphones based on Firefox OS, a system adapted from the popular Firefox Web browser. Mozilla, the organization behind Firefox, announced a partnership with Chinese chipmaker Spreadtrum Communications Inc. to create a blueprint for any phone maker to make $25 smartphones.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp., meanwhile, said it was relaxing hardware requirements to keep phone costs down. For instance, phones no longer need physical camera and control buttons. Those can now be done through software instead.</p>
<p>It is also working with Qualcomm Inc. on blueprints for any phone maker to quickly design a Windows phone. While global brands such as Apple and Samsung reign in industrialized countries, smaller, regional manufacturers thrive in emerging markets because of lower distribution costs and better tailoring to local needs.</p>
<p>Internet services also see opportunities in finding the next few billions in emerging markets.</p>
<p>In fact, getting the smartphone and the connectivity is just the beginning, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during Monday&#8217;s keynote. More important, he said, is giving people a reason to connect: basic financial services, access to health care information and educational materials. He sees Facebook as the &#8220;on ramp&#8221; to all those services.</p>
<p>In many ways, emerging markets provide unmatched opportunities.</p>
<p>Apple has insisted on making premium smartphones. Even last fall&#8217;s iPhone 5c was just $100 cheaper, at $549, than the more-advanced iPhone 5s. That&#8217;s way beyond the reach of many people in poorer countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are focusing on the premium segment,&#8221; Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing told The Associated Press. &#8220;Their market has become mature, saturated. So now, if you want to further grow, you must focus on those emerging markets, particular those poor people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Lenovo releases 40 or 50 smartphones a year to meet the diversity of needs in those markets.</p>
<p>Making cheap phones available will help companies expand in developed countries, too. Even in the U.S., not everyone wants or can afford a high-end smartphone, Sony Mobile President Kunimasa Suzuki said in an interview.</p>
<p>But emerging markets also pose challenges unfamiliar in the industrialized world.</p>
<p>The easy one to solve is to support two SIM cards in the same phone. Pricing and plans vary so much in emerging markets that it&#8217;s common for people to use different carriers for different circumstances. The Moto G, the Nokia X and Sony&#8217;s new Xperia M2 phone support that, and Microsoft will enable that in Windows Phone this spring.</p>
<p>More challenging is dealing with expensive data connections, something Zuckerberg posed as a bigger barrier than smartphone affordability.</p>
<p>Chris Weasler, whose role at Facebook is to improve access to Internet services around the world, said he has met many smartphone owners who forgo data services and use the devices instead as mobile computers and cameras.</p>
<p>Local wireless carriers will need to better educate their customers on the value of connectivity, he said, while app developers need to tweak their services to work on slower, less reliable networks. He said Facebook learned that when a team went to Africa and couldn&#8217;t use Facebook&#8217;s Android app because it pulled too much data.</p>
<p>Firefox phones have FM radio tuners built in so owners won&#8217;t waste data connection on streaming services, while another emerging system, Ubuntu, tries to make sure it has apps that work well offline.</p>
<p>To address the lack of credit cards in emerging markets, Nokia replaced Android&#8217;s card-based app store with one that permits billing directly to mobile operators.</p>
<p>Ultimately, companies need to figure out what to sacrifice to bring costs down. Forget high-resolution video or a giant screen, such as the 5.1-inch display on the Samsung Galaxy S5 that was announced Monday. Not only are those features expensive, they require faster processors and longer battery life, adding to expenses.</p>
<p>Cellular connectivity through 4G is also something often dropped, as many emerging markets are lucky just to have the slower 3G.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s good enough? Leo Li, CEO of Spreadtrum, said phones using his company&#8217;s blueprints work as good as Apple&#8217;s iPhone 4. But that&#8217;s a 4-year-old phone. Nonetheless, he said performance is better than the basic phones that first-timers are upgrading from.</p>
<p>By upgrading, people can truly access the Web and aren&#8217;t limited to the few services that phone makers already included.</p>
<p>&#8220;To spend a little more for a true Web experience is pretty good, even if the resolution isn&#8217;t as good as the iPhone,&#8221; said Jay Sullivan, Mozilla&#8217;s chief operating officer. &#8220;People want to be connected. They want to be online and have access to all the information and all the things we do, like maps, as they explore new places.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/watching-tv-wide.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1993061" alt="Watching-tv-wide" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/watching-tv-wide.jpg" /></a> ‘Fin’ is a smart ring that can turn one’s palm into a gesture interface to control multiple devices
<p>A 23-year-old CEO of a start-up firm in Kochi would be one of the speakers at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain.<br />
Rohildev N is the founder of robotics startup RHL Vision Technologies, one of the firms incubated at Kochi-based Startup Village, the technology incubator promoted by government and private players.</p>
<p>RHL Vision’s product ‘Fin’, a smart ring that can turn one’s palm into a gesture interface to control multiple devices, has already evoked keen interest in the industry.</p>
<p>Fin is a Bluetooth-enabled ring that could be worn on fingers, converting the whole palm into a numeric keypad or gesture interface to interact with appliances such as TV. The gadget would have three in-built sensors beaming signals into a TV loaded with the software developed by RHL Vision.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='475' height='267' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Gx3zWHS8amA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>The prototype of the produce has shown around 100 metre range between it and an appliance. Instead of using a remote control, a TV could be operated using ‘fin’, which is yet to reach the market. The company has also started a campaign to take the product into market and to find investors.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rohil.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993062" alt="rohil" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rohil.jpg?w=259&#038;h=191" width="259" height="191" /></a></p>
<p>As many as 4,300 CEOs would attend the Mobile Congress. Rohildev would speak on ‘emerging markets and next wave of digital entrepreneurs’ at the conference village on February 27. The official website of the Mobile Congress has given a brief sketch about Rohildev, who will be the youngest speaker at the conference.</p>
<p>“It’s a big moment for the Team RHL Vision. I hope that the invitation to address the world-class event is also in recognition of the tremendous interest that Fin could generate in the global startup scenario,” said Rohildev.</p>
<p>RHL was one of the top 15 companies at the TechCrunch CES Hardware Battlefield in Las Vegas and the only Indian startup to be selected for the Pioneers Festival, a prominent startup festival in Austria. It was also the second runner-up at the Microsoft BizSpark India StartUp Challenge 2013.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993010&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the first time, scientists have detected water vapour in the atmosphere of a Jupiter-like planet orbiting a nearby star using a novel technique. The new technique could help researchers learn about how many planets with water &#8211; like Earth &#8211; exist within our galaxy, researchers said.</p>
<p>Researchers at The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and several other institutions analysed the gaseous atmospheres of such extrasolar planets and have made the first detection of water in the atmosphere of the Jupiter-mass planet orbiting tau Bootis star. Scientists have previously detected water vapour on a handful of other planets, but these detections could only take place under very specific circumstances, said Alexandra Lockwood, the first author of the study that was published in The Astrophysical Journal.</p>
<p>Lockwood and her adviser Geoffrey Blake applied a novel technique for finding water in a planetary atmosphere. Other researchers had used similar approaches previously to detect carbon monoxide in tau Bootis b. The method utilised the radial velocity (RV) technique &#8211; a technique commonly used in the visible region of the spectrum to which our eyes are sensitive &#8211; for discovering non-transiting exoplanets.</p>
<p>Using the Doppler effect, RV detection traditionally determines the motion of a star due to the gravitational pull of a companion planet; the star moves opposite that of the orbital motion of the planet, and the stellar features shift in wavelength. A large planet or a planet closer to its host star provides a larger shift.</p>
<p>Lockwood, Blake, and their colleagues expanded the RV technique into the infrared to determine the orbit of tau Bootis b around its star, and added further analysis of the light shifts via spectroscopy &#8211; an analysis of the light&#8217;s spectrum. Since every compound emits a different wavelength of light, this unique light signature allows the researchers to analyse molecules that make up the planet&#8217;s atmosphere. Using data of tau Bootis b from the Near Infrared Echelle Spectrograph (NIRSPEC) at the W M Keck Observatory in Hawaii, researchers were able to compare the molecular signature of water to the light spectrum emitted by the planet, confirming that the atmosphere did indeed include water vapour.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992935&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">With just 28 working days left for the end of support for Windows XP, Microsoft on Tuesday raised the alarm bells saying 16 per cent of large enterprises were still stuck on the old operating system. April 8 is the last day of support for what is arguably Microsoft’s most popular operating system, first released to manufacturing in August 2001.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Microsoft India Managing Director Karan Bajwa called it an alarming situation as 35 per cent of banking and financial services institutions and a similar number of state institutions were still on Windows XP. “Usually companies give about five years of support for a tech product. We generally give five plus five. But Windows XP has already got over 12 years of support,” he said, adding that it was the most supported product ever.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As Microsoft started migrating users to Windows 7 since it was launched in  2009, over 84 per cent of the 4 million-odd PCs in large enterprises have switched off the old OS. “We have seen a spike in migration in the last 18 months during which about 25 per cent of users made the switch over,” added Amrish Goyal, General Manager &#8211; Windows Business Group, Microsoft India. Of those left to switch, are 17 per cent users in manufacturing and 16 per cent in the communication industries.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the risks of continuing with XP, Bajwa said that companies will be exposed to vulnerabilities as well as huge costs for maintenance and support. “The estimated maintenance cost after XP is retired will be as high as $300 per year,” he said. These devices have six times more chance of getting infected now, he added. Goyal said that while Microsoft will provide virus support for a year, they will not be releasing patches for the vulnerabilities these viruses are trying to exploit. For the record, there have been 30 security bulletins released for Windows OS in the last year alone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Goyal added that staying with XP would mean that the companies, especially the banks won’t be future-ready and won’t be able to use many new technologies like biometrics. However, he clarified that there are no companies that are completely on XP and have a mix of Windows operating systems. Incidentally, Bajwa said that a third of the remaining companies will not have to even pay for the upgrade as they already have devices that shipped with Windows 7 or 8 but were downgraded to make them compatible with the rest of the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Goyal told the Financial Express that while the remaining companies might not be able to switch over completely by April 8, they could at least have a plan in place. Bajwa added: “The costs of staying on could be huge. Our studies have shown that a single bank could have business loss of Rs 1,100 crore per day if something goes wrong… Move to XP, whatever it takes.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992899&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg is known for his long-term vision for Facebook —and for bringing the Internet to billons of people around the world who are unconnected.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old CEO of Facebook Inc. touched on both of those missions, in an on-stage interview at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain on Monday.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg said his company&#8217;s $19 billion acquisition of mobile messaging service WhatsApp will allow the startup to focus on growing its user base — and not on making money — over the next five years. With 465 million monthly members, Zuckerberg believes WhatsApp is on track to reach a billion users.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg spent most of his time discussing Internet.org, the ambitious project by Facebook and a slew of partners that aims to get everyone in the world online.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992573&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/whatsapp2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992570" alt="Co-founder and CEO of Whatsapp Jan Koum speaks during a conference at the Mobile World Congress, the world's largest mobile phone trade show in Barcelona.

<p>WhatsApp, the popular messaging service for smartphones that&#8217;s being acquired by Facebook, will soon be offering a voice service.</p>
<p>CEO Jan Koum said the voice service will be deployed for Android and iPhones this spring, with Blackberry and Microsoft and Nokia phones coming later.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to introduce voice in WhatsApp in the second quarter of this year,&#8221; Koum said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. &#8220;I think we have the best voice product out there. We use the least amount of bandwidth.&#8221;</p>
<p>WhatsApp currently has a voice function but only in note form. This new service will be live.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Facebook agreed to buy WhatsApp for $19 billion in a deal that is by far the biggest by the social networking company and any other done by Google, Microsoft or Apple.</p>
<p>Wearing a gray shirt, jeans and a black jacket, the 38-year-old Koum quipped &#8211; &#8220;last week we added a new Facebook friend. I don&#8217;t know if you guys heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blockbuster deal made serious waves with those in the telecommunications industry who gathered this week in the Catalan city, but also sparked concern among users that Facebook would introduce advertising to WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Koum insisted that there are no designs to add &#8220;marketing&#8221; to the messaging service.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no planned changes,&#8221; said Koum. &#8220;Our vision and mission are aligned. We both want to make the world more connected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook is paying $12 billion in stock and $4 billion in cash for WhatsApp. Koum along with fellow founder Brian Acton and their 55 employees were also granted restricted stock worth $3 billion that will vest over four years after the deal closes.</p>
<p>Koum said that he didn&#8217;t expect that WhatsApp&#8217;s staff would grow in number very much, saying that &#8220;we want to operate as a startup.&#8221;</p>
<p>Relatively unknown until now in the U.S., WhatsApp is popular in other countries, both in Europe and in emerging economies. The Mountain View, California, startup already has almost twice as many users as the better known short messaging service, Twitter.</p>
<p>WhatsApp has 465 million monthly users and 330 daily users, according to Koum. It is ad-free and costs users 99 cents a year after a first free year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992569&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/glam_galaxy-s5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992564" alt="The Samsung Galaxy will be available from April. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/glam_galaxy-s5.jpg" /></a> The Samsung Galaxy will be available from April.
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S5 is here. The fifth edition of what has been one of the most popular Android devices, carries the same design language forward with minor tweaks. Samsung seems to have decided that it was better to offer the consumers something they identified with instead of offering gimmicky features that might get the eyeballs, but won&#8217;t be all that functional.</p>
<p>The phone will be available from April.</p>
<p><strong>DESIGN:</strong> The Galaxy S5 features a perforated pattern on the bac and will come in charcoal black, shimmery white, electric blue and copper gold, to complement the style of the individual consumer. The Galaxy S5 is IP67 dust and water resistant. But it still looks the same.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sm-g900f.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1992565" alt="SM-G900F" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sm-g900f.jpg?w=475&#038;h=559" width="475" height="559" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>CAMERA:</strong> The biggest upgrade seems to be in the camera, as the Galaxy S5 offers the world’s fastest autofocus speed of 0.3 seconds coupled with advanced High Dynamic Range (HDR). Users can also use selective focus to focus on a specific area of an object while blurring out the background.</p>
<p><strong>CONNECTIVITY:</strong> The Galaxy S5 promises the best LTE and Wi-Fi experience and supports the fifth generation Wi-Fi 802.11ac and 2X2 MIMO, and supporting the large number of LTE frequency with LTE Category 4 standard. Plus, there is the Download Booster Wi-Fi technology for boosting data speed by bonding Wi-Fi and LTE simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>APPS:</strong> The device will feature enhanced S Health 3.0, a comprehensive personal fitness tracker to help users monitor and manage their behavior, along with additional tools including a pedometer, diet and exercise records, and a new, built-in heart rate monitor. It will also pair seamlessly with the next generation Gear products for real-time fitness coaching.</p>
<p><strong>BIOMETRIC:</strong> The S5 will offer a finger scanner in the Home button, providing a secure, biometric screen locking feature and a seamless and safe mobile payment experience to consumers. Apple&#8217;s scanner does not do this at the moment.</p>

</script>
<p>It remains to be seen if these features are enough to satisfy Samsung&#8217;s customers. Incidentally, the S4 was not as popular as the earlier versions of the flagship phone.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992563&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have created an application that monitors how much of Wikipedia entries are being created or edited by Internet bots, versus humans.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is a global crowdsourced encyclopedia and some of the information appearing on it is put there by bots &#8212; software applications that run automated tasks over the Internet &#8212; rather than human beings.</p>
<p>To keep entries coming and to keep them updated, bots have been created to grab information from one place and post them into another.</p>
<p>It is not easy to determine what portion of Wiki pages are generated by humans versus bots.</p>
<p>So Thomas Steiner, a Customer Solutions Engineer at Google Germany, Hamburg and colleagues have created an application that can be accessed and used by anyone to see in real time what percentage of pages are being written by humans, versus bots.</p>
<p>The application reveals that bots are doing a lot more of the work adding information to pages in non-English speaking countries, which suggests that the majority of Wikipedia content is still being created by human beings in the US and the UK, &#8216;phys.org&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The application also monitors activity on Wikidata, a database to share data among the difference language versions of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have developed an application and an underlying Application Programming Interface (API) capable of monitoring realtime edit activity of all language versions of Wikipedia and Wikidata,&#8221; researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This application allows us to easily analyse edits in order to answer questions such as &#8216;Bots vs Wikipedians, who edits more?&#8217;, &#8216;Which is the most anonymously edited Wikipedia?&#8217;, or &#8216;Who are the bots and what do they edit?&#8217; they said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992223&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/earth-480.jpg" /></a> The study confirms that zircon crystals from Western Australia&#8217;s Jack Hills region crystallised 4.4 billion years ago. (Reuters)
<p>Earth&#8217;s crust was first formed at least 4.4 billion years ago, just 160 million years after the formation of our solar system, a new study in the journal Nature Geoscience has found. A time-line of the history of our planet places the formation of the Jack Hills zircon and a &#8220;cool early Earth&#8221; at 4.4 billion years, researchers said. With the help of a tiny fragment of zircon extracted from a remote rock outcrop in Australia, the picture of how our planet became habitable to life is coming into sharper focus.</p>
<p>An international team of researchers led by University of Wisconsin-Madison geoscience Professor John Valley reveals data that confirm the Earth&#8217;s crust first formed at least 4.4 billion years ago, just 160 million years after the formation of our solar system. The work shows that the time when our planet was a fiery ball covered in a magma ocean came earlier. &#8220;This confirms our view of how the Earth cooled and became habitable. This may also help us understand how other habitable planets would form,&#8221; said Valley.</p>
<p>The study confirms that zircon crystals from Western Australia&#8217;s Jack Hills region crystallised 4.4 billion years ago, building on earlier studies that used lead isotopes to date the Australian zircons and identify them as the oldest bits of the Earth&#8217;s crust. The microscopic zircon crystal used by Valley and his group is now confirmed to be the oldest known material of any kind formed on Earth.</p>
<p>The study, according to Valley, strengthens the theory of a &#8220;cool early Earth,&#8221; where temperatures were low enough for liquid water, oceans and a hydrosphere not long after the planet&#8217;s crust congealed from a sea of molten rock. &#8220;The study reinforces our conclusion that Earth had a hydrosphere before 4.3 billion years ago,&#8221; and possibly life not long after, said Valley.</p>
<p>The study was conducted using a new technique called atom-probe tomography that, in conjunction with secondary ion mass spectrometry, permitted scientists to accurately establish the age and thermal history of the zircon by determining mass of individual atoms of lead in the sample. The clusters of lead atoms formed 1 billion years after crystallisation of the zircon, by which time the radioactive decay of uranium had formed the lead atoms that then diffused into clusters during reheating. &#8220;The zircon formed 4.4 billion years ago, and at 3.4 billion years, all the lead that existed at that time was concentrated in these hotspots,&#8221; Valley said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992091&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/x-body.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992052" alt="X-body" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/x-body.jpg" /></a> The Nokia XL is a five-inch phone.
<p>They look like the Nokia Asha devices, but are larger and more powerful. This is the new Nokia X family range of handsets launched at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday. But the biggest feature of these affordable devices won&#8217;t be their size, but their ability to run Android apps. Now, that is big, coming from a company that is now owned by Microsoft.</p>
<p>The new phones will run the Nokia X software platform based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). However, the UI will look more like Windows Phone than stock Android.</p>
<p>The Nokia X, X+ and XL are priced between the existing Asha and Lumia lines, at €89, €99 and €109 respectively, and will appeal to the budget users who can afford a bit more than the Asha and are willing to pay for it. The Nokia X will be available in India and a bunch of countries soon, while the other two models are expected in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/x-pile-body.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992054" alt="The Nokia X will be available in India soon" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/x-pile-body.jpg" /></a> The Nokia X will be available in India soon
<p>The X and X+ both have 4-inch screens, while the XL, as the name implies, will have a larger 5-inch screen. All three will carry forward the bright colour language that sets apart all Nokia devices now. They will also have a tile-based home screen like in Windows Phones. They will also bring back a redesigned version of the Fastlane notifications centre, the second home screen that is very popular in the latest Asha devices.</p>

<p>On the software side, the devices will have a HERE Maps with turn-by-turn navigation, Nokia MixRadio for free streaming music, 7GB free cloud storage on Microsoft OneDrive and Skype. Nokia has also tied up with Viber to provide the latest version of the app on these devices.<br />
All three devices are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon Dual Core processors and are Dual SIM. A range of third-party apps comes preinstalled, including BBM, Plants vs. Zombies 2, Viber, Vine and Twitter.</p>
<p>Dippak Khurana, CEO and Co-Founder, Vserv.mobi said the move &#8220;kills more than two birds with one stone&#8221;. &#8220;On one hand, its Android strategy will enable reaching out to specifically lower-end users and capitalise on Android’s robust app kingdom. It will also get Nokia closer to the app developer ecosystem, which could be leveraged for Windows as well. This in turn, will provide a jump-start to the in-app purchasing ecosystem where operator billing is key for purchases of scale,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>While there are thousands of apps on Google Play, it is not as monetised as Apple&#8217;s iOS or even BlackBerry World. This is where Nokia&#8217;s operator billing might help Android developers actually make some money.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992048&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/tizen480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991977" alt="Tizen OS" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/tizen480.jpg" /></a> Instead, attention is shifting to winning a share of a potentially bigger pie: the software that runs your car, camera, fridge, smartwatch or TV.
<p>You may have heard of the operating system Tizen (you may even know how to pronounce it: tie-zen, not tee-zen or tiz-zen). But the chances of it running your smartphone are slim, about the same as having had one of its predecessors or rivals: Maemo, Moblin, MeeGo, Bada, Ubuntu, Sailfish or Firefox.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not for want of trying. Every Mobile World Congress in the past four years has featured an announcement about one of these operating systems (OS). This year is no different, as handset makers, carriers and chipmakers try to break the stranglehold that Google Inc and Apple Inc have on the software that runs the world&#8217;s mobile phones.</p>
<p>But for many this war, at least for now, is already lost.</p>
<p>Instead, attention is shifting to winning a share of a potentially bigger pie: the software that runs your car, camera, fridge, smartwatch or TV. The thinking here is that if web-based operating systems like Firefox or Tizen can gain a foothold in those internet-connected devices, they could then gain broader acceptance among users and app developers on mobile, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Firefox OS can succeed in the TV market, it will mean that many developers contribute either content or apps,&#8221; says William Liang, Taiwan-based senior director at contract manufacturer Foxconn, which works closely with developers of the Firefox Mobile OS. &#8220;Then probably the mobile market will also accept a web-based OS.&#8221; Liang stressed he was speaking in a personal capacity.</p>
<p>The scale of the challenge of taking on the existing mobile duopoly is daunting.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s Android and Apple&#8217;s iOS operating systems account for more than 95 percent of smartphone sales worldwide last year, according to Strategy Analytics, up from about 88 percent in 2012. Strip away Microsoft Corp&#8217;s paltry slither, and other OS&#8217; share of the pie fell to 2 percent last year from 9 percent. In October-December, it fell to below 1 percent.</p>
<p>A paper released by the mobile industry&#8217;s GSM Association ahead of this week&#8217;s congress in Barcelona noted that at least 36 telecoms operators had pledged support for one of the four open source challengers &#8211; Firefox, Ubuntu, Tizen and Sailfish.</p>
<p>But the GSMA said that if anyone is to make a dent it needs to win at least 5 percent market share within the next year or so &#8220;to have a chance of being a long-term competitor.&#8221;</p>
<p>EMERGING MARKETS</p>
<p>This has prompted a race into places where smartphones are still a relative luxury &#8211; emerging markets, which will collectively add 130 million new subscribers each year until 2018, according to the GSMA.</p>
<p>Leading the charge at Barcelona is Mozilla Corp, best known for its open source Firefox browser, and whose Firefox mobile OS is already on three devices sold by four operators in more than a dozen markets. China&#8217;s ZTE, for example, was encouraged enough to launch two more devices running Firefox this year. Firefox accounted for less than 1 percent of the 42 million phones ZTE shipped last year, according to a company executive, but he said that over the next three years up to a fifth of ZTE smartphones would run on operating systems other than Android or iOS. Alcatel has announced three new handsets running Firefox, while Huawei Technologies has announced its first Firefox phone.</p>
<p>Firefox may be first out of the door, but it&#8217;s still a drop in the ocean of smartphones sold &#8211; up to 750,000, according to interim chief operating officer Jay Sullivan. Gartner expects nearly 1 billion Android handsets to be shipped this year.</p>
<p>Reducing the price of components is key. Firefox&#8217;s OS takes up half the space Android does in a phone&#8217;s memory, said Firefox&#8217;s mobile chief Li Gong, reducing one of the device&#8217;s three biggest costs.</p>
<p>Chipmaker Spreadtrum Communications on Sunday announced a chipset and reference design using the Firefox OS making it possible for manufacturers to sell smartphones for as little as $25 retail. &#8220;This is an important start,&#8221; said Diana Jovin, a vice president at Spreadtrum.</p>
<p>THE INTERNET OF THINGS</p>
<p>But many remain skeptical that these initiatives can dent Google and Apple&#8217;s dominance. Smartphone prices have been falling anyway and will fall further. Prices for entry-level smartphones running Android in India, for example, halved last year and could drop to $30 this year.</p>
<p>And, while carriers are one of the main supporters of alternative operating systems, they don&#8217;t have much sway in markets where most handsets are bought from retailers. &#8220;Launching to retail is like a flood,&#8221; acknowledged Mozilla&#8217;s Li, who said the company was focusing on this market this year. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know where the water will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>More promising, some say, is the opportunity presented by the profusion of devices connecting to the internet &#8211; the so-called Internet of Things &#8211; and wearable devices. All require an operating system to work, and an interface for display.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wearables and other connected devices other than phones or tablets are still up for grabs,&#8221; said Jordan Edelson, CEO of Appetizer Mobile, an app developer and consultancy.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, for example, has yet to launch a phone running Tizen, the OS it has championed since 2011, but the South Korean group has released a Tizen camera, and on Sunday said the second version of its smartwatch, the Samsung Gear, would abandon Android in favour of Tizen.</p>
<p>Intel Corp, Samsung&#8217;s co-creator of Tizen, also stresses the operating system is as much about other devices as mobile. &#8220;We do see some landscape changes, in devices in general, not specific to mobile,&#8221; says Imad Sousou, general manager of Intel&#8217;s Open Source Technology Centre. &#8220;And what we see is a huge growth coming in all sorts of devices, the Internet of Things and consumer electronics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Firefox, too, is looking as much to devices beyond the mobile phone. Panasonic Corp earlier this year unveiled a TV running Firefox. Mozilla&#8217;s Li points out that the Japanese firm is the world&#8217;s largest maker of infotainment systems for cars. &#8220;That&#8217;s where things are headed,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>All such operating systems leverage a new generation of web technologies, including HTML5, which in theory make them more open than the standalone apps favoured by Android and iOS.</p>
<p>This also means, in theory, that these devices would not be hidebound by a shortage of developers and apps &#8211; the chicken-and-egg problem that has bedevilled Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone and BlackBerry&#8217;s new BBOS operating systems.</p>
<p>Browser developer Opera Software ASA, for example, is working with TV manufacturers and chipmakers to build a sort of app store for TV content, where publishers could design HTML5-based apps that should work on other devices. Opera already counts Samsung, Sony Corp and TCL Corp among its customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to try to compete on the OS,&#8221; says Aneesh Rajaram, senior vice president for TV and Devices at Opera. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be the friends of the publishers, carriers and content providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>GETTING SMART</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced. For one thing, there are a lot fewer smart TVs in the world than mobile phones, so the latter are likely to influence the former.</p>
<p>Sales of smart TVs are in the low hundreds of millions, says Richard Lim of GSR Ventures, which invested in a mobile OS that was later bought by Baidu Inc. &#8220;This will never translate to phones with unit volumes in the billions, so it&#8217;s more likely to go the other way around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, the big players have also made moves into smart devices. Google and Apple have each focused on devices that plug into existing TVs and act as sort of set-top boxes, channeling content through their own services. Apple, Microsoft and Google have launched initiatives to put their respective operating systems into cars.</p>
<p>But for the likes of Samsung, the strategy makes sense, some say. By launching first with devices like cameras and TVs, it allows the company to hone the operating system and &#8220;try to make people comfortable with a new OS,&#8221; said Katyayan Gupta, India-based analyst at Forrester.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slowly Samsung will give people a flavour through consumer electronics and then later into phones.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991972&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Facebook Inc  Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will take a victory lap at the world&#8217;s largest mobile technology conference in Barcelona on Monday, after beating out Google Inc in a $19 billion acquisition of free messaging service WhatsApp. But he is facing a new arduous race on the horizon.</p>
<p>Just 18 months after appearing at risk of getting crushed by the swelling mobile wave, the No. 1 social network is riding high. It gets a huge chunk of ad revenue on world-wide users of  smartphones and tablets, from virtually nothing several years ago.</p>
<p>Now, Zuckerberg&#8217;s purchase of WhatsApp -  while raising eyebrows with the hefty price paid for a company that boasts 450 million users but has little revenue &#8211; places Facebook at the heart of smartphone communications.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a twist that is sure to have some telecom bosses in Barcelona gritting their teeth. WhatsApp and its fellow messaging apps, including China&#8217;s WeChat and Israel&#8217;s Viber, have punched a hole in operators&#8217; sales by offering a free alternative to text messages, a $120 billion market for operators. Research group Ovum said telcos lost $32 billion in text revenue last year and will lose $54 billion by 2016.<br />
Zuckerberg and WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum are likely to cast themselves as partners not foes of the industry in their appearances at Mobile World Congress on Monday.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg&#8217;s keynote at 17:00 GMT is expected to focus on Facebook&#8217;s efforts to make wireless Internet access easier and more affordable in developing countries.</p>
<p><strong>SURPRISE DEAL</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Facebook&#8217;s purchase of WhatsApp is its latest move to transform a platform and company born on the PC into a full-fledged network for a mobile generation. Zuckerberg&#8217;s progress so far on mobile has positioned the company to take advantage of the fast-growing markets. And it has helped boost Facebook&#8217;s stock roughly 150 percent since July.</p>
<p>But with a new crop of smartphone applications threatening to eat into Facebook&#8217;s audience, worrying signs of waning interest amongst younger users &#8211; which the WhatsApp acquisition may help address &#8211; and a tech landscape evolving more rapidly than ever before, Facebook can&#8217;t afford to fall behind again.</p>
<p>That is critical for Facebook as it courts the &#8220;next 5 billion&#8221; Internet users, many of whom live in places like India and Africa and who are likely to first experience the Internet on a mobile rather than a PC.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Facebook is not first in line when those people are firing up their devices, it stands a chance of never connecting with those folks, because there are so many alternatives,&#8221; said Brian Blau, an analyst at research firm Gartner.</p>
<p><strong>NO SURE THING</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>To some, Google wields the advantage for now.</p>
<p>Its Android mobile operating system comes pre-installed on roughly 80 percent of the smartphones sold in the world today. That helps ensure new users will see and use its various online services, including search, maps and its Google+ social network.</p>
<p>Once WhatsApp is in Facebook&#8217;s pocket, there&#8217;s no guarantee the messaging service &#8211; which famously eschews games, shopping or other popular add-ons to focus on pure messaging &#8211; can remain ahead in a notriously fickle market.</p>
<p>Rival messaging apps such as Tencent Holding&#8217;s  WeChat and Naver&#8217;s LINE are popular across Asia and have hundreds of millions of users. They have also expanded to allow users to book taxis, top up phone credit, and take part in flash sales, all on the app.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, which Zuckerberg has promised will remain independent, fits Facebook&#8217;s recent approach of designing or buying &#8220;spinoff&#8221; apps for smartphones, such as Instagram or the Paper news app, which has earned positive reviews.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see Facebook trying to increase its surface area, with different apps for different things,&#8221; said Josh Elman, a venture capital firm Greylock Partners. The idea is to give users multiple ways to interact with Facebook throughout the day.</p>
<p>To meet his ambitions, Zuckerberg could use the telecom industry&#8217;s help. He will make his case to the handset makers and operators gathered in Barcelona that they should work together to make Internet access cheaper and more ubiquitous in the developing world.<br />
Facebook has partnered with over 150 wireless providers over the past four years to offer free or discounted access to the social network, including a deal with Globe Telecom to provide three months of free access to customers in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Not everyone is on board.</p>
<p>Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao said earlier this month that Facebook had approached him about waiving data charges when customers access the website from their mobiles. But Colao rejected the idea because he didn&#8217;t see any benefit for his company, which is Europe&#8217;s largest wireless carrier and also operates in India and across Africa.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991912&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/club-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991902" alt="We tries two cases from Cygnett and two from Switcheasy " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/club-480.jpg" /></a> We tried two cases from Cygnett and two from Switcheasy
<p>Apple iPhone 5S is one of the most elegant phones in the market. But is metal body gets scratched easily, making it look a lot less appealing, and like any other phone, the iPhone 5S is also prone to damage after a fall. That is why investing in a case is necessary. We&#8217;ve used four cases for around three weeks each on an iPhone 5S, here&#8217;s how they fared.</p>
<p><strong>Switcheasy Tones</strong></p>
<p><em>$25 (~Rs 1,600, shipping extra)</em></p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/switcheasy-tones-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991903" alt="This cover picks up dirt easily. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/switcheasy-tones-480.jpg" /></a> This cover picks up dirt easily.
<p>Switcheasy is a popular mobile accessories brand in the US. Tones is among Switcheasy&#8217;s best iPhone cases. Switcheasy ships to India for $10 (~Rs 650), and you&#8217;ll get cases within two weeks of ordering. Tones is available in several colours, but all the light coloured variants get dirty really soon. We had a turquoise and a black case for review. The edges of the turquoise case got dirty within two days. The black case didn&#8217;t get dirty.</p>
<p>Tones is made of two materials. The back cover is hard, while the edges are made of soft plastic. The case fits well and has excellent build quality except for the empty space for the volume button, which looks like it will break under duress. Tones has some “lip” room too, which means that your iPhone&#8217;s screen won&#8217;t touch the surface if you place it face down. Tones seals the volume buttons and the ports at the bottom. Note that the black variant came with the flaps attached to the case, while the turquoise one had them as separate components. The seal protects the phone from dust and you will lose the tiny flaps if they aren&#8217;t attached to the case itself. Check this with Switcheasy if you plan to buy the case.</p>
<p>Some user reviews on Amazon.com say the case tends to break easily too. Tones isn&#8217;t easy to remove, so if you need to remove your iPhone case frequently, this isn&#8217;t a great option. That may be a reason behind the issues faced by those users.</p>
<p>I accidentally dropped my iPhone 5S a few times while reviewing the case. It rolled on the edges and even fell screen downwards once. The case protected the phone very well and it is the reason why my iPhone is unscathed. It&#8217;s a great purchase as long as you pick a dark colour.</p>
<p><strong>Switcheasy Numbers</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>$15 (~Rs 1,000, shipping extra)</em></p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/switcheasy-numbers-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991905" alt="The edges are dirty" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/switcheasy-numbers-480.jpg" /></a> The edges are dirty
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about breaking Tones, then Switcheasy Numbers is a good alternative. It&#8217;s made of a soft, rubberised material that will not break. We reviewed a blue Numbers case and, like Tones, it got dirty soon. Washing the case doesn&#8217;t help much, so you will have to live with an ugly case if you pick a light colour. While we didn&#8217;t review the black Numbers case, it isn&#8217;t likely to get dirty going by our experience with Tones.</p>
<p>Apart from that, Numbers is a great case. It didn&#8217;t fit as well as the Tones, but that is a minor inconvenience. It protected the iPhone just as well as Tones. Numbers also has the same flaps to seal the ports and a gap for the ringer/silent button. It covers the volume buttons, but we had no trouble using those buttons with the case on.</p>
<p>Overall, Numbers offers better value for money than Tones. If you&#8217;re not finicky about looks (Tones is better-looking), get Switcheasy Numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Cygnett Alternate</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><em>Rs 2,499</em></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cygnett-alternate-480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1991907" alt="Cygnett Alternate-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cygnett-alternate-480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>Do you frequently buy new cases for your iPhone? Cygnett has tried to ensure that you don&#8217;t get bored with your case by making the Alternate. This case has removable parts – top and bottom – in two colours. Each case comes with four removable parts in two colours, so you can swap them when you want a new look.</p>
<p>This case doesn&#8217;t seal ports, which doesn&#8217;t help if you live in a dusty area. Our review unit&#8217;s white part were made of plastic, while the blue had a rubber coating. After two weeks with the case, the blue part got dirty on the edges. The white part was surprisingly spotless.</p>
<p>Alternate doesn&#8217;t feel as good to hold as Switcheasy&#8217;s products, but it protects the iPhone just as well. A lot of people liked its looks and some even asked me if I had bought a new case when I swapped colours. If that appeals to you, Alternate is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Cygnett Workmate Utility</strong></p>
<p><em>Rs 3,599</em></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cygnett-workmate-480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1991908" alt="Cygnett-Workmate-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cygnett-workmate-480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>We picked this case for review because it is one of the few rugged iPhone 5S cases available in India. Workmate Utility is pretty serious about durability. The material is thick and it has a screen guard attached. It takes time to fit an iPhone in this case, but that&#8217;s just because it is a rugged case. The review unit we received had covered the home button too. This makes it impossible to access the fingerprint scanner on the iPhone 5S. However, Cygnett reached out to inform that a new variant of the case lets you access the home button. Make sure you check this before buying.</p>
<p>Cygnett says the Workmate Utility can protect your iPhone even when it falls from a height of five feet. We didn&#8217;t drop the phone from that height, but there were no marks on the iPhone after a two-feet fall. It also protects the iPhone from scratches and dust. If you want a rugged case, this is a great option.</p>
<p>That said, the Workmate Utility is bulky. It&#8217;s as slim as rugged cases get, but if you love your iPhone because it is sleek, this case is not for you. While this case is good for iPhone 5S, it hasn&#8217;t been optimised for iOS 7. The screen guard leaves very little room around the edges of the screen, which makes it difficult to execute gestures such as swipe up to access control center and swipe down to check notifications. If your use revolves around these gestures, it&#8217;s best to wait until Cygnett makes some revisions to the design.</p>

<p>Microsoft will update its Windows system this spring to address some of the gripes people have had when they use devices without touch capabilities.</p>
<p>Windows 8 and last fall&#8217;s 8.1 update were designed for a touch environment. But some of the gesture commands don&#8217;t translate well when using traditional mouse and keyboard controls.</p>
<p>Among other things, Microsoft Corp. will add search, power and settings buttons to the Start page, so that users don&#8217;t have to figure out how to pull those functions like a sock drawer from the right. There also will be easier, touch-free ways to close apps.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also updating its Windows Phone system this spring to work better in corporate environments and to bring features desired in fast-growing emerging markets.</p>
<p>The announcement came Sunday before the Mobile World Congress wireless show in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Many of the changes are geared at reducing manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>In essence, Microsoft is relaxing hardware requirements. For instance, there will be no longer a requirement that phones have a physical camera button and three control buttons on the front. That can be done through software instead, the approach used in many Android phones. Meanwhile, tablets and personal computers won&#8217;t need as much memory and storage as before.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also allowing phones to support two SIM cards, something in demand in China, India and other emerging markets where prices and plans vary so much that people switch services constantly for the best deals. For developed markets, Microsoft plans improvements for corporations, including VPN support on phones so people can access work networks securely.</p>
<p>More details on the phone changes are expected at Microsoft&#8217;s Build conference for software developers in April. Microsoft said nothing about pricing, although these updates have typically been free to download. The company also did not disclose the name of either Windows update.</p>
<p>Microsoft also announced the availability of a Facebook Messenger phone app in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Microsoft used Mobile World Congress two years ago to release a test version of its Windows 8 operating system, months before its October 2012 debut.</p>
<p>The system was a response to the growing popularity of smartphones and tablet computers, which have been siphoning sales from personal computers running Windows. Windows 8 emphasizes touch controls, just like mobile devices, and borrows much of its look and feel from Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone system for smartphones.</p>
<p>Many consumers, however, hate having that approach on PCs. Research firm IDC blamed Windows 8 for accelerating a decline in PCs &#8211; by 14 percent in the first three months of 2013, the first full quarter with Windows 8.</p>
<p>Just one year after the Windows 8 launch, Microsoft issued a free update to address some of the gripes. The system now lets people run more than two apps side by side, for instance, and its Internet Explorer browser lets people open more than 10 tabs without automatically closing older ones. Windows 8.1 also introduced new features, including a universal search to access files stored on the computer along with Web content on the Internet.</p>
<p>Joe Belfiore, Microsoft&#8217;s vice president of operating systems, said many of the gripes have come from people who use non-touch devices. Although 40 percent of Windows 8 devices sold in the U.S. are now touch-enabled, he said the new update will make it easier for the remaining, non-touch users.</p>
<p>He said the company stood by its decision to emphasize touch in Windows 8, notwithstanding the latest changes. He said 200 million Windows 8 licenses have been sold so far.</p>
<p>The announcement comes amid speculation that Nokia Corp., a long-time Windows Phone supporter, is planning a phone based on the rival Android system from Google Inc. Microsoft is also in the process of buying Nokia&#8217;s phone business and patent rights in a 5.4 billion euros ($7.3 billion) deal expected to be completed by the March 31.</p>
<p>Belfiore said Nokia is still an independent company, so &#8220;what they do as an independent company is what they do.&#8221; He said Microsoft has been happy with many things Nokia has done, and &#8220;some things we may be less excited about. Whatever they do, we are very supportive of the relationship (we have) with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nokia deal is part of Microsoft&#8217;s attempt to give Windows Phone a boost in a world dominated by Apple&#8217;s iPhones and devices running Google&#8217;s Android system. During Sunday&#8217;s presentation, audience members chuckled when Microsoft boasted that it had surpassed BlackBerry, a struggling operating system.</p>
<p>Microsoft also got a new CEO this month: Satya Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran who had been in charge of the company&#8217;s small but growing business of delivering software and services of the Internet. He replaced Steve Ballmer, who had struggled to steer Microsoft from PCs to mobile.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991814&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/samsung1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991538" alt="The new Gear 2 which was unveiled at the Mobile World Congress in Spain." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/samsung1.jpg" /></a> The new Gear 2 which was unveiled at the Mobile World Congress in Spain.
<p>Samsung unveiled two new computerized wristwatches on Sunday, this time including health sensors and related fitness features to give people a reason to buy one.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s first Galaxy Gear smartwatch came out last fall amid much fanfare, but it landed with a thud in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Samsung and its smartwatch rivals had failed to persuade many consumers that they need to be able to constantly check messages from their wrists. Wearable devices that succeeded tended to be fitness products such as the Fitbit.</p>
<p>The new Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo will have a heart rate sensor, a pedometer and various tools to measure exercise, sleep and stress levels. The low-resolution, 2-megapixel camera on the Gear 2 is being moved to the main body; it was on the strap on the original Gear. It&#8217;s not immediately clear if the Gear 2 Neo has a camera.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also unclear whether the new watches will continually display the time. In the original Gear, that was shut off to save battery, which lasted just a day. The new watches promise two or three days under normal use, putting them more in line with what rivals offer.</p>
<p>Samsung didn&#8217;t immediately reveal prices for the new watches, but said they would be available in April.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co. announced the new watches on Sunday, ahead of the Mobile World Congress wireless show in Barcelona, Spain. Samsung has a major event Monday evening, during which it is expected to announce a successor to its popular Galaxy S4 smartphone.</p>
<p>The company decided to make the latest smartwatches with a little-known operating system called Tizen OS, instead of the Android system from Google used in the original Gear, as the South Korean electronics company tries to break the dominance Google has on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The move gives some credence to a fledgling system that Samsung and other backers want to see on all sorts of devices, including televisions, refrigerators and cars. Samsung already has a Tizen camera out, but a Tizen phone has yet to emerge, despite expectations of one last year. For now, Samsung is putting Tizen on a smartwatch instead.</p>
<p>Although Google gives away Android for any manufacturer to use in its gadgets, it&#8217;s loaded with a range of Google services, including stores for apps, music and video. Samsung is trying to promote its own stores as well and ends up confusing users by including two of everything.</p>
<p>To prevent Google from having a similar dominance in wearable devices and other gadgets beyond phones and tablets, Samsung is pushing Tizen OS as an alternative.</p>
<p>But before Tizen can take off, Samsung needs the new Gear to be a success.</p>
<p>The original Gear worked with selected Samsung phones to display email and text alerts. It also had a camera on the strap for low-resolution photos and a speakerphone on the watch to make calls, Dick Tracy-style. The Gear&#8217;s 1.6-inch screen keeps the watch small enough _ at least for men _ to work as a fashion accessory. Straps came in six colors.</p>
<p>The device had many shortcomings, however.</p>
<p>Its $300 price tag was 50 percent higher than what Sony Corp. charges for its SmartWatch 2. And the Gear worked only with selected Samsung phones, while watches from Sony and Qualcomm Inc. work with a greater pool of Android devices from a variety of manufacturers.</p>
<p>In addition, app selection on the Gear was limited, while the apps that were available fell short on functionality. Although the Gear was supposed to offer quick access to information so you don&#8217;t have to constantly pull out your phone, many of the alerts simply tell you to return to the phone to read a new message.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991537&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lenovovibe.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991328" alt="The Vibe Z K910 is Lenovo's new flagship." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lenovovibe.jpg" /></a> The Vibe Z K910 is Lenovo&#8217;s new flagship.
<p>Lenovo is renowned for its fantastic laptops, but it&#8217;s slowly making a mark in the world of smartphones too. The Vibe Z K910 is its new flagship, packed with top-of-the-line hardware. But is it worth Rs. 36,000?</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 5.5-inch display (1920&#215;1080 pixels, 401 ppi) | 2.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor | 2GB RAM | 16GB storage + no microSD slot | 13MP rear camera (1080p FullHD video), 5MP front camera (1080p FullHD video) | 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac, Wi-Di, Bluetooth 4.0 | GPS with A-GPS | 3000mAh battery | Android 4.3 Jelly Bean with custom UI</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> The last Lenovo flagship and the Vibe Z&#8217;s predecessor was the K900, which looked great with its sleek metallic design but didn&#8217;t feel that good when you held it. This time, Lenovo has traded in the sharp edges and metal body for high-quality plastic and rounded corners. The result? It doesn&#8217;t look as premium as the K900, but it feels far better to hold in your hand. It&#8217;s a big phone, so rounded edges make it a tad easier to grip. Plus, the Vibe Z is deceptively light for its size, much more so than the K900. And I&#8217;m glad the Vibe Z has capacitive touch buttons on the bezel rather than them taking up screen space. If you&#8217;re going to have a bezel, it only makes sense that it&#8217;s used when screen space is limited real estate. That said, at 15 cms in total height, this is a gargantuan handset and won&#8217;t fit most people&#8217;s hand properly.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/and480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1990790" alt="Lenovo Android Phone" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/and480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=717" width="480" height="717" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Screen:</strong> Speaking of the screen, the 5.5-incher here reproduces colours well and is sharp, thanks to its FullHD resolution. The viewing angles aren&#8217;t the best I have seen on a phone, but they aren&#8217;t bad enough to be a deal-breaker either. The only issue is with sunlight legibility. Even on full brightness, it wasn&#8217;t easy to read things on it while walking around under Mumbai&#8217;s harsh sun.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> With a Snapdragon 800 processor and 2GB of RAM, it&#8217;s no surprise that the Vibe Z can handle anything you throw at it. Much like any other smartphone running this combination, there are zero performance issues.</p>
<p><strong>Memory:</strong> The advertised 16GB translates to only 12GB once the OS and preinstalled apps have had their share. With no expandable microSD slot, 12GB is going to prove to be very little if you shoot videos with 1080p, take photos at 13MP, load up some songs and download a few FullHD games. Case in point, if you install HD versions of FIFA 14, Call of Duty: Strike Team and Asphalt 8, that&#8217;s 5GB of space right there.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> The Lenovo Vibe Z has an average antenna, on par with the likes of the LG Nexus 5 and Sony Xperia Z1.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lenovorounded_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1991326" alt="Lenovorounded_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lenovorounded_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=427" width="480" height="427" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> I have never been fan of Lenovo&#8217;s custom UI but the Vibe Z is the worst it&#8217;s ever been. For starters, all apps have weird rounded edges at the top part. It looks out of place with the flat notification bar and messes with the clean Holo UI (Android&#8217;s default, flat design scheme) of many apps. The multi-tasking pane uses only logos instead of previews and scrolls horizontally at the bottom instead of vertically—it&#8217;s difficult to use it with one hand now, as if that wasn&#8217;t hard enough on this big phone. It only furthers my point that except in rare cases, <a title="Does Android Still Need To Be Customized?" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/does-google-android-still-need-to-be-customized/" target="_blank">Android does not need custom interfaces any more</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong> The cameras are where the K910 shines—that&#8217;s right, plural. The rear camera is a 13-megapixel affair that improves on the K900&#8242;s stellar shooter. The camera is as good as that on the iPhone 5, and that&#8217;s not a compliment I give lightly. The best part, though, is Lenovo&#8217;s camera app. For all their software flaws, Lenovo makes the best stock camera app in the business. It&#8217;s easy enough for an amateur to use and has enough customizations and options for the advanced user to fiddle around with, whether it&#8217;s making GIFs, adjusting the white balance, getting the metering just how you want it, and more. And let&#8217;s not forget the front-facing 5MP camera, which has a wider angle than most such cameras to let you take selfies more easily and include your friends in it too. The shots in this are good in bright light, but settings such as a dimly lit restaurant will give you grainy images.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> On a day of medium-to-heavy usage, the 3000mAh Lithium-Polymer battery on the Vibe Z chugs on for a respectable 15 hours. On pure video playback, it ran for just about 4.5 hours. Playing FIFA 14 on airplane mode, it died out in 2.5 hours. FullHD gaming with lots of touch input seems to be the Achilles Heel of the Vibe Z, much like it was with the Sony Xperia Z1. Just for comparison, the Note 3—with similar specs—lasts for 4 hours of FIFA 14. The Nexus 5, meanwhile, maxes out at 100 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: If you want a large screen, good battery life and a fantastic camera, the Vibe Z is worth it at Rs. 36,000, as long as you can live with the UI and the limited 16GB of memory, which I&#8217;m sure you will run out of soon.</p>
<p>For the same Rs. 36,000, you can get the 32GB LG G2 and the 16GB Sony Xperia Z1, while the 32GB LG Nexus 5 and 16GB Samsung Galaxy S4 are retailing at roughly Rs. 32,000. And all of these other handsets have some sacrifices too, whether it&#8217;s battery, screen, build quality or camera. In short, the Vibe Z is as good as its peers and as flawed as its peers. It&#8217;s a question of which flaws matter most to you.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991325&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[There is an expanding market for light fixtures capable of capturing and analysing vast amounts of data about the habits of ordinary citizens<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991084&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Visitors to Terminal B at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey may notice the bright, clean lighting that now blankets the cavernous interior, courtesy of 171 recently installed LED fixtures. But they probably will not realise that the light fixtures are the backbone of a system that is watching them.</p>
<p>Using an array of sensors and eight video cameras around the terminal, the light fixtures are part of a new wireless network that collects and feeds data into software that can spot long lines, recognise license plates and even identify suspicious activity, sending alerts to the appropriate staff.</p>
<p>The project is still in its early stages, but executives with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, are already talking about expanding it to other terminals and buildings.</p>
<p>To customers like the Port Authority, the systems hold the promise of better management of security as well as energy, traffic and people. But they also raise the spectre of technology racing ahead of the ability to harness it, running risks of invading privacy and mismanaging information, privacy advocates say.</p>
<p>Fred H Cate, director of the Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research at Indiana University, described the potential for misuse as “terrifying”.</p>
<p>What began as a way to help governments and businesses save energy by automatically turning lights on and off has become an expanding market for lights, sensors and software capable of capturing and analysing vast amounts of data about the habits of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>The light fixtures are outfitted with special chips and connect to sensors, cameras and one another over a wireless network. Data that is collected — say, a particular car pulling up to the terminal —can then be mined and analysed for a broad range of applications. Systems like the Port Authority’s, developed by a company called Sensity Systems, could soon be more widely available. Under a recent agreement, Amerlux, a leading lighting manufacturer, will start using the technology in its LED fixtures. Other companies, including giants like Cisco Systems and Philips, are racing to grab a share of that market.</p>
<p>Las Vegas is testing a street lighting system that can broadcast sound, and plans to use it mainly to control lighting and play music or to issue security alerts at a pedestrian mall.</p>
<p>Copenhagen, Denmark, is installing 20,000 street lamps as part of a system that could eventually control traffic, monitor carbon dioxide levels and detect when garbage cans are full. Other government agencies and businesses have begun replacing thousands of lighting fixtures with LEDs, mainly to cut costs.</p>
<p>Some cities have more targeted sensors, like the ShotSpotter gunshot location system in use by more than 70 American cities, including Boston, Milwaukee and San Francisco. But the Sensity network can bring them together through existing light fixtures.</p>
<p>The system could, once software is developed, also make shopping more convenient — a potential boon for malls losing business to the Internet. Sensing a shopper pulling into a parking lot, the system could send an alert to a smartphone, showing empty spaces, or a coupon.</p>
<p>“We see outdoor lighting as the perfect infrastructure to build a brand-new network,” said Hugh Martin, Sensity’s chief executive. “We felt what you’d want to use this network for is to gather information about people and the planet.”<br />
But that is precisely what worries privacy advocates.</p>
<p>“There are some people in the commercial space who say, ‘Oh, big data — well, let’s collect everything, keep it around forever, we’ll pay for somebody to think about security later’,” said Justin Brookman, who studies consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology. “The question is whether we want to have some sort of policy framework in place to limit that.”</p>
<p>Even those developing the technology acknowledge the concerns. “I’m not saying that I know the exact balance point, but there is a lot of value, I think, if we do it right, to this information,” Martin said, whether that value is heightening security or helping stores compete with Amazon.</p>
<p>His company has a board that includes Heather Zichal, President Barack Obama’s former energy and climate change adviser, and former Republican Dick Gephardt to help figure out the implications of the technology.<br />
“I just think we need to be very thoughtful about the positives and the negatives,” Martin said. He added that the Sensity network is encrypted and “super-secure”.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, officials say they are not interested in using the video and audio surveillance capabilities of the system they are testing, called Intellistreets, and are instead looking at the use of audio broadcasting to enhance ambience and safety in public areas.</p>
<p>In Copenhagen, the emphasis is on efficiency, said Eric Dresselhuys, an executive vice president of Silver Spring Networks, which designed the network to connect that system. Executives say the potential for the advanced lighting is nearly boundless.</p>
<p>“No one really wanted the smartphone 20 years ago because they didn’t know they could have it,” said Fred Maxik, founder and chief technology officer of Lighting Science Group, which manufactures LEDs. “And I think the same is true of lighting today: No one knows what lighting is going to be capable of.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991084&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Science is now not just scratching the surface to understand why we itch<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991083&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The experiment was not for the squirmish. Volunteers were made to itch like crazy on one arm, but not allowed to scratch. Then they were whisked into an MRI scanner to see what parts of their brains lit up when they itched, when researchers scratched them and when they were allowed to scratch themselves. The scientific question was this: Why does it feel so good to scratch an itch?</p>
<p>“It’s quite intriguing to see how many brain centres are activated,” said Dr Gil Yosipovitch, chairman of dermatology at the Temple University School of Medicine and director of the Temple Center for Itch. “There is no one itch centre. Everyone wants that target, but it doesn’t work in real life like that.”</p>
<p>Instead, itching and scratching engage brain areas involved not only in sensation, but also in mental processes that help explain why we love to scratch: motivation and reward, pleasure, craving and even addiction. What an itch turns on, a scratch turns off — and scratching oneself does it better than being scratched by someone else. The study results were published in the journal PLOS One.</p>
<p>Itching was long overshadowed by pain in both research and treatment, and was considered just a mild form of pain. But millions of people suffer from itching, and times have changed. Research has found nerves, molecules and cellular receptors that are specific for itching and set it apart from pain, and the medical profession has begun to take it seriously as a debilitating problem.</p>
<p>Within the last decade, there has been a flurry of research into what causes itching and how to stop it. Along with brain imaging, studies have begun to look at gene activity and to map the signals that flow between cells in the skin, the immune system, the spinal cord and the brain.</p>
<p>The concern is not so much the fleeting nastiness of mosquito bites and poison ivy, but the misery caused by chronic itching and that often resists remedies.</p>
<p>For the first time in the US, itching research and treatment centres have opened. “Itch is now where pain was probably 20 years ago,” said Dr Lynn Cornelius, chief of the dermatology division at Washington University School of Medicine. “The science has to lead to treatment, I believe. Clinicians won’t just look upon someone itching as someone who needs antihistamines.”</p>
<p>Itching appears widespread in the animal kingdom —  though no one knows for sure why animals claw, bite or peck themselves, or scrape against trees or fences. Even fruit flies engage in “robust grooming behaviours” that look a lot like scratching, said Diana Bautista, an assistant professor of cell and developmental biology at the University of California, Berkeley. Her research includes studying various strains of itchy mice that are models for human ailments.<br />
Recent research has shown that substances other than histamine, released from inflammatory cells, are involved in chronic itching, along with three types of nerve cells, Bautista said. Drug companies are trying to find ways to block those substances.</p>
<p>One of the most important advances in the field was reported in the journal Nature in 2007 by a Washington University team led by Zhou-Feng Chen, who is now director of the itch centre. Working with mice, his team was studying receptors, molecules on cells that respond to certain chemical signals to change the cells’ behaviour.</p>
<p>The group was the first to find a receptor in the spinal cord that was specific for itching, called gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. The discovery helped prove that signals for itching and pain travel on different pathways.</p>
<p>Chen said that mice with the receptor blocked did not itch. Nor was the group without a receptor harmed by the lack of it. “If you block function of this receptor alone, you pretty much stop chronic itching,” he said. The receptor is present in humans too, and Chen said it might be possible to develop a drug to block it.</p>
<p>For many patients, new treatments cannot come soon enough. One of them was a boy who had scratched his arms and legs raw. Doctors had referred him and his family to a psychiatrist. Now 18, Joshua Riegel said, “They said I was doing it to manipulate my parents.” Thus began what he calls “that weird part of my life where they thought I was mentally ill”.</p>
<p>He was 12 or 13 when the psychiatrist prescribed antidepressants, which he dutifully took for two or three years. But they brought on terrible side effects: at one point, he was hospitalised with suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>As a last resort, his parents took him from their home in Hillsville, Virginia, to see Yosipovitch. Tests found a rare form of a genetic disease that was causing a particularly destructive set of symptoms: intense itching and skin so fragile that scratching ripped it to shreds.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991083&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Is the new Kindle Paperwhite 3G a good travel companion? Two airports, two bumpy flights and two cities later, here’s what we felt.</em></p>
<p><em></em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">I would like to do more reading than what I get to do these days. So when I got the opportunity to review the new Kindle Paperwhite, I was looking forward to check out the sixth generation of the ebook reader and the second in the Paperwhite series.</span></p>
<p>The opportunity presented itself in the form of a three-day official trip to Chennai. Due to the nature of the trip, I was sure there would not be much time to read once I was there. But nothing could stop me from reading at the airport and while flying. So that meant at least eight hours of reading, at two new airports and two rather old aircrafts in between.</p>
<p>I am in the taxi en route to the airport. I decide to download some reading material for the flight on the Paperwhite. This version has 3G, so I am not tethered to a WiFi network for updates. I decide to first sync a few books that are already there in my Kindle account. I buy Ramachandra Guha’s India After Gandhi, a book I have been dying to read. I also find the cover of the Columbia Journalism Review (“Evgeny vs the Internet”) interesting and decide to subscribe to the magazine. It helps that the first month is free, after which I can decide whether I want to continue with the subscription. The entire process takes me under five minutes, the 3G is quite fast on this version.</p>
<p>At the airport, I try and log in to the free WiFi. I could not experience a faster download, probably because the airport WiFi was being used by hundreds of passengers. It is not much of a difference in speeds and I am not really spending money as the 3G does not entail usage cost. Interestingly, the device automatically switches off the 3G when it latches on to a wireless network.</p>
<p>As I try to log in to the Goodreads site, it is time to board the flight. The Paperwhite — like its earlier version — is not much larger than a thin paperback and can easily go inside my coat pocket.</p>
<p>In the flight, I cozy up with the CJR cover story on Evgeny Morozov. Of all the Kindle devices so far, this one has one of the fastest page flips. But this also means that if your thumb inadvertently touches the bottom right corner, you are on to the next page. I have always found it slightly awkward to read periodicals on the Kindle. One article flows into another and often you mistake this for a new chapter, when it turns out to be a completely new piece. But this also means you can finish a magazine from cover to cover without being bothered about anything else, just the kind of experience avid readers love.</p>
<p>India After Gandhi starts with a rather long prologue peppered with footnotes. Clicking any superscript number on the text opens the footnote pop-up in a jiffy. It is convenient, and much faster than clicking on a link on a website.</p>
<p>The one day that I spend in Chennai does not afford me much time to read lengthy pieces. But I do use the device to check The Indian Express stories once in a while — after all, this is Chennai where you cannot get a copy of the paper.</p>
<p>On my way back, on a very turbulent evening flight, I actually read much more than I have in ages. In two hours, I am four chapters into Guha’s latest. Having seen the actual size of the book, I am quite certain that this is a better way to read any book that is more than 300 pages long.</p>
<p>Back in Delhi, I am on my way back home and using 3G. I select a line from the book and tweet it. Yes, this is a good added feature, but perhaps this is not the device for multiple tweets from a single book. You can easily manage a tweet per book. Plus, there is the fact that the tweet makes sense only for people on the Amazon ecosystem, for the link that goes with it is synced to the Amazon site.</p>
<p>At home, I use the Goodreads feature to log in to Facebook to create a shelf of the books I have read on the Kindle. It also shows other people on my list who are using this service. Surprisingly, there were quite a few of them and with books that I would like to read, when I get the time. This seems like a better feature than the actual share option.</p>
<p>Overall, the Kindle Paperwhite has now become a device for the share-it-now generation. It is still the closest digital experience to the actual book and is at times a better experience, especially when you are on the move. A must-have for people who like to read wherever they are.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Price: Rs 13,999 (The version without 3G is </strong><strong>Rs 3,000 less)</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991071&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/whatsapp.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990959" alt="On Wednesday the world's biggest social networking company, Facebook, announced it is buying mobile messaging service WhatsApp for up to $19 billion in cash and stock. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/whatsapp.jpg" /></a>  The world&#8217;s biggest social networking company, Facebook, recently announced it is buying mobile messaging service WhatsApp for up to $19 billion in cash and stock.
<p>The Facebook deal for WhatsApp drew attention for its whopping price tag, but has also brought out fresh criticism over security for the billions of messages delivered on the platform.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, which is to be acquired for USD 19 billion, says on its website that &#8220;communication between your phone and our<br />
server is fully encrypted.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company warns users need to be aware that when they send messages, the recipient&#8217;s device may not be secure. But it says it does not store any chat history and that messages are wiped off its system after delivery.</p>
<p>Yet security researchers and others point out that there may be vulnerabilities in the system used by some 450 million people globally.</p>
<p>Paul Jauregui at the security firm Praetorian said in a blog post yesterday that WhatsApp security and encryption are not ideal, citing vulnerabilities in the way it handles SSL, the secure socket layer protocol for communications.</p>
<p>The group&#8217;s mobile security test &#8220;picked up on several SSL-related security issues affecting the confidentiality of WhatsApp user data that passes in transit to back-end servers,&#8221; Jauregui said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the kind of stuff the NSA (National Security Agency) would love. It basically allows them &#8212; or an attacker &#8211; to man-in-the-middle the connection and then downgrade the encryption so they can break it and sniff the traffic. These security issues put WhatsApp user information and communications at risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jauregui noted that Praetorian would need authorisation from Facebook and WhatsApp for a more thorough security evaluation. He added that it would be &#8220;not very difficult&#8221; to patch the security flaws.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Germany, the data commissioner in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, said in a statement this week the deal raises serious privacy concerns and that WhatsApp does not comply with European data protection rules.</p>
<p>The official, Thilo Weichert, said in a statement that people should opt out of WhatsApp for more &#8220;trusted services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last October, Dutch security researcher Thijs Alkemade posted a blog saying that the encryption can be circumvented, making it feasible &#8220;that anyone who is able to eavesdrop on your WhatsApp connection is capable of decrypting your messages, given enough effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>WhatsApp did not respond to an AFP query on the security claims. But some rival services say the Facebook-WhatsApp tie-up is likely to hurt confidence in the messaging app.</p>
<p>Nico Sell, co-founder of the security-focused app Wickr said it has seen &#8220;thousands more people than normal&#8221; downloading its app since Facebook&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think people will swap quickly out of WhatsApp now that it&#8217;s part of Facebook,&#8221; she told AFP.</p>
<p>Sell said Facebook&#8217;s core business is monetizing data, while Wickr aims at protecting user anonymity and privacy, by using top-grade encryption and paying bounties to hackers who discover any security flaws.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990956&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[WickedLeak's phones have plain vanilla version of Android, and they update their phone months before other manufacturers do.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990782&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/and4800.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990793" alt="Android Customisation" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/and4800.jpg" /></a> The question is whether Android in its current form still needs these custom UIs.
<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">While reviewing the Lenovo Vibe Z, the first thing I was struck by how it didn&#8217;t quite feel like Android. For starters, there was the missing app drawer—the menu of all your apps. Instead, the Vibe Z only has a homescreen with an endless flow of apps, much like the iPhone.<br />
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The next thing to catch me by surprise was that all apps had rounded corners at the top, which was jarring under the flat, straight-lined notification bar. And then there were the custom apps, like Lenovo&#8217;s Messaging app, which have their own design style, separate from Android&#8217;s recommended Holo theme.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Several other manufacturers have customized how Android looks on their devices, including Samsung, LG and HTC. A few stick to the default Android design as much as possible, like Micromax and Motorola. Before v4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich, the operating system lacked several core features that these custom interfaces delivered. The question now is whether Android in its current form still needs these custom UIs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/and480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1990790" alt="Lenovo Android Phone" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/and480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=717" width="480" height="717" /></a></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>A Need For Consistency</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you look at a Nexus phone and all the apps installed on it, and compare it to a Samsung or LG phone and its apps, you will notice that the Nexus feels more like a cohesive unit when you&#8217;re switching between apps. Most new apps follow the Holo design guidelines laid down by Google to deliver a certain uniformity to the Android experience. Unfortunately, the custom UIs by manufacturers only go to ruin this uniformity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You see, the beauty of Android is in the large number of apps it offers on the Play Store. That&#8217;s what makes it a great OS, not its core features. And if you are going to be installing all those apps, you should have a consistent experience across all of them; it shouldn&#8217;t be that you press at the top-left corner to go back in one and press at the bottom-right to go back in another.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In its progress, Android has borrowed heavily from some of the custom UIs to get to where it is today. But I&#8217;d argue that it&#8217;s now at a point where it would be better for the manufacturers to deliver an overall consistent experience than to distinguish themselves through design. Because ultimately, design deviations lead to jarring changes when using many apps.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Cost Of Updates</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Another benefit of keeping the design and functionality as close to the original Android version as possible is that manufacturers are able to roll out updates that much quicker. Apart from the Nexus series, a prime example of this is the Indian manufacturer WickedLeak, which has consistently been the first non-Nexus device to update to the latest version of Android. WickedLeak&#8217;s phones have a plain vanilla version of Android, and they update their phone months before other manufacturers do.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Case For Customizations</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">That said, there are still some customizations that add features which Android could benefit from. Take, for example, Samsung&#8217;s <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/pen-is-mightier-samsung-galaxy-note-10-1-show-a-stylus-can-change-how-you-use-tablets/">Air Command</a> on the new Note series. On the Moto X, Motorola has done some fantastic work with the Active Display and Touchless Control.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By delivering a core function that can&#8217;t be easily replicated with a third-party app, these mobiles are able to distinguish themselves in a far better way than a custom design can. In fact, there are enough people willing to pay purely for those functions.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">But the key takeaway here is that it&#8217;s the function that sets these apart, not the form. Android can still use &#8220;features&#8221; that add more than the default experience, but perhaps it&#8217;s time manufacturers moved on from changing the design alone and adding functions that are available as third-party apps.</span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990782&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jbl480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990642" alt="JBL Voyager" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jbl480.jpg" /></a> JBL Voyager looks and sounds great.
<p>At first look, you could mistake it to be an attractively designed utensil or a flying saucer-shaped toy of a small boy, but make no mistake this is the JBL Voyager—a wireless home audio system that incorporates a detachable wireless speaker. Until now, we have seen wireless speakers in different shapes, sizes and wattage, but this innovation from Harmon</p>
<p>International is a class apart. It’s a stunner in terms of looks and it distinguishes itself in a crowded market with its powerful performance.</p>
<p>Before we delve into the tech intricacies of this new-age device, first a small brief on its creator. Harman International is an American audio and infotainment equipment company. It designs, manufactures and markets audio and infotainment products for the car, the home, theatres and venues, as well as electronics for audio professionals. Harman International’s consumer group makes loudspeakers, CD and DVD players, CD recorders, and amplifiers under several brand names such as Harman Kardon, JBL, and Infinity.</p>
<p>Back to the Voyager and its relevance in present-day times. If you haven’t noticed, portable speakers are becoming a must-have accessory for music fans these days. In recent months, I have reviewed two great products from Bose—Soundlink</p>
<p>Mini Bluetooth Speaker and Soundlink Bluetooth Mobile Speaker II—and I was left with a everlasting impression of what sound quality is really all about.</p>
<p>But buying a standalone system for the home and a portable speaker for work can be expensive…which is why JBL is combining them into one product. Basically, the Voyager is a portable Bluetooth speaker with an integrated sub-woofer and a central speaker you can detach and take with you. It combines a portable speaker with a sub-woofer system. To put it in simple terms, you’ll get both power and portability with this Rs 19,990-a-piece audio system.</p>
<p>In terms of body dynamics, the Voyager measures 210 x 127 mm in diameter and height and has a Lithium polymer (7.4V 1000mAh) battery with a lifetime of five hours. At 1.14 kg, they don’t feel heavy and inconvenient when you pick these up for the first time. They feel quite solid in terms of build quality as well. In</p>
<p>audio specifications, the Voyager has amplifier power of 2 x 7.5 watts (portable unit) plus 1 x 15 watts (sub-woofer), frequency response of 20Hz – 20kHz and signal-to-noise ratio of 80 dB. Input connections are Bluetooth and a jack, Bluetooth frequency range of 2.402 GHz-2.480 GHz and Bluetooth transmitter power of 0~4dBm.</p>
<p>Okay, enough of the tech talk. Let us talk about the product’s real-life performance. Set up won’t take long and it is fairly straight forward. Firstly, the speakers emit no noise if you set the volume to the lowest setting. You can establish connectivity with your tablet, mobile phone or a laptop which support wireless connectivity. When pairing over Bluetooth, the speakers will emit an audible signal letting you know if and when you are connected to your audio source. At my end, I connected the Voyager with a BlackBerry phone and a Dell laptop.</p>
<p>For starters, the dual drivers and sub-woofer bring you all the sonic muscle-power of a full-range JBL home audio system, complete with aux-in and USB ports for charging your smartphones and tablets. But that’s just half the fun: you can easily undock the portable Bluetooth speaker out of the main system and roam throughout your home or office, taking it anywhere you like.</p>
<p>At my end, I detached the speaker from the main system and placed it in a separate room, almost 18 feet away and yet there was not disruption in connectivity. The speakers worked good and sounded better than many conventional home audio systems. The sound that comes out of both of systems (coupled or decoupled) is astoundingly loud. But what’s the single most impressive thing about the sound output with these is that we could literally crank up the volume to the maximum, which can easily fill a large living room if you have got a small get together, and without a hint of crackling or distorting audio.</p>
<p>Balancing style, price, and sound quality can be tough when choosing speakers. But all things considered, if you are looking for a portable speaker, JBL is always worth considering. The Voyager is a great device that gives you a lot more for your money than you might first expect.</p>

<p>Finnish handset maker Jolla, founded by some ex-Nokia employees, is in talks with partners to sell its smartphones in India, initially by tapping the popular e-commerce route.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jolla is now rapidly entering into new markets, and is negotiating with partners in several countries, including Russia, India and Hong Kong where Jolla will open online sales in the near future,&#8221; the company today said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company has built its own operating system Sailfish which will provide users alternative to Android, Windows, Blackberry and Apple&#8217;s iOS.</p>
<p>In an interview to PTI earlier, Jolla CEO Tomi Pienimaki had said the company already had orders from India when it started taking pre-bookings for smartphones.</p>
<p>Currently, Jolla smartphones are available for orders online at its web shop at the price of 399 Euros to all European Union countries, Switzerland and Norway.</p>
<p>According to CMR&#8217;s India Mobile Handsets Q3 Market Review, India registered 62.9 million mobile handset shipments for the period July-September, 2013. During the same period, 11.1 million smartphones were shipped in the country.</p>
<p>Launching its first handset in India after a nearly two-year hiatus, Motorola earlier this month made its Moto G available exclusively through e-commerce player Flipkart.</p>
<p>Jolla founders moved out of Nokia after the company, then led by Stephen Elop, decided to dump &#8216;Meego&#8217; operating system and instead adopt the Windows platform.</p>
<p>Nokia in mid-2011 had unveiled only one phone, Nokia N9 on Meego, in partnership with computer chip giant Intel. Microsoft has now acquired Nokia&#8217;s mobile devices business.</p>
<p>Currently, Jolla is a team of over 90 people and has offices in Helsinki and Tampere, Finland and Hong Kong, SAR of China. Jolla unveiled its first smartphone for about Rs 34,000 in November and is now expanding globally.</p>
<p>Its Sailfish OS is compatible with devices on which Android OS works. Jolla has started providing Sailfish OS through Android playstore on select devices like Samsung Galaxy, Google Nexus and Sony Xperia, for people to experience this new platform.</p>
<p>Soon, the company will provide Sailfish OS downloads from its website as well. The company has tied up with Tieto Corporation for providing Sailfish OS to handset manufacturers.</p>
<p>In a first, Jolla has announced agreement with F-Secure for mobile security on Sailfish OS. Jolla and F-Secure are working on an upcoming solution that will provide Jolla smartphone customers gigabytes of cloud storage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jolla and F-Secure want to make sure Jolla phone users have a secure choice to back-up and share their on-device content. We are both very passionate about privacy and security, which is why our cooperation is natural and fruitful,&#8221; Pienimaki said.</p>
<p>Jolla customers will be able to access stored content from other devices such as tablets, Macs or PCs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990416&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>At the Samsung Forum in Bali, the buzz was all around the updraded versions of a bunch of its mobile devices as well as the enterprise oriented tablets. However, the Korean tech giant also showed that it means business in a segment that it has not really been able to monopolise so far. The company announced the NX30 and the Galaxy Camera 2. The first a compact system camera delivering high quality images  and the second a sequel to the Galaxy Camera line-up that brings smartphone-like sharing to imaging devices.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung NX30</strong></p>
<p>The NX30 has an advanced 20.3MP APS-C CMOS Sensor and can capture fast-paced moments in perfect clarity thanks to its 1/8000 sec Shutter speed and the 9 frame per seconds (FPS) continuous shooting function. The NX30&#8242;s NFC and Wi-Fi capabilities creates a ‘Tag &amp; Go’ function that lets users tap and share photos instantly and easily. The Photo Beam feature allows users to transfer images or videos between smartphones or tablets by simply touching devices together.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Camera 2</strong></p>
<p>The Galaxy Camera 2 lets users enjoy the full benefits of the Android platform. Its 16M BSI CMOS Sensor is supported by a 21x Optical Zoom. It also featured an upgraded 1.6 GHz Quad-Core processor supported by a massive 2.0 GB of RAM. The Galaxy Camera 2&#8242;s 121.2mm (4.8-inch) HD Super Clear Touch LCD adds to the experience.</p>
<p>Samsung will announces the prices closer to the India launch dates.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989985&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/ahtaap-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1952832" alt=" Now, the friends behind the hot mobile messaging startup WhatsApp are the newest tech industry billionaires." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/ahtaap-med.jpg" /></a> Now, the friends behind the hot mobile messaging startup WhatsApp are the newest tech industry billionaires.
<p>Jan Koum, an immigrant from Ukraine, was so poor as a teenager that he used saved old Soviet notebooks for school and queued with his mom for food stamps.</p>
<p>Brian Acton lost a small fortune in the dot-com bust and was rejected for jobs at Twitter and Facebook. Now, the friends behind the hot mobile messaging startup WhatsApp are the newest tech industry billionaires.</p>
<p>Facebook this week bought WhatsApp in a stock-and-cash deal worth up to USD 19 billion and gave Koum a seat on the social network&#8217;s board of directors.<br />
Koum signed the Facebook takeover contract at the unused building where he and his mother once queued for food stamps in the Silicon Valley city of Mountain View, where WhatsApp is located, according to Forbes Magazine.</p>
<p>Koum, who turns 38 on Sunday, has described growing up as a rebellious Jewish child near Kiev and having little when he immigrated to California with his mother at the age of 16 just after the Soviet Union&#8217;s breakup. His father did not make it to the United States, where the family sought to escape anti-Semitism and oppressive tactics of secret police.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jan&#8217;s childhood made him appreciate communication that was not bugged or taped,&#8221; Sequoia Capital partner Jim Goetz said in an online post.<br />
&#8220;When he arrived in the US as a 16-year-old immigrant living on food stamps, he had the extra incentive of wanting to stay in touch with his family in Russia and the Ukraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Koum&#8217;s mother brought with her a cache of pens and Soviet-issued notebooks to save money on school supplies, according to Forbes magazine. A self-described trouble-maker at school, Koum had a job sweeping the floors in a grocery store. After his mother was diagnosed with cancer, they got by on disability payments, Forbes reported.</p>
<p>Koum learned computer networking from manuals bought from, and eventually returned to, a used book store, according to the account.<br />
He enrolled in a state university in Silicon Valley and was working on the side with a computer security firm when he met Acton while on assignment at Yahoo in 1997.</p>
<p>Acton was employee number 44 at the Sunnyvale, California-based Internet firm and shared a &#8220;no-nonsense&#8221; attitude with Koum. Within a year, Koum was working as an engineer at Yahoo and the pair were on their way to being close friends. Koum eventually chose Yahoo over college. When Koum&#8217;s mother died of cancer in 2000, his mentor Acton stepped in with support. Acton, meanwhile, reportedly lost millions investing during the famous dot-com boom that ended with an infamous dot-com bust. Acton and Koum left Yahoo in 2007 and took a year off, exploring South America and playing the sport of Ultimate Frisbee, according to Forbes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989978&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/satyanadella.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1977519" alt="India-born Satya Nadella said Microsoft needs to move faster in innovation." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/satyanadella.jpg" /></a> India-born Satya Nadella said Microsoft needs to move faster in innovation.
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s new chief executive Satya Nadella says the tech giant needs to start thinking like a startup again if it wants to move ahead in the new technology landscape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Culturally, I think we have operated as if we had the formula figured out, and it was all about optimising, in its various constituent parts, the formula,&#8221; Nadella said in an interview with The New York Times published on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had great successes, but our future is not about our past success. It&#8217;s going to be about whether we will invent things that are really going to drive our future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nadella, who was named earlier this month to succeed Steve Ballmer at the helm of the tech titan, said Microsoft needs to move faster in innovation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything now is going to have to be much more compressed in terms of both cycle times and response times,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to be able to sense those early indicators of success, and the leadership has to really lean in and not let things die on the vine,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Nadella&#8217;s appointment coincides with Microsoft founder Bill Gates stepping back in as a &#8220;technology advisor,&#8221; giving up his title of chairman.</p>
<p>The Indian-born CEO said Gates&#8217;s role will not really be new.</p>
<p>&#8220;The outside world looks at it and says, &#8216;Whoa, this is some new thing.&#8217; But we&#8217;ve worked closely for about nine years now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;m very comfortable with this, and I asked for a real allocation of his time. He is in fact making some pretty hard trade-offs. And one of the fantastic things that only Bill can do inside this campus is to get everybody energised to bring their &#8216;A&#8217; game. It&#8217;s just a gift.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989940&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[India, with its ever increasing number of smartphone users, will be high on the agenda for both Facebook and WhatsApp in the coming months. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989852&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/facebook-turns-10_kuma.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1979749" alt="Facebook will acquire mobile messaging company WhatsApp for 19 billion dollars in a cash and stock deal." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/facebook-turns-10_kuma.jpg" /></a> Facebook will acquire mobile messaging company WhatsApp for 19 billion dollars in a cash and stock deal.
<p>It’s a billion dollar question: Why did Facebook pay so much for a mobile messaging app. The answers, strangely, might lie in India.</p>
<p>Facebook has over 93 million users in India, of which, 75 million access the social network from mobile devices. The company does not share how many have Facebook Chat Instant Messenger on their smartphones, but it is much lower compared to people using WhatsApp, which has over 30 million users in India alone.</p>
<p>“The Facebook-WhatsApp deal highlights the increasing importance of the messaging space and the role it will play in mobile-internet going forward,” says Kavin Bharti Mittal, whose messaging app ‘Hike’ just crossed 15 million downloads.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing India following a similar growth trajectory, especially in the messaging space; with the proliferation of cheaper smartphones and data plans,” says Mittal.</p>
<p>Interestingly, about 80 per cent of Hike’s users are under 25 years.</p>
<p>Recent reports suggest that the youth have been moving away from Facebook. WhatsApp, on the other hand, is the fastest growing messaging app. The acquisition is a way of future-proofing growth, especially in a young country like India.</p>
<p>Dippak Khurana, CEO &amp; co-founder  of mobile advertising platform Vserv.mobi says, “Whatsapp is the most successful and fastest growing social communication app and has the sharpest growth trajectory compared to other social communication platforms. This makes it a strong logical extension to Facebook’s ‘connecting the world’ goal, by helping them develop new mobile experiences which until recently was restricted to the Facebook app.”</p>
<p>Anubhuv Nayyar, country head, Viber Media Inc, creators of another popular messaging app that was picked up by Japanese tech giant Rakuten Inc last week, says, “Everyone is focussing on what the consumer wants in the end and have different strategies to achieve this.”.</p>
<p>Nayyar adds that it is impossible to deny the fact many segments, especially the youth, have started spending more time on messaging apps than social networks.</p>
<p>India, with its ever increasing number of smartphone users, will be high on the agenda for both Facebook and WhatsApp in the coming months.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989852&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/necomimi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989587" alt="Necomimi might look stupid, but it can read your mind. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/necomimi.jpg" /></a> Necomimi might look stupid, but it can read your mind.
<p>Will robots start delivering products for e-commerce outfit? Will they become wise enough to run our homes? Will there be purpose built robots to take on specific tasks? All tough questions. But answers to these might be closer than you think.</p>
<p>There are simple and fun solutions like <a href="http://www.necomimi.com">Necomimi </a>that literally show what is on your mind, to cutting edge technologies that let you control anything from smartphone apps to cars with just the power of thought.</p>
<p>We speak to The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Senior Member and industry expert<strong> Dean Aslam</strong> on his project with mind-controlled robots that have applications for operating drones, prosthetics, smart homes and can even be used in the early detection of neuro disorders, like Parkinson&#8217;s Disease.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='475' height='267' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/LdSBQy5_yyY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about your project. How is it different? </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Electroencephalogram (EEG) typically use a large number of electrodes (21-64) and have been used in mind-controlled devices and limbs. For example, recently the researchers at University of Minnesota have demonstrated a mind-controlled quad-copter using 64 electrodes. However, such systems are very complex and expensive.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Neurosky introduced an inexpensive single-electrode (placed on forehead) EEG (the second electrode is the ground electrode attached to earlobe) that is being used in mind-controlled toys. Such commercial single-electrode EEG toys are rigid, large and not very flexible for other applications.</p>
<p>The researchers in the Micro and Nano Technology Lab (MANTL) at Michigan State University, were able to miniaturise the EEG electrode, the packaging of electronics and a power source by using 3D inkjet printing. Their mind-control system can be mounted in a cap or wig which, for example, can control the robots and appliances in a smart home. The new EEG system will also help study commonly occurring neural problems using a game-changing personal, inexpensive, non-invasive and comfortably-wearable integrated healthcare Microsystem.</p>
<p><strong>How does mind controlling work? What are the advantages?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>When we think about someone or something, the thought process is initiated, by firing neurons, in the prefrontal lobe of the brain. In order for brain to get details, it has to fire neurons in different parts of the brain. Because part of the neuron activity involves electrical currents, any thought process leads to electromagnetic waves called brainwaves that travel all over the brain.</p>
<p>When the brainwaves ‘leak’ out of the head they can be detected by the EEG sensors. The frequency of detected signal reflects the state of our mind; for example, whether we are focused or unfocused or relaxed. This information can be used control a robot if a wireless link is created between the EEG system on the head and the control circuit on the robot.</p>
<p>Mind-controlled limbs work like real limbs. Mind-controlled smart home appliances can be switched on or off automatically even we are sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>Are we finally entering the real robotic age? Why?</strong><br />
Yes, if we use mind-controlled robots. This is because this technology combines two things that excites us the most; the brain and robots.</p>
<p><strong>Is there going to be a big boost in the number of purpose built robots? What are the indicators to this effect?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, because they are applicable in almost every aspect of our lives.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989584&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fujifilm X-E2, a premium interchangeable lens camera with the latest APS-C X-Trans CMOS II sensor and the world&#8217;s fastest AF, has been launched in India.</p>
<p>The camera is the successor of the Fujifilm X-E1 and promises image quality comparable with full-frame cameras. The company claims an unprecedented AF speed of 0.08 seconds, achieved by doubling the processing speed of the EXR Processor II. It is able to harness the<br />
information taken from over 100,000 phase detection pixels incorporated in the X-Trans CMOS II. The 16.3 MP APS-C sized X-Trans CMOS II Sensor incorporates an original color filter array.</p>
<p>The X-E2 will have a combination of a manually adjusted aperture ring and a shutter speed dial on the top plate like in the X-E1.  The X-E2 shoots Full HD video at up to 60fps and the AF tracking performance in movie mode has been improved with good focusing speed, accuracy and smoothness.</p>
<p>Plus, users can now easily transfer images wirelessly to a smartphone or tablet after installing the free FUJIFILM Camera Application app.<br />
The X-E2 is priced at Rs 76,999 for body and Rs 1,09,999 with XF18-55mm kit lens.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989501&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>19 billion dollars represents a lot of things to a lot of people. To A Raja, it represents a paltry amount; 2G cost the exchequer almost twice that. To the world on this day, however, it represents the total amount that one indispensable part of our lives (Facebook) paid for another equally important part (WhatsApp).</p>
<p>Here are the funniest reactions from Twitter, to this mammoth acquisition:</p>
<p><strong>The funniest spoof Twitter account in India</strong></p>

<p>Hike messenger, the free messaging app from Bharti SoftBank, has crossed the 15 Million user milestone, up from 5 million nine months ago. hike is unique as it allows users to get in touch with even those who are offline, through SMS.</p>
<p>Founder Kavin Bharti Mittal said the app was seeing great traction amongst the youth and those under 25 made up over 80% of our user base. &#8220;Despite the proliferation of instant messaging apps in India, hike is growing faster than ever. We’ve observed that the youth, today, want to move away from mass platforms to a place where they can express more, within a closer set of friends. Hike is that destination,&#8221; he said in a release.</p>
<p>The app has some unique features like &#8216;Last Seen Privacy&#8217; where one can choose to share their ‘Last Seen’ and ‘Status Updates’ with a chosen set of friends.  There are also localised sticker packs such as ‘Things Indians Say’ and a playful Bollywood pack.<br />
Kavin said the company is working on &#8220;cool and innovative ideas&#8221; we&#8217;re working on in the pipeline for that segment.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989171&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/opla480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989105" alt="Oppo N1 phablet" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/opla480.jpg" /></a> Oppo N1 phablet
<p>The personal technology market, especially smartphones, has become so lucrative that everyone wants to have its piece of the pie. Everyday, we hear about some new company joining the fray. One such is the Chinese firm Oppo, which recently launched their flagship product, the Oppo N1 phablet, in India with much glamour and blitz.</p>
<p>The Oppo N1 screams style right from the packaging itself. The handset comes inside a white jewellery box-like casing, which doesn’t feel flashy but extremely stylish. Everything inside the box, right from quality of the USB cable and in-ear headphones (angled to fit perfectly with excellent sound quality) to the way they have been packaged, makes the device look like a piece of art.</p>
<p>The 5.9-inch phablet, in matte white with metallic silver bordering, looks fantastic. Inspite of its huge size and 213 gm weight, it felt light in hand. Since I am not a fan of phablets as I find them too bulky for a proper hand-held experience, the N1 did feel wobbly while operating with one hand. So for an average user, this could feel too chunky. But for those who like it big, this could well be device.</p>
<p>With a 1080p full-HD IPS display (1920 x 1080 pixels, 377 ppi), the N1 gives an excellent viewing experience. Colours look sharp and crisp and viewing angles are also good. To put things in perspective, the iPhone 5S offers a 326 ppi display and the Samsung Note 3 has 386 ppi. The screen is made up of Gorilla Glass 3, which should provide respite from ordinary scratches.</p>
<p>The N1 is powered by a 1.7 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 quad-core processor with Adreno 320 GPU and 2GB RAM. Obviously with such raw power, the device gave butter-smooth user experience. Continuous multitasking with Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Chrome and a few games like Subway Surfer and Temple Run did not give any lags whatsoever. I could play a space-guzzler like Asphalt 8 without any glitch. Watching videos were also great, with stunning picture quality.</p>
<p>Oppo claims the N1 is the first smartphone with a rotating camera. So irrespective of whether you use the primary camera for clicking pictures or want to video chat, just rotate the 13 MP camera grid to get high-quality pictures or videos. The camera optics, along with the dual-LED flash, gave some quality pictures on well-lit conditions. However, performances in darker conditions were a big letdown, resulting in grainy and noisy pictures. Also, one can click the back of the phone to use it as the camera shutter and scroll pictures, which I thought was a novel idea.</p>
<p>Though based on the Android Jelly Bean 4.2 platform, the N1 runs a proprietary OS called Color, did not make much of a difference to the Android experience for a common user. The stock Android interface has just been tweaked in terms of the colour scheme and app icons, with other things broadly remaining same.</p>
<p>The phablet offers the option of 16/32 GB internal memory, with no option for expandable storage. The device that I tested was the</p>
<p>16-GB model, with just around 10GB free for the user. For a R40,000-device, this was a big disappointment. The mammoth 3610 mAH battery, however, brought some smile as this would easily last over a day for an average user.</p>
<p>An USP of the N1 is the ‘O-click’ wearable device. The ‘O-click’ is a bluetooth wireless remote that comes in the shape of a small key ring. This smart looking device can be attached to one’s keychain and can be used for taking pictures. Just position the camera and use the O-click button as a shutter, and voila, the picture is taken without any jostling with the phone. The device also works as an anti-lost tool (when paired with the N1, it can alert the user if the phone goes out of range or the user is finding it difficult to locate the phone) as well as alerts user when there is a missed call or message. A novel and sleek accessory.</p>
<p>Another thing I liked was the option of having a guest mode (where in case there is another user, the main user has the option of hiding private contacts, messages, pictures etc from the guest user) and the holiday mode (where calls, emails and messages can be muted for a specified period of time). The phone gave FM radio a miss, which I did not like.</p>
<p>The Oppo N1 has everything in it to shake up the premium phablet segment. In terms of style and features, it can well put the market leaders to shame. But unfortunately, the Indian consumer gets hesitant when it comes to taking chance with a new company offering a premium product, and generally falls for the tried-and tested ones. So if Oppo can market the N1 well with affordable buying options, this can be a clear winner.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/fb-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989017" alt="fb-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/fb-480.jpg" /></a> WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly active users
<p>Facebook is buying mobile messaging service WhatsApp for $19 billion in cash and stock, by far the company&#8217;s largest acquisition and bigger than any that Google, Microsoft or Apple have ever done.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s biggest social networking company said Wednesday that it is paying $12 billion in Facebook stock and $4 billion in cash for WhatsApp. In addition, the app&#8217;s founders and employees — 55 in all — will be granted restricted stock worth $3 billion that will vest over four years after the deal closes.</p>
<p>The deal translates to roughly 9 percent of Facebook&#8217;s market value. In comparison, Google&#8217;s biggest deal, Motorola Mobility, stood at $12.5 billion, while Microsoft&#8217;s largest was Skype at $8.5 billion. Apple, meanwhile, has never done a deal above $1 billion.</p>
<p>The price stunned Gartner analyst Brian Blau. &#8220;I am not surprised they went after WhatsApp, but the amount is staggering,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Facebook likely prizes WhatsApp for its audience of teenagers and young adults who are increasingly using the service to engage in online conversations outside of Facebook, which has evolved into a more mainstream hangout inhabited by their parents, grandparents and even their bosses at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a bet on the future for Facebook,&#8221; Blau said. &#8220;They know they have to expand their business lines. WhatsApp is in the business of collecting people&#8217;s conversations, so Facebook is going to get some great data.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that sense, the acquisition makes sense for 10-year-old Facebook as it looks to attract its next billion users while keeping its existing 1.23 billion members, including teenagers, interested. The company has said it will develop a &#8220;multi-app&#8221; strategy, creating its own applications that exist outside of Facebook and acquiring others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook seems to be in acknowledgement that people are using a lot of different apps to communicate,&#8221; said eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson. &#8220;In order to continue to reach audiences, younger in particular, it needs to have a broader strategy&#8230;not put all its eggs in one basket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook said it is keeping WhatsApp as a separate service, just as it did with Instagram, which it bought for about $715.3 million in two years ago.</p>
<p>WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly active users. In comparison, Twitter had 241 million users at the end of 2013.</p>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says WhatsApp is on path to reach a billion users.</p>
<p>&#8220;The services that reach that milestone are all incredibly valuable,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>WhatsApp, a messaging service for smartphones, lets users chat with their phone contacts, both one-on-one and in groups. The service allows people to send texts, photos, videos and voice recordings over the Internet. It also lets users communicate with people overseas without incurring charges for pricey international texts and phone calls. It costs $1 per year and has no ads.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close later this year.</p>
<p>Shares of Menlo Park, California-based Facebook slid $1.12 to $66.94 in extended trading after the deal was announced.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989013&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/laser-2-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988607" alt="World's most powerful laser has been developed in Britain. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/laser-2-480.jpg" /></a> World&#8217;s most powerful laser has been developed in Britain. (Reuters)
<p>British researchers have built the world&#8217;s most powerful terahertz laser chip, an advance that may enable improved security scanning and medical imaging. Researchers from the University of Leeds claimed to have exceeded a 1 Watt output power from a quantum cascade terahertz laser.</p>
<p>The new record more than doubles landmarks set by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and subsequently by a team from Vienna last year. Terahertz waves, which lie in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum between infrared and microwaves, can penetrate materials that block visible light and have a wide range of possible uses including chemical analysis, security scanning, medical imaging, and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Potential applications include monitoring pharmaceutical products, the remote sensing of chemical signatures of explosives in unopened envelopes, and the non-invasive detection of cancers in the human body. However, one of the main challenges for scientists and engineers is making the lasers powerful and compact enough to be useful. &#8220;Although it is possible to build large instruments that generate powerful beams of terahertz radiation, these instruments are only useful for a limited set of applications,&#8221; said Edmund Linfield, Professor of Terahertz Electronics in the University&#8217;s School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need terahertz lasers that not only offer high power, but are also portable and cost less,&#8221; Linfield said. The quantum cascade terahertz lasers being developed by Leeds are only a few square millimetres in size. In October 2013, Vienna University of Technology announced that its researchers had smashed the world record output power for quantum cascade terahertz lasers previously held by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).</p>
<p>The Austrian team reported an output of 0.47 Watt from a single laser facet, nearly double the output power reported by the MIT team. The Leeds group has now achieved an output of more than 1 Watt from a single laser facet. The research was published in the Institution of Engineering and Technology&#8217;s (IET) journal Electronics Letters.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988551&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/marsupial-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988176" alt="New marsupial species found in New South Wales. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/marsupial-480.jpg" /></a> New marsupial species found in New South Wales. (AP)
<p>A new species of mouse-like marsupial known for its unusual breeding habits in the Gold Coast hinterland has been discovered by Australian scientists. The species had caught global attention last year after researchers found the male of the species was dying from stress after over-enthusiastic marathon mating sessions. The new findings are published in the scientific journal Zootaxa.</p>
<p>Scientists are claiming to have discovered a new species, the black-tailed antechinus, which is said to be only found in high-altitude, wet areas in the Springbrook National Park between northern New South Wales and the Gold Coast Hinterland. Andrew Baker of Queensland University of Technology said researchers are applying for an endangered species listing while they conduct more research.</p>
<p>They probably follow the typical pattern of antechinus, which is all males are dead before they turn one year old,&#8221; he said adding usually antechinus have a &#8220;frenzied mating period&#8221; when they are about 11 months old, and &#8220;all males will die before the young are born&#8221;. Baker said it is not yet known how many of the species exist, but he describes them as &#8220;quite striking&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tail emerges from a body that is very shaggy, very hairy, with really long guard hairs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On the rump of the animal it becomes almost an orangey-brown colour, but where the tail emerges from the rump there is quite a distinct change from orange rump to black tail. &#8220;It&#8217;s a very short-furred tail and they have black feet as well.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988159&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/eddy480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988139" alt="Eddy tablet" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/eddy480.jpg" /></a> &#8216;Eddy introduces the concept of responsible technology, ensuring a safe and controlled technology experience for children with a strong focus on learning&#8217;
<p>If your child is more than 18 months old and you use a smartphone, iPad or an Android tablet, chances are your devices will have more apps for the use of your little one than for yourself. With game-based learning thought to be the future of education, apps for children have an ever-growing market. Going a step further, the market now has a tablet that caters only to children aged two to 10 years.</p>
<p>My tech-savvy two-and-a-half-year-old son has taken to Eddy like a fish takes to water. I was always apprehensive of giving my iPhone, Nexus 7 or his father’s iPad to him, fearing he would straightaway go to YouTube for his ‘ABC songs’ and Masha and Medved cartoons and in the process end up getting exposed to inappropriate content on the Internet. This new tablet launched last month by Delhi-based education start-up Metis Learning relieves me of this worry.</p>
<p>Eddy claims to be the first Android-based learning tablet for kids and has been designed by educators. Its content is linked to school curriculum, and a child can read books, learn to play musical instruments and also practise mathematics through games on the device.</p>
<p>“Eddy introduces the concept of responsible technology, ensuring a safe and controlled technology experience for children with a strong focus on learning,” says Metis Learning CEO Bharat Gulia.</p>
<p>Here is a lowdown on the product from a parent’s point of view.</p>
<p><b> <a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/eddy4801.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1988141" alt="Eddy tablet" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/eddy4801.jpg?w=480&#038;h=358" width="480" height="358" /></a></b></p>
<p><b>Net-safe:</b> Though Internet-enabled, the device does not allow my son to access regular tablet features without parental approval, keeping him away from social media sites, Internet and unwanted apps. Coming pre-loaded with the Maxthon Kid Safe Web browser, Eddy provides a violence-free and controlled environment.</p>
<p><b>Monitoring: </b>The first thing you do on the tablet is to customise the device as per the age of the child. It also lets me monitor my son’s activities on the device through detailed reports.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/edy480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1988142" alt="Eddy tablet" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/edy480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=375" width="480" height="375" /></a></b></p>
<p><b>Disciplined usage:</b> The best feature I have found on this tablet is that it allows me to decide how long I want my son to use the device for. I can set the permissible number of hours per day or week and even allot exact time slots.</p>
<p><b>Choice of apps:</b> If my child finds one subject too engaging and gets hooked to it, spending most of the time on it, I have the power to block that particular app and promote another. My son likes the language and maths subjects most and I can keep changing apps in each section.</p>
<p><b>Sharing:</b> Eddy gives me an option to create multiple profiles. The feature is not of much use to me but kids with siblings can share the device using the separate profiles created according to age. A maximum of three profiles can be created.</p>
<p><b>Notable features</b></p>
<p>Over 150 pre-loaded apps selected from popular and recommended ones used worldwide</p>
<p>Access to Google Play through the ‘Parent Zone’</p>
<p>Comes with Kids Radar &#8212; a proprietary recommendation engine that helps find new apps according to age, subject and price.</p>
<p><b>Thumbs up</b></p>
<p>Approved by ophthalmologists</p>
<p>Made of food-grade material looking at child safety and drop-safe due to its shock-absorbing sturdy cover</p>
<p><b>Spoilers</b></p>
<p>At Rs 9,999 (introductory price), the device is costlier than several regular tablets</p>
<p>Comes with a specific old-world Nokia-like pin charger, cannot be charged using any other one.</p>
<p>Somehow, iOS seems to have the best apps for kids. But then Eddy runs Android.</p>
<p><b>Specifics</b></p>
<p>A 7” IPS touchscreen (1024 x 600)</p>
<p>0.3 MP front camera and 2 MP back camera</p>
<p>Android 4.2 OS</p>
<p>3200 mAH battery/3.7V Lithium (ensures 4 hours of usage on full charge)</p>
<p>1.6 GHZ dual core processor</p>
<p>1 GB RAM</p>
<p>8 GB storage extendable up to 32 GB with Micro SD card (can install up to 350 apps at a time)</p>
<p>WiFI enabled (54 Mbps), external 3G SD card slot</p>
<p>1xMicro USB</p>
<p>1&#215;3.5 mm earphone jack</p>
<p>Currently being used in select Delhi schools, the device can be brought online from <a href="http://www.eddytablet.com" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0260a8;"><b>Eddy Tablet</b></span></a> and <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/news/eddy-for-my-kiddie-a-mom-s-view-of-the-first-android-learning-tablet-for-children/1227333/www.amazon.in" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0260a8;"><b>amazon</b></span></a></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988137&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/portrait-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987542" alt="Lupita Nyong'o poses for a portrait at the 86th Oscars Nominees Luncheon, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/portrait-480.jpg" /></a> Lupita Nyong&#8217;o poses for a portrait at the 86th Oscars Nominees Luncheon, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (AP)
<p>Gaurav Mishra, Technical Officer with Nikon India tells you how to take stunning portraits&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Mainly while shooting portraits, photographers should get a good hold of aperture on which depth of field and exposure both depends. To make this job easier Aperture Priority Auto Exposure mode (A mode) can be a good idea. In A mode photographer has the liberty to control aperture while camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed. In camera, one can set Picture Control to portrait and get the best possible natural colors in camera itself. Further the photographer can control sharpness, saturation, brightness, contrast and hue even before clicking the portrait.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: </strong>Preferably, the best lenses for portrait photography are the fixed focal length lenses. Though the kit lens provided with camera produce good high quality portraits, but once can look and try fixed focal length lenses with faster aperture like f/2.8, f/1.8 or even f/1.4 to produce nice astonishing Bokeh in the back ground. From NIKKOR line-up one can look for AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G lens and other prime lenses, which can easily fit in pocket and can make portraits like a pro.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> To or not to take portraits always with shallower depth of filed! Taking portraits with shallow depth of field can make your portraits stand out of the background, also if you want to explore your creativity and want to include background elements in the frame, greater depth in your composition can do the needful. Environmental portrait photography has been one of the most admired and tried by world known big shots.  This type of photography is used to establish the character of your portraits in their surroundings. It is generally achieved by keeping the portrait/person in less than 50 per cent of the total frame and including background in focus by choosing higher f-numbers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987535&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Good displays aren't only about pixels...<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987422&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hd480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987428" alt="HD vs Full HD" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hd480.jpg" /></a> A mobile phone&#8217;s display depends on various factors apart from the pixels.
<p dir="ltr">Apparently, the next lot of smartphones might just come with 2K screens—these are displays with a resolution of 2560&#215;1440 pixels. A company named Vivo has already demoed such a phone, while rumours are flying around that Samsung&#8217;s next flagship might have it too. To me, it&#8217;s all a little ridiculous.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Good Displays Aren&#8217;t Only About Pixels</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ever since Apple came out with a &#8220;Retina Display&#8221; and touted its &#8220;ppi&#8221; (pixels per inch), everyone has been going nuts trying to cram more pixels into a screen. And generally, yes, the more pixels in a given space, the sharper the image will look. But pixels or resolution aren&#8217;t the only things that go into making a good screen. I&#8217;ve seen many phones that have qVGA (960&#215;540) resolution look better than an HD (1280&#215;720) screen. And the same goes for HD displays that look better than FullHD (1920&#215;1080) screens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A mobile phone&#8217;s display depends on various factors apart from the pixels. There&#8217;s the type of panel used—you&#8217;ve probably heard of jargon like AMOLED, LCD, IPS and more being thrown around. There&#8217;s the image processor, like Sony&#8217;s touted Mobile Bravia Engine. Even the type of scratch-resistant glass coating has an effect on the quality of the display. Several factors have to come together to make for a good-looking display and just amping up one—like the resolution—isn&#8217;t going to help.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>So Why Are Pixels Talked About So Much</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There&#8217;s a pretty simple explanation for why resolution becomes the most talked-about factor: it has cold numbers where bigger is better. It&#8217;s really that simple. In cameras, the technology behind producing a good image is much more than what your megapixel count is, but we have reached a point where most people mistakenly believe &#8220;more megapixels = better camera.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Similarly, in displays, the rest of the technology involved isn&#8217;t easy to understand or explain—even in the course of research for this article, I haven&#8217;t got a grasp on all aspects yet. But a simple measure of numbers, where bigger is better, is something anyone can easily digest and hence this is the point which companies like to boast.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Real-World Test</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I have long maintained that for phones around 5 inches, it is difficult to tell an HD screen apart from a FullHD one unless you are going to be inspecting it very closely. Most people would hold the phone at the level of their elbow or perhaps a few inches closer. At that distance, I reckoned that an HD and a FullHD screen can&#8217;t easily be told apart. With intense scrutiny, yes, but for regular usage, it doesn&#8217;t make much of a difference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So I put my theory to test by laying out eight 5-inch phones and one 5.2-inch phone next to each other, some of which were HD and some of which were FullHD. They were all running the same game or ebook, and most people weren&#8217;t able to tell the difference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I replicated this test one more time with the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/the-quick-read-review-samsung-galaxy-grand-2/">Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 </a>and its 5.2-inch HD screen, pitting it against the Micromax Canvas Turbo&#8217;s 5-inch FullHD screen. Without mentioning resolutions or sizes, I asked people which of the two phones had a better screen. Of the 13 people who saw both, 12 picked the Grand 2 as a better display. The reason was either because it&#8217;s &#8220;more colourful&#8221; or &#8220;looks brighter.&#8221;<br />
Yup, the screen with the lower resolution was almost unanimously the one people liked more.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What This Means For You</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The point, of course, is that resolution or pixel counts alone do not make a better screen. In some cases, there is a noticeable difference—like when you compare a WVGA (800&#215;480) screen with an HD one. But especially at HD resolution on 5-inch screens, it becomes difficult to tell those apart from a FullHD one. If you go up in size, perhaps FullHD would matter more, like with a 6-inch smartphone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So the next time you are shopping for a phone and if it&#8217;s around 5 inches, as long as the resolution says &#8220;HD&#8221; or 1280&#215;720 pixels, start to look at the other features. Spending any extra or buying inferior processors and RAM for the pleasure of a FullHD screen is not the smart decision.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987422&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/park480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987641" alt="Samsung South West Asia CEO B D Park at Samsung Forum in Bali" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/park480.jpg" /></a> Samsung South West Asia CEO B D Park at Samsung Forum in Bali
<p>Samsung on Tuesday showed it is not one to rest on its laurels. Having made the smartphone space its own in India, the company now seems all set to capture the enterprise computing segment where tablets have for some time been touted as the next big thing.</p>
<p>At the annual Samsung Forum in Bali, B D Park, Samsung Electronics&#8217; president and CEO for South West Asia, said the company will focus on bringing in smarter experiences for its customers, of which there are more and more every year. No wonder then that the company has recently been touted as the eighth most valuable in the World.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s big ticket announcement was the Samsung Galaxy NotePRO, a 12.2-inch tablet that seems to be aimed at the enterprise segment due to its productivity-centric features. It is also expensive, meaning it will keep away the &#8216;non-serious&#8217; buyers. Country head Vineet Taneja estimated that the serious buyers, who need the productivity, would be at least 100,000. For a tablet that cost Rs 64,900, that would be a good place to start at.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/samsung-ups-the-ante-on-tablets-with-galaxy-notepro-galaxy-tab3-neo-launches/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung ups the ante on tablets with Galaxy NotePRO, Galaxy Tab3 Neo launches</strong></a></p>
<p>The company also showed its intent to capture more space in the camera segment. It announced a new NX30 mirrorless camera along with the Galaxy Camera 2, the second version of its innovative connected camera. Prices of these devices will be announced closer to the launch, Taneja said.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1987614" alt="NotePRO" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/notepro.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></p>
<p>The other main announcements are:</p>
<p>&#8211;A 5-inch <a title="Samsung Forum: Samsung ushers in Neo update for Galaxy Grand, Galaxy Note3" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/samsung-forum-samsung-ushers-in-neo-update-for-galaxy-grand-galaxy-note3/" target="_blank">Galaxy Grand Neo</a> at Rs 18,450, to be available in India by May end.</p>
<div id=":146">&#8211; A seven-inch Tab3 Neo aimed at the youth and priced at Rs 16,490.</div>
<p>&#8211;Vineet Taneeja also launched the Samsung Note 3 Neo with updated features and access to local Club Samsung content. This 5.5-inch phablet is priced at Rs 40,900. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/samsung-forum-samsung-ushers-in-neo-update-for-galaxy-grand-galaxy-note3/" target="_blank">Read more</a></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1987674" alt="tv" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/tv.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></p>
<p>&#8211;Curved screens are being touted as the next big things in the television segment. So Samsung has not wasted time in announcing its new Curved UDH TVs in 78, 65 and 55 inch sizes for India. Rajeev Bhutani, the company Director Sales in India, said the curved screen will offer a more immersed viewing experience.</p>
<p>&#8211;There is also a new HW-H600 SoundStand for large screen televisions, as well as a MX-HS9000 sound system for those who like really loud sound.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung has managed to fit slightly larger screen in Grand 2 while maintaining same overall profile as original Galaxy Grand.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986701&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/galaxy480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986710" alt="Samsung Galaxy Grand 2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/galaxy480.jpg" /></a> The Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 has a better-than-average antenna, picking up signals where most phones struggle to.
<p dir="ltr">For its price, the first Samsung Galaxy Grand was a disappointment given its low-resolution screen without scratch-resistant glass, an underwhelming processor, and poor battery life. Can its successor bring some success?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 5.2-inch display (1280&#215;720 pixels, 280 ppi) | 1.2GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor | 1.5GB RAM | 8GB storage + microSD slot (up to 64GB) | 8MP rear camera (1080p FullHD video), 1.9MP front camera (1080p FullHD video) | 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Wi-Di, Bluetooth 4.0 | GPS with A-GPS | 2600mAh battery | Android 4.3 Jelly Bean with TouchWiz UI</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Design:</strong> Samsung has managed to fit a slightly larger screen in the Galaxy Grand 2 while maintaining the same overall profile as the original Galaxy Grand. That extra screen space isn&#8217;t immediately noticeable, but the smaller bezels do look good. The disappointment is that it&#8217;s gone back to the &#8220;plastic-y&#8221; roots. With the Galaxy Note 3 and <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/the-quick-read-review-the-new-samsung-galaxy-note-10-1-is-all-about-style-and-stylus/">Galaxy Note 10.1</a>, Samsung introduced a new faux leather finish on the back that makes the phones feel a bit premium. And while the Grand 2 looks the same from a distance, it doesn&#8217;t feel like leather at all—it&#8217;s just textured plastic. The only thing in it&#8217;s favour is that it&#8217;s matte and not glossy plastic.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Screen:</strong> The 5.2-inch screen of the Grand 2 sports 1280&#215;720 pixels or HD resolution. Now, there are plenty of screens at this size and price which boast FullHD (1920&#215;1080 pixels) resolution, but in my opinion, <a href="http://linklinklink">HD is good enough</a>. While there is an easily noticeable difference between the 800&#215;480 px resolution of Grand and the HD screen of the Grand 2, that&#8217;s not the case when it comes to the Grand 2 and other screens with a FullHD display. That said, there is one disappointing aspect of the Grand 2—extremely poor sunlight legibility. Also, Corning does not list the Grand 2 among the devices with a Gorilla Glass surface. However, there is definitely some sort of scratch-resistant glass on the device (perhaps the less common Dragontail) and it did a good job of protecting the screen in our tests, which included a drop and carrying it in pockets with keys and open pen drives.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Performance:</strong> In a significant step up from its predecessor, the Galaxy Grand 2&#8242;s processor and RAM have been boosted for performance that won&#8217;t leave you wanting in any aspect. The device received an update in the middle of our review process. Before the update, it would lag at times and be sluggish when multi-tasking between heavy apps. After the update, it&#8217;s been buttery smooth and will serve any power user well.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Memory:</strong> The 8GB of internal memory takes up about 2.4GB for preloaded apps and the TouchWiz UI, but the rest is still available to you. And you can pop in a microSD card as well. The end result is enough memory to keep you happy for a long, long time.<br />
<strong>Connectivity:</strong> The Galaxy Grand 2 has a better-than-average antenna, picking up signals where most phones struggle to. The voice on both ends was also crystal clear.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Software:</strong> Samsung&#8217;s TouchWiz UI is brilliant on the likes of the Galaxy Note series, where the S-Pen stylus and the large screen size can combine to really take advantage of the various preloaded feature. In the Grand 2, that&#8217;s not the case. You can still make use of the Multi-Window feature to an extent, but I didn&#8217;t find myself availing of that option. Apart from that, it&#8217;s the same TouchWiz that has always been—pick up any Samsung device and you&#8217;ll know what you&#8217;re in for.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Camera:</strong> The Grand 2 has a good camera for its price, taking photos that are clear in broad daylight and decent at night. While noise is an issue that plagues it like most handsets, this device does a better job of capturing colours, with just the right amount of hue and saturation. Video recording is also what you&#8217;d expect, with no major complaints on that front—again, like with all handsets, recording audio from sources not directly in line with the microphone is a problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Battery:</strong> The biggest improvement in the Galaxy Grand 2 is the new 2600mAh battery. The original Grand didn&#8217;t have good battery life but the Grand 2 easily lasts for over 15 hours on a single charge. On pure video playback, it ran for just about 5 hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Verdict:</strong> At Rs. 22,990, the Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 gets most things right with the poor sunlight legibility and plastic build being the only things that mars the experience. Those aside, this is a wonderful smartphone. I wouldn&#8217;t worry too much about HD vs. FullHD, especially given the great camera, battery life and performance that the Grand 2 offers. And if the price seems a bit high, remember, you get a reputable brand with proven after-sales support.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986701&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986125&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nokia_lumia_525_shot.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986128" alt="Nokia Lumia 525 is the successor to the Nokia Lumia 520 " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nokia_lumia_525_shot.jpg" /></a> Nokia Lumia 525 is the successor to the Nokia Lumia 520
<p>The successor to the world&#8217;s most popular Windows Phone device, Nokia Lumia 520, is here. Lumia 525 is Nokia&#8217;s attempt to refine the 520 and address its shortcomings without increasing the price. At Rs 10,399, the 525 is priced competitively and is more powerful than its predecessor. Let&#8217;s see how much of a difference that makes to your experience, should you choose to buy it.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> Micro-SIM | 4-inch IPS LCD capacitive touchscreen (800&#215;480 pixels) | Windows Phone 8 | 1 GB RAM | 8 GB storage | microSD slot (up to 64 GB supported) | 5-MP autofocus rear camera | 1,430 mAh battery</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> It is hard to tell the Lumia 520 and 525 apart. The two phones have the same dimensions, weigh the same and look the same. The buttons are in the same place, just like the charging and audio ports. But when you hold them, you will notice the difference. The Lumia 520&#8242;s body is made of glossy plastic (unless you get a black 520), which means it is slippery. The 525 has a different finish, which provides better grip. One complaint is that the lock button feels a little weak. Many 520 users complained of the button going soft after six to eight months of use. Let&#8217;s hope that users don&#8217;t face the same problem with the 525. Nokia&#8217;s bright colours have become distinctive now.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nokia-lumia-525-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1986129" alt="Nokia-Lumia-525-2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nokia-lumia-525-2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=498" width="480" height="498" /></a>Display:</strong> The 4-inch screen has with a resolution of 800&#215;480 pixels. This is good enough for reading, watching videos and gaming. When you&#8217;re using the phone in bright sunlight, you&#8217;ll have trouble reading on the screen. Of course, a higher resolution would have been welcome, but you won&#8217;t notice it unless you are downgrading from an expensive phone with a better display. When you tilt the phone a bit, you&#8217;ll notice white light bleeding from the top. This is a minor annoyance, which you&#8217;ll not notice unless you look for it.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Having 1 GB RAM greatly improves gaming performance. Last year, several developers had to optimise their games to run on phones with 512 MB RAM because of the Lumia 520. There will be no such issue this year. Games such as <em>Temple Run 2, Rail Rush</em> and <em>Angry Birds Go!</em> are playable on the Lumia 525, although minor stutters were noticed some times. The phone did not show any lags when running several applications and switching between them.</p>
<p><strong>Memory:</strong> Lumia 525 has 8 GB internal storage and supports a microSD card of up to 64 GB. This is sufficient for most people. Once every two or three months, you will have to remove apps you don&#8217;t use to free up space. Other than that, as long as you&#8217;re storing photos and videos on the microSD card, the phone should not run out of space.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> Windows Phone 8 has received crucial updates in the past year. One of these has cured the OS of the other storage bug that would eat up all space on your phone. The OS works well and we did not face any random reboots or stutters. I could not synchronise contacts from my Google account with the Lumia 525. Instead, I used the Transfer My Data app to pull contacts from my primary phone. Apart from chat apps such as WhatsApp, most apps worked well on Lumia 525. With chat apps, notifications were often delayed. Every time I opened WhatsApp, I found several unread messages for which I had not received notifications.</p>

<p><strong>Camera:</strong> The Lumia 525&#8242;s camera is similar to the one on its predecessor. The 5-MP autofocus camera takes satisfactory pictures in daylight with good colour reproduction. However, pictures lost details when clicked in low light. Pictures shot at night were grainy. Lumia 525 does not have a front camera, so if you love selfies or make a lot of video calls, this is not the best phone for you.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> The battery life of the Lumia 525 is satisfactory. It lasted a little less than a day on moderate use involving a few calls, gaming, browsing, social networks and chatting. Heavy use takes a toll on the battery, so it would be wise to invest in a portable battery pack.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Windows Phone has its shortcomings, but is a smooth and stable operating system. The Lumia 525 is an incremental upgrade over the 520, and is a good alternative to Android phones for the price (Rs 10,399). The 520 is still available for around Rs 8,000, in case you&#8217;re short on cash and gaming isn&#8217;t on your mind.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986125&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/05/m_id_382838_bbm.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1882838 " alt="M_Id_382838_BBM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/05/m_id_382838_bbm.jpg?w=600" /></a> BBM users can now make voice calls over Wi-fi or data
<p>On Valentine&#8217;s Day, BlackBerry made life a lot simpler, and cheaper, for lovers. The altest version of its popular BlackBerry Messenger will now let even Android and iPhone users make &#8216;free&#8217; voice calls to BBM contacts. It will be free if you are using it over Wi-Fi, but while it works over data connections too, overuse of this feature could lead to you exceeding your data limit sooner than you expected. So, the free comes with a catch.</p>
<p>BBM customers will also be able to share their live location for a specified amount of time with other BBM contacts by using location sharing, powered by Glympse, and will have 100 new emoticons available to help them say what’s on their mind. That would be handy if you still have a lot of friends on BBM, those who have not yet switched over to Whatsapp, Line or WeChat.</p>
<p>Actually, a lot of people are using multiple messaging services to keep in touch with different kinds of people. For instance, you can use BBM for office contacts, Line for family and WeChat for friends and so on. A lot of users do this segmentation to get a grip on their increasingly social lives.</p>
<p>The messaging segment saw another interesting news on the same day. Viber, the pioneer for voice over data services on smartphones, was picked up by<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/technology-others/viber-gets-picked-up-by-japans-e-commernce-giant-rakuten/" target="_blank"> Japan&#8217;s ecommerce company Rakuten</a>.</p>
<p>John Delaney, Associate VP, Mobility at research first IDC, says: &#8220;It looks like Viber is being bought for its user base, to whom Rakuten intends to sell digital goods such as games, emoticons and tokens. Rakuten will probably use a similar model to the one developed by, among others, the Japanese instant messenger service Line.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, he says, fits in neatly with Rakuten&#8217;s larger strategic objective of increasing the size of the international target market for its digital goods. &#8220;On the basis that the simplest ideas tend to be the most successful, this bodes well for a better outcome for this acquisition, than in the e-Bay/Skype case.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2005, e-Bay bought Skype, an  acquisition that didn&#8217;t end happily for e-Bay. The rationale for that deal was predicated on integrating Skype functionality into the e-Bay interface, to &#8220;reduce the friction for transactions&#8221;. But it never really came off, and eventually Skype was spun back out of e-Bay (to be acquired again later on, this time by Microsoft).</p>
<p>The two moves indicate that voice calls in messaging apps is a segment that is hotting up. As data services become more reliable in countries like India, you could see a larger number of people use these services to stay in touch with friends and family.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985874&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/blue-jam-plus-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985529" alt="Blue Jam PLUS-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/blue-jam-plus-480.jpg" /></a> HDMX Jam Plus costs Rs 3,990 per piece
<p>The writing is on the wall for large music systems and speaker sets. Actually, the pitch has been queering for this ubiquitous technology of the last many decades thanks to the mobile phone and its universe of accessories. For a couple of years now Bluetooth headphones have become the primary loudspeaker in many homes around the world. Of late, the price of these small and large audio devices has been coming down. We are now entering an interesting era with these small little devices, as they try to connect between each other to enhance your audio experience manifold.</p>
<p>I was a bit apprehensive trying out the HDMX Jam Plus, as I was not all that impressed by the audio quality of the HDMX Jam Party when I tested it out last year. But like all of HDMX’s devices, this one too is a design classic. It actually looks a bit like a jam jar and actually comes packed in a jar.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jam1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1985530" alt="jam1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jam1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=443" width="480" height="443" /></a>The base and top have a rubberised finish. All functional buttons are in front and the lights behind it tell you when the device is pairing or when the battery is draining. A very functional design that shows how simple design can be very effective.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jam4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1985537" alt="jam4" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jam4.jpg?w=475&#038;h=264" width="475" height="264" /></a>But the really interesting feature here is the fact is that two of these Jam Plus units can pair between themselves to become a stereo system of sorts. This doesn’t mean you need to buy two pieces at all times. The Jam Plus works alone too as any Bluetooth speaker. If you have just one speaker, then you need to switch the button at the base to Mono.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jam2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1985531" alt="jam2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jam2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=406" width="480" height="406" /></a>To play two speakers in tandem one of the devices need to set to Left and the other to Right. Switch on the speakers one after the other and they will pair within a few minutes. After this, when you search for devices to pair with from a phone, tablet or laptop, it will appear as a single device under the name Jam 2. Quite simple.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/photo-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1985532" alt="photo 3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/photo-3.jpg?w=443&#038;h=600"   /></a>A single Jam Plus is good enough for listening to music in a small room or for amplifying the what is running on any smart device. The audio quality is pretty decent and does not jarr at high volumes like some other speakers of this device. When two of them are playing together, obviously you have better sound. But I could not make out left-right splits when the files being played clearly had it. But overall the experience was enjoyable.</p>
<p>I would not suggest that you buy both these devices to run as a stereo system, there are other devices that do this very well like the Portronics PureSound Pro which we reviewed recently. But if you need to buy multiple Bluetooth speakers, then opt for these as then it gives you the added advantage of running a stereo set up when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Rs 3,990 per piece</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985522&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/windows8.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985263" alt="Viber has over 16 million users in India" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/windows8.png" /></a> Viber has over 16 million users in India
<p>Viber, an app that gained global popularity by letting its users make voice calls over data, has been acquired by Japan&#8217;s e-commerce giant Rakuten, Inc.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Company will acquire Viber for a total consideration of $900 million and will hold 100% of Viber’s outstanding voting stock and underwrite a new issue of shares,&#8221; a release from the Japanese company said.</p>
<p>Rakuten said the company decided to acquire Viber to strengthen its global platform through the use of Viber’s range of customers in the company’s E-commerce and digital contents services. Viber has 280 million global registered users and 100 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>Rakuten has e-commerce interests in at least four continents and has clearly stated ambitions to become the &#8220;no. 1 Internet services company in the world&#8221;.</p>
<p>Acquiring one of the top messaging apps in the world, is clearly a step in consolidating the two users bases. In fact, South Korea&#8217;s Kakao talk, one of the most monetised messaging apps in the world, is also a succesful e-commerce platform. It seems Rakuten seems to have been inspired by the success of the this company from its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Viber has over 16 million users in India and the company has goals of doubling its user base here by the end of this year. But off late the company has not been doing all that well with players like Whatsapp, Line and WeChat all adding voice to their messaging platforms. Viber still has an edge over other platforms due to its ability to be accessed from all devices and operating systems.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985262&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/m_id_450017_bharti_airtel.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1955543" alt="M_Id_450017_Bharti_Airtel" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/m_id_450017_bharti_airtel.jpg" /></a> 10 GB of data at 4G speeds will cost Rs 1,000
<p>Airtel has launched 4G services in Bangalore, but limited it to those using the latest Apple iPhones, the 5c and the 5s. India&#8217;s largest private telecom operator, says its services will enable users in India&#8217;s tech capital to stream high definition video with zero buffering. while these are 4G services, the Apple iPhone users have the added advantage of having to pay only 3G rates for the same.</p>
<p>Customers will have to upgrade to a 4G SIM to enjoy the higher speeds, but will not have to change their existing data plan, Airtel said. The company claims the speeds will be so fast that you can download 10 movies in less than 30 minutes and use the wi-fi hotspot features in these phones effectively connecting multiple devices to the network.</p>
<p>Customers on 2G/GPRS data plans/packs can opt for any of the 3G plans/packs available and enjoy 4G speeds, Airtel said. For heavy data users there is a new plan offering 10 GB of data at 4G speeds for Rs 1,000. However, remember that at 4G speeds, you can exhaust this limit within a few hours if not careful.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the company said that while data browsing will be on 4G network, voice calls will be routed on 2G/3G with the CSFB (circuit switched fall back) technology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985159&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Trriger T-32 is a decent gaming mouse. Not many buttons, but quite affordable. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1984849&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/trrigert32.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1984901" alt="Trriger T32 gaming mouse is priced at Rs 1,500" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/trrigert32.jpg" /></a> Trriger T32 gaming mouse is priced at Rs 1,500
<p dir="ltr">Over the past few years I have used and reviewed quite a few gaming mouses, even though I am not a great gaming enthusiast. Though I have always loved the comfort of these large mouses, their price tags have put me off purchasing one for myself. So when I got to review the new  Trriger gaming mouse T-32, which has a more affordable Rs 1,500 price tag, I struck on the wonderful idea of trying to use it in the office. Here are the results:</p>
<p dir="ltr">I usually spent over 12 hours in front of the computer and along with affecting my eyesight, it has also given me multiple bouts of carpal tunnel syndrome that leads to severe pain in the wrist. This is why the comfort and easy hand resting posture of a gaming mouse has always appealed to me.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The T-32 is a bit big, but then it gives a good groove to rest the thumb. Just next to the thumb are the back and next buttons. The left and right click buttons too have curves that ease your fingers into place. There is a roller between the two to make page scrolls easy. Just behind is a button to change the DPI.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><iframe width="480" height="411" src="//www.thinglink.com/card/490779500892651521" type="text/html" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">The mouse is smooth and responsive. It also moves easily on any surface. But this means that for anyone using the mouse for long hours, you don’t get tired pushing the cursor more than needed. There is a gaming pad that comes in the box in case you want to use if for traditional gaming.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In an office environment, where you are browsing through a lot of web pages, the back and next buttons are a boon. The only problem is that you have to remember to use them at the right time. The roller is also great when you are going through large excel sheets or reading a rather long articles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For full-fledged gamers, the T-32 might not seem that impressive as it has just five customisable keys. In contrast, something like the Vengeance M90 has 15. But then, not everyone wants an M90, nor is everyone willing to spend that much just to score better in a game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We suggest this gaming mouse for those who are halfway between an amateur and an avid gamer. And since this doesn’t cost all that much, we suggest you try this for things beyond gaming.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1984849&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp-slate1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1983901" alt="The HP Slate6 VoiceTab phablets are being launched first in India" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp-slate1.jpg" /></a> The HP Slate6 VoiceTab phablets are being launched first in India
<p>HP, the tech giant that it is, can choose not to call its new 6-inch device a smartphone, or even a phablet, but we are pretty sure that the <a href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/hp-launches-two-android-tablets-with-calling-from-india/1218471/">HP Slate 6 Voice Tab </a>is one. And a good one at that too. Here is why.</p>
<p><strong>It looks and feels like a smartphone:</strong> If you had doubts of what the Slate 6 VoiceTab would look like, you would be disappointed when you opened the box. For it looks like any other six-inch smartphone, the Sony Xperia Z or the HTC One Max. Six inches means any adult can easily grip the phone and make a call. Six inches means you can afford not to invest in a tablet to go along with your phone. The Slate 6 has superb build quality, the kind you would expect from a company like HP which has always dabbled with premium devices. But we are not so sure about the bling factor. There is a champagne finish metallic frame that runs around that device along with a shiny texture back. Not for everyone I would say.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp-slate3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1983903" alt="hp-slate3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp-slate3.jpg?w=447&#038;h=600" width="447" height="600" /></a>It does everything that a phone does:</strong> Seven inch tablets with voice are primarily tablets that let you make voice calls too. That is meant for people who would use the device primary for tablet-like data-heavy uses. With the Slate 6, you don’t have to make that sacrifice. Use it just as a phone and you would be quite happy. Yes, it is difficult to make calls with one hand. But people won’t stare at you if you keep this device to your ear, unlike those using a tiffin box-sized tablet for the same. The audio quality is really good, and that is a plus for all tablets with voice don’t do all that well on this front. In other words, you can use this as a phone without a Bluetooth device, that is almost a prerequisite with voice tabs. Plus, it has two SIM slots. How many tablets do you know that do that?</p>
<p><strong>Its performance rivals top-end smartphones:</strong> Any tablet with voice calling will have the performance of a tablet, which often is not at par with that of a smartphone. It won’t take you long to realise that the Slate 6 is different. It is not powered by a Quallcomm or MediaTek processor, but the Marvell PXA1088 1.2Ghz Quad Core is fast and slick. The multi-tasking that Android 4.3 affords you is seamless and easy thanks to the powerful processor. If benchmarks scores are your dope, then let me tell you that the scores are what you would find in the best mid-range phones. That would be above the Samsung Galaxy S2 and below Google Nexus 4, numbers almost impossible to achieve for the present day voice tablets. Use the Full HD screen for gaming or to watch a HD video, you won’t be disappointed with the graphics quality or the overall experience. Plus, it has two front firing speakers that are never seen in tablets.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp-slate2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1983902" alt="hp-slate2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp-slate2.jpg?w=333&#038;h=600" width="333" height="600" /></a>It is also priced like a smartphone:</strong> Of late, seven-inch voice tablets have been priced quite affordably. But the Slate 6 is priced more like a middle segment smartphone at a very competitive Rs 22,999.</p>
<p><strong>However, it has the camera of tablet:</strong> With all those smartphone like features listed above you would expect this device to have at least a 8MP camera. But that is not the case. It seems this where HP decided to cut corners, as the rear camera has a measly 5MP sensor. Compare this to the other six-inchers that sport 13MP and so on. The results are decent in daylight and very so-so indoors and in low light. In artificial light it lacks clarity and that is very dissapointng. And yes, it reminds me of tablets, not smartphones.</p>
<p><strong>It also has the battery of  a tablet, and that is good:</strong> This is one of the best features of this device. The 3000 mAh battery can easily last 36 hours with decent use. It will last more if you are using it like a second device. If only more smartphones behaved this way.</p>
<p><strong><iframe width="480" height="267" src="//www.thinglink.com/card/490384491756388352" type="text/html" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></strong></p>
<p><strong>So should you buy this as a tablet or a smartphone:</strong> If you are looking for a tablet that can make calls once in a while then look for cheaper options. But if you want smartphone that is as good as a tablet, then this is a good option that is much cheaper than than the Samsung Galaxy Note 3, the clear leaders in this segment. But the device is good value for money without an element of doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Specs:</strong> 6-inch 720p HD IPS screen | 1.2GHz quad-core Marvell PXA1088 processor | 1GB RAM | 16GB storage + microSD slot (64GB) | 5MP rear camera, 2MP front camera | Dual SIM slots 2G/3G | 3000 mAh battery | Android 4.3 |  Buletooth 3.0, WiFi &#8211; 802.11b/g/n &amp; WAPI, GPS&amp;AGPS<br />
<strong>Rs 22,999</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1983851&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini is a good-looking phone with a decent lineup of specs<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1983963&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/micro4151.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1983965" alt="Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/micro4151.jpg" /></a> Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini
<p>Among the Indian handset makers, Micromax is now a force to reckon with. Right from the entry level to the premium—the company has been churning out handsets for every segment at a breakneck speed. The company’s successful Canvas series— the mid-to-premium smartphone range, now has a new entrant—the Canvas Turbo Mini (A 200), which I took out for a spin.</p>
<p>Apart from its minimalist white packaging, the first thing that struck me was how light the phone felt in hand. I incidentally started looking for the battery, only to discover both that and the back cover are non-removable. The device looked extremely slim and Micromax has to be given credit for doing a good job with the design. Complementing the phone’s white and silver body, it has made the accessories in white. However, the metallic silver back, which, inspite of looking far better than the run-of-the-mill Android 5-inchers, was slippery to hold. Perhaps using a sturdy back cover would be prudent.</p>
<p>Younger sibling of the highly-praised Canvas Turbo, the Canvas Turbo Mini offers dual SIM capabilities—one normal and one micro SIM. I thought this feature was a useful one, which would save users from the trouble of getting one of their SIM cards cut. Calls went without a hitch and voice quality was good.</p>
<p>The Canvas Turbo Mini has a 4.7 inch, IPS HD screen with a resolution of 1280 by 720. The display was sharp, colours looked vivid and crisp, and viewing angles were pretty good. However, I felt full-HD was required here. The R15,000-smartphone market is cut-throat and competitors in this segment are offering full-HD options.</p>
<p>Running on Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2, the phone does not offer a pure Android experience. The stock interface has been heavily customised, which did not work for me. The app icons and phone dialler had an iOS-like feel to it. Not sure if that was intentional.</p>
<p>A 1.3 GHz quad-core processor with 1GB of RAM powers the phone. Multitasking between apps was fine and performance was snappy. A couple of windows on Chrome and a constant swapping between Subway Surfers, Temple Run 1 and 2 worked well, with a few lags here and there.</p>
<iframe width="480" height="401" src="//www.thinglink.com/card/490402980638490624" type="text/html" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe>
<p>I was very pleased with the 8 MP primary camera. Pictures taken were quite good, even in low-lit conditions, thanks to the powerful flash. Even the 5-MP front camera, an exception in this range, performed above expectations. Picture effects like zero shutter delay, face detection, smile shot, self-timer and panorama should please the user.</p>
<p>Now for the major disappointments. The 1800mAH battery was a let-down, as this will not last a day for an average-to-high user. For a 5-inch HD phone, I felt Micromax should have given minimum 2000mAH battery, quite common at this price point. More disappointing was the 4-GB internal storage, out of which about 2.5 GB is free for the user. Competitors offer 8 GB, or even 16 GB internal storage at this price. I felt Micromax could have been more generous on these two areas.</p>
<p>A special word for the headphones included with the phone. They looked the same that comes with the low-priced phones and sound quality was below average. For a R15,000 phone, Micromax should have given better headphones.</p>
<p>Preloaded apps like BBM, Hike, Flashlight, Kingsoft Office, Opera Mini and Spuul were good add-ons. Although, why Facebook and Twitter was left out was a mystery. Some preloaded wallpapers were a delight.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini is a very good-looking device with an excellent camera and a good processor, but lacks a punch in a few vital areas like internal storage and battery. If you can overlook those, this could be a good choice. If not, you do have better options at this price point.</p>
<p><em>Estimated street price: Rs 14,999</em></p>

<p>Google on Thursday marked the 135th birth anniversary of freedom fighter and poet Sarojini Naidu with a doodle. She was born in Hyderabad on February 13, 1879.</p>
<p>The doodle has a caricature of the Naidu in place of the second O and a pen for L.</p>
<p>Sarojini Naidu, one of the leading lights of India&#8217;s freedom movement, was also called the Nightingale of India.</p>
<p>Of late, the frequency of India specific doodles seems to be going up. The last one was to mark <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/google-doodle-marks-indias-65th-republic-day-with-grand-parade/" target="_blank">Republic Day</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Google&#8217;s now-iconic doodle has become a cultural icon on its own, often an indicator of the global mood, at least the online kind. And that is something unprecedented for what is essentially just a corporate logo.</p>
<p>Strangely, the first doodle in 1998, was anything but an effort to make a cultural statement. The sticky figure drawing on the homepage then was just Google founders Larry and Sergey&#8217;s way of indicating that they would be attending the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert. The next doodle appeared in 2000 to mark Bastille Day and since then there have been 700 doodles that have rustled the imagination of people around the world. Over the years, doodles have tried to be funny, imaginative and interactive, always drawing appreciation from netizens.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1983793&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">In a release,  Chetan Krishnaswamy, Google India’s Country Head for Public Policy, said: “Through the Good to Know campaign, we want to help equip millions of new Internet users coming online in India with the knowledge and tools needed to become responsible digital citizens. Internet safety begins with exercising meaningful choices when online, having an open conversation about it with our families, and teaching them the basics such as using strong, unique passwords and not sharing personal information.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">J Satyanarayana, Secretary, Department of Electronics and IT, Ministry of Communications and IT called it an excellent initiative, while Dr. Gulshan Rai, DG, CERT-In said that while the potential of the Internet is immense, it is therefore important that we use the medium responsibly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Safer Internet Day, now in its eleventh year, is celebrated every February 11 to promote safer and more responsible use of online technology, especially amongst children and young people across the world.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1983429&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Scientists have developed a new smartphone called oPhone that can send scents through SMS, email or tweets. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1983364&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/smartphone-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1983371" alt="New smartphone can send scent notes over SMS. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/smartphone-480.jpg" /></a> New smartphone can send scent notes over SMS. (Reuters)
<p>In a breakthrough, scientists have developed a new kind of smartphone that can send scents via email, tweet, or text. A Paris laboratory under the direction of David Edwards, Michigan Technological University alumnus, has created the oPhone that allows odours &#8211; oNotes &#8211; to be sent, via Bluetooth and smartphone attachments, to oPhones across the globe.</p>
<p>The scents can be sent via email, tweet, or text, researchers said. &#8220;We create unique aromatic profiles,&#8221; said Blake Armstrong, director of business communications at Vapour Communications, an organisation operating out of Le Laboratorie (Le Lab) in Paris. &#8220;We put that into the oChip that faithfully renders that smell,&#8221; said Armstrong.</p>
<p>Edwards said that the initial four chips that will come with the first oPhones can be combined into thousands different odours &#8211; produced for 20 to 30 seconds &#8211; creating what he calls &#8220;an evolution of odour.&#8221; The secret is in accurate scent reproduction, locked in those chips plugged into the devices. Odours are first captured in wax after which they are perfected by an aroma expert at Le Lab, Marlene Staiger &#8211; who deconstructs the scents.</p>
<p>For example, with coffee, &#8220;the most universally recognised aroma,&#8221; she replaces words like &#8220;citrus&#8221; or &#8220;berry&#8221; with actual scents that will be created by ordering molecules and combining them in different percentages. &#8220;Imagine you are online and want to know what a particular brand of coffee would smell like. Or, you are in an actual long line waiting to order. You just tap on the oNote and get the experience,&#8221; Edwards said. The result for all oPhone recipients is a pure cloud of scent close to the device. Perhaps six inches in diameter, it is released and then disappears, retaining its personal and subtle aura.</p>
<p>Improvements are already planned for an end-of-year Beta release of the scent-transmitting phone to a limited audience. Researchers will be seeking feedback before a broader release in 2015.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1983364&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/xonpad7.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1983260" alt="Oplus XonPad 7 costs Rs 9,999 and that is the best feature  " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/xonpad7.jpg" /></a> Oplus XonPad 7 costs Rs 9,999 and that is the best feature
<p>With the value proposition that it presents, it is no surprise that almost every company wants to line up with seven inch tablets that offer voice calling too. The latest to enter the scene is a company called Oplus with its XonPad 7.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 7-inch (1280x800p) IPS screen | 1.2GHz quad-core processor | 1GB RAM | 16GB storage + microSD slot | 5MP rear camera, 2MP front camera | SIM slot | 3500 mAh battery | Android 4.2.2</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> From the front this is like any other seven-inch Android tablet. But the rear panel has a brushed metal finish which makes it look a bit like the Asus Fonepad 7. There is another differentiator, an Esc button just under the power and volume keys on the side. There is a groove at the bottom that holds micro-SD card and SIM slots.</p>
<p><strong><iframe width="480" height="763" src="//www.thinglink.com/card/490083670271459329" type="text/html" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen scrolling="no"></iframe></strong></p>
<p><strong>Screen:</strong> When the switch comes  to life it clearly screams HD. But the resolution sort of makes the fonts and icons seem a bit too small even at the largest size. We tried some Full HD videos from YouTube and the results were decent. However, you will have trouble figuring out stuff if you plan to use this out in the open.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> You cannot expect much from an Android device that is priced this low. But with a quad-core processor, the XonPad 7 is decent with multi tasking and gaming. It did freeze at times, that too in strange places like Google Play and settings. Since there are no touch buttons under the screen you will have trouble using it as a phone, especially when you are trying to reach your home screen in between a call. I later realised that this is why the Esc, button has been added at the side. It is almost an afterthought and tries to do what the back buttons does on most Android phones.</p>
<p><strong>Memory:</strong> There is internal memory of 16GB out of which above 3GB has been used by the OS and apps. The pre-installed apps are all classics like Fruit Ninja, Candy Crush and Angry Birds which you can delete without a second thought.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> The phone works on a regular 3G SIM and you can make and receive calls without much trouble. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth too work like they are supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> It is not the latest version of Android and you might have to upgrade soon after you purchase the device to stay current. There are no tweaks except for a stylish start screen that goes with the design language of the device. As mentioned earlier there some pre-loaded games which you can easily delete.</p>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong> Obviously, you are not buying this for the camera. If you are, then I cannot offer you much hope. All I can say is that some of the rear camera pictures came out like some filter had been applied on them. Both the cameras are useable and that is about it.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> The battery life is decent and should see if you back home if you intend to use it more like a phone and less as a tablet. If you use it for video consumption and games, then you will squeeze in eight to 10 hours at the most.</p>
<p><strong>Special Mention:</strong> The device has the weirdest SIM slot I have ever seen. The SIM card goes in, but there is no guarantee that it will come out when you want it to. I had to try all tricks in the book to get my precious MTNL card back. Maybe SIM cards should come with handles.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> I won’t go to the extent of saying this is a bad device, which it is not. But there are some quirks that make me think you should look at other options before you decide on this one. It will, however, be tough for you to get other HD screen at this price point.</p>
<p><strong>Rs 9,999</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1983258&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Lenovo is gradually shifting its focus to smartphones. Its latest, the Vibe Z, is a 5.5-inch device powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor clocked at 2.2 GHz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Equipped with high-speed LTE (4G) connectivity, the phone will also have a 13 MP rear camera with BSI sensor and dual LED flash. Lenovo has fitted the Vibe Z camera with a large f/1.8 aperture lens. The 5MP front camera has a 84° degree wide viewing angle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The phone won the ‘CRN 10 Show-Stopping Smartphones category’ at the recently-concluded CES 2014. That is because the phone has a thickness of 7.9 mm and weighing just 147 grams, despite its 5.5 inch display.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Android phone will be powered by an integrated 3000 mAh battery and lets you access data from a pen drive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Vibe Z smartphone is priced at Rs 35,999.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1983177&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony Corp is on a high following a report that it is in talks to supply more camera sensors to Apple Inc. Sony gained 2.2 percent and was the eighth most-traded stock in Japan&#8217;s Nikkei by turnover.</p>
<p>The Nikkei newspaper said Sony is in talks with Apple to double its supply of camera components for a new iPhone slated to roll out as early as next year.</p>
<p>Sony supplies nearly all of the CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) sensors for the current iPhone 5S&#8217;s rear-mounted main cameras.</p>
<p>Apple Inc could be looking to switch to Sony sensors for the secondary camera on the front, which currently uses parts from suppliers in the United States and elsewhere, the business daily said.</p>
<p>With more customers expected to use smartphones for video calls, Apple sounded out Sony about supplying more sensors, Nikkei said.</p>
<p>Sony held the largest share of the global CMOS sensor market in 2012 at 32.1 percent, according to Techno Systems Research. Sony has laid the groundwork for stepping up production to keep up with the increase in orders, Nikkei reported.</p>
<p>A request from Apple Inc was the reason for its January decision to purchase a plant from Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics, according to a source involved in the negotiations, the newspaper said. Sony also supplies to Samsung Electronics, the world&#8217;s No. 1 smartphone seller, and Huawei Technologies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1983087&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Great, the Apple iPhone 5c is now selling for Rs 5,000 less. That means the price of the latest Apple phone should be around 36,000 given its Rs 41,000 price tag.</p>
<p>But the fact is that the phone has taken a price cut, but not a Rs 5,000 price cut as some people might have you believe. A cheapest price for the iPhone 5c is Rs 39,250 on Amazon.in. That is something you can find with a simple search on Junglee.com, the search for online shopping portals in India.</p>
<p>There is however a seller on <a href="http://www.snapdeal.com/product/apple-iphone-5c-16-gb/1368707030/?pos=0;0;814">Snapdeal.in</a> who is offering the phone at Rs 37,950.</p>
<p>How this new price came to be reported in anybody&#8217;s guess. But all we can say is that even at Rs 39,000, the iPhone 5c is a good buy. If you don&#8217;t like the colours, which is putting off many sober buyers, then just get a good cover that matches you personality.</p>
<p>Yes, the Apple  iPhone 5c is still a good phone and much cheaper phone compared to the flagship iPhone 5s. Read our review to find out why?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/micro415.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1982389" alt="Microsoft" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/micro415.jpg" /></a> 20 per cent Indians said they were victims of online phishing attacks
<p>In support of  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/resources/sid.aspx" target="_blank">Safer Internet Day</a> (SID) on February 11, Microsoft has released the results of the third annual <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/resources/mcsi.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Computing Safer Index</a> (MCSI) that reveals impact of poor online safety behaviour. Microsoft is asking consumers to visit the new, interactive <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/saferonline" target="_blank">website</a> to “Do 1 Thing” today and make it part of their daily digital routine because education and guidance about how to avoid online risks remain key.<br />
According to the MCSI survey, the annual worldwide impact of phishing and various forms of identity theft could be as high as USD $5 billion, with the cost of repairing damage to peoples’ online reputation higher yet at nearly USD $6 billion, or an estimated average of USD $632 per loss.<br />
<em>Of the more than 10,000 consumers surveyed globally:</em><br />
* 20 per cent Indians said they were victims of online phishing attacks<br />
* 12 per cent Indians said they suffered identity theft at an average cost of Rs 7,500<br />
* Of the seven behavioural steps to secure oneself online, Indian respondents adopted an average three steps, and deployed an average of 3.2 technical tools out of a total of 12 available tools<br />
Globally, only 34 percent said they limit what strangers see on social networks and the amount of personal information online, while 38 percent said they adjust their social network privacy settings. And, only 35 percent use a PIN (personal identification number) or password to lock their mobile device. The new site allows Internet users around the world to share how they plan to avoid online risks, learn what other people are doing to help protect themselves, and receive instant tips to enhance their digital lifestyle.<br />
“The Internet touches our lives every day, whether we are communicating with loved ones, for work, shopping, and paying bills,” said Prakash Kumar, National Technology Officer, Microsoft India Pvt. Ltd.<br />
“But, how cautious are we about monitoring our online presence, and taking note of our own vulnerabilities? There are many things you can do to stay safer online. What is needed is to do just one thing, and we can all be much safer, together,” Kumar said. “Go to our website to share your one thing. Tell the world that you’re committed to helping keep the Internet safer and more secure. And once you do, you’ll be part of that positive change.”<br />
Internet users can make more informed decisions and help better protect their <a title="online activities" href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/saferonline/" target="_blank">online activities</a>, which provides a range of hints, tips and guidance including the following:<br />
* Help guard your devices and online accounts. Use a unique four-digit PIN for mobile devices and strong passwords for online accounts.<br />
* Perform sensitive transactions over secured networks. This includes paying bills, banking or shopping. Don’t share personal account information over “borrowed” or public Wi-Fi connections.<br />
* Take charge of your online reputation. Discover what information about you is on the Internet, periodically re-evaluate it, and remove unwanted or inaccurate content to cultivate an accurate, positive reputation.<br />
* Help protect your social circles. Use privacy settings to manage the information you share and with whom you share it. Be selective about what you post and accepting friends.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1982386&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you have used Coast by Opera, which in my books is the best browser available for any mobile device, though it is not available on all mobile devices, then you have most probably seen what simple designs can do the for the success of apps.</p>
<p>But ask Huib Klienhout, product designer and the &#8216;brains&#8217; behind this popular iPad browser, and he will tell you all this simplicity is actually hiding a lot of serious technology. &#8220;Coast was design driven. The whole idea was to see what the next generation browser would be like with the devices moving towards touch. We also wanted to hide the technology and remove the bells and whistles,&#8221; he told<em> The India Express</em> in an interaction.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/coast2.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1982245" alt="coast2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/coast2.jpeg?w=480&#038;h=312" width="480" height="312" /></a>&#8220;So we have replaced buttons with something better. Yes, it is confusing if you are used to the regular browser&#8230; if you work with technology you can introduce a new feature or make existing fuctionalities simpler. That is something that Apple has done so well. It is just making technology more accessible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Coast, he says, has so much cutting edge technology like in the engine that differentiates one website from the other to convert it into an app-like icon. Klienhout says that like other browsers, Opera too tried to make he browser faster, but &#8220;that was not the most important feature.&#8221; It is also as secure, or more, than an popular browser.</p>
<p>However, he was cagey on whether Coast will come for other platforms and devices. &#8220;We would like to bring Coast to all devices. We would have liked to do that from the start, but that would have meant compromising on some of the features,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1982236&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gionee-p3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1981654 " alt="The Gionee Pioneer P3 gets most things right, but the screen is a nightmare" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gionee-p3.jpg" /></a> Gionee Pioneer P3 costs Rs 7,500
<p dir="ltr">Gionee, a reputable brand in China, is making a big push in India with handsets across different price ranges. Its cheapest smartphone so far is the Pioneer P3, which has good hardware on paper. But does that translate into real-world performance?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 4.3-inch display (800&#215;480 pixels, 217 ppi) | 1.3GHz Cortex A7 quad-core processor | 512MB RAM | 4GB storage + microSD slot (up to 32GB) | 5MP rear camera (720p HD video), VGA front camera | 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 | GPS with A-GPS | 1700mAh battery | Android 4.2 Jelly Bean</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gionee-p3-white.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1982170" alt="Gionee P3 White" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gionee-p3-white.jpg?w=357&#038;h=600" width="357" height="600" /></a>Design:</strong> It&#8217;s been some time since I have used an Android phone that&#8217;s so chunky and heavy, even at this price range. The Gionee Pioneer P3 wins no design points—there&#8217;s nothing new to see here. It&#8217;s a slab of plastic with a rubber-finish on the back, with a fatter width than most phones. But to make up for that, it is sturdy. I accidentally dropped the phone from a height of 5 feet to a marble tile and the P3 has a mere scratch on one of the sides—there&#8217;s no dent, let alone any cracking on the screen. Granted, the impact was on its back and not its front, but that&#8217;s still better than even some of the flagship handsets out there.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Screen:</strong> The <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/never-compromise-on-smartphone-screen/" target="_blank">screen can make or break the smartphone experience</a> and this is the most disappointing factor of the P3. The viewing angles are extremely poor—tilt it even slightly in any direction and the colours or contrast will distort. On top of that, the colour temperature of the screen is among the worst I&#8217;ve seen. And like all phones at this price, it doesn&#8217;t have a scratch-resistant glass so a screen guard further distorts the viewing angles under direct sunlight. This screen will be a deal-breaker for most people.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Performance:</strong> The quad-core processor on the Pioneer P3 sets it apart from most of the smartphones in this budget, as it handles most games well. It struggles with high-end titles like FIFA 14 and Asphalt 8, but it&#8217;s not unplayable—and at this price, that&#8217;s good enough. To its credit, multi-tasking on the P3 is much smoother than other phones with 512MB RAM and even some with 1GB RAM.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gionee-p3-black.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1982169" alt="Gionee P3 Black" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gionee-p3-black.jpg?w=320&#038;h=600" width="320" height="600" /></a>Memory:</strong> With just 4GB of built-in memory, you are going to run out of space quickly. Android now requires you to install apps on the internal memory first and with Gionee&#8217;s custom UI already taking up disk space (along with the inability to uninstall certain apps), 4GB is stifling. Then again, you don&#8217;t get anything better in this price range.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> There&#8217;s nothing great and nothing bad about the network quality or Wi-Fi range of the Pioneer P3. You won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Software:</strong> Gionee&#8217;s custom UI is too childish for my taste. For some reason, all the icons are wrapped in squares of rounded corners and any new app you install gets a bubble around it of the same shape. Android&#8217;s default interface is far more pleasing, so I don&#8217;t see why Gionee would want to push this on its customers, especially since it takes up some of the already limited memory.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Camera:</strong> The camera on the Pioneer P3 is the best I&#8217;ve seen in this range, including the Nokia Lumias. Don&#8217;t judge the photos by what you see immediately—the phone&#8217;s faulty screen doesn&#8217;t do them justice. But if you load them up on your PC and compare them with photos taken by other phones in this range, then the P3 is the clear winner. Shots have more detail, better colour reproduction and are marginally better in low light. That said, low light photography is still not good enough to replace your point-and-shoot camera.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Battery:</strong> On a single charge, the Gionee Pioneer P3 will go on for about 12 hours of average usage. You will need to charge this phone twice a day on average—once before leaving for work and once after—but it should get you through the work day without needing to be plugged in.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Special Mention:</strong> I wanted to make a note of the phone&#8217;s video recording ability separately from the camera. Yes, the camera is better than others, but it&#8217;s the video recording that really stood out for me. Budget phones usually struggle with two aspects of video: audio capture and light flares. The P3&#8242;s sensor is able to compensate for bright light, and its ability to capture the intended audio without too much ambient noise is just what you need.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Verdict:</strong> The only person I&#8217;d advise to buy the Gionee Pioneer P3 is the budget buyer who cares about only the camera and is willing to live with all other compromises. Otherwise, the phone asks for too many sacrifices, even for the Rs 7,500 price tag. The screen, especially, is the big letdown and you will find yourself frustrated with it as you use it.</p>

<p>XOLO on Monday launched the Q1100 smartphone. Powered by a 1.4 GHz Quad Core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor with 1 GB RAM, the Q1100 runs the Android v4.3 Jelly Bean platform. It comes with a large 5-inch HD IPS display, with One Glass Solution (OGS) technology that makes the phone thinner, lighter and more touch responsive.</p>
<p>Fitted with a high performance Adreno 305 graphics engine, you can expect a lag-free gaming experience with overall good quality resolution and textures for any kind of mutlimedia experience. Users also get access to exclusive Snapdragon apps like Audio+, Qualcomm Quick Charge and Battery Guru. While Audio+ offers high quality audio, the Quick Charge feature charges a mobile up to 75 per cent faster than regular charging. Battery Guru, on the other hand, optimises battery life without stopping any apps or functionalities.</p>
<p>Besides, the phone comes with an 8 MP Auto Focus rear camera with BSI 2 sensor. This sensor improves image quality by increasing the amount of light captured thereby enhancing low-light shooting performance. Even the 2 MP front camera with the BSI sensor will give you sharper selfies and good quality video calling capability. It also sports a new arch based menu, which makes it easier to control and switch camera settings at one place. As for battery duration, the company claims a stand by time of upto 600 hours on 2G and upto 450 hours on 3G.</p>
<p>The XOLO Q1100 is priced at Rs. 14,999 and will be available in black color.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1981942&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/htc480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1981724" alt="HTC " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/htc480.jpg" /></a> HTC is seeking to reverse a two-year sales slump matched with new cheaper smartphones.
<p>Smarting from growing losses, Taiwanese phone maker HTC Corp says it will expand its range of cheaper products as it fixes off-target marketing for its premium smartphones.</p>
<p>The company that has long prided itself as a purveyor of upscale, feature-loaded products says it needs to sell more mid-tier and affordable smartphones after losing out in 2013. Muscled off-track by fast-growing Chinese rivals like Xiaomi Inc as well as giants like Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc, HTC is seeking to reverse a two-year sales slump matched by an 80 percent drop in its share price.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem with us last year was we only concentrated on our flagship. We missed a huge chunk of the mid-tier market,&#8221; said co-founder and Chairwoman Cher Wang, speaking to Reuters in New York last week alongside Chialin Chang, HTC&#8217;s &#8206;Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>Speaking ahead of an HTC earnings guidance presentation expected later on Monday, Chang said HTC will sell products in the $150 to $300 retail price range for both emerging and developed markets, along with high-end phones which can sell for over $600. HTC won&#8217;t get into the &#8220;very, very low-end market&#8221;, Chang said, but will soon unveil a new flagship phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two cylinders are going to be fired together,&#8221; Chang said.</p>
<p>The new strategy marks a need to address problems at a company, 3.8 percent-owned by Wang herself, that just over two years ago supplied one in every 10 smartphones sold around the world. In 2013 its global market share had fallen to just 2 percent, according to Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston, and HTC last month reported its second straight quarter of operating losses.</p>
<p>HTC will need to move quickly in order to convince sceptical shareholders. &#8220;Only time will tell, but I&#8217;m not optimistic,&#8221; said Laura Chen, a Taipei-based analyst at BNP Paribas.</p>
<p>Chen believes the company&#8217;s fundamental problem is unattractive, underwhelming products and that this will continue to hold it back in 2014. &#8220;They don&#8217;t offer anything really new to the market,&#8221; said Chen, who has a &#8216;sell&#8217; rating on HTC shares.</p>
<p>MARKETING MISS</p>
<p>Wang aims to boost smartphone sales this year by improving its marketing, something she said her company &#8220;didn&#8217;t do well&#8221; in 2013. While the flagship HTC One phone it launched last year attracted rave reviews, these didn&#8217;t translate to strong sales: HTC needs a &#8220;very aggressive campaign&#8221; to broaden its market beyond tech-savvy 20 to 30-year-olds, the executives said.</p>
<p>Last year HTC hired Hollywood actor Robert Downey Jr for a series of TV ads to promote its brand in a campaign labelled &#8220;Here&#8217;s to Change&#8221;.</p>
<p>The executives said that higher volumes of cheaper phones should make up for the difference in price with its higher-end phones. &#8220;Overall profitability is going to grow,&#8221; said Wang.</p>
<p>Along with an improvement in the mid-tier HTC is also hoping for incremental growth in the high-end phone market this year. The executives said invitations will be sent out in about two weeks for an event where it will announce the successor to the HTC One flagship phone.</p>
<p>More affordable phones should fill a gap in HTC&#8217;s range. Of the 53 phones for sale on HTC&#8217;s China website, only two models cost less than $150 &#8211; the highest-growth price bracket in China, according to research firm IDC. Twenty-one are over $500.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to have an HTC, but their prices have gotten too high,&#8221; said 30-year-old Beijing resident Liang Lihuan. The bank worker said she recently switched to a phone made by South Korea&#8217;s LG Electronics Inc. &#8220;The price is simply more reasonable.&#8221;</p>
<p>With growth in China shifting to cheaper models, posing problems for heavyweight Apple despite a much-hyped deal with China Mobile, local smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd lists eight models under the magic $150 threshold. Xiaomi, whose phones sell for between $130 and $410, said it plans to double its sales this year compared to 2013.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think HTC will be forced to migrate into the mid-tier,&#8221; said Richard Ko, an analyst at Taipei-based KGI Securities. &#8220;Those products are low-price and high-spec, which is a trend for this year,&#8221; said Ko, who has a &#8216;sell&#8217; rating on HTC shares.</p>
<p>While HTC recalibrates, Wang said the company wouldn&#8217;t return to its roots as a contract manufacturer supplying phones for others.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not even considering that,&#8221;&#8206; she said: The only manufacturing partnerships HTC will consider are ones where its brand features on the phone alongside that of a partner such as a mobile carrier.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1981723&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Near Field Communication (NFC) might not have made a big impact in smartphones in India, but now this technology is going to be available in desktops too. Asus has just announced the launch of its M70AD desktop PC with NFC to help it pair with Android devices.</p>
<p>This means you can use the desktop to backup media in compatible phones and tablets with just a tap. The ASUS-exclusive NFC Express software automatically backs up photos and videos in Android mobile devices on the desktop, detecting only files added since last sync.</p>
<p>The M70AD can also charge mobile devices wirelessly, while a built-in UPS acts as a power supply for the PC in the event of a power outage. The ASUS Wireless Charger tray supports Qi inductive power standard even when  computer is shut down, while the Ai Charger utility provides faster recharge times for your mobile devices through USB 3.0.</p>
<p>The M70AD desktop PC will be powered by a 4th generation Intel Core processor and will feature Sonic Master Technology and MaxxAudio from Waves to offer a better audio experience.</p>
<p>The M70AD is priced at Rs 62,000.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1981708&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/flappy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1981657" alt="Flappy Bird was reportedly raking in $50,000 a day" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/flappy.jpg" /></a> Flappy Bird was reportedly raking in $50,000 a day
<p>This bird won&#8217;t flap anymore. The creator of hit mobile game Flappy Bird has removed it from the App Store and Google Play saying it had ruined his life.</p>
<p>The game, which was uploaded in 2013 but only surged to the top in downloads earlier this year, was removed early Monday. By then its creator Nguyen Ha Dong was raking in over $50,000 a day in advertising revenue.</p>
<p>The 29-uear-old from Hanoi wrote on Twitter on Saturday that the Internet sensation caused by the game &#8220;ruins my simple life&#8221; and he now hated it.</p>
<p>However, there have been claims that Dong was using tricks to artificially increase downloads for his incredibly tough game.<br />
The take down is also an indicator that is becoming increasingly tough for single app developers to manage successful games that require regular updates and tracking of analytics to keep pace with the thousands of users who are playing the game at any given point of time.</p>
<p>It could also mean that the developer had made enough money for him not to be really bothered about the success of this game anymore. After all, not everyone wants to create an Angry Birds franchise. It would have been difficult for Nguyen to maintain this game if he wanted to start working on another.</p>
<p>However, if this game was really all that successful, it is highly unlikely that he would have just killed it. This only suggests that there was something really gone with either the game or the numbers it reportedly had. Don&#8217;t be surprised if you read more about this game and its developer in the coming days.</p>
<p>As for the game, you can still get it from some locations online. But it might not be really worth it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On a computer, your input is through a keyboard and a mouse or trackpad. The output is on the screen. Things change on a smartphone, where both input and output is on the same screen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Your TV stays on one wall, motionless, while you move around. Viewing angles become important. With your smartphone, you stay in one place but the hand moves—as you try and read that article on the crowded local commute, as you try to keep an eye on the road while walking and texting, or as you try and get a shot by holding your camera away from your body at a weird angle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You are never going to accidentally drop your TV and have its screen shatter. You aren&#8217;t going to throw your laptop with the screen open in a bag full of sharp objects. But smartphones are small enough to slip out of your hand, and get put into a pocket unprotected from other elements like your keys.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The point of all this, of course, is to illustrate how crucial the screen is to a smartphone. And yet, all too often, companies skimp on that one element.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Take, for instance, the Gionee Pioneer P3. It gets most things right in the performance department, even throwing in a quad-core processor. The camera surpasses most others in that price range. But the screen, oh that crucial screen, is a nightmare. Bad viewing angles and poor display quality mean that even as a Rs 7,500 budget phone, it&#8217;s difficult to recommend it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At a slightly higher price, the Lenovo P780 offers the best battery life we have seen in a smartphone. And the rest of the performance is decent too. But the lack of a scratch-resistant glass for a phone that costs upwards of Rs 15,000 is unforgivable. At that price, you shouldn&#8217;t be putting a screen guard and marring the experience.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even at the top end, Sony is guilty of asking people to pay Rs 40,000 for its Xperia Z1 and throwing in a screen that distorts colours when you look at it from an angle. It&#8217;s got all the protection in the world, including waterproofing, and the best hardware money can buy. But what&#8217;s the point of running Asphalt 8 smoothly if your car&#8217;s and track&#8217;s colours change when you move frantically to steer?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Performance matters a lot in a phone, as does the battery life. Music is important for a few, while some people are all about the camera. Budget phones always force you to make some sacrifices, but if you have to, then don&#8217;t compromise on the screen. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to ensure how much you use your handset in the long run; it&#8217;s what dictates how rough or delicate you will be with the phone; it&#8217;s what decides whether you enjoy that technological marvel in your pocket.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/motogm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1981223" alt="Moto G's 16 GB version, priced at Rs 13,999, was sold out in the first 15 minutes of the launch." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/motogm.jpg" /></a> Moto G&#8217;s 16 GB version, priced at Rs 13,999, was sold out in the first 15 minutes of the launch.
<p>Enthused by the overwhelming response from shoppers to Moto G launch, e-commerce player Flipkart is looking at a long term relationship with handset maker Motorola Mobility.</p>
<p>The US-based firm launched its much-awaited budget phone Moto G in India through Flipkart on February 6. There has been tremendous response from online shoppers to the launch with the 16GB version being sold out in first 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is extremely overwhelming. We were surprised. We did not expect this kind of response. It was more than the traffic on peak Diwali rush. Our site also went down for a couple of minutes on February 6th, the day of launch, due to traffic,&#8221; Flipkart co-founder and CEO Sachin Bansal said.</p>
<p>Moto G&#8217;s 16 GB version, priced at Rs 13,999, was sold out in the first 15 minutes of the launch and few units of the 8 GB version &#8211; costing Rs 12,499 &#8211; were left, he added.</p>
<p>Asked whether Flipkart will continue selling Motorola products after the big-bang debut of Moto G, he said that both the firms believe online is the way forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Definitely, I think both Motorola and Flipkart are seeking a long term relationship. Sure, I think we do see and actually hope that we do get to do more such things together,&#8221; Bansal said.</p>
<p>Like Flipkart, Motorola also believes that online is the way to go and as the world is moving to e-shopping, India will also follow, he added.</p>
<p>According to market experts, Moto G is getting very good response from online shoppers with some 20,000 units being sold out on Flipkart within hours of the launch on February 6.</p>
<p>&#8220;The price difference between 8 GB and 16 GB was not much and that could have also led to people going for the 16 GB one,&#8221; Bansal said on shoppers preferring the 16 GB version.</p>
<p>Besides, traffic to Flipkart was twice of what it sees on other days and 67 per cent of it was driven just by Moto G.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our page views increased by 100 per cent during the launch and Moto G page saw a million page views on February 6. Also, inbound calls to customer support number doubled and we had close to 20,000 queries on Moto G alone during the day,&#8221; Bansal said.</p>
<p>On launching Moto X, he said presently both the companies are watching the response to Moto G.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, we are focusing on Moto G and we want to wait and see how it is and then take a call on other opportunities. I don&#8217;t know how it will pan out, but we want to wait for a few days and then sit down to decide,&#8221; Bansal added.</p>
<p>Last week, Motorola launched its first handset, Moto G, in India after a nearly two-year hiatus. After being acquired by Google in May 2012, Motorola did not introduce new products in India. However, the firm continued with its operation unit in India.</p>
<p>In the US, Moto G is priced at around USD 179 (about Rs 11,200) with 8 GB of storage and USD 199 (about Rs 12,400) for the 16 GB version.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1981216&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ahmed1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1980945" alt="The ruling allows Internet service providers (ISPs) to sell faster download speeds to the  highest bidder — even if access to other websites slows to a crawl" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ahmed1.jpg" /></a> The ruling allows Internet service providers (ISPs) to sell faster download speeds to the<br />highest bidder — even if access to other websites slows to a crawl
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Can you imagine a world with two Internets — the first a quick, smooth highway for those who pay more, and the other a slow, bumpy trail for everybody else? Would you be amenable to paying a fee to be able to stream YouTube videos at full speed or simply wait endlessly for the videos to buffer? </span></p>
<p>In January, a US federal court struck down the “net neutrality rules” put in place by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) in 2010. The rules had been designed to prevent the nation’s largest broadband service providers from charging content companies for access to Internet “fast lanes”. The ruling allows Internet service providers (ISPs) to sell faster download speeds to the highest bidder — even if access to other websites slows to a crawl</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p>Net neutrality or “net neutrality” is the principle that data packets on the Internet should be moved impartially, without regard to content, destination or source. Everybody who accesses the Internet does so through an ISP.</p>
<p><strong>Importance</strong></p>
<p>Web activists around the world claim that now access to the Internet is a fundamental human right. Thus it is important to ensure that the Internet remains a free and open platform that promotes innovation, competition and user’s interest.</p>
<p><strong>The argument</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important features of the Internet and the way it grew over the years is its openness: Users can surf any site or download anything they want. ISPs did not differentiate between various kinds of content and choose who gets the best access. However, ISPs don’t want to stay neutral anymore and say this is essentially a free-enterprise issue. They argue that they provide a service and, therefore, should be able to decide how to deliver it and how they charge customers for it. As of now, content providers don’t pay different rates in accordance with the kind of content they provide. If the Internet will no longer be neutral, an ISP will give preference to those who pay more. Also, if ISPs start charging a premium to websites, you can be assured the cost will be passed on to customers.</p>
<p><strong>At global level?</strong></p>
<p>There are few countries that have laws regarding net neutrality. Chile was the first country to approve a law that proscribes an ISP from blocking, discriminating or restricting the right of any consumer from using, sending, receiving or offering content. Denmark passed a law recently which prohibits ISPs from charging higher fees, impeding or slowing down applications and websites. It also states that an ISP needs to get consent of the user before placing cookies on their computer, protecting the data of the user.</p>
<p><strong>Trivia</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/220px-twu.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1980980" alt="220px-Twu" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/220px-twu.jpg?w=220&#038;h=275" width="220" height="275" /></a>The term ‘net neutrality’ was coined by Columbia law professor Tim Wu. The concept dates back to the 1800s when Almon Brown Strowger invented an automatic telephone exchange to bypass operators who redirected calls for profit.</p>
<p><strong>Law in India?</strong></p>
<p>India does not have a law regarding net neutrality nor has it moved towards creating one.</p>
<p>The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), in its guidelines for issuing licences for providing Unified Access Service, promotes the principle of non-discrimination but does not enforce it.</p>
<p>The Information Technology Act does not provide regulatory provisions relating to Internet access, and does not expressly prohibit an ISP from controlling the Internet to suit their business interests.</p>
<p>With the advent of 3G and the unprecedented growth of Internet users in India, the chances of networks getting clogged have become higher.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, it is possible that an ISP may impose certain types of premium rent on download or surfing.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1980944&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kindle.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1980431" alt="The Kindle Paperwhite 3G is now available for Rs 11,999" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kindle.jpg" /></a> The Kindle Paperwhite 3G is now available for Rs 13,999
<p>I would like to do more reading than what I get to do these days. So when I got the opportunity to review the new Kindle Paperwhite (yes, there is another Kindle Paperwhite in the market) I was looking forward to the opportunity to review the sixth generation of the ebook reader and second in the Paperwhite series.</p>
<p>However, even a week after I got there devices, I was just carrying it everywhere in my backpack, not really getting to read anything long or even play around with the newer features.</p>
<p>Finally, the opportunity presented itself in the form of a three-day official trip to Chennai. Due to the nature of the trip, I was sure there would not be much time to read once I was there. But nothing could stop me from reading at the airport and while flying. So that means at least eight hours of reading. Here&#8217;s my experience with the Kindle Paperwhite, recorded over two new airports and two rather old aircraft in between.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kindle4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1980433" alt="kindle4" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kindle4.jpg?w=433&#038;h=600" width="433" height="600" /></a>The journey begins</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I am in the taxi en route to the airport. So I decide to take the Paperwhite out and download some stuff to read during the flight. This version has 3G, so I am not tethered to a Wi-Fi network for updates. I decide to first sync a few books that are already there in my Kindle account, either partially read or unread &#8212; I do use the Kindle app on my iPad to read books once in a while. I then buy Ramachandra Guha&#8217;s <em>India After Gandhi</em>, a book I have been dying to read. I also find the cover of the <em>Columbia Journalism Review</em> (<a href="http://www.cjr.org/cover_story/evgeny_vs_the_internet.php?page=all"><em>Evgeny vs the Internet</em></a>) interesting and decide to subscribe to the magazine. It helps that the first month is free, after which I can take a call on whether I want to continue with the subscription. The entire process has taken me under five minutes, the 3G is quite fast on this one.</p>
<p>At the airport, I try and log in to the free Wi-Fi to see how the experience is. But I could experience a faster download, most probably because the airport Wi-Fi was being used by hundreds of passengers. It is not much of a difference in speeds and I am not really spending money as the 3G does not entail usage cost. Interestingly, the device automatically switches off the 3G when it is latched on to a wireless network.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pencil.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1980435" alt="pencil" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pencil.jpg?w=471&#038;h=98" width="471" height="98" /></a>As I try to log in to Goodreads, it is time to board the flight. The Kindle Paperwhite &#8212; like its earlier version &#8212; is not much larger than a thin paperback and can easily go inside my coat pocket. I wish I could do that with my second generation iPad.</p>
<p>In the flight, I cozy up with the CJR cover story on Evgeny Morozov. I have used or reviewed almost all Kindle devices so far, but this one undoubtedly has one of the fastest page flips. But this also means that if your thumb inadvertently touches the bottom right corner, you are in the next page. I have always found it a slightly awkward experience reading periodicals on Kindles. One articles flows into another and often you mistake this for a new chapter when it turns out to be a complexly new piece. But this also means you can finish a magazine from cover to cover without being bothered about anything else, just the kind of experience bookworms would love.</p>
<iframe src="//instagram.com/p/kJCK1hgPLb/embed/" width="480" height="267" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe>
<p>India After Gandhi starts with a rather long prologue peppered with footnotes. Clicking any superscript number on the text opens the footnote pop-up in a jiffy. It is as convenient, and much faster than clicking a link on a website.</p>
<p>The one day that I spend in Chennai does not afford me much time to read anything long. But I do use the device to check <em>The Indian Express</em> stories once in a while, after all this is Chennai where you cannot get a copy of the paper.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kindle2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1980432" alt="kindle2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kindle2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=483" width="480" height="483" /></a>On my way back, on a very turbulent evening flight, I actually read much more than I have in ages. In two hours I am four chapters into Guha&#8217;s latest. Having seen the actual size of the book, I am pretty certain that this is the better way to read any book that is more than 300 pages long.</p>
<p>Back in Delhi, I select a line from the book and tweet it. I am actually on the way back home and on 3G. Yes, this is a good added feature, but maybe this is not the device for multiple tweets per book. You can easily manage a tweet per book. Plus, there is the fact that the tweet makes sense only for people on the Amazon ecosystem for the link that goes with it is one for the publication on Amazon.</p>
<p>At home, I use the Goodreads feature to log in to Facebook a create a shelf of the books I have read on Kindle. It also shows other people on my list who are using this service. Surprisingly, there were quite a few of them and with books that I would like to read, when I get the time. This seems like a better feature than the actual share option.</p>
<p><strong>So, what did I think?</strong></p>
<p>Overall, the Kindle Paperwhite has now become a device for the share-it-now generation. It is still the closest digital experience to the actual book and is at times a better experience, especially when you are on the move. A must-have for people who like to read wherever they are.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>Rs 13,999 (The version without 3G is Rs 3,000 less)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1980421&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Google took aim at office meeting rooms with the release of a Chromebox for videoconferencing.</p>
<p>&#8220;These days, we often connect with each other from far-flung locations, coordinating time zones and dialing into conference calls from our phones,&#8221; product management vice president Caesar Sengupta said in a blog post on Thursday. &#8220;Meetings need to catch up with the way we work &#8212; they need to be face-to-face, easier to join, and available from anywhere and any device.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chromebox-for-meetings is available in the US at a starting price of USD 999 and is to be released later this year in Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, New Zealand,  and Spain. The first model box  comes with a high-definition camera and a speaker with a microphone. A monitor must be provided. There is an annual management fee of USD 250 for the videoconferencing setup.</p>
<p>As many as 15 people can take part in a Chromebox video conference using smartphones, tablets, laptops or other Internet linked computers.</p>
<p>Google has been working to expand its business beyond online search and into businesses with a productivity and collaboration software offered as services in the Internet cloud. The California technology titan also continues to promote Chrome-powered boxes and laptops that push computing power to servers in Google data centers.</p>
<p>Google introduced the first Chromebook in mid-2010 in a challenge to Windows operating software at the heart of Microsoft&#8217;s empire. The array of Chromebook makers has grown to include Acer, Asus, Lenovo, Samsung and Hewlett-Packard, with many models offered at bargain prices when compared to high-end laptops.</p>
<p>Shifting operating software to banks of servers online means that Google updates programs and fends off hackers and malicious software.</p>

<p>A grieving father&#8217;s personal appeal to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has prompted the social network to release a retrospective video tribute of the man&#8217;s deceased 21-year-old son.</p>
<p>John Berlin, 46, of suburban St. Louis posted a YouTube message to Zuckerberg on Wednesday seeking a copy of Facebook&#8217;s new &#8220;look back&#8221; video feature for his late son, Jesse, who died in his sleep in January 2012 of unknown causes.</p>
<p>The automated tool creates a 62-second video using photos and comments previously posted by Facebook users. The YouTube plea has since drawn more than 1.25 million views.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ever do something crazy &#8217;cause you just don&#8217;t know what to do anymore?&#8221; a tearful Berlin said in the YouTube plea. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook typically disables the accounts of people who have died. But the company said in a statement Thursday that it granted Berlin&#8217;s request and suggested Facebook might alter its policies on information posted by users who later died.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the number of people using our service, it&#8217;s often very difficult to act on behalf of one. But John&#8217;s story and emotion moved us to take action — so we did,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;This experience reinforced to us that there&#8217;s more Facebook can do to help people celebrate and commemorate the lives of people they have lost. We&#8217;ll have more to share in the coming weeks and months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berlin said Thursday he was overwhelmed by Facebook&#8217;s rapid response as well as messages of support he&#8217;s received from all over the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never expected any of this to happen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All I want is every little piece of him I can get.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook unveiled the new feature, entitled &#8220;A Look Back,&#8221; on Tuesday to commemorate its 10th anniversary. The customized video shows the year a user joined along with a selection of the most-liked photos and messages, backed by instrumental music.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1979748&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dellvenue-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1979642" alt="Dell Venue 8 is priced at 17,499 " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dellvenue-480.jpg" /></a> Dell Venue 8 is priced at 17,499
<p>The tablet segment is becoming too big for anyone to ignore, even the larger players in the PC game. So when Dell finally launched Android tablets aimed at regular consumers, we had to check it out. The new Dell Venue 8 is among the first 8-inch tablets to hit the Indian market.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 8-inch IPS Display with HD (WXGA 1280 x 800 pixels) | 2GHz Intel Atom Z2580 processor  | 2GB RAM | 32GB storage + microSD slot (up to 128GB) | 5MP rear camera + 2MP front camera | 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi + Bluetooth 4.0 + GPS | 4100mAh battery | Android 4.2.2</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/venue8_family-480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1979643" alt="Venue8_family-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/venue8_family-480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=417" width="480" height="417" /></a>Design:</strong> If you remember the <a title="Dell Streak Archive story" href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/dells-streak-readies-for-battle-with-ipad/623886/" target="_blank">Dell Streak</a>, then it won’t take you long to realise where this design story is coming from. In fact, the Dell Venue has the same look and feel as the Streak, which was the precursor of the phablet segment that is all the rage at the moment. The back panel feels solid in a carbon finish with a chrome Dell logo. But the tablet is also quite thin at 9.5mm and weighs just 350 grams. So you can use it comfortably and carry it where you go. The way the volume and power buttons are crafted shows the difference in build quality when compared to some of the cheap tablets available in the market.</p>
<p><strong>Screen:</strong> The HD screen is good, though we felt that it reflects the background in certain angles. But it is bright enough to work well outdoors too. The HD screen is really complemented by the amazing audio quality, which is among the best we have found in any tablet. So this makes the Venue 8 a good device to watch movies and videos as well as play games with.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> The tablet performs reasonably well and there would be nothing to complain about. But having used some high-specced devices like the Xolo Tegra Play Note in the recent weeks the Venue feels like a horse that has been fettered. But that is only when you try and push the device to its limits, something most of us seldom do. The benchmark scores are good and places this tablet in the upper middle class of Android devices. Multi-tasking is smooth and so is gaming. We also did not experience any heating up even while playing games for long durations.</p>
<p><strong>Memory:</strong> No issues on this front, as the 32GB of built-in memory and rare 128GB support in the microSD slot are among the best you can get.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Dell will soon start selling a version of the Dell Venue 8 with 3G and we suggest that could be a better option for those who need to use this one on the move. For others, this connectivity options in the present version are good enough for regular use.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> The Android is as plain vanilla as it can be and we love that. There is just one additional software and that is the Pocket Cloud, which is a good value add.</p>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong> The 5MP camera is very deceptive. That is because the image showing on the screen when you are composing a shot does not appear very promising. But the final results are better. This could be an issue if you are using a camera-oriented app like a virtual scanner. I wouldn’t buy this device for its camera. The front camera is good enough for you to make good Skype calls.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> The Dell Venue 8 can give six hours of solid works and about five hours of video playback at full volume. That is decent.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Buy the Dell Venue 8 if you are looking for a durable Android tablet that will come with the kind of support you can expect while buying a PC. The Venue 8 is reasonably priced at 17,499 and is definitely a good buy at that price. We would , however, wait a month or so for the 3G version of the tablet to hit the market.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1979640&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Three new smartphones that show the world Indian brands mean more than cheap price tags<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1978774&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lava4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1978786" alt="Lava Iris Pro 30 " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lava4801.jpg" /></a> Lava Iris Pro 30 is slim at just 7.5 mm thickness and feels light at just 114 grams.
<p><span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span style="font-size:small;">After having garnered the numbers with affordable devices, Indian smartphone makers are slowly testing the upper segments with premium high-spec devices that can take on the bigwigs like Samsung and Apple right where it hurts. Here we look at three devices that push the limits as far as specs go, but still hold on to their affordable tags. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><strong>Lava Iris Pro 30</strong><br />
The Iris Pro 30 does not look like anything you have paid for. In fact, it is a stunner with one of the thinnest bodies in any smartphone, let alonea medium range one. It is slim at just 7.5 mm thickness and feels light at just 114 grams. Adding to this lightweight feel is the matte finish soft plastic back that gives it a superior feel.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;">The Iris Pro 30 has a 720p HD screen from Sharp. But it feels better than some of the other phones with the same resolution thanks to the One Glass Solution that negates any gap between the touch panel and screen. The benchmark ratings put this device between the Samsung Galaxy S2 and the Google Nexus 4, which is quite good considering the price point. Multi-tasking is easy, but then you would expect that with a quad core phone. We did not notice any heating up even while playing games. The phone really shone when I played some HD videos from YouTube even as I had the Robocop game paused in the background.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;">On the flip side, the phone has just 1.5 GB of internal storage free. With so many high-end specifications, the company could have been a bit more liberal with the space on offer and not let the user buy all the space he needed. Thankfully, the are not many tweaks to the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system and that is good. The 8 MP camera on the phone is much better than what you would find in other devices of this price range. The content adaptive backlight control helps the phone reduce power consumption on the screen by 30% and the 2000 mAh battery easily lasts a full working day.<br />
At Rs15,999, this is a good looking phone that promises decent all round performance. There are no serious sore points with the phone, so if it fits your budget go ahead and buy this.<br />
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><br />
<em>* Display: 4.7-inch IPS display</em><br />
<em>* Processor: 1.2 GHz quad-core Mediatek MT6589 processor</em><br />
<em>* Operating system: Android 4.2 Jelly Bean</em><br />
<em>* Storage: 4GB storage + microSD slot, 1 GB RAM</em><br />
<em>* Camera: 8 MP (rear); 3 MP (front)</em><br />
<em>*Estimated street price: Rs 15,999</em></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Intex Aqua Octa</strong><br />
The Intex Aqua Octa is a large phone that reminds one of the Samsung Galaxy Mega. It is just 7 mm thick, but the flip cover that comes in the box is tacky and just makes this device look bulky. This dual-SIM phone has not been built for those who want to keep swapping SIM cards as it is not all that easy to open the panel. The 720p screen is good, but not great. I will definitely prefer a full HD panel in this size.<br />
When you buy a phone that sells itself, thanks to its superior processor, in this case an Octa core processor, you will always be trying to push it to the limits. And that is one front of which this phone will never disappoint you. For instance, a simple Quadrant benchmark test is completed in a faction of the time that it would take on any other phone. The benchmark scores put this near the Samsung Galaxy S4 and very much in the top draw of Android performers. There is no doubt that this device will give you a better gaming experience than its peers. However, there are very few, or hardly any, games that have been written for the Octa core processor. So the best experience is still some time away.<br />
If there is something in the phone that is irritating, then it is the software tweaks. It is full of bloatware and apps that you might not need. The basic interface has also been tweaked and even app icons look different.<br />
The 13 MP camera is decent, in good light. It is not that effective in low light. Plus, we felt that the auto-focus was a bit sluggish and had to be prodded to lock on to a subject. The phone comes with 16-GB internal storage out of which you have around 12 GB free.<br />
At Rs 19,999, this is a good buy for those who want to use the phone for its top-end performance and to exploit the large screen for gaming.</p>

<em>* Display: 6-inch Capacitive Touch OGS HD Display</em><br />
<em>* Processor: 1.7 GHz Octa-Core MediaTek MT6592 processor</em><br />
<em>* Operating system: Android 4.2 Jelly Bean</em><br />
<em>* Storage: 16 GB storage + microSD slot, 2GB RAM</em><br />
<em>* Camera: 13 MP (rear); 5 MP (front)</em><br />
<em>* Estimated street price: Rs 19,999</em></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Karbonn Titanium X</span></span></span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Despite its very plasticky rear panel, the Titanium X has a decent built quality. A metallic body would have gone better with the overall image and name of the phone. At 143 grams, the device does not feel heavy though it looks a bit bloated. The volume rocker is on the left and the power buttons on the right and this takes some time to get used to. The micro-SIM slot is on top under a flimsy flap and being a unibody design there is no SD card slot.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;">The best thing about this phone is undoubtedly its full HD screen. This is among the cheapest phones that comes with one. The one glass technology adds to the value of this screen and prevents it from accumulating fingerprints. If you are planning to use this for watching movies, the speaker might be a bit of a problem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;">With 1.5 GHz quad-core processor, the phone can easily multi-task and be sprightly when you are using it for gaming. The device came up with decent benchmark results that put in somewhere between the Google Nexus 4 and the Samsung Galaxy S3. The Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system is what you would expect it to be.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;">While most so called top-end phones come with just 4 GB of inbuilt memory, half of which is taken by the OS and app, the Titanium X gives about 10 GB of free space. Though the company claims 16 GB internal memory, we could find only about 14 GB on the device of which about 10 GB is free. With no slots for a micro-SD card this might leave a lot of users frustrated. But the camera is the worst part of this phone. The 13 MP camera is anything but good and even the dual flash fails to redeem it in anyway. The 2300mAh battery is decent and can last you a day if you don’t use the 1080p screen for games or movies. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#222222;"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><span style="font-size:medium;">At a street price of Rs 16,500, this a decent Android phone with the sort of specs that you can flaunt. The screen is definitely what you are paying the money for.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/karbonn.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1978784" alt="Karbonn Titanium X" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/karbonn.jpg" /></a> Karbonn Titanium X

Moto G will be available to consumers in India exclusively through <a title="Flipkart" href="http://www.flipkart.com/motorola?otracker=hp_nmenu_sub_electronics_0_Moto%20G" target="_blank">Flipkart</a> from 6</span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><sup><span style="font-size:large;">th</span></sup></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;"> February, 2014.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">“<span style="font-size:large;">This exclusive partnership with Motorola Mobility is in continuation of our commitment to bring the very best in selection and service to our customers. For the first time a global brand has tied up with an exclusive online partner in India. The power of Motorola and Flipkart now brings this exceptional phone at an exceptional price to our customers.”, says Sachin Bansal, Co-founder and CEO, Flipkart.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;">Moto G, priced for the Indian market at Rs. 12,499 (8 GB) and Rs. 13,999 (16 GB), offers a premium smartphone experience that comes for a third of the price of the current high-end phones and includes:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;">A brilliant 4.5-inch HD display &#8211; the sharpest in its class &#8211; that goes edge-to-edge so you can enjoy movies, photos, video chats and more.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;">The newest Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 400 processor featuring a quad-core CPU for seamless multitasking and enjoying the web, videos and games, with all-day battery life.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;">Android 4.3 Jellybean, the most up to date Android of any phone in its class, with a guaranteed upgrade to Android 4.4 KitKat just weeks after launch.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;">Stylish design with a comfortable curved back and interchangeable coloured back covers</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;">Dual SIM support gives you the option to choose your network.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;">Protected with the latest Corning Gorilla Glass and water-repellent nano-coating inside and out</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;">People all around the world want to be a part of the mobile Internet so they can access the world’s information, share, and connect with the things that matter to them. But value-conscious customers who don’t want to pay a lot of money for a high-end smartphone usually have two options. The first is to buy inexpensive, new smartphones made with technology that doesn’t do justice to modern apps and experiences like navigation, video chat and games. The second is to buy “low cost” versions of premium products that were released a few years ago and are thus already obsolete.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;">On the event, Magnus Ahlqvist, GM of EMEA and Asia Pac, Motorola Mobility commented, “We think everybody deserves to experience mobile Internet at its best, and price shouldn’t stand in the way of anyone owning a technologically advanced smartphone. Moto G promises its users a best-in-class mobile experience at an unbelievable price and we couldn’t think of a better launch partner than Flipkart India’s largest e-commerce marketplace and a leader in smartphone sales in India.”</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-size:large;">The Indian e-commerce market grew by 88% in 2013 and stands at $ 16 billion today. E-commerce is definitely poised to emerge as the preferred mode of shopping for Indian Internet users &#8211; and Flipkart, with 1 crore registered users, daily visitors of more than 10 lakhs and a million monthly shipments to over 100 Indian cities is at the forefront of this change. In fact, this launch re-emphasizes the mainstream status that Flipkart and e-commerce has achieved in this country.</span></span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1978119&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/xpad415.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1977883 " alt="Simmtronics Xpad Turbo" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/xpad415.jpg" /></a> The 7-inch screen is good enough for you to play games, enjoy videos and photos clicked with this phone.
<p dir="ltr">The Simmtronics Xpad Turbo is a budget dual-SIM tablet with voice calling aimed that those who are always on the move, but don’t really want to spend much on brands or devices. Here is what I felt after using the Xpad for a week.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 7-inch capacitive multi-touch display (1024 x 600 pixels)  |1.2 GHz dual-core processor with Mali-400MP GPU | Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) OS | Dual SIM (2G + 3G) with dual standby | 8.5mm thick and weighs 273 grams | 2MP rear camera and front digital camera | 512MB DDR3 RAM, 4 GB internal memory, expandable memory up to 32GB with micro SD |3G (via SIM card slot,) WiFi, Bluetooth with A2DP, aGPS | 3.5mm audio jack, FM Radio, Built-in Speaker | 2800 mAh battery with 140 hours standby.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Design:</strong> The Simmtronics Xpad Turbo looks exactly like its predecessor. The charging port, micro SD slot and the earphone jack are located on the top, while the volume and power keys find place at the top right of the tab. SIM card slots are on the either side of the tablet. There is no safety cover for any of the slots.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Screen:</strong> The 7-inch screen is good enough for you to play games, enjoy videos and photos clicked with this phone. The touch is good but volume keys and auto screen sensor can sometimes leave you frustrated.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Performance:</strong> Simmtronics Xpad Turbo is a budget tablet and hence should not be compared with the Apples or Samsungs. The Xpad Turbo might look like the Micromax Funbook, but is superior in performance. It is a good device for browsing, playing games and videos and we also liked the Skype experience. However, the volume and the power key are so closely together that you often end up switching off the tablet. Then, for a device that should be selling itself on its voice calling capabilities, this Xpad has very poor audio quality. I often had to switch to the speaker mode always to make hear anything.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Memory:</strong>  The 512MB DDR3 RAM might seems a bit outdated now and there is no point selling a tablet these days with just 4 GB of internal memory, even with an expandable memory slot.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Camera:</strong> The rear camera here is just 2MP and has issues with zoom, so the camera is not one of its strong points.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Battery:</strong> At 2800 mAh the battery gave us over 24 hours of usage. It however takes four hours to charge up.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Verdict:</strong> At Rs 8,999, the Xpad is for those who don’t want to spend much. It won’t take you long to realize which are the areas where corners have been cut to achieve this price point. But for those looking for a first tablet and can’t afford another smart device, this seems like a decent buy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bike-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1977538" alt="&quot;We are one of the countries that have maximum two-wheeler fatalities and most of the deaths occur due to non-wearing of helmet,&quot; said the 15-year-old." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bike-med.jpg" /></a> &#8220;We are one of the countries that have maximum two-wheeler fatalities and most of the deaths occur due to non-wearing of helmet,&#8221; said the 15-year-old Nerkar.
<p>After his father who was not wearing a  helmet had a close shave in a motorbike accident, a 15-year old has come out with a solution for two-wheeler riders that will reduce the risk of such injuries.</p>
<p>Amey Nerkar, a Class X student of Nashik city in North Maharashtra, has developed a system whereby a motorcycle would start only if the rider wears a helmet.</p>
<p>&#8220;The helmet has been fitted with touch, heat and pressure censors that can detect the body heat. The circuit will start only when the helmet is locked with its clip.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will send transmit signal to a receiver, which is fitted on the bike. This system has been connected to the ignition,&#8221; said the student of the Rachana Vidyalaya in Nashik, who is representing his school at the Children Science Congress where members of 50 other schools are taking part.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, the moment one removes the helmet or even unlocks it, a message is sent to the receiver, which is fitted on the bike and this will further send signals to ignition of the bike to stop the vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea struck Nerkar after his father met with an accident while riding his motorbike and was injured. He was not wearing helmet at that time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are one of the countries that have maximum two-wheeler fatalities and most of the deaths occur due to non-wearing of helmet,&#8221; said the 15-year-old.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Nerkar&#8217;s innovation was mentioned by former President APJ Abdul Kalam in his inaugural speech Tuesday.</p>
<p>The entire system, Nerkar said, costs only between Rs 200-Rs 300 and if any company apply for mass production then the cost can come down.</p>
<p>He has also applied for patent for this system and has already spent Rs 80,000 on it and has also approached leading two-wheeler companies.</p>
<p>Similar is the case with Lalrintluangi, a class IX student of R Hranga High School in Champhai, Mizoram.</p>
<p>The 13-year old student, who is also representing her school at the Children&#8217;s Science Congress, came up with the idea of generating electricity from manure and soil due to the erratic power supply in her state.</p>
<p>&#8220;For generating electricity, one must have empty plastic containers, manure, copper wires and magnesium ribbon, wooden stick and a DC circuit. Every container should have two wooden sticks with each wrapped with copper wire and magnesium ribbon,&#8221; explained Lalrintluangi.</p>
<p>When the manure is mixed with water and soil in the container, the manure becomes electrolyte solution.</p>
<p>The copper wire wrapped around the wooden stick, which is immersed in the solution, acts as the cathode and attracts anions and begins to produce electricity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The magnesium ribbon is placed in the solution, it acts as the anode and attracts the cation and begins to produce a negative charge. The attraction of unlike charge makes it a complete battery. Thus, electricity is produced,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1977533&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kaspersky.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1977200" alt="Kaspersky PR send out the first mails on Monday" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kaspersky.jpg" /></a> Kaspersky PR send out the first mails on Monday
<p>It seems the PR team of internet security giant Kaspersky Lab got more than what it bargained for. Nine hour after it sent out an email saying that “buried within the latest update for Facebook’s Android app is a feature that is causing growing concern among some users”, they were sending out clarification emails saying they were “not the source of the news” that Facebook was reading your SMSes and “have only commented on the technical aspect”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We will leave that call to you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is what the first mail, received on Monday, said: “<em>Buried within the latest update for Facebook’s Android app is a feature that is causing growing concern among some users. In the App permissions menu, the site asks for access to &#8216;Read your text messages (SMS and MMS)&#8217;, and to &#8216;Add or modify calendar events and send email to guests without owners’ knowledge.&#8217;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>According to Facebook’s official app permission page, an example of when Facebook requires access to text messages is when connecting phone numbers to an account. &#8216;If you add a phone number to your account,&#8217; explained Facebook, &#8216;This allows us to confirm your phone number automatically by finding the confirmation code that we send via text message.</em>&#8216;”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/letter1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1977202" alt="letter" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/letter1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=235" width="480" height="235" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The mail goes on to say that “the key… seems to lie in the word &#8216;automatically&#8217;”.  “<em>Surely the app doesn&#8217;t *need* to do this automatically.  Facebook could simply prompt me to type in the code manually.  Or, at the very least, provide this option.  This may be a perfectly innocent feature. But in the light of growing concerns about online privacy, such an option would help to allay people&#8217;s fears</em>.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">It quotes David Emm, Global Research &amp; Analysis Team (GReAT), Principal Security Researcher, Kaspersky Lab as saying that it is good to see Facebook providing two-factor authentication.  “It’s up to you, of course, to decide if you’re happy to allow Facebook to read your messages.  As a final note, we’d urge people to carefully check the permissions requested by any app when you first install it.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, hours later, as  the Internet was flooded with reports by bloggers, journalists and even mainstream news agencies with headlines like “<a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/news/facebook-wants-to-spy-on-android-phone-users-kaspersky/1222796">Facebook wants to spy on Android phone users: Kaspersky</a>”, the company was literally running for cover.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Soon the company sent out another email saying “<em>On behalf of Kaspersky Lab, we would like to clarify that we are not the source of the news, but have only commented on the technical aspect. This email was sent out to media at large hoping that we will get queries &amp; would respond to it accordingly. Kaspersky Lab would thus like to clarify their position and state that they are not holding Facebook responsible for this in any manner &amp; are only commenting on the news that has already been published</em>.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Obviously, no one called back with queries on their story and just based reports on the PR mailer which seemed to put everything in black and white with no need for follow-ups. We are just wondering what Facebook thinks about the who episode.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1977171" alt="Rs 59,990 might be a bit too much for this device" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp2.jpg" /></a> Rs 59,990 might be a bit too much for this device
<p>The tablet-notebook hybrid is the ideal form factor for a Windows 8 device because you get the comfort of a regular laptop while also boosting the functionality with a tearaway tablet when you need it. That said, is the HP Pavilion11 x2 still worth a price of almost Rs 60,000?</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 11.6-inch Antiglare display (1366&#215;768 pixels) | 2GHz quad-core Intel Pentium N3510 processor | 4GB DDR3 RAM | 64GB SSD + microSD slot (tablet) + 3-in-1 memory card reader (base) | Intel HD Graphics | Beats Audio | 1080p FullHD front camera, 1080p FullHD rear camera | Wi-Fi b/g/n | Bluetooth 4 | HDMI out (base) | 2-cell battery (tablet), 2-cell battery (base) | Windows 8 (64-bit)<br />
Price: Rs 59,990</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1977173" alt="HP4" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp4.jpg?w=480&#038;h=541" width="480" height="541" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> Priced in the ultrabook range, the Pavilion11 x2 looks like a chunky clamshell in comparison. If the light weight of a MacBook Air or Sony Vaio Pro is something you like, you aren&#8217;t going to be happy with this. It&#8217;s also all glossy plastic, so no points there. The hinge mechanism to to connect the tablet to the keyboard dock is solid though and holds the tab steady, without wobbling when you tap it. Also, full marks for including a trackpad even though it&#8217;s for use with a touchscreen—it makes the Pavilion11 x2 feel like a proper laptop, not a makeshift hybrid. It&#8217;s squarely functionality over form here.</p>
<p><strong>Screen:</strong> Notebooks are notorious for not having good viewing angles, but the tablet part helps here as the Pavilion11 x2 is bright and clearly visible from wide angles. The touchscreen is also responsive and 1366&#215;768 isn&#8217;t bad on an 11-incher.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Sadly, the performance is where the HP Pavilion11 x2 disappoints the most. Don&#8217;t get fooled by that quad-core processor, it isn&#8217;t going to stand up to what a power user needs. For basic work tasks like light Internet browsing and Office software, it&#8217;s fine. But it can&#8217;t cope with gaming, FullHD high-quality movies, heavy Internet browsing or heavy multi-tasking.</p>
<p><strong>Memory:</strong> The 64GB SSD seems a bit limiting at first, but that&#8217;s till you realise you can throw in microSD or SD cards into both the tablet and the keyboard to expand your storage. Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>Connectivity:</strong> I would have appreciated a SIM card slot on this to make the tablet a bit more useful, but it&#8217;s not a big deal, to be honest. And the HDMI port is a nice addition.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1977170" alt="HP1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=382" width="480" height="382" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> It&#8217;s Windows 8. We&#8217;ve talked about how it&#8217;s <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/windows-8-is-still-not-ready-to-be-on-tablets-heres-why/" target="_blank">not yet ready for touchscreens</a>. But since this is a hybrid, it&#8217;s actually a great desktop OS for that. When you have the dock connected, use the Desktop mode and operate Windows as you normally would. Undock the tablet and you can do some tasks well, like Internet browsing (Internet Explorer 11 is really good for touchscreens) and reading (hello Kindle!), but that&#8217;s about it. However, as mentioned earlier, be ready to miss out on some great touch-friendly apps available on Android and iOS.</p>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong> It&#8217;s got cameras on both the front and back, but you will only want to use the front camera for video chats and the back camera in dire emergencies. Still images aren&#8217;t good at all, but video is decent, provided the lighting is good.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> The Pavilion11 x2 has fantastic battery life as a single unit. Separately, both the dock and the tablet will get you around four hours of average use; combine them and your laptop goes on for 8 hours, which is competitive by any standard.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1977174" alt="HP3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp3.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a><br />
Verdict: </strong>While HP has got most things right, we hesitate to give the Pavilion11 x2 a solid recommendation. Windows 8 is a major compromise as a tablet OS and if a tablet is what you want, you&#8217;ll still want a tablet OS. In that case, Rs. 60,000 seems a high price to pay. It’s worth it if what you want is a single gadget for all your needs, but be warned that the tablet portions of your needs will need to be severely limited.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/facebook.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1976616" alt="Mark Zuckerberg is just 30" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/facebook.jpg" /></a> Mark Zuckerberg is just 30
<p>Facebook &#8211; with more than 1.2 billion users worldwide &#8211; is celebrating its 10th birthday amidst challenges of keeping its original base of young users with new innovative social networks coming to the fore. The company was launched by Mark Zuckerberg on February 4, 2004, from Harvard University. The site was conceived as a way to connect students, and let them build an online identity for themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/facebookaniversary1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1976776 aligncenter" alt="facebookaniversary" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/facebookaniversary1.jpg?w=464&#038;h=1023" width="464" height="1023" /></a></p>
<p>In a message, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said: “It&#8217;s been an incredible journey so far, and I&#8217;m so grateful to be a part of it. It&#8217;s been amazing to see how people have used Facebook to build a real community and help each other in so many ways. In the next decade, we have the opportunity and responsibility to connect everyone and to keep serving the community as best we can.”</p>

<p>On February 4, Facebook will &#8220;A Look Back&#8221; product, an experience that enables people on Facebook to see a personalised movie or collection of photos with their biggest moments since they joined Facebook. &#8220;This is a small gesture to thank the over one billion people who are on Facebook by providing a unique way to look back at some of their biggest moments,&#8221; a note from the company said.</p>
<p>According to the company&#8217;s own recent figures, the social networking site has since expanded to cover a large swath of the world, with more than 1.2 billion people using its site on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg, who turns 30 in May, reflected on the 10-year milestone at an industry conference in Silicon Valley last week. He said he never envisioned Facebook, which made him one of the wealthiest people in the world, becoming so large or influential at the start. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t even occur to me that it could be us,&#8221; Zuckerberg said.</p>

<p>Since then, Facebook&#8217;s site and its business, now a public company, have changed dramatically, the report said.</p>
<p>The company was slow to react to the important mobile market, however, last week it reported that more than half its ad revenue now comes from mobile devices, the report said.</p>
<p>Among the growing challenges is the soaring popularity of smartphone apps that let people share images, videos, thoughts or observations at any moment. Social networking sites such as Pinterest, Twitter and SnapChat have sparked concerns that Facebook which set a social networking trend in motion may be losing its original teen base.</p>
<p>A recent Princeton University study suggested that Facebook may lose around 80 per cent of its users over the next three years, a claim which was challenged by the social networking site. According to a recent report in iStrategyLabs, Facebook lost more than 3 million users in the age group of 13 and 17 between January 2011 and January 2014.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp_pavilion_11_x2_windows_8_4.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1976429" alt="These hybrids run full-fledged Windows just like you would on any notebook PC" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hp_pavilion_11_x2_windows_8_4.jpeg" /></a> These hybrids run full-fledged Windows just like you would on any notebook PC
<p>Windows 8 brought with it a focus on a new type of device: the laptop-tablet hybrid. These “convertibles” could loosely be described as tablets with a keyboard dock. Unlike an iPad though, these hybrids run full-fledged Windows just like you would on any notebook PC.</p>
<p>The concept itself is quite cool and one that I believe will be the future of computing. A single operating system for your computer, which can switch back and forth between being a proper desktop OS when used with a keyboard/trackpad combo and a touch-friendly mobile OS when used as a standalone tablet.</p>
<p>In the recent past, I’ve tested hybrids running Android, Windows 8, as well as dual-booting between Windows and Android. The HP Pavilion 11 x2 is the latest on the block and while it&#8217;s a cool device, I can&#8217;t help but feel that the current crop of these hybrids falls short of the mark.</p>
<p>As I have previously noted, Windows 8 isn’t yet ready for a touchscreen interface, so the “tablet” functionality of a hybrid is limited. Android isn’t yet ready to be as robust a desktop operating system as Windows, so the “notebook” functionality of the hybrid is limited. And dual-booting between Windows and Android is the proverbial Jack of all trades, master of none. The problem isn’t just software though.</p>
<p>To make a great hybrid, it should work perfectly as a tablet and as a notebook. However, hybrid PCs at the moment usually have chunky and large tablets (over 11 inches screen size, minimum) and thick keyboard bases. So the “notebook” unit feels heavy, while the tablet is a bit thicker than one would like. The combination isn’t bad, but it’s nowhere near as good as having a great tablet or a great notebook. Plus, Intel&#8217;s mobile processors for these tablets have not yet struck the right balance between good battery life and good performance—you only get one of the two. It’s a middling compromise.</p>
<p>Usually there is nothing wrong with a compromise, but here, there is one factor: price. At the moment, decent hybrid computers don’t come for less than Rs 40,000. For that price, you could pick up a decent laptop and a decent tablet separately, which will both do a better job as individual devices than the hybrid’s convertible promise.</p>
<p>That “2 for the price of 1” promise, though, makes a lot of sense and is the direction both hardware and software companies seem to be headed. Software guys are increasingly looking at a “one platform to rule them all” solution, like Microsoft’s Windows 8. It hasn’t yet delivered, but the idea is right. Similarly, Apple seems to be converging on the hardware front, as the iPad Air treads on the MacBook’s toes.</p>
<p>Right now, the hybrid PC doesn’t make much sense to buy because you are better served by a dedicated tablet and another dedicated laptop. But in the near future, as hardware and software gets better, you’ll wonder why you ever had two different gadgets.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/exopl-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1975903" alt="Exoplanets orbit stars far beyond the habitable zone outside our Solar System. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/exopl-m.jpg" /></a> Exoplanets orbit stars far beyond the habitable zone outside our Solar System. (Reuters)
<p>Exoplanets may have been teeming with alien microbial life just 15 million years after the Big Bang, according to a Harvard scientist.</p>
<p>Exoplanets that orbit far beyond the habitable zone may have been able to support life in the distant past, warmed by the relic radiation left over from the Big Bang that created the universe 13.8 billion years ago, said astrophysicist Abraham Loeb from the Harvard University.</p>
<p>This suggests that Earthlings may be extreme latecomers to a universe full of life. The earliest evidence of life on Earth dates from 3.8 billion years ago, about 700 million years after our planet formed, &#8216;LiveScience&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The universe was a much hotter place just after the Big Bang. It was filled with sizzling plasma &#8211; superheated gas &#8211; that gradually cooled.</p>
<p>The first light produced by this plasma is the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) that we observe today, which dates from about 389,000 years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>Now, the CMB is freezing cold &#8211; around minus 270 degrees Celsius. It cooled down gradually with the expansion of the cosmos, and at some point during the cooling process, for a brief period of seven million years or so, the temperature was just right for life to form.</p>
<p>The CMB&#8217;s heat that would have allowed water to remain liquid on ancient exoplanets, Loeb said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the universe was 15 million years old, the cosmic microwave background had a temperature of a warm summer day on Earth,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If rocky planets existed at that epoch, then the CMB could have kept their surface warm even if they did not reside in the habitable zone around their parent star,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>According to the standard cosmological model, the very first stars started to form out of hydrogen and helium tens of millions of years after the Big Bang. No heavy elements, which are necessary for planet formation, were around yet.</p>
<p>However, Loeb said that rare &#8220;islands&#8221; packed with denser matter may have existed in the early universe, and massive, short-lived stars could have formed in them earlier than expected.</p>
<p>Explosions of these stars could have seeded the universe with heavy elements, and the very first rocky planets would have been born.</p>
<p>These first planets would have been bathed in the warm CMB radiation, and thus, Loeb said, it would have been possible for them to have liquid water on their surface for several million years.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1975900&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aqua-octa-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1975738" alt="Intex Aqua Octa is first phone in India with a octa core processor" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aqua-octa-1.jpg" /></a> Intex Aqua Octa is first phone in India with a octa core processor
<p>For the past couple of years, smartphone manufacturers have been gripped by a quest for the perfect number of core. This is crucial for them since Android is a power hogging operating system. In fact, a dual-core processor is now widely accepted as the mimimum standard for an good Android phone. However, on the top end you will see phones with the new Octa-core chips. We test the Intex Aqua Octa the first octa core phone from an Indian manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 6” Capacitive Touch OGS HD Display (720p) | 1.7 GHz Octa-Core MediaTek MT6592 processor | 2GB RAM | 16GB storage + microSD slot | 13MP rear camera, 5MP front | Bluetooth 4.0 | Dual-SIM | 2300mAh battery | Android 4.2 Jelly Bean | Accelerometer | Proximity sensor.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aqua-octa-front.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1975740" alt="Aqua-Octa-Front" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aqua-octa-front.jpg?w=396&#038;h=600" width="396" height="600" /></a>Design:</strong> The Intex Aqua Octa is a large phone. It reminded me of the Samsung Galaxy Mega at times, but has a metallic rear panel that sets it apart. It is just 7mm thick, but the flip cover that comes in the box it tacky and just makes this device look bulky. This dual-SIM phone has not been built for those who want to keep swapping SIM cards as it is not all that easy to open the panel. The power key in on top, while the volume keys are on the right. All quite functional.</p>
<p><strong>Screen:</strong> The 720p screen if good, but not great. I will definitely prefer a Full HD panel in this size. But the screen is good for video consumption and gaming, which a lot of people who will buy this Octa core phone will use it for.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> When you buy a phone that sells itself thanks to a superior processor, you will always be trying to push it to the limits. And that is one front of which this phone will never disappoint you. For instance a simple Quadrant benchmark test is completed in a faction of the time that it would take on any other phone. The benchmark scores put this near the Samsung Galaxy S4 and very much in the top draw of Android performers. There is no doubt that this device will give you a better gaming experience that its peers. However, there are very few, or hardly any, games that have been written for the Octa core processor. So the best experience is still some time away.</p>
<p><strong>Memory:</strong> The phone comes with 16-GB internal storage out of which you have around 12 GB free. There is a micro-SD card slot in case you run out of space after loading heavy games line Asphalt 8. Plus, Intex is giving 5GB of free cloud storage.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> This is where I don’t really like this phone. It is full of bloatware and apps that you might not need. The basic interface has also been tweaked and even app icons look different. It took me some time to figure out which one was the browser. Get rid of all the tweaks and you will enjoy the experience more.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/img_20140131_081549.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1975743" alt="IMG_20140131_081549" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/img_20140131_081549.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>Camera:</strong> The 13MP camera is decent, in good light. It is not that effective in low light. Plus, we felt that the auto-focus was a bit sluggish and had to be prodded to lock on to a subject. The front camera is better than what you would find in others and is good for Skype calls.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/img_20140131_081452.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1975742" alt="IMG_20140131_081452" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/img_20140131_081452.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/img_20140131_081418.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1975741" alt="IMG_20140131_081418" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/img_20140131_081418.jpg?w=480&#038;h=313" width="480" height="313" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> Despite being a large screen phone the battery of the Octa carries enough juice to last a day. Yes, this does not mean you can play Asphalt 8 all day long. But with regular calls and browsing, this won’t give up before 12 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> At Rs 19,999 this is a good buy for those who want to use the phone for its top-end performance and to exploit the large screen for gaming. There are not many competitors in the octa core segment and that will give you a badge of exclusivity for some time to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iris-pro-30-small.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1975120" alt="Lava Iris Pro 30 is a stunner with one of the thinnest bodies in any smartphone" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iris-pro-30-small.jpg" /></a> Lava Iris Pro 30 is a stunner with one of the thinnest bodies in any smartphone
<p>After having garnered the numbers with affordable devices, Indian smartphone makers are slowly testing the upper segments with premium high-spec devices that can take on the bigwigs like Samsung and Apple right where it hurts. While Micromax has been successful with its Canvas series and Lava with Xolo, the latter has just announced a new Iris Pro series with similar ambitions at lower price points. Here we test the first of the lot, the Lava Iris Pro 30.</p>
<p>Quick Tech Specs: 4.7” IPS display (1280x720p) | 1.2GHz quad-core Mediatek MT6589 processor | 1GB RAM | 4GB storage + microSD slot | 8MP rear camera, 3MP front | Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n | Bluetooth 3.0 | Dual-SIM  | 2000mAh battery | Android 4.2 Jelly Bean</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iris-pro30-side-master.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1975121" alt="Iris pro30 side  Master" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iris-pro30-side-master.jpg?w=480&#038;h=48" width="480" height="48" /></a>Design: The Iris Pro 30 does not look like anything you have paid for. In fact, it is a stunner with one of the thinnest bodies in any smartphone, let alone a medium range one. It is slim at just 7.5 mm thickness and feels light at just 114 grams. Adding to this lightweight feel is the matte finish soft plastic back that gives it a superior feel. All ticks marks when it comes to design.</p>
<p>Screen: The Iris Pro 30 has a 720p HD screen from Sharp. But it feels better than some of the other phones with the same resolution thanks to the One Glass Solution that reduces on negates any gap between the touch panel and screen. It is also a very bright screen which makes reading stuff in the sunlight easier.</p>
<p>Performance: The Quadrant and Atuntu benchmark rating put this device between the Samsung Galaxy S2 and the Google Nexus 4, which is quite good considering the price point. Multi-tasking is easy, but then you would expect that with a quad core phone. We did not notice any heating up even while playing games. The phone really shone when I played some HD videos from YouTube even as I had the Robocop game paused in the background.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iris-pro-30-slide-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1975122" alt="Iris Pro 30 Slide 1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iris-pro-30-slide-1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=355" width="480" height="355" /></a>Memory: Lava has been stingy with on board memory before too. This one too just has 4GB of memory out of which the user gets a maximum of 1.5GB free. With so many  high end specification, the company could have been a bit more liberal with the space on offer and not let the user buy all the space he needed.</p>
<p>Software: There are not tweaks to the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system. We could find a Lava care app which we thought was a good addition. Lava’s software enhancements like flip to mute, lift to answer and call, voice and face unlocking all work with varying degrees of success. But never at a 100 per cent.</p>
<p>Camera: The 8MP camera on the phone is much better than what you would find in other devices of this price range. It is also very fast, both in auto focus and while clicking. That is something we can live with.</p>
<p>Battery: Lava has added content adaptive backlight control which is claims power consumption on the screen by 30 per cent. But then we could not feel anything extra. But the 2000 mAh battery easily lasts a full working day. If you keep the brightness low you should be able to get back home before the battery completely dies on you.</p>
<p>Verdict: At Rs 15,999 this is a good looking phone that promises decent all round performance. There no serious sore points with the phone, so if it fits your budget go ahead and buy this.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1975118&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mxit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1974548" alt="Roger Grobler, Gary Kirsten and Sam Rufus Nallaraj" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mxit.jpg" /></a> Roger Grobler, Gary Kirsten and Sam Rufus Nallaraj
<p>The world of messaging apps is getting very crowded and it is becoming increasingly hard for app makers to differentiate themselves. The latest to enter this race to offering a cheaper option to SMS and easier way to socialise, is South Africa&#8217;s Mxit.</p>
<p>The company thinks its strategy to get new users in the large Indian feature phone segment will set it apart from the rest of the pack. To its advantage is the fact that the app will work on almost all devices, except entry level mobile phones.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are definitely aiming for the large middle segment which could be as large as 500 million users. So the app will first be promoted in smaller town of Andra Pradesh,&#8221; Mxit India CEO Sam Rufus Nallaraj told The Indian Express. To cater to this segment, the app will also be able to send and receive message in Hindi. &#8220;Soon we will have support for at least 10 Indian languages,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The other interesting aspect of the app is that it leverage the power of the cloud to give some smartphone like features for its users. For instance, students will be able to use the app like a scientific calculator or periodic table with all the computing being done at the back-end and not on the phone. &#8220;We have this innovative app-in-app concept that lets them do all this. The same will be used by NGOs and non-profits to provide counselling and other services to users,&#8221; explained Mxit chairman Roger Grobler.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mxit1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1974550" alt="Mxit1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mxit1.png?w=480&#038;h=592" width="480" height="592" /></a>Mxit, which says it has been doing social networks much before Facebook, is already the largest player in South Africa commanding over 46 per cent of market with 6.5 million monthly average users. In fact, the app is used by UNICEF and others to provide services to subscribers and even send text books in e-book format to students in South Africa, Grobler explained.</p>
<p>The company has appointed South African cricket legend and former India coach Gary Kirsten and brand ambassador. &#8220;While we have a lot of common factors, there are topics like cricket that are popular in both countries. Our idea has always been to generate those conversations revolving around topics,&#8221; added Nallaraj, who was one of the semi-finalists in the reality show Apprentice Asia.</p>
<p>The app can be download on popular apps stores, or directly from<a href="http://in.mxit.com/"> mixt.com/in</a> or by texting MXIT to 57333</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1974546&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first Portronics Pure Sound portable speakers gave a host of options to those who had their music stashed away in multiple sources across the house. A year later, the company has an upgraded version of the device to a Pro version for those carrying around their music in a smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 2.5 W speakers | FM Tuner | BlueTooth | SD Card reader | USB | MP3/APE/FLAC  | 1000mAh Li-ion battery | Aux port | 3.5mm jack</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> The design is exactly the same as the Portronics Pure Sound, a long string of speaker with a stylish LED panel and buttons at the end. This business end also houses a battery of ports and the Lithium-ion battery. It would have been a great idea to have a flap here to prevent dust from accumulating here. Otherwise it is a very functional design and is not very heavy. There are buttons for volume, play and skip, mode and scan. Plus, the lightweight remove gives you a few more options like skipping folder when you are playing from a storage device.</p>
<p><strong>Audio:</strong> For the speaker that is not all that expensive and coming from a company that does not make its own drivers, the Pure Sound Pro has superb sound quality. Even over wireless the audio quality is clear and lossless. The best experience is obviously when you are playing from the SD card slot or the USB. It is also loud, and you will not need to go beyond the halfway mark. The Pro is not very high on bass, but not everyone needs that option.</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> I love the Pure Sound Pro for the fact that is gives the user every conceivable option and that is how manufacturers must think these days. So while this is primarily a device that feeds off your smartphone or laptop it also gives you the option of breaking free from the boredom of your playlist by switching to FM radio. Tuning stations is as simple as it can be and you can skip from one station to another in one touch. The Bluetooth pairing is also simple as the device starts scanning as soon as you enter this mode.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> The speaker comes with a removable phone-like Lithium-ion battery. On a single charge this can play for up to eight hours. However, there is power adapter in the box and you will need to plug in the USB cable into a smartphone charger or laptop to power this up. This means it takes rather long to charge the 1000 mAh battery.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> At Rs. 4,499, the Portronics Pure Sound Pro BT is good value for money option for those looking for a speaker for the home. There are not many other devices that give you so many source options while promising a decent playback quality.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1973543&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/glass-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1973959" alt="A new technique developed by researchers makes glass less brittle so that if it is dropped it simply bends. Reuters" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/glass-med.jpg" /></a> A new technique developed by researchers makes glass less brittle so that if it is dropped it simply bends. Reuters
<p>Scientists are developing a new gen-next glass that bends but does not shatter when dropped. A new technique developed by researchers makes glass less brittle so that if it is dropped it simply bends and becomes slightly deformed rather than breaking.</p>
<p>Professor Francois Barthelat from the McGill University&#8217;s Department of Mechanical Engineering and his team took inspiration from the mechanics of natural structures like seashells in order to significantly increase the toughness of glass. &#8220;Mollusk shells are made up of about 95 per cent chalk, which is very brittle in its pure form,&#8221; said Barthelat.</p>
<p>&#8220;But nacre, or mother-of-pearl, which coats the inner shells, is made up of microscopic tablets that are a bit like miniature Lego building blocks, is known to be extremely strong and tough, which is why people have been studying its structure for the past twenty years,&#8221; said Barthelat.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to recreate the structures of nacre have proved to be challenging, according to Barthelat. The team studied the internal &#8216;weak&#8217; boundaries or edges to be found in natural materials like nacre and then use lasers to engrave networks of 3D micro-cracks in glass slides in order to create similar weak boundaries.</p>
<p>The researchers were able to increase the toughness of glass slides (the kind of glass rectangles that get put under microscopes) 200 times compared to non-engraved slides.</p>
<p>By engraving networks of micro-cracks in configurations of wavy lines in shapes similar to the wavy edges of pieces in a jigsaw puzzle in the surface of borosilicate glass, they were able to stop the cracks from propagating and becoming larger. The researchers worked with glass slides simply because they were accessible, but Barthelat believes that the process will be very easy to scale up to any size of glass sheet, since people are already engraving logos and patterns on glass panels.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we know now is that we can toughen glass, or othermaterials, by using patterns of micro-cracks to guide larger cracks, and in the process absorb the energy from an impact,&#8221; said Barthelat.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1973909&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>NASA is planning to launch robotic missions to make water on the Moon in 2018 and oxygen on Mars in 2020.</p>
<p>The Moon mission will be the US space agency&#8217;s first attempt to demonstrate in-situ resource utilisation (ISRU) beyond Earth.</p>
<p>The purpose of ISRU, or &#8220;living off the land&#8221; is to harness and utilise space resources to create products and services which enable and significantly reduce the mass, cost, and risk of near-term and long-term space exploration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every pound that you don&#8217;t have to launch from the Earth of dumb mass &#8211; things like water and air and propellant &#8211; means that you can add a pound of intelligent mass &#8211; an experiment, a computer, something designed to accomplish some job or give us some capability,&#8221; said lunar geologist Paul Spudis, with the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doing ISRU gives you incredible leverage because you&#8217;re changing the fraction of intelligent-to-dumb mass on your spacecraft in favour of the intelligent part,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The first in-space ISRU test is targeted for 2018, &#8216;Discovery News&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>NASA plans to launch a mission called Resource Prospector that includes a rover with instruments to scout for telltale hydrogen, drill out samples, heat them and scan for water vapour and other volatiles on the moon.</p>
<p>Vapour also could be re-condensed to form a drop of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the technologies have broader use than just lunar&#8230;it&#8217;s just a convenient location to be testing the ISRU technology,&#8221; said Jason Crusan, director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA headquarters in Washington DC.</p>
<p>A second ISRU experiment is due to be aboard NASA&#8217;s next Mars rover, which is slated for launch in 2020.</p>
<p>The device, which is yet to be selected, would pull carbon dioxide from the planet&#8217;s atmosphere, filter out dust and other particles and prepare the gas for chemical processing into oxygen.</p>
<p>The demonstration also could include actual oxygen production, the report said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1973896&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/ear460.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1973656" alt="F&amp;D H50 &amp; H30 headphones" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/ear460.jpg" /></a> F&amp;D H50 &amp; H30 headphones
<p>Nowadays on-ear headphones aren’t that popular as they used to be some years back. This is simply because people like to listen to music while in transit on the much lighter and easy-to-wear in-ear headphones. But if you ask me, a listener gets an altogether different experience while catching up with his/her choice of music from a conventional on-ear headphone set. I get such an out-of-the-world audio experience with my Sennheiser Momentum headphones. Not only do they sound as good as they look, the vastly superior German audio technology embedded inside ensures that soulful music is deeply engrained in our minds for a longer duration. Most important, they completely block out outside noise.</p>
<p>Recently, Fenda Audio (F&amp;D) sent across their Discovery headphones—H50 and H30—for a product review. With its latest headphones, F&amp;D is offering style-hungry consumers a refined, semi-classical design with a touch of flash. Both the on-the-head audio gears are comfortable to wear for hours at a time. But how do these affordable offerings perform in real life, read on to find out.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery H50</strong></p>
<p>Out of the box, the H50’s style is modern, carefully designed to appeal to the style conscious and generation next. It comprises a finely stitched genuine leather outer headband that ensures durability of the headphones. If you are the kind who prefers rough and tough usage of electronic accessories and enjoys good sound, Discovery H50 has to be your pick. It retails for Rs 3,990.</p>
<p>In my assessment, a good headphone is the one that is easy and comfortable to wear, besides having the capability to stream high quality audio. The H50 provides a comfortable fit to the user as he listens to the soul stirring music. The adjustable inner headband covered in soft finishing puts a tick mark on this aspect. Not to forget, the soft touch ear pads add to the unruffled experience.</p>
<p>The H50, designed in Korea, measures 210 x 240 x 90 mm in body dimensions. In technical terms, it has a driver size of 40 mm, frequency response of 20 to 20,000 Hz, sensitivity of 97 dB/mW and impedance of 32 ohm. Maximum input power is of 50 mW and the headphone comes with a 3 mm gold plated jack which is compatible with mobile phones, iPods, MP3 players, iPads, laptops and PCs.</p>
<p>The H50 feels like it weighs almost nothing on your head, but in fact its 230 grams, which is about average for full-size headphones. This professional stereo headphone promises precision and sound detail, thanks to its double-layered ear-shells that reduces resonance and vibration. In terms of actual usage, the H50’s acoustic chamber design does manage to create authentic and superior sound performance. The semi-open back architecture of H50 lends the listener some impactful bass reproduction and also prevents sound leakage. The bass, mid-range, treble balance is very smooth, with no overly exaggerated frequencies.</p>
<p>Overall, a very accurate set of headphones designed for buyers who want to hear sound with nothing added or taken away from the music.</p>
<p><strong>Discovery H30</strong></p>
<p>The first thing that strikes you about these not-so-new peerless black headphones is its styling. Entailing a semi-open back architecture for profound, solid bass reproduction, the Discovery H30 headphones have it in them to be part of your gadgets must-haves kit. Their unique styling may not align with everyone’s tastes, but I think it looks great.</p>
<p>Overall build quality is fairly decent. F&amp;D has carefully crafted the outer headband with genuine leather and an adjustable inner headband with soft finishing, ensuring durability and comfort for the users.</p>
<p>The double-layered ear-shells reduce vibration and lend impeccable sound detailing to the listener. Importantly, the fine cable used for the headphones provide excellent strength and flexibility.</p>
<p>The core competence of the F&amp;D H30 is its sound—and it’s no less than crystal clear. The good audio experience between your ears is possible thanks to the headphone’s fine woven fabric that controls sound leakage.</p>
<p>Making sure the rhythms are pure and unadulterated, its acoustic chamber design offers fine listening experience.</p>
<p>In real usage, the H30 is equally adept playing movies and music, thanks to its unfatiguing sound. The sound is never harsh or unpleasant in any way. These Rs 2,490-a-piece headphones are highly accurate and clear. They will appeal to those who prize clarity, but at an affordable price.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1973652&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>BlackBerry has finally brought out an update that fixes a lot of bugs and adds features that were missed in earlier versions of its  BlackBerry 10 OS. The new version 10.2.1 makes it easier to do a lot of things and brings the operating system at par with other OS. Here are 10 features that are good enough for you to go ahead with the update when it becomes available on your device in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> It is now easier to receive or reject a call. The new call screen lets users swipe to the left to answer or swipe right to ignore a call.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> You can now respond with a message. Along with the regular option of respond to calls through SMS or email, you can now see if a call is coming from a user who has BBM app and send a BBM message too.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The BlackBerry Hub is now much more customisable and can show only unread messages, flagged messages, draft messages, meeting invites, sent messages or Level 1 Alerts which override silent settings.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Everyone has been able to do this for years, but now BlackBerry users will also be able to create SMS and email groups to broadcast messages.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Windows does it as simply as possible, but the new BlackBerry picture tpassword adds another level of security by using a combination of pictures and numbers. To unlock, users have to drag the grid so that the selected number overlays the particular point on the image.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Quick Settings Menu, which is often the first port of call for fixing an issues, can now be customised to add more features. The menu also includes a toggle that lets you instantly switch between your Personal and Work sphere.</p>
<p><strong> 7.</strong> Users can now decide to which source the contact has to be synced. Works really well for people who want to segregate work and personal contacts.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> There a quite a few Android apps that do this, so the Device and Battery Monitor is not really new. The feature lets you check battery status as well as  memory and storage.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> The operating system can now be set to update automatically over Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> The new version unlocks the FM radio in BlackBerry Z30, BlackBerry Q10 and BlackBerry Q5 smartphones.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-gear-008-set1-side_six.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1972846" alt="Samsung Galaxy Gear is priced Rs 22,900, but you need to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 too" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-gear-008-set1-side_six.jpg" /></a> Samsung Galaxy Gear is priced Rs 22,900, but you need to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 too
<p>I have been wearing a smartwatch for over a month now. So when I finally got a chance to review the Samsung Galaxy Gear smartwatch, it was only natural that I started comparing it with my Pebble. Here are the results.</p>
<p><strong>WATCH:</strong> There is no doubt that the Pebble is the better watch of the two. But that is not because it is more accurate in timekeeping, but because once you wear it you don’t realise it is on your wrist. But the Galaxy Gear is a bit heavier and with a clip on strap and these two factors constantly remind you that there is something there. Plus, the review unit I had was bright orange and that sure got me more attention than I am used to. Then it has the camera bump on one side and that sort of reminds you that this is no ordinary watch. The Pebble on the other hand has so many watch faces that you can get one with which on one will realise that you have smartwatch on.</p>
<p><strong><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='480' height='267' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/Fp-lPjS5cWc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>SET-UP:</strong> The Gear is very easy to set up. But the problem here is that is can be used only in tandem with a few top-end Samsung Galaxy smartphones. The Pebble on the otherhand works with most iOS and Android devices. But the Gear has something that make life so easy for the user. Thanks to NFC you can just tap the watch with its Galaxy phone to get a link. Both the Gear and the Pebble need the phone to install apps.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-gear_004_combination_black-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1972844" alt="Galaxy Gear_004_combination_black (2)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-gear_004_combination_black-2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320" width="480" height="320" /></a>PERFORMANCE:</strong> You can do much more with the Galaxy Gear than you would with the Pebble. For instance, the Gear has a camera and that sorts of adds so many new scenarios to what you can do with a watch. Then this has a Super AMOLED display, compared to the Pebble’s e-paper display and is hence capable of doing much more. While the Pebble shows calls, notifications and alerts from your phone, the Gear actually lets you dial and even make the call using just the watch and with the help of voice. And that is a wow feature that sort of made me feel a bit like James Bond. The audio quality is not all that good though, especially if there is a lot of ambient noise around. Then you can use the voice controls to create notes and reminders. Actually, the Gear lets you do almost everything that you can with your smartphone. The Pebble is in comparison just a smartwatch.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/20140126_131807.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1972863" alt="20140126_131807" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/20140126_131807.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>APPS:</strong> The Pebble is a star when it comes to watchfaces and users have the choice to choose hundreds of them depending on your mood, religion or political inclination. It has apps too, but they are mostly third party apps that need to downloaded to the phone first and transferred to the phone. A lot of the apps are limited by the fact that there is no colour screen. The Gear has no such limitations. In fact, its 1.6-inch screen is powered by an 800 MHz Processor and hence it can run a lot of powerful apps. There is already a superb Evernote app, Banjo and MyFitness apps. You can get Line and ChatOn message on your wrist while pedometer and media controller are pre-installed. Plus, the phone (in our case a Galaxy Note 3) and the watch can find each other. All of these worked out of the box and without any hitches.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mix.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1972848" alt="mix" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mix.jpg?w=454&#038;h=267" width="454" height="267" /></a>CAMERA:</strong> The real differentiator of the Galaxy Gear is the camera 1.9MP camera with auto-focus that creates these amazing photography opportunities we would not have imagined before. The camera and its results, both still and video, are good when you consider it has been shot from a watch. I would have loved to have had a front facing camera to make video chats much more natural.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-gear-006-set1-front_six.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1972845" alt="Galaxy Gear-006-Set1 Front_Six" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-gear-006-set1-front_six.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>BATTERY:</strong> Built to work like a smartphone, the Gear has a battery life almost similar to those devices. So you will be lucky to get 48 hours on a full charge if you are using this device to its potential. In comparison the Pebble gives you a week of juice on a full charge. In fact, I charge mine only on weekends. The Gear also needs to be put inside a special cover to be able to take the micro-USB port. No such hassle with the magnetic charging ports of the Pebble.</p>
<p><strong>SHOULD YOU BUY IT:</strong> That is a tough one, especially since there is no concept of buying the Galaxy Gear on its own at the moment. You need to buy it with a smartphone like the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and that means it will put you back by around Rs 60,000. If you don’t mind that and have been waiting to buy a new phone as well, then it a good combo. It is a easier decision for those who have a compatible Galaxy device as this just augments the entire experience. As for me, I am quite happy with my $150 Pebble.</p>
<p><strong>Rs 22,900</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/blackberry-10-2-1-image.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1972430" alt="BlackBerry 10.2.1 now allows users to natively install Android apps" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/blackberry-10-2-1-image.jpg" /></a> BlackBerry 10.2.1 now allows users to natively install Android apps
<p>Faced with dropping sales of its much-hyped new devices all over the world, BlackBerry Limited on Tuesday announced an update bringing in a lot of features demanded by its users. However, the most interesting feature in the new 10.2.1 version its BlackBerry 10 OS is that it allows users to natively install Android apps from third party sources. This might solve one of the biggest grouses BlackBerry users have had with its new, and old, platforms: the lack of apps that are popular on other platforms. However, it also opens up what is considered to be the most secure mobile platform to vulnerabilities that could come embedded in unverified Android apps.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the press release does not mention this minor detail, which could in effect be the biggest strategic shift the company has made in recent years. Even at the closed door briefing in New Delhi, this fact was mentioned at the very end, almost like an afterthought. Advait Vaidya, BlackBerry India’s head of product management, clarified that BB10 users will not be able to download apps from the Google Play Store, and will have to do so from ‘trusted’ third party sources. Plus, these apps would be able to run on the work sphere of devices that are managed by IT departments of companies.</p>
<p>BlackBerry had come in for a lot of flak when it allowed porting of Android apps to its new BB10 app store. A year on, it seems the inability to get the apps that matter has forced the Canadian smartphone maker to capitulate and open up for third party apps. It is surprising why the company did not decide to open a curated Android app store of its own, as that would have given it the ability to keep out risky software. However, CTOs will react to this new ‘improved’ OS remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The company announced a host of improvements to its BB10 OS with the new update, including a customised pinch gesture to filter blackberry hub to show just filtered messages and incoming call screen that lets you swipe to the left to answer or swipe right to ignore a call.  Like in other operating systems, users can now respond to a call with a text message and even a BBM is the caller is on the messaging platform. The OS now lets users create SMS and email groups and has a picture-number password for quick unlocking. There is also an exhaustive device and battery monitor as well as FM Radio for Z30, Q10 and Q5 smartphones.</p>
<p>But none of these features are revolutionary and have been available on other platforms for years. What is really revolutionary is the fact that a platform that prides itself as being the most secure now lets you install software made for the platform that is notorious as being the most insecure.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1972428&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Scientists say they have discovered the first new river dolphin species in nearly 100 years inhabiting the Araguaia River in Brazil&#8217;s vast Amazon rainforest.</p>
<p>The discovery of the &#8220;Inia araguaiaensis&#8221; was officially announced earlier this week in a study posted on line by the <em>Plos One</em> scientific journal.</p>
<p>Biologist Tomas Hrbek works at the Federal University of Amazonas in the city of Manaus and is the lead author of the study. He says the new species is the third found in the Amazon region.</p>
<p>Hrbek said it &#8220;it was an unexpected discovery that shows just how incipient our knowledge is of the region&#8217;s biodiversity.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is a fantastic device, but it can't replace your PC or your smartphone, even at this price. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1971916&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-note-10-1-product-image-1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1971920 " alt="GALAXY Note 10.1 Product Image (1)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-note-10-1-product-image-1.jpg" /></a> Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 has the highest resolution screen Samsung has put on its tablets
<p dir="ltr">With a faux leather finish on the back and a fantastic stylus to change your method of input, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 is ready to take on the iPad. But can it justify the 50,000-rupee price tag?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 10.1-inch Super Clear LCD display (2560&#215;1600 pixels, 299 ppi) | 1.9GHz quad-core processor + secondary 1.3GHz quad-core processor | 3GB RAM | 32GB storage + microSD slot (up to 64GB) | 8MP rear camera (1080p FullHD video), 2MP front camera (1080p FulHD video) | 3G with SIM slot | Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n/ac, Wi-Di | Bluetooth 4.0 | 8220mAh battery | Android 4.3 Jelly Bean</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Design:</strong> Is it plastic? Yup. Does it feel cheap? Nope. Samsung&#8217;s devices have historically gotten a lot of flak for their &#8220;plastic-y&#8221; feel, but as we have seen with the Note 3, the introduction of a new faux leather finish on the back is changing all this. Couple that with ridged trimmings on the sides (again, plastic made to look like metal) and solid build quality, and it&#8217;s hard not to be impressed with the look and feel of the device. Even the stylus, housed at the back, is perfectly flush with the design and gives you a satisfying click when you remove or insert it.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Screen:</strong> This is the highest resolution screen Samsung has put on its tablets and the result is clear to see when you&#8217;re reading. Whether it&#8217;s text or comics, the Note 10.1 can rival the iPad and any other slate out there. But the screen does take its toll on the processor.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Performance:</strong> You&#8217;d think that with two quad-core processors, the Note 10.1 could handle anything you threw at it. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s a noticeable lag on the default TouchWiz UI itself. And it gets worse when you are multi-tasking between heavy apps like an HD game and the Chrome browser. If you&#8217;re playing a game like FIFA 14 and receive a bunch of notifications in the background, you&#8217;ll see a slight stutter now and again. At Rs. 50,000, this is unacceptable.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-note-10-1-product-image-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1971921" alt="GALAXY Note 10.1 Product Image (4)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-note-10-1-product-image-4.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>Memory:</strong> There&#8217;s 32GB of built-in memory (of which 26GB is available to the user), and a microSD slot for another 64GB card.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Personally, I do believe tablets are best when you put a SIM card in them. It actually makes them more useable on the move, and that&#8217;s the whole point, right? So it&#8217;s great that the Note 10.1 offers this option.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Software:</strong> We&#8217;ll come to the Air Command for the S-Pen in a bit, but even apart from that, Samsung&#8217;s TouchWiz customizations are best on these large-screen devices, especially the 10-inch tablets. Something like the Multi Window view, which lets you open two apps next to each other, makes the tablet immensely more powerful as a computing device. You can actually imagine doing a lot of real work on this, unlike an iPad. That said, Samsung does go a bit overboard with the built-in apps, like the unnecessary Flipboard-integrated My Magazine. If you don&#8217;t want that RSS reader, well, too bad because you&#8217;re stuck with it, taking up RAM and memory. And then there&#8217;s Smart Stay, tracking your eyes to keep the screen alive when you&#8217;re reading—and hogging battery in the process.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Camera:</strong> The 8MP camera of the Note 10.1 is a significant upgrade to its predecessor and is every bit as good as last year&#8217;s iPad 4 camera. The iPad still holds an edge in its better focussing ability, but the Note 10.1 triumphs in low-light shots with better flash. That said, neither is as good as the flagship smartphones of their respective companies.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Battery:</strong> Some day, there will be a tablet with better battery life than the iPad—unfortunately, that&#8217;s not today. The Note 10.1 puts up a valiant effort with nine hours of continuous video playback and 8 hours of Wi-Fi browsing. But the battery also depends on whether you have a SIM card loaded or not because looking for network with the Note 10.1&#8242;s weak antenna drains the battery faster. On average usage, you can expect this gadget to last you about 15 hours of usage.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Special Mention:</strong> Of course, what makes the Note 10.1 stand out is its remarkable S-Pen stylus. If you ever thought Samsung doesn&#8217;t innovate enough, you really haven&#8217;t used the S-Pen for enough time with its new Air Commands. The combination of the stylus and the software changes how you use a tablet, as you can read in this <a href="http://http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/pen-is-mightier-samsung-galaxy-note-10-1-show-a-stylus-can-change-how-you-use-tablets/">piece</a>. Suffice to say, it&#8217;s a big deal, whether you want to take notes, draw sketches or anything else.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Verdict:</strong> Where the iPad is great for consuming content, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 wants you to consume but also create content. Samsung&#8217;s loaded it with a stylus and some nifty software to do that, but does that justify the price tag of Rs. 49,990? Sadly, no. It&#8217;s a fantastic device, it really is, but it can&#8217;t replace your PC or your smartphone, and that&#8217;s just too high a price to pay for an in-between device. When it eventually drops to around the Rs. 37,000 mark (which is its current price in the U.S.), pick it up without a second thought.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1971916&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/note3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1971142" alt="The S-Pen and its software add-ons make you believe tablets should ideally come with a built-in stylus." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/note3.jpg" /></a> The S-Pen and its software add-ons make you believe tablets should ideally come with a built-in stylus.
<p>Let me take you back to 2007, when Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs first introduced the world to the iPhone. At one point, he reached the subject of touch input. &#8220;Who wants a stylus? You have to get &#8216;em and put &#8216;em away, and you lose &#8216;em. Yuck. Nobody wants a stylus. So let&#8217;s not use a stylus.&#8221; And with those few lines, he split the touchscreen world into two camps: finger input and stylus input. For a long time, there were debates about which is better. It&#8217;s safe to say that the finger has come out on top, like Jobs predicted. But there&#8217;s one mistake he made: You don&#8217;t have to choose between the two.</p>
<p>No Apple touchscreen product ships with a stylus as the company still believes your finger is the best pointing device around. And that&#8217;s fair. But it&#8217;s silly to think that it&#8217;s the best pointing device for every use case scenario. Have you tried sketching with your finger, or writing notes with it?</p>
<p>Much like with any debate between extremes, the answer to &#8220;Which is better, the finger or the stylus?&#8221; lay in a middle path that didn&#8217;t make the user choose a camp, and instead empowered him with the best of both. That&#8217;s what Samsung has done with the S-Pen and its software add-ons for the Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. It&#8217;s good enough to make me believe tablets should ideally come with a built-in stylus.</p>
<p><strong>80% Finger, 20% Stylus</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Even with the Note 10.1, you will end up using your finger for 80% of your tasks. The thing is, that stylus fills a gap for the 20% which you can&#8217;t do well on an iPad or other tablets. These are simple, everyday tasks.</p>
<p>You walk into a meeting and you need to take notes—wouldn&#8217;t it be helpful to take those notes on a tablet and have it auto-convert them into digital text, so you can search through them later? That&#8217;s what the S-Pen does with the Action Memo.</p>
<p>You need to quickly open a calculator as a floating window in a specific part of the screen while working on your spreadsheet? Samsung&#8217;s Air Command has a &#8220;Pen Window&#8221; feature just for that.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re an artist who wants to sketch? There&#8217;s plenty of great apps built-in and the S-Pen is pressure-sensitive, making it easier to draw.</p>
<p>Good hardware always needs to be complemented by good software and Samsung has demonstrated this very well with the S-Pen and its many features on the Note 10.1. The apps just work! I was surprised by how accurate the Action Memo was in recognizing what I was writing. I have atrocious handwriting, as you can see, but it was still able to transcribe most of it, making only three small errors.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/note1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1971139" alt="note1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/note1.png?w=480&#038;h=300" width="480" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/note2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1971140" alt="note2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/note2.png?w=480&#038;h=300" width="480" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Not Perfect, But Better Than Nothing</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Using the S-Pen stylus still has its shortcomings. For one, the button on it is placed in a way where you will accidentally click it a few times. Plus, you should still follow some of the rules of actual pen and paper, like always writing in portrait mode, since writing in landscape makes each line too long.</p>
<p>And you can&#8217;t be using the S-Pen all the time. A lot of touchscreen interactions have now been made keeping finger input in mind, like long-presses and gestures. Performing the same with the stylus does not work properly many times.</p>
<p>Still, the utility it offers in those 20% aforementioned scenarios is a godsend. And the more I used the Note 10.1, the more reliant I got on that little S-Pen. The handwriting recognition of the device is pretty good, so I often found myself using it over a regular keyboard for short replies and messages.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s perfect pairing of great software and hardware makes you realise how good devices would be if they offered a little more choice to users. I really do wish the iPad came with a stylus, complete with custom software from Apple to make the most of it. But for now, the Note 10.1 is what you will need to buy if a high-end stylus-equipped tablet is what you seek.</p>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sony4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1970599" alt="Sony Vaio Flip" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sony4801.jpg" /></a> Sony Vaio Flip is available in four variants.
<p><strong><span style="font-size:large;">Sony Vaio Flip: Flipping display</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Ever since the launch of Windows 8, laptop makers’ have tried to be creative with designs to optimise the machines. This year, Sony has launched a new take on the 2-in-1 laptop — the Vaio Flip, whose display flips 180 degrees. The laptop is quite portable at 1.31 kg (13-inch model with 128 GB SSD). But if you want more storage space, you lose out on the portability. The weight of the 14-inch variant with 1 TB storage is 1.96 kg. These laptops ship with Intel’s fourth generation Core i5 and i7 processors and Intel HD 4400 graphics. The Vaio Flip is available in four variants.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:large;">Rs 94,990+</span></em></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:large;"><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mad4801.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1970601" alt="Micromax mAD" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mad4801.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:large;">Micromax MAd A94: Watch ads, get ‘paid’</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">How about a smartphone that can pay you? Micromax has launched MAd A94 which allows users to watch commercials and earn credits into postpaid/pre-paid accounts. With one-time registration, the service will work for all subscribers across all operators. With a 4.5-inch touchscreen, the ads should be fun to watch. The smartphone packs a 1.2 GHz quad core processor, 1,800 mAh battery and runs Jelly Bean 4.2.2. MAd A94 has a 5-MP rear and front cameras, so your I-just-got-paid-for-watching-an-ad selfie is pretty clear in Facebook.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:large;">Metis Learning Eddy: Tablet for children</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">An Indian startup, Metis Learning, has launched tablet Eddy for children up to 10 years old. The tablet runs 4.2 Jelly Bean and comes with several games that help kids learn subjects such as mathematics. The tablet also has features to help parents monitor their children’s usage. Parents can create three child profiles on Eddy to personalise their learning experience. The tablet has a platform called Eddy Zone, which has content for children. Eddy can also access Google Play Store. The tablet comes with a shock-absorbing cover, in case the children decide to thump Learning Eddy on the floor.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:large;">Bike Mount Universal: Smartphone on a bike</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">Talking on the phone while riding a bike is not a good idea. But with Cygnett’s bike mounts, talking or even snapping a scene while biking could be a breeze. The accessories brand’s latest launch Bike Mount Universal I &amp; II (for standard and large smartphones) and a bike mount for iPhone (5, 5S) have a zip-closure mechanism and additional foam inserts for a wide range of models. The universal mounts cost Rs 1,999, while the iPhone-only mount costs Rs 3,999. Cygnett says a key feature of these mounts is the easy installation and retrieval.</span></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Nokia steps in with a big phone — Lumia 1520 — and strikes the right chord<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1970296&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/nokia480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1970623" alt="Nokia  Lumia 1520" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/nokia480.jpg" /></a> Nokia Lumia 1520
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In line with the rest of the smartphone industry, Nokia has finally brought a huge phablet to the Indian market. Nokia Lumia 1520 is a six-inch phone that takes the baton from the 1020, which has a 41-MP camera. The company already has quite a few big phones in its stable, but the 1520 is the biggest of the lot. This is Nokia’s most powerful phone, and the Rs 46,999 price tag reflects that. For that price, a person is spoilt for choice, with several excellent phones available in the market. Lumia 1520 is the only Windows Phone in that band. Let’s find out if it is worth buying.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Build &amp; Design: </strong></em>The 1520 is a big phone. The black variant comes with a matte finish that is good to hold. The phone doesn’t slip off the palm easily, which is crucial considering how big it is. The size makes it nearly impossible to use with one hand, so does its weight (209 g). It fit in the front pocket of only one of the five trousers I wore while reviewing the device, and even then, taking the phone out to take calls was tedious. This is the first Lumia phone to require a nano-SIM card, also found on iPhone 5 and 5S. The nano-SIM is smaller than micro-SIM cards and most telecom operators let users swap SIM cards for a nominal fee.</p>
<p>Like most Lumia phones, the design of the 1520 is immaculate and the touchscreen is very responsive. Buttons for volume, power and camera are on the right hand side of the device. There is no marking to indicate which button does what, so you will have to figure that out initially. This phone supports expandable memory via microSD cards in case you want more storage.</p>
<p>The display on this phone is excellent. Whether you are reading outdoors or in a dark room, it will not disappoint. Blacks are prominent and colours are vivid on the screen. This is a great phone for watching films.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/nokia4801.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1970651" alt="Nokia Lumia 1520" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/nokia4801.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Software &amp; Performance: </strong></em>In our review of Windows Phone 8 last year, we had said that it is a refreshing take on a smartphone OS. It has several good features but is lacking in some basic areas. While testing the Lumia 1520, we noticed a few major shortcomings in the software. The first is the lack of a good notification centre. In Android and iOS, you can check your messages, email and other updates by swiping down from the top of the screen. In Windows Phone, these notifications disappear after a couple of seconds. If you miss a notification, there is no way to find it. In this operating system, notifications appear on the apps arrayed on the home screen — referred to as live tiles. Not all apps support live tiles, which underlines the need for a notification centre. Let’s hope it comes to the platform soon.</p>
<p>A minor problem was the inability to sync the Google calender and contacts. A Nokia spokesperson told us that this is a known issue with the operating system, so perhaps a fix is on the way. In the meantime, Nokia ships the phone with an excellent app called Transfer My Data, which uses Bluetooth to copy contacts from another phone. It worked perfectly with an iPhone.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is imperative to highlight how much the app store has evolved in the past year. Many of the better apps from Android and iOS are available on Windows Phone now, including Instagram, Vine, Path, Temple Run, Kindle and more. There are unofficial apps for some services such as Google Hangouts and Dropbox, so you won’t miss much, should you buy this phone. A large number of apps look much better on smaller Lumia phones, but that may be a simple case of developers not optimising apps for six-inch devices. WhatsApp users will be disappointed with the Windows Phone version as messages often reach late and the app often fails to notify about incoming messages.</p>
<p>Nokia must be praised for equipping yet another phone with a great camera. The 1520’s 20.7-MP camera performs well in most conditions. It did not perform well during thick fog at night, unlike the 1020 which is still far better than any camera Nokia has made.</p>
<p>This phone performed very well when handling heavy tasks such as gaming and watching films simultaneously. The battery takes a long time to charge, but lasts over a day on heavy use.</p>
<p><em><strong>Should You Buy It?</strong></em><strong><em> </em></strong>If you are comfortable with the size and don’t overly-depend on Google services, the Lumia 1520 is a recommended purchase. Good apps, a great camera and exceptional battery life make it worth buying.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/m2-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1969850" alt="The price is a reasonable Rs 1,999" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/m2-1.jpg" /></a> The price is a reasonable Rs 1,999
<p>Do you panic when your internet connection drops? When the deadline looms, I do. Many of us rely on the Internet to earn a living so whether it is power cuts, poor network coverage or unscheduled downtime, the cost of such outages is huge.</p>
<p>During one such deadline-hour power cut, I realised that my phone had run out of charge. I had to borrow a neighbour&#8217;s phone and use it as a Wi-Fi hotspot to send my story. To put it mildly, the editor was not happy.</p>
<p>When I first used Tata Photon Max Wi-Fi last week, a USB dongle that lets you access the internet on up to five devices, I wished I&#8217;d had it a year ago. The amount of hardware and software configuration needed for a broadband connection make it unviable for many. If you had a USB stick that you could use to quickly connect five devices to the internet, things would be a lot more convenient than a broadband connection. That is just what the Photon Max Wi-Fi offers.</p>
<p><strong>SETTING IT UP</strong></p>
<p>The review unit we got was pre-configured, so all I had to do was connect it to a power socket and the device started working in half a minute. I couldn&#8217;t find the installation manual on the Tata Photon website, so I have uploaded it here: <a href="http://is.gd/mg1pr4" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/mg1pr4</a>. Going by those instructions, it looks like the installation process and changing Wi-Fi passwords is going to be difficult for most people. However, it&#8217;s a one-time hassle.</p>
<p><strong>COVERAGE</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, the device works as advertised after you configure it. It is almost identical to the Photon Max, whose coverage I&#8217;ve found to be very reliable in most big cities. The Photon Max Wi-Fi has a blue and a green light. A stable blue light means that the device has connected to the Internet, while a stable green light means that your gadgets are connected to Photon Max Wi-Fi. In over a week of testing, I faced no downtime.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/m2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1969849" alt="M2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/m2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>SPEED</strong></p>
<p>Tata promises up to 6.2 Mbps speed on the Photon Max. The speed we got ranged between 1.4 Mbps and 2.6 Mbps, when tested on speedtest.net. By no means should this be considered slow. Three to four people had connected phones and tablets to the Wi-Fi network and were constantly browsing, chatting and updating apps. The connection did not slow down much during that test.</p>
<p><strong>RANGE</strong></p>
<p>The most surprising aspect that emerged during testing was the range of the device. The Tata website says the range is up to 100 metres. In our tests, we got a range of up to 20-30 metres in The Indian Express&#8217; office. As is common, the signal went weak when there were thick walls between the Photon Max Wi-Fi and my phone. This means that the device may not be best for homes with more than two rooms. But most offices don&#8217;t have those walls, so the range should be much better there.</p>
<p><strong>ONE MORE THING&#8230;</strong><br />
It has been quite some time since we last came across a device that is so obviously useful, but as reviewers, our job is to find the catch. While using the Photon Max Wi-Fi, I wished that the device had a battery or that Tata had offered a battery pack as a bundle offer of some sort. While you&#8217;re travelling, sometimes you may not find a power socket or working USB port. For those cases, we recommend purchasing a portable battery pack – one that lets you plug in USB devices.</p>
<p><strong>Should you buy it</strong>?</p>
<p>If you need a stable, portable Wi-Fi connection at home or office, then the Tata Photon Max Wi-Fi will be an excellent purchase. The price is reasonable – Rs 1,999. Plans range from Rs 650 per month (up to 3 GB) to Rs 1,500 per month (up to 15 GB) excluding taxes. However, if you use more than 15 GB data per month, then it would be better to get a broadband connection as Tata curtails speed to 153.8 kbps once you hit the limit.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1969847&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Nokia will give the best idea in 'Your Wish is My App' show Rs 10 lakh. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1969447&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/picture1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1969461" alt="Picture1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/picture1.jpg" /></a> The first season resulted in 38,000 ideas.
<p>When Nokia launched the ‘Your Wish is My App’ contest last year, the idea was to engage with Nokia Lumia users and understand the kind of apps they would want to use. But the response to the event was much beyond what the Finnish phonemaker had bargained for. While they were expecting a maximum of 5,000 entries, by the end of the contest they had to employ Ernst Young to audit the 38,000 ideas. A year down the line, 1,200 of these ideas have become apps, while 300 more are in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Now, the company is once again partnering with NDTV for a second season of what could arguably be the only reality show on apps. This time the company will take in entries from all over the world and fly in the shortlisted contestants to India. While the person suggesting the best idea will be awarded Rs 10 lakh, two runners up each will get Rs 5 lakh and Rs 2 lakh each.</p>
<p>Nokia India MD P Balaji said apps are literally governing our lives, especially in a country like India where the access to the Internet is primarily from the phone. “Our youth are very aspirational and seeking to consume, converse and create,” he added, underlining the main reason for the growing popularity of the apps. “Now, about 1.6 billion apps are downloaded a year and that number is expected to grow up to 9 billion in 2016 and it is changing our behaviours.” The company expects to rake in over 50,000 idea this time.</p>
<p>“When training new kids in the kitchen, I ensure they are not made slaves of rules. So when I got an opportunity in the show I had to do it,” explained New York-based chef Vikas Khanna. He says it is also necessary for someone who is not associated with technology to be part of such a show.

<p>Fresh water suitable for life flowed on the surface of the Red Planet four billion years ago, according to new evidence found by NASA&#8217;s Mars Rover Opportunity.</p>
<p>The findings from rock samples collected and examined by Opportunity have confirmed an ancient wet environment that was milder and older than the acidic and oxidising conditions revealed by rocks the rover examined previously, NASA said.</p>
<p>&#8220;While Mars is too cold now to have the liquid water needed for life, we&#8217;ve had evidence for past water activity on the planet from satellite images of valleys and analysis of rocks by the Rovers,&#8221; Dr Paulo de Souza, who is on the science team led by Cornell University&#8217;s Professor Steven Squyres, said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the water that once shaped those landscapes and minerals was as acidic as vinegar,&#8221; de Souza from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our latest research has found not only the earliest episode of water activity documented yet by the Opportunity Rover, but that the geochemistry of the 4 billion year old rocks indicates extensive deposits of past water that&#8217;s among the freshest, most life-sustaining found so far anywhere on Mars,&#8221; said de Souza.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there was ever life on Mars, then this would have been the mud for it to live in,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>On the day of its 10th anniversary on the Red Planet, Opportunity is examining the rim of the Endeavour Crater. It has driven 38.7 kilometres from where it landed on January 24, 2004.  The site is about halfway around the planet from NASA&#8217;s latest Mars rover, Curiosity.</p>
<p>To find rocks for examination, the rover team steered Opportunity in a loop, scanning the ground for promising rocks in an area of Endeavour&#8217;s rim called Matijevic Hill.</p>
<p>The mineral-mapping instrument on NASA&#8217;s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) detected evidence on Matijevic Hill of a clay mineral known as iron-rich smectite.</p>
<p>&#8220;These rocks are older than any we examined earlier in the mission, and they reveal more favourable conditions for microbial life than any evidence previously examined by investigations with Opportunity,&#8221; said Opportunity Deputy Principal Investigator Ray Arvidson.</p>
<p>The Opportunity team set a goal to examine this mineral in its natural context &#8211; where it is found, how it is situated with respect to other minerals and the area&#8217;s geological layers &#8211; a valuable method for gathering more information about this ancient environment.</p>
<p>Researchers believe the wet conditions that produced the iron-rich smectite preceded the formation of the Endeavor Crater about 4 billion years ago.</p>
<p>The findings appear in the journal Science.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1969246&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/micro-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1969150" alt="The company will start with 14 devices" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/micro-480.jpg" /></a> The company will start with 14 devices
<p>After taking on global giant Samsung in India and emerging as the country&#8217;s second largest phone makes, Micromax  has now made its Russia launch official.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company,which is also the world’s 11th largest mobile phone brand now, started its Russia operations this week through a partnership with VVP Group, one of the country&#8217;s leading distribution houses. The move is expected to provide good reach for the brand across the large counrty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company will start with 14 devices in the Canvas series of smartphones and Bolt series of smart-feature phones. For service, Micromax is setting up 60 centers by end of the month.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Co-Founder Rahul Sharma used the launch to reiterate the company&#8217;s resolve to democratise technology for the masses. But it is obvious that the company is eyeing the high value European market through its  Russia entry. &#8220;Our initial focus in the Russian market is to replicate the success witnessed in our other markets in the last couple of years,&#8221; he said, adding that they wanted to be the first Indian hardware brand to go global.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company had made its global intentions clear when it chose to launch a tablet, running both the Android and Windows 8 operating systems, at the Consumer Electronics Show, the world’s largest tech show, in Las Vegas. Earlier, it had recruited Hollywood star Hugh Jackman as brand ambassador, making its global outlook amply clear.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Micromax is not alone. Other Indian players live Lava had clear global ambitions and could soon start looking beyond their pocket boroughs in Asia and Africa. Most think of Africa as a growth area, but the volumes there might not be backed by larger margins. And even the volumes are not there at the moment. That is why Europe and the Americas are crucial. It won’t be that easy to take on these markets, but Indian companies have a clear USP that has not been tested in these geographies before—their very Indian price points.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1969147&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/700-nokia_asha_502_ds_group.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1969084" alt="700-nokia_asha_502_ds_group" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/700-nokia_asha_502_ds_group.jpg" /></a> At Rs 6,145, this phone will appeal to those who are looking for their first touch screen and first connected device
<p>The Nokia Asha series pioneered what I like to call the smart feature phone segment, where the devices are sort of smarter and better than feature phones, but not as spec heavy as smartphones. The Nokia Asha 501 took the concept to a new level as it ushered in a unique platform for these devices. The Asha 502 is a natural progression, in keeping with the ever-increasing requirements of the segments this phone is meant for.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 3-inch TFT touch display (240 x 320p) | Nokia Asha software platform 1.1 | 64MB RAM | microSD slot | 5MP rear camera | 1010mAh battery</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/700-nokia_asha.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1969099" alt="700-nokia_asha" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/700-nokia_asha.jpg?w=476&#038;h=600"   /></a>Design:</strong> The Asha 502 looks exactly like its predecessor. The compact soap bar design and size continues, though the 502 seems to have laminated looks thanks to a transparent layer of plastic. Below the display is just the back key and on the sides are the volume  and power keys. It is a bit difficult to open the rear panel and it would have been a great idea to keep the second SIM hot-swappable without having to pry open the rear panel. And, yes, the bright colour schemes continue in line with Nokia’s new design philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>Screen:</strong> The screen is good enough for you play games, do basic browsing and enjoy the photos clicked with this phone. But this is not for those people who are used to HD screens. This is a functional touch screen and that is all it is meant to be.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> The Asha 502 is meant to be a phone for the masses and hence should not be compared with smartphones. If you look at this as an option for people who are graduating from a feature phone, then the Asha 502 is a rock star. It lets you connect to the net, surf the web without incurring huge data costs, check mail, engage in IM chats and use Facebook and Twitter effectively. It does not lag at any point of time as the OS has been custom built for device with these specs. The experience is smooth and stable, but not enough to suffice those who have been exposed to high-end devices.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/700-nokia_asha_502_ds_yello.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1969085" alt="700-nokia_asha_502_ds_yello" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/700-nokia_asha_502_ds_yello.jpg?w=480&#038;h=539" width="480" height="539" /></a>Memory:</strong> It won’t take you long to exhaust the 64MB internal memory, so be prudent while you download apps. But a 4GB SD card should be able to take care of all other storage needs.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> The Asha platform does not seem to have changed since the Asha 501 was launched last year. There are quite a few pre-loaded apps and a games which have been optimised for this device. The store gives you more options for apps which are custom built for the platform. In comparison to Android, these apps are light weight and don’t drain the phone’s resources.</p>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong> The camera is 5MP, but fixed focus. So you will need to move back and forth to get the right focus, or move your subject around. The results are pretty good, considering where it is coming from. The flash is of big help in low light. The camera is great for moms to snap pictures of their grandchildren, but is it good enough for college students? That is a million dollar question.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> Don’t frown at the 1010 mAh battery. It will last longer, much longer, than any smartphone will. We got up to three days on a full charge and with moderate use.</p>
<p><strong>Special Mention:</strong> The Xpress browser is a boon for the entry level user as it cuts your data usage by up to 90 per cent. This is nothing new, but among the few implementations at a mass level.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> At Rs 6,145, this phone will appeal to those who are looking for their first touch screen and first connected device. However, it will be hard to keep some of these buyers for dishing out a few more bucks to get hold of a Android device. The one thing in Asha 502’s favour is the fact that it offers a better long term proposition compared to a low-end Android phone. But this is an window that is slowly, but surely, shutting.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1969080&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The Zook speakers are powerful and great for home listening.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1968169&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/zook-speaker.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1968176" alt="Zook speakers" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/zook-speaker.jpg" /></a> Zoook 2.1 channel speaker ZM-SP3200 is priced at Rs 2,990.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The French techno-art revolution is here. Meet Zoook, a division of Intelligent Technologies, and a maker of eye-catching headphones, earphones and speakers. Zoook, says the company literature, was born in France, conceptualised and created by technology freaks who were artistic and creative. Recently, they launched their range of decorative products in the market and the Zoook 2.1 channel speaker ZM-SP3200, priced at R2,990, was sent for a review. Let us find out how it performs.</span></p>
<p>Digital music and smart devices have changed the way people experience music. Out of the box, the French company&#8217;s ZM-SP3200 speaker system has a classic elegant design with two satellites and a 4-inch magnetically shielded bass unit for powerful bass output, all housed in a wooden enclosure. It can be easily connected by stereo jack to any audio device—MP3 player, mobile phone, laptop or a tablet.</p>
<p>The SP3200 also has USB and SD/MMC ports, located on the sub-woofer to directly music from an MP3 loaded flash USB. Volume control and track selection buttons are located on sub-woofer for users to control their music and create the sound experience they desire. Equaliser functions give you output just to suit your musical mood.</p>
<p>In my testing, I connected the speaker to a laptop, mobile phone, iPod and a tablet. It is powerful and reproduces full, natural sound whether you are inches from the system or way across the room. It can practically transform your computer into an entertainment system or any aux-device into a sound monster.</p>
<p>For the size it has, audio quality is a lot better than what one would expect. The looks are definitely to die for and will make you look very stylish. Being compact and light in weight, the speaker looks neat on any background and for the ergonomics, look and feel, it gets a good nine out of ten.</p>
<p>A perfect replacement for large speakers—this is how I would describe ZM-SP3200.</p>

<p>Of late Indian manufacturers have been trying to give high end specs at medium range prices. This is  good for people who want the full Android experience. The Karbonn Titanum X is one such device.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 5 Inch Full HD IPS display | 1.5GHz quad-core Mediatek MT6589 processor | 1GB RAM | 16GB storage | 13MP rear camera, 5MP front camera | Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n | Bluetooth 3.0 | 2300mAh battery | Android 4.2 Jelly Bean</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> Despite its very plasticky rear panel, the Titanium X has a decent built quality. A metallic body would have gone better with the overall image and name of the phone. At 143 grams, the device does not feel heavy though it looks a bit bloated. The volume rocker is on the left and the power buttons of the right and this takes some time to get used to. The micro-SIM slot is on top under a flimsy flap and being a unibody design there is no SD card slot. Below the screen is a three-key backlit panel that lights up as you touch it.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/karbonn_titanium_x-4802.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1967281" alt="karbonn_titanium_x-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/karbonn_titanium_x-4802.jpg?w=480&#038;h=580" width="480" height="580" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Screen:</strong> The best thing about this phone is undoubtedly its Full HD screen. This is among the cheapest phones that comes with one. You will realise the quality of the screen as soon as you switch on the device. The one glass technology adds to the value of this screen and prevents it from accumulating fingerprints. However, some of the preloaded games and apps failed to rise to the high standards set by the screen. If you are planning to use this for watching movies, the speaker might be a bit of a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> With 1.5GHz quad-core processor, the phone can easily multi-task and be sprightly when you are using it for gaming. The device came up with decent benchmark results that put is somewhere between the Google Nexus 4 and the Samsung Galaxy S3. The phone can manage graphic heavy games like the Robocop with ease and does not heat up like some of its contemporaries. The browsing is also fast, even with multiple tabs open.</p>
<p><strong>Memory:</strong> While most so called top-end phones come with just 4GB of inbuilt memory, half of which is taken by the OS and app, the Titanium X gives about 10GB of free space. Though the company claims 16GB internal memory, we could find only about 14GB on the device of which about 10 is free. With no slots for a micro-SD card, a lot of buyers might look for other options.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> The Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system is what you would expect it to be. Karbonn had added some customized apps like Karbonn Zone and Karboon Live, but nothing that you would really want to use.</p>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong> The camera is the worst part of this phone. The 13MP camera is anything but good and even the dual flash fails to redeem it in anyway. Pictures lack detail and clarity even in full daylight. Plus, there is a significant shutter lag. <em>See the pictures below.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/pic2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1967269" alt="pic2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/pic2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a> <a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/pic1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1967268" alt="pic1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/pic1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> The 2300mAh battery is decent and can last you a day if you don’t use the 1080p screen for games or movies. With a lot of calls and browsing, the battery could call it a day in under 10 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> At a street price of Rs 16,500, this a decent Android phone with the sort of specs that you can flaunt. The screen is definitely what you are paying the money for. Don’t buy this if you like to take a second look at picture shot with your phone camera.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1967255&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>iBooks Textbooks will now be available in India. On Tuesday, Apple announced that it was expanding into 51 countries including new ones like India, Brazil, Italy and Japan. It has also made iTunes U Course Manager available in 70 countries including Russia, Thailand and Malaysia.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/fit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1966791" alt="fit" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/fit.jpg" /></a> Sony Vaio Flip
<p>Ever since Windows 8 was launched, laptop makers have tried scores of different designs to optimise the design of hybrid machines. Last year, Sony brought the Vaio Duo 11 and the Vaio Pro 13 to India. While the Duo 11 had a folding display with a cramped keyboard, the Pro 13 was a slim ultrabook with a touchscreen. This year, Sony has launched a new take on the 2-in-one laptop – the Vaio Flip, whose display flips 180 degrees.</p>
<p>Usually the main worry with flip mechanisms is reliability. Sony said it has manually flipped the screen over a million times during quality checks. The company also said the screen is scratch-proof and will not crack easily under pressure.</p>
<p>The laptop is quite portable at 1.31 kg (13-inch model with 128 GB SSD). If you want more storage space, you lost out on the portability. The weight of the 14-inch variant with 1 TB storage is 1.96 kg. These laptops ship with Intel&#8217;s fourth generation Core i5 and i7 processors and Intel HD 4400 graphics.</p>
<p>You can use the laptop in three different modes. The first one is like a conventional laptop. You can flip the screen 180 degrees if you want the keyboard out of the way. To do this, you will have to move a sliding key to release the lock. The screen snaps on to the stand when you flip it. But don&#8217;t forget to lock it when using it in laptop mode as the screen tends to move when lifting the lid. The third mode is like a tablet. The screen can be placed parallel to the keyboard.</p>
<p>The Vaio Flip is available in four variants priced between Rs 94,990 and Rs 1,19,990. To lure buyers, Sony has some interesting offers available. A person who buys the Vaio Flip gets a free Sony MDR-XB910A, which is a pair of headphones worth Rs 12,990. This is a limited time offer (till stocks last). Apart from that, Sony offers three months of unlimited music download for free using the Jive app and one year of accidental damage warranty. You can also buy two years of extended warranty with the laptop for Rs 999. This costs Rs 2,499, but with the Vaio Flip warranty is discounted.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1966778&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The SoundTouch Portable, in fact the entire series, looks a lot like the SoundDock devices from Bose.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1966491&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/bose480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1966497" alt="Bose SoundTouch Portable" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/bose480.jpg" /></a> Bose SoundTouch is available in three different models.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I first reviewed a wireless music player about five years back. There was Internet radio even then, but the experience of running those stations from around the world inside your living room was anything but easy. But now Internet and wireless networks are much more common that they were earlier. It has also become much easier for wireless players to log on to Internet stations of your choice. In fact, the experience is good enough for you to look at these as replacement to your old fashioned radio experience. This week I had the opportunity to test the SoundTouch Portable wireless music player. Here is what I thought.</p>
<p><a title="Watch Video: Bose SoundTouch Portable Wi-Fi music system" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGUV5SzjV8E" target="_blank">Bose SoundTouch Portable Wi-Fi music system</a></p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> The SoundTouch Portable, in fact the entire series, looks a lot like the SoundDock devices from Bose. The Portable is obviously the smallest of the series and weighs under 1.5 kg, making it very easy to move around the house. The Bose build quality is obvious everywhere. But I did not really like the Formica-like finish in some places. There is a small OLED panel in the front that shows basic notificiations. On top are six channel buttons flanked by power, aux, and volume buttons. The same buttons are recreated on a very basic remote. It is as simple and functional as any design can be.</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong> This is a crucial part of the device. So if you are not one of those who have a wireless set up at home, this isn’t meant for you. To set up the device you need to first connect this to a PC and configure it to your Wi-Fi network. There is nothing to be worried of here as the app will handhold you through the entire process. All you need to know is your network password. The SoundTouch app will also install on your desktop in the process. You can use this app to control the player as well as add channels from what seems like a curated list to the station slots. It also connects to the iTunes or Windows Media Player where you have catalogued your music. So one of the stations can be your own playlist. This might sound complicated, but trust me it is quite easy. Plus, you have the option of adding the same app on your Android or iOS devices to keep changing channels without having to switch on the PC every time.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Being a self confessed Bose fan I have always maintained that it is almost silly to write that the sound quality is good when testing a unit from this company. However, there will have to a disclaimer this time as the audio quality here will depend on the Internet radio station you are playing too. I say this because the experience while playing my playlist from the laptop and while using the SoundTouch was what I have come to expect from Bose. But I cannot say the same with all the stations that I played. I often felt that the device was too good for some of the stations. So I suggest you be choosy while picking stations as presets.<br />
Once the device has been set up, it is as easy as clicking any preset buttons to play the stations of your choice. However, this will depend on your Wi-Fi network and Internet connectivity also. I felt frustrated a couple of times when the device failed to play only to realise that my service provider had ditched me at the moment I was ready for some quality music. The other small issue I had was the fact that the SoundTouch app does not let you add any Internet radio station you want to. Having been a fan of this medium for long, I have a few favourites. But they failed to show up in the searches. Plus, I could not find channels for Malayalam music, of which I know there are lot on the Net. Hopefully, the SoundTouch app will keep adding more channels soon. The Portable version is not all that loud. So if you have large rooms then maybe look for the SoundTouch 30 which is larger and louder.</p>
<p><strong>Should You Buy It?</strong> Definitely, if you are 1) a fan of Internet radio and would love to hear random songs; 2) have a good Wi-Fi network and a good Internet connection to power it and 3) can afford it. At <strong>Rs 32,513</strong>, the SoundTouch Portable is not all that expensive, especially since there are no other devices that making playing Internet stations so easy.</p>
<p><strong>Price Rs 32,513</strong><br />

		<description><![CDATA[For a price of Rs. 7,500 in stores, the Xolo A600 is very well priced. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1965796&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/a600-4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1965820" alt="Lava Xolo A600" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/a600-4801.jpg" /></a> Lava Xolo A600
<p>Buying a low-cost smartphone naturally means having to compromise on some features. But does the Lava Xolo A600 ask you to sacrifice the right things while delivering on what matters?</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 4.5-inch IPS display (960&#215;540 pixels) | 1.3GHz dual-core Mediatek MT6572W processor | 512MB RAM | 4GB storage + microSD slot | 5MP rear camera, VGA front camera | Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n | Bluetooth 3.0 | A-GPS | 1900mAh battery | Android 4.2 Jelly Bean</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> Looking at the Xolo A600, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to think this is a budget smartphone. While it doesn&#8217;t have the design chops of a Sony, it stands apart from all the devices you&#8217;d get in this range with its glossy plastic body, sharp edges and the chrome bands on the top and bottom. Even when you hold it, it doesn&#8217;t feel cheap; although let&#8217;s be honest, it doesn&#8217;t feel expensive either.</p>
<p><strong>Screen:</strong> The screen is often a disappointment in this range of smartphones, usually due to bad viewing angles, sunlight legibility or a poor touch response. The Xolo A600 actually scores well in all three aspects. The screen is what you look at and interact with the most, so it needs to be a good experience that you don&#8217;t find lacking; and the A600 is the first budget handset to really deliver that. The only thing I&#8217;d want is a scratch-resistant glass, but you have to go upwards of twice its current price to get that.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Sacrifices have to be made for budget handsets and Xolo has decided the processor and RAM to be where it cuts the price. The A600 is not for power users and not for gamers. It&#8217;ll stutter on the latest games like Asphalt 8 and you won&#8217;t be able to multi-task well on this phone. If you&#8217;re an average user who doesn&#8217;t need major multi-tasking and plays only basic games like Subway Surfer, you&#8217;ll be fine with this.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/a600-480t1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1965821" alt="A600-480t" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/a600-480t1.jpg?w=322&#038;h=600"   /></a>Memory:</strong> Out of the 4GB of ROM that the A600 ships with, only 2.5GB is available to the user, split across internal memory and phone storage. The unfortunate result is that you can&#8217;t directly download games or apps of a size larger than 1.3GB on to the phone—and that&#8217;s if your storage is empty, which it won&#8217;t be soon. It&#8217;s a real bottleneck and you need to be ready to install such apps via APKs on your memory card (up to 32GB) if you are considering this smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> Lava hasn&#8217;t mucked around with the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system and it&#8217;s as close to stock Android as it gets. There&#8217;s no reason to complain here.</p>
<p><strong>Camera:</strong> Much like most handsets in this range barring the Gionee P3, the Xolo A600 produces barely usable pictures. In direct sunlight, your shots will be fun. But go indoors or shoot at night and there is too much noise, too little detail, and atrocious focus.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> The low-specced performance does have one major upside: the battery life. Xolo has already packed a large 1900mAh battery in this device and it gives fantastic results, easily lasting for 18 hours of average usage. On a continuous video playback test, it played for just over 6 hours. That&#8217;s brilliant when compared to other smartphones in this range.</p>
<p><strong>Special Mention:</strong> Generally, budget handsets tend to skimp on the antenna and don&#8217;t give you good network coverage, but the Xolo A600 is an exception. In fact, its antenna outclasses some of the flagship models of other companies. It performed better in bad-network areas than the likes of the Sony Xperia Z1, Nokia Lumia 920 and the HTC One.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> For a price of Rs. 7,500 in stores, the Xolo A600 is very well priced. The combination of a good screen and long battery life is difficult to get in budget handsets, and the small sacrifices of great performance and a stellar camera are worthy trade-offs for that. If this is price range, then this is the phone to get.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1965796&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/zync480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1965439 alignleft" alt="Zync Z605 6.5 inch phablet" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/zync480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>After entering the Indian tablet market in 2011, Zync Global, one of India’s leading technology providers and low cost tablet maker has kick- started the New Year 2014 with the launch of their second device in the phablet category- ZyncZ605.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p lang="en-US">
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/black480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1965398" alt="Blackphone" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/black480.jpg" /></a> The Blackphone is being developed by US-based company Silent Circle and Geeksphone, a Spanish handset maker. (AP)
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">A new &#8216;snoop-resistant&#8217; smartphone that can encrypt all calls and messages to protect them from spies and hackers is being developed.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">The Blackphone is described by its makers as &#8220;the world&#8217;s first smartphone to put privacy and control ahead of everything else.&#8221;</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">The Blackphone is being developed by US-based company Silent Circle and Geeksphone, a Spanish handset maker.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Using cryptography &#8211; ways of masking information and communications ¿ the device is able to make and receive secure phone and video calls, as well as exchange encrypted text messages, &#8216;The Times&#8217; reported.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">&#8220;The number one priority of creating Blackphone is to uphold the objectives of privacy,&#8221; said Phil Zimmermann,president of Silent Circle and co-founder of the Blackphone project.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">&#8220;It&#8217;s not to serve some other business model of monetising customer data. What we&#8217;re trying to do is to make a smartphone whose whole purpose is to protect privacy,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">However, the phone&#8217;s makers have not explained key questions raised by experts, such as whether secure calls can only be made between two Blackphones, or exactly how its encryption technology would make it beyond the reach of hackers.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">The group will give more details about the handset during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next month.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Blackphone comes as part of a growing effort among technology companies to protect personal information of mobile phone users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:large;">According to the latest leaks from whistleblower Edward Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) collected almost 200 million mobile phone text messages a day from around the world that allowed it to extract contact networks and credit card data of users. </span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1965396&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p lang="en-US"><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/data480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1965388" alt="Aakash 4 Tablet" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/data480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Handset makers which have manufacturing plants in the country have expressed interest in bidding for Aakash 4 tablet order but are finding it difficult to maintain the price level of Rs 2,500 apiece in the absence of government support.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Canadian phone maker Datawind which has supplied about 1,00,000 low-cost Aakash tablets to the government till date says that it would be a challenge to supply the device at Rs 2,500 a unit due to rupee volatility and other factors.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">&#8220;We will be able to bid for Aakash 4 at a price below Rs 2,500 a unit. However, it is a challenge to maintain it at that level. We have seen fluctuation of about 20 per cent in the value of rupee and the uncertainty remains,&#8221; Datawind CEO Suneet Singh Tuli told PTI.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">The Aakash project was Union minister Kapil Sibal&#8217;s brainchild when he was the HRD Minister. The idea was to provide low-cost computing device at subsidised rate to students to enable them access internet for educational purposes.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">The Directorate General of Supplies &amp; Disposals has floated a tender for the latest Aakash tablet with technical specifications of 7-inch scratch resistant capacitative touch screen, Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G and 4G connectivity, 4GB internal storage, external memory card slot with storage capacity of up to 32 GB, front camera etc.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">However, the number of units to be supplied has not been mentioned in the tender. The last date for submission of bids has again been deferred till January 28.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal had said that the government wanted a price of around Rs 2,500 for the latest device.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Besides Datawind, domestic handset maker Simmtronics and other vendors, who wished not to be named, expressed interest in bidding for the latest Aakash tablet order.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Simmtronics said its &#8220;price will be competitive&#8221;, but did not reveal the likely price to be quoted in the bid.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">&#8220;Low quality products will fail to qualify technical bids. We will qualify but maintaining desired price level in present form is a challenge as most of the components are imported.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">&#8220;There are duties on components which should be waived as Aakash 4 will be supplied to government,&#8221; company&#8217;s Managing Director Indrajit Sabharwal said, adding that multinational chipset companies have approached it to supply processors at minimal cost.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">A company, which plans to set up manufacturing unit in the country, said it does not expect a quality product can be supplied for Rs 2,500 as desired by Sibal.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">&#8220;Government wants talk time of 20 hours which even high-end phones don&#8217;t give. Its not possible to match price as desired by minister (Sibal),&#8221; a top official of a company, which partnered with a PSU for selling tablets, said.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Another vendor which plans to bid expressed disappointment on lack of government support for the project.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">&#8220;We have been asked to quote price of product but have not been informed about the number that we need to supply. There is a huge risk and we expect only 4-5 companies to bid for this project,&#8221; a company official said.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">The government last week had said it will not allow vendors to change price quoted in the bids due to fluctuation in the value of rupee.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Also, industry sources said that multinational companies have withdrawn from bidding as they will be unable to comply with Preferential Market Access rules incorporated in the tender, whereby tablets for supply to central government should have at least 30 per cent of components made in India.</span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1965383&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/internetsearch.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1965271" alt="internetsearch" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/internetsearch.jpg" /></a> People&#8217;s habit of Googling for online diagnosis before visiting doctor can provide early warning of infectious disease epidemic.
<p>Internet-based surveillance can detect infectious diseases such as dengue fever and influenza up to two weeks earlier than traditional methods, scientists say.</p>
<p>People&#8217;s habit of Googling for an online diagnosis before visiting a doctor can provide early warning of an infectious disease epidemic, researchers said.</p>
<p>When investigating the occurrence of epidemics, spikes in searches for information about infectious diseases could accurately predict outbreaks of that disease, said senior author of the study Dr Wenbiao Hu from Queensland University of Technology.</p>
<p>Hu, based at QUT&#8217;s Institute for Health and Biomedical Innovation, said there was often a lag time of two weeks before traditional surveillance methods could detect an emerging infectious disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is because traditional surveillance relies on the patient recognising the symptoms and seeking treatment before diagnosis, along with the time taken for health professionals to alert authorities through their health networks,&#8221; Hu said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In contrast, digital surveillance can provide real-time detection of epidemics,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The study found that by using digital surveillance through search engine algorithms such as Google Trends and Google Insights, detecting the 2005-06 avian influenza outbreak &#8220;Bird Flu&#8221; would have been possible between one and two weeks earlier than official surveillance reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;In another example, a digital data collection network was found to be able to detect the SARS outbreak more than two months before the first publications by the World Health Organisation (WHO),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early detection means early warning and that can help reduce or contain an epidemic, as well alert public health authorities to ensure risk management strategies such as the provision of adequate medication are implemented,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Hu said the study found social media and micoblogs including Twitter and Facebook could also be effective in detecting disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the potential for digital technology to revolutionise emerging infectious disease surveillance,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step would be to combine the approaches currently available such as social media, aggregator websites and search engines, along with other factors such as climate and temperature, and develop a real-time infectious disease predictor,&#8221; Hu said.</p>
<p>The study was published in Lancet Infectious Diseases.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1965198&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;"><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/phone480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1965158" alt="Global Smartphone users" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/phone480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Aided by growing adoption of smartphones, especially in emerging markets, global smartphone users are expected to touch 1.75 billion this year, market research firm eMarketer said.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">The firm also pegged global mobile phone users to reach 4.55 billion in 2014.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">&#8220;The global smartphone audience surpassed the 1 billion mark in 2012 and will total 1.75 billion in 2014. eMarketer expects smartphone adoption to continue on a fast-paced trajectory through 2017,&#8221; the firm said.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Nearly two-fifths of all mobile phone users, close to one-quarter of the worldwide population, will use a smartphone at least monthly this year, it added.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">The firm said the slowing mobile adoption will get a boost from developing regions in Asia-Pacific and other places.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">&#8220;eMarketer expects 4.55 billion people worldwide to use a mobile phone in 2014. Mobile adoption is slowing, but new users in the developing regions of Asia-Pacific and the Middle East and Africa will drive further increases,&#8221; it added.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Between 2013 and 2017, mobile phone penetration will rise from 61.1 per cent to 69.4 per cent of the global population, the research firm said in its &#8216;Worldwide Mobile Phone Users: H1 2014 Forecast and Comparative Estimates&#8217; report.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Mobile phone users are fast switching over to smartphones as devices become more affordable and 3G and 4G networks advance, it added.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">&#8220;More than 2.23 billion people worldwide, 48.9 per cent of mobile phone users, will go online via mobile at least monthly in 2014 and over half of the mobile audience will use the mobile Internet next year,&#8221; eMarketer said.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Analysts feel that mobile data network expansion in emerging markets with a rising middle class and the adoption of smartphones and feature phones with Internet capabilities will fuel the growth of mobile Internet.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">Rising low-cost smartphone devices with dual core processors and multi GB RAM being offered by many smartphone vendors will also lead to greater data consumption and a growth in communication over smart devices.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:large;">In 2014, mobile devices will become the primary computing devices for many end users and smartphone users will seek full-functionality and access to major applications and data from their mobile devices.</span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1965154&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/android-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1965088" alt="Indian phone buyers look at brand, battery and screen" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/android-1.jpg" /></a> Indian phone buyers look at brand, battery and screen
<p>The gap between the most expensive and most affordable smartphones in India is a bit crazy. At the top of the line, you find the iPhones and Galaxy Notes selling for upwards of Rs 50,000 and some even touching Rs 60,000. And at the bottom of the pyramid, you can get an Android phone for less than Rs 3,000.</p>
<p>The expensive ones are not worth their price. The cheapest ones are purely functional without letting you actually take advantage of Android—you’d be better off with a dumb phone by Nokia in that range.</p>
<p>So where does a “good enough” Android experience start and what do you need for it? Every few months, that price keeps decreasing as manufacturers are able to fit better hardware at lower prices. Till a year ago, Rs. 10,000 was the lowest I would go to in recommending a smartphone. But that’s changed now with a new crop of devices like the Xolo A600.</p>
<p>It’s not that these are fantastic phones. But unlike handsets previously available in this range, they don’t suffer from poor hardware. If you aren’t going to buy the top-of-the-line phone, there are always going to be some compromises. But in this new lot, those compromises have been reduced.</p>
<p>A recent survey by <a title="THE ASIAN MOBILE CONSUMER DECODED: NIELSEN" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fjp.en.nielsen.com%2Fsite%2Fdocuments%2FDecodingtheAsianmobileconsumer-Sep2013.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNF2CJYAapAjNCy4ssZXFQug8H3b1A" target="_blank">Nielsen </a>showed that the Indian buyer has three things on his or her mind when purchasing a smartphone: brand, battery and screen. And so far, buying a phone for less than Rs 10,000 meant either compromising on screen quality or battery life. However, phones like the Xolo A600 and Micromax Canvas A77 can now meet those criteria at Rs 7,500. Yup, a brand like Micromax is no longer seen as inferior.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/a600-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1965087" alt="Xolo A600" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/a600-1.jpg?w=600" /></a> Xolo A600
<p>Take the Xolo A600 (read our full review tomorrow). The screen is bright, vibrant, legible under direct sunlight, and has good viewing angles, which is an oft-demanded feature by people who commute a lot and can’t always hold their phone in a certain way. And its battery life clocks in at over 18 hours of average use and 6 hours of continuous video playback. That’s good enough for most users.</p>
<p>Even apart from that, the phone is perfectly functional. Sure, you aren’t going to be multi-tasking like a pro on it or playing games like Asphalt 8 without a stutter, but those are the compromises that one can live with, as long as the basics are taken care of.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, the price of a “good enough” Android experience is inching towards the Rs 5,000 mark.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1965086&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/tw8200-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1964396" alt="Epson EH-TW8200 is ideal for home theatres" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/tw8200-1.jpg" /></a> Epson EH-TW8200 is ideal for home theatres
<p>For a year or so, I have been in favour of using a good projector in place of an expensive, large screen television. My argument has been that most of the new projectors are cheaper, have all the input options you need and can be much larger than any televisions for the home, well almost. The new EH-TW8200 from Epson has sort of reinforced my view. Here are four reasons why.</p>
<p><strong>THE PICTURE QUALITY IS SUPERB:</strong> This projector comes with Lamp Boost Technology that lets you project the images even on a biscuit coloured wall in your home and still enjoy a movie as you would in a theatre. Yes, I have a biscuit coloured wall in the living and that too full of art work by my two-year-old. But let me tell you, I still loved watching BluRay version of the Platoon on it. The colours were great, so was the kind of details. I hate running projectors in rooms with ambient light, but the 2,400 lumens lamp can let you do this. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this though. Not because you won&#8217;t be able to enjoy the images, but because you will really love the high contrast when you switch off the light. So keep the room dark for the best I effects. Plus, there is a super resolution buttons that lets you get the best picture depending on the size of the projection.</p>
<p><strong>THE 3D WORKS:</strong> We are still a couple of years away when it comes to perfection in 3D entertainment at the home. There are some TV models that are really good with it, but they cost a bomb. This Epson projector is compatible with most 3D formats and you will enjoy the experience if your source is a BluRay player running a 3D version of a movie. In the box is a single RF 3D glass that makes this a pleasurable experience for one person in the house. You can run 3D files from a PC too using the HDMI cable, but not all the files worked for us. Still, when it worked the 3D had decent throw and great depth, even while converting from 2D. You will need to spend more to get additional glasses for everyone in the house. Anyway, like with televisions, I would suggest that you don’t look at 3D as the big differentiator, but as an added advantage.</p>
<p><strong>IT IS EASY TO USE:</strong> The EH-TW8200 has every possible source option you will need to let this power a home theatre set up. It will also seamlessly link to a sound system. There is no USB port, but then you are not going to keep this on a table where you can keep plugging in a USB. This is a large device and will need to be wall or ceiling mounted for best effects. But the optical lens shift lets you move the image vertically and horizontally to where you need it. Since there are two HDMI ports you can keep this connected to a Set-Top-Box and BluRay player at the same time. There is a superb remote with the project. I call it superb because it has a backlight button, which is very thoughtful considering you will be fumbling for buttons in the dark. You will need the remote to access the many controls and tweaks this device offers. The menu notifications are easy to navigate, but you need to click Esc to get rid of this. This can be a bit irritating.</p>
<p><strong>IT IS CHEAPER:</strong> Well, sort of. There are many projectors that will let me make this statement with a lot of conviction. But with this model I need to make this term relative. Yes, this is cheaper than most TVs when you consider the size of the image. Let us say at Rs 2,54,999, this costs a fraction of what 70-inch screen will. This can throw an image much larger than that if required. So there is a cost advantage, though there is no doubt that this is a premium product.</p>
<p><strong>SHOULD YOU BUY IT?</strong><br />
EH-TW8200. Yes, if you have a hall large enough to make full use of this projector.  Yes, if you are serious about 3D content.</p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong> RGB liquid crystal shutter projection system, 1080p, 2.1x zoom, Throw Ratio 1.34 &#8211; 2.87, 4,000 hours lamp life, 600,000:1 contrast ration, 334W power consumption, 8.4kg<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Rs 2,54,999<br />
<strong>Rating:</strong> 4</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1964390&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/brain-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1963868" alt="After visual input hits the retina, the information flows into the brain, where information such as shape, colour, and orientation is processed." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/brain-med.jpg" /></a> After visual input hits the retina, the information flows into the brain, where information such as shape, colour, and orientation is processed.
<p>MIT neuroscientists have found that the human brain can identify images seen for as little as 13 milliseconds.<br />
This is the first evidence of such rapid processing speed of the brain &#8211; far faster than the 100 milliseconds suggested by previous studies.</p>
<p>Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) asked subjects to look for a particular type of image, such as &#8216;picnic&#8217; or &#8216;smiling couple&#8217;, as they viewed a series of six or 12 images, each presented for between 13 and 80 milliseconds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that you can do that at these high speeds indicates to us that what vision does is find concepts. That&#8217;s what the brain is doing all day long &#8211; trying to understand what we&#8217;re looking at,&#8221; said Mary Potter, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive sciences and senior author of the study.</p>
<p>This rapid-fire processing may help direct the eyes, which shift their gaze three times per second, to their next target, Potter said.</p>
<p>After visual input hits the retina, the information flows into the brain, where information such as shape, colour, and orientation is processed.</p>
<p>In previous studies, Potter has shown that the human brain can correctly identify images seen for as little as 100 milliseconds.</p>
<p>In the new study, she and her colleagues decided to gradually increase the speeds until they reached a point where subjects&#8217; answers were no better than if they were guessing. All images were new to the viewers.</p>
<p>The researchers expected they might see a dramatic decline in performance around 50 milliseconds, because other studies have suggested that it takes at least 50 milliseconds for visual information to flow from the retina to the &#8216;top&#8217; of the visual processing chain in the brain and then back down again for further processing by so-called &#8216;re-entrant loops&#8217;.</p>
<p>However, the MIT team found that although overall performance declined, subjects continued to perform better than chance as the researchers dropped the image exposure time from 80 milliseconds to 53 milliseconds, then 40 milliseconds, then 27, and finally 13 &#8211; the fastest possible rate with the computer monitor being used.</p>
<p>Potter believes one reason for the subjects&#8217; better performance in this study may be that they were able to practice fast detection as the images were presented progressively faster, even though each image was unfamiliar.</p>
<p>The study also suggests that while the images are seen for only 13 milliseconds before the next image appears, part of the brain continues to process those images for longer than that, Potter said, because in some cases subjects weren&#8217;t asked whether a specified image was present until after they had seen the sequence.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Attention, Perception, and Psychophysics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1963836&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/lava450.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1963700" alt="Lava Iris Pro 30" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/lava450.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>The Indian brands are slowly trying to brush off their affordable devices tag by launching premium devices that can take on the big brands, of course with a slightly lower price tag. For instance, after it took its Xolo brand global with a launch at the CES 2014, Lava International Limited has launched a new premium series with its Iris Pro 30 smartphone. The phone has premium features, but at a Rs 15,999 price tag.<br />
Speaking at the launch, Chairman Hari Om Rai reiterated his resolve to make the company a global brand from the &#8220;Indo-Chinese&#8221; company it is at the moment. &#8220;This goal inspires us to work hard. We are looking at creating a multi-national brand within a decade,&#8221; he added.<br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/lava480fjan17.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1963714" alt="Lava Iris Pro 30" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/lava480fjan17.jpg?w=462&#038;h=600" width="462" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>The Android 4.2 phone has a 4.7-inch 720p IPS screen in a slim 7.5mm chassis. It will feature a 8MP auto-focus camera and a rare 3MP front camera. the device is powered by a 1.2 GHz quad-core processor and will have face and voice unlock. The 2000mAh battery will last longer thanks to the content adaptive backlight control.<br />
The phone will be available from next week.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1963633&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The MTV Twister is for those who host regular parties, especially those that tend to be on the wild side<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1963361&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mtv1www.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1963372" alt="MTV Twister is made for the outdoors" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mtv1www.jpg" /></a> MTV Twister is made for the outdoors
<p>For many of us, the term MTV brings back memories of the early nineties when we were first exposed to unabridged, unadulterated western music and our parents to the high volumes and liberated attitudes that came with it. When I recently got to test the MTV Twister, a Bluetooth speaker this very popular music brand has brought out in collaboration Soundlogic, a lot of these memories came flooding back.</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong><br /> The MTV Twister is everything that you would imagine the brand to be. It is young, it is bright and it is vivacious. The shape might remind you of the spittoon-shaped loudspeakers of last century. But it is not made of aluminum or metal like that 1900s classic. In fact, the Twister is made of a very rubbery material. That is because it has been made splash and shock proof. That means you would want to use this for a rain dance or a beach party, just be careful you don’t let sand go inside the eye of this whirlpool shaped speaker. There is just one button on the device, a power button at the rear. Here you also find a micro USB port for charging and a 3.5mm jack in case you don’t want to go wireless. The power buttons is also used for Bluetooth pairing.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p>The device is easy to pair, though on the iPhone it showed up as a headphone which was a bit confusing. You would expect anything that has MTV on it to be loud. The Twister won’t disappoint you on that count. In fact, I did not imagine a 3W speaker to be this loud. It seems the shape does do its bit in ensuring that everyone at the party hears it out. But there is no doubt that those in front of the speaker will hear more than those behind it. Well, you can again blame the shape for that.<br /> I won’t call the audio quality bad, but that is about it. This is certainly not for those like to hear an acoustic cover to a popular song. This is certainly for those who like a Yo Yo Honey Singh, or Wham’s Wake Me Up if you are from the original MTV generation. But then this is intended for a party and no one hears acoustic covers a poolside parties.</p>
<p><strong>Should you buy it:</strong> Go ahead if you are a regular host of parties, especially those that tend to be on the wild side. I wouldn’t suggest this as a Bluetooth speaker for the home. It just lacks the versatility that you might want to. But then don’t think twice if you are a loud music aficionado.</p>
<p><strong>Rs 2,999</strong></p>
<p>Rating: <strong>3.5</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1963361&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/birds-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1962757" alt="&quot;The intricate mechanisms involved in V formation flight indicate remarkable awareness and ability of birds to respond to the wingpath of nearby flock-mates." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/birds-med.jpg" /></a> &#8220;The intricate mechanisms involved in V formation flight indicate remarkable awareness and ability of birds to respond to the wingpath of nearby flock-mates.
<p>Birds fly in a distinctive V formation to arrange themselves in &#8220;aerodynamically optimum positions&#8221; while precisely timing the flapping of their wings, scientists have found.</p>
<p>Flying in a V formation helps each bird take advantage of  &#8220;good air&#8221; (upwash) thrown up by the wings of the flyer in front while avoiding detrimental &#8216;bad air&#8217; (downwash), according to researchers from the University of London&#8217;s Royal Veterinary College.</p>
<p>They found that birds also flap their wings at just the right time so as maximise an updraft and minimise a downdraft.</p>
<p>These aerodynamic accomplishments were previously not thought possible for birds because of the complex flight dynamics and sensory feedback that would be required to perform such a feat, researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The distinctive V-formation of bird flocks has long intrigued researchers and continues to attract both scientific and popular attention, however a definitive account of the aerodynamic implications of these formations has remained elusive until now,&#8221; said Steven Portugal, lead researcher at the Royal Veterinary College.</p>
<p>&#8220;The intricate mechanisms involved in V formation flight indicate remarkable awareness and ability of birds to respond to the wingpath of nearby flock-mates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Birds in V formation seem to have developed complex phasing strategies to cope with the dynamic wakes produced by flapping wings,&#8221; Portugal said.</p>
<p>Researchers studied a free-flying flock of northern bald ibises as they flew alongside a microlight on their migration route from Austria to Italy.</p>
<p>They used specially developed GPS biologging technology to measure the position, speed and heading of all birds in a V formation.</p>
<p>The team recorded the position and every wing flap of all individuals within the V during 43 minute of migratory flight.</p>
<p>They found each bird stayed about 45 degrees to the bird ahead and 1.2 metres to the one behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we have shown that ibis flight in V formation does, on average, match predictions of fixed-wing aerodynamics, although of course the flock structure is highly dynamic,&#8221; Portugal said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Birds flying in V formation flap with wingtip path coherence, meaning that their wingtips take the same path to maximise upwash capture.</p>
<p>&#8220;In contrast, birds flying in line flap in spatial antiphase, with wingtip paths maximally separated, to avoid adverse downwash,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The study is published in the journal Nature.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1962743&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/cyber-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1962741" alt="Scientists at the University of Michigan created the model to help develop a basis for understanding the strategic implications of cyber technology." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/cyber-med.jpg" /></a> Scientists at the University of Michigan created the model to help develop a basis for understanding the strategic implications of cyber technology.
<p>US researchers have developed a mathematical model that can predict when a cyber attack may be launched.</p>
<p>Scientists at the University of Michigan created the model to help develop a basis for understanding the strategic implications of cyber technology.</p>
<p>Focusing on the timing of cyber conflict, the model analyses when an attacker is most motivated to exploit vulnerabilities in a target&#8217;s computer system for espionage or disruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of our major contributions is to develop some concepts to deal with this new realm of cyber conflict,&#8221; said Robert Axelrod, professor of political science and public policy at U-M&#8217;s Ford School.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took 15 years in the nuclear world for people to understand the implications of nuclear technology. It is our hope that it won&#8217;t take that long to understand the strategic capabilities of cyber technology,&#8221; Axelrod said.</p>
<p>The researchers developed two concepts. One is stealth, which is the ability of a resource to exploit a vulnerability in a target&#8217;s computer system to stay undiscovered if it is used.</p>
<p>The other is persistence, which is to keep the vulnerability undiscovered if it isn&#8217;t used.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good resource should have both stealth and persistence,&#8221; said Rumen Iliev, a postdoctoral research fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;The less persistent a resource is, the sooner (it should be used) lest the vulnerability is fixed before (there&#8217;s) a chance to exploit it,&#8221; Iliev said.</p>
<p>They illustrate their model using four case studies, including the Stuxnet attack on Iran&#8217;s nuclear programme and the Iranian cyber attack on the energy firm Saudi Aramco.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also hope this will encourage other efforts to study these things in a rigorous way,&#8221; Axelrod said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of discussion about cyber problems, but it&#8217;s so new that the language isn&#8217;t established. People use the word attack to mean anything from stealing a credit card number to sabotage of an industrial system,&#8221; Axelrod said.</p>
<p>The research appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1962639&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Two smooth and fast smartphones from HTC with good build quality and a decent set of features.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1962610&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1962617" alt="HTC Desire 501" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/htc480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></p>
<p>Back in 2010, HTC was one of the top smartphone makers in the world, accounting for one in every ten smartphones sold.<br />
After years of strong market performance, the Taiwanese phone maker is in a tight spot, facing stiff competition from Apple, Samsung and other handset makers. Last week, it reported worse-than-expected results for Q4FY13. Though the sale of its remaining 25% stake in Beats Electronics for $265 million helped the company avoid its second-consecutive quarterly loss, it appears that despite aggressive cost-cutting measures—buying chips from cheaper vendors, outsourcing production etc—the handset maker’s troubles are far from over. The company’s global share of the smartphone market has declined to 2.2% in the third quarter of 2013, from a peak of 10.3% only two years ago.<br />
Competition woes aside, HTC continues to amaze us with their devices’ stunning looks. In a deft strategy designed for high growth markets such as India, HTC has decided to introduce competitively priced models. Recently, it launched two new snappy and smooth phones—HTC Desire 501 and Desire 601. Both the devices are stylish in looks, have a judicious mix of hardware and software, and offer good web surfing experience. Will they connect with the customer? Let us find out.</p>
<p><strong>HTC Desire 501</strong></p>
<p>The original HTC Desire, released in 2010 was a hit among people with its attractive looks, sturdy build, a fairly good camera and plethora of apps. HTC has now debuted its mid-range smartphone, the 4.3-inch HTC Desire 501. It is a dual SIM and an affordable Android with a price tag of Rs 18,290. The phone has a reasonable display with its WVGA, super LCD 2 screen. The screen features decent brightness and colour balance, and offer users fairly reasonable viewing angles.<br />
The 501 is powered by a dual-core 1.15 GHz processor, backed by 1 GB of RAM and 8 GB of internal storage; there’s also a microSD slot for memory expansion. This specification is standard for the price and the minimum that we can expect on an Android handset. On the camera front, we are looking at a familiar 8-megapixel snapper with auto focus.<br />
Externally, the 501 is a good-looking phone with bevelled edges and a slightly raised screen, which together give it a chiselled, defined look. Our test unit was a Blue model, but whichever colour you choose, you’ll have a phone which is both slimmer and more stylish than pretty much any budget handset out there.<br />
In terms of real-world performance, the 501 is fairly good. It is fast, loads web pages quickly and is generally easy to navigate. It is also good at taking photos.</p>
<p><strong>SPECIFICATIONS: HTC DESIRE 501</strong></p>
<p>* Dimensions: 128.5 x 66.9 x 9.8 mm<br />
* Display: 4.3 inch WVGA, super LCD 2<br />
* Processor: Dual-core, 1.15 GHz<br />
* Operating system: Android 4.1 with HTC Sense 4.0+<br />
* SIM type: Dual microSIM<br />
* Memory: 8 GB (internal); 1 GB (RAM<br />
* Camera: 8 MP with auto focus<br />
* Estimated street price: Rs 18,290</p>
<p><strong>HTC Desire 601</strong></p>
<p>Compared to HTC One and One Mini, the Desire 601 sports a much affordable tag of Rs 27,990. Out of the box, it becomes evident that the phone has a stylish design. It comes in three colours—white, black and red. The phone has a plastic body with a removable rear battery. There’s a 4.5 inch qHD display which is much larger than the 501.<br />
Underneath, you’ll find a 1.4 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor (decent enough to make the Android run smoothly), 8 GB of internal memory which is just adequate for storing reasonable amount of music, video and photos. Like every Desire phone, this one too runs Android. It features the latest version of HTC Sense, incorporating the Blinkfeed home screen. The speakers are similar to those of the HTC One, which give a decent stereo effect.<br />
The HTC Desire 601 has a 8-megapixel sensor with an LED flash. It has an interesting piece of software, the Zoe mode software that grabs video at the same time as stills to animate your phone camera gallery. It shoots a burst of stills rather than a single one.<br />
In terms of performance, the Desire 601 is a smooth and fast phone with good build quality. In my usage, the phone came across as a fast device with no observable screen lagging. Movies and videos can be played in good quality with its sharp high definition display.<br />
If you haven’t got much money to buy the latest high-end phone in the market, then the Desire 601 is the one to get.</p>

<p>India has allowed the import of human embryos for artificial reproduction, opening up what is expected to be a huge segment of the medical tourism market.</p>
<p>The decision will allow foreign couples to bring in frozen human embryos and rent a surrogate womb in India for the baby to be born. The relaxed rules will also apply to other infertility-related treatment such as IVF.</p>
<p>The decision was announced through separate notifications by the Central Board of Excise and Customs and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade over the last one month.<br />
To ensure quality control, such imports will have to carry a no-objection certificate from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).</p>
<p>“It is not only for foreign nationals but also Indian couples settled abroad if they want to bring frozen embryos to India for infertility treatment or surrogacy,” Hrishikesh Pai, president-elect of the Indian Society of Assisted Reproduction and head of the IVF unit at Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>“This was not permitted earlier but the new guidelines have streamlined the process and cleared grey areas on their import.”</p>
<p>Although ICMR had recognised the import of human embryos frozen in liquid nitrogen containers for artificial reproduction techniques as proper medical procedure to be conducted in India, doctors said customs and DGFT rules did not permit such imports.</p>
<p>India is a rising global healthcare player with the ability to provide inexpensive but top quality medical care and a large percentage of foreign patients come for treatment of problems linked to fertility.</p>
<p>The medical tourism business is expected to grow by 30 per cent cumulatively to about $2 billion (Rs 12,000 crore) by 2015.</p>
<p>But surrogacy has had to deal with conflicting guidelines and had not taken off.<br />
Experts said since the government has built in a case-by-case approval procedure, it would ensure that human embryos are not brought into the country for research purposes or for the exploitation of surrogates.</p>
<p>According to estimates, even now there are between 400 to 500 surrogacy cases in the country every year of which nearly 70 per cent are from Indian patients. “Import of human embryos has been restricted and only with permission from the ICMR,” said R Muralidharan, executive director, PricewaterhouseCoopers.</p>
<p>ICMR officials said the conditions for granting NOC are stringent.<br />
“The draft Assisted Reproductive Techniques Bill, which is still under consideration of the ministry of health, clearly disallows export of embryo gametes etc unless for personal therapeutic purposes. Imports are allowed so long as there is no sale. There is no restriction on implantation of a imported frozen embryo in a surrogate either but the conditions for granting of NOC are stringent,” one official said.</p>
<p>The documents required for an NOC  include a certificate of registration of the ART clinic recommending transfer of embryos/gametes and the clinic in India where the infertility treatment will happen along with name and address of its in-charge.</p>
<p>The foreign clinic has to certify that the infertile woman cannot conceive or that such conception may lead to undesirable medical implications. There has to be certification that at least one of the gametes was from the infertile couple.</p>
<p>The Indian ART clinic has to give a certificate saying which foreign clinic has referred the couple and from which country, including name and address of the couple, while its foreign counterpart has to certify that the embryo was generated in their clinic and there was no sex selection. The couple has to furnish identification documents and proof of marriage.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1962384&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>HP is entering the phablet-tablet race with two Android devices with voice calling. Incidentally, six-inch HP Slate6 VoiceTab and the seven-inch HP Slate7 Voice Tab have been designed in Asia and will be launched from India early next week.</p>
<p>Rajiv Srivastava, President, PPS, HP India said the India launch demonstrates their recognition of changing market preferences and commitment to India as a consumer market. &#8220;People have been consuming a variety of devices and we thought it was only right for us extend our portfolio to this segment as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Srivastava said it would not be right to call the device a phone as it will be clearly smarter than any smarphone. &#8220;It will have the full productivity features of a tablet.&#8221; However, he is very clear that HP does not want to classify these as phablets. &#8220;Our view is that we will call it a voice tablet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company said the 3G dual SIM devices will be full-feature tablets powered by a quad-core processor, &#8220;enabling users to multi-task at everything from email to web surfing to gaming to streaming&#8221;. The devices will have IPS panels and HD cameras.<br />
&#8220;Our belief is that the six-inch device is small enough for people to carry around and make voice calls with. The screen sizes are right for apps and calling too,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The devices will be available in India next month.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1961985&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/lm2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1961870" alt="Younger people seem to have better memories because they are able to retrieve them in higher definition, scientists have found.

(Reuters)
<p>Younger people seem to have better memories because they are able to retrieve them in higher definition, scientists have found.<br />
Researchers found that it is not that younger people are able to remember more than older people but their memories seem better because they retrieve them in higher definition.<br />
Philip Ko of Vanderbilt University in the US, led the research team which focused on visual working memory, a person&#8217;s ability to briefly retain a limited amount of visual information in the absence of visual stimuli.<br />
The team&#8217;s examination of why this function is reduced during the course of healthy aging took the multiple stages of encoding, maintenance, and the retrieval of memorised information into account.<br />
They ran 11 older adults of around 67 years of age and 13 younger adults of approximately 23 years of age through a task called &#8216;visual change detection&#8217;.<br />
This task consisted of viewing two, three or four coloured dots and memorising their appearance. These dots disappeared, and then after a few seconds the participants were presented with a single dot appearing in one of the memorised colours or a new colour.<br />
The accuracy of their response (&#8216;same&#8217; or &#8216;different&#8217;) was considered to reflect how well they memorised the colours. This accuracy of response is referred to as &#8216;behavioural measure&#8217;.<br />
Electroencephalographic data was also collected from the participants as they performed the task for a neural measure of their memory capacity.<br />
Ko found that while behavioural measures indicated a lower capacity in older adults than younger adults to memorise items, the neural measure of memory capacity was very similar in both groups.<br />
In other words, during the maintenance stage, both groups stored the same number of items.<br />
The researchers suggest that older adults store the items at a lower resolution than younger adults, resulting in impaired recollection.<br />
Unlike older adults, younger adults may be able to use perceptual implicit memory, a different kind of visual memory, to give them a &#8216;boost&#8217; when they are trying to retrieve the stored information.<br />
&#8220;We don&#8217;t know why older adults perform poorly when their neural activity suggests their memory capacity is intact, but we have two leads,&#8221; Ko said.<br />
&#8220;First, further analysis of this current dataset and other studies from our laboratory suggest that older adults retrieve memories differently than younger adults.<br />
&#8220;Second, there is emerging evidence from other labs suggesting that the quality of older adults&#8217; memories is poorer than younger adults.<br />
&#8220;In other words, while older adults might store the same number of items, their memory of each item is &#8216;fuzzier&#8217; than that of younger adults,&#8221; Ko said.<br />
The study appears in the journal Attention, Perception &amp; Psychophysics, published by Springer.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1961865&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/kindlepaperwhite.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1961863" alt="Kindle paperwhite" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/kindlepaperwhite.jpg" /></a> The price is the same as that of the previous generation device &#8212; WiFi variant for Rs 10,999. (Photo courtesy: Amazon)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Over</span><span style="line-height:1.5em;"> four months after its US launch, Amazon India has brought the Kindle Paperwhite ebook reader to the country.</span></p>
<p>The price is the same as that of the previous generation device &#8212; WiFi variant for Rs 10,999 and if you want 3G, be prepared to shell out Rs 13,999. These variants are available for pre-order on amazon.in. The company said it will begin shipping the new Kindle Paperwhite on February 4.</p>
<p>The new Kindle Paperwhite looks similar to its predecessor, but the improvements are in its display, processor, touchscreen and software.</p>
<p>Amazon says this iteration of the product has a display with higher contrast, a better front light for reading in the dark, both of which should improve reading experience. Amazon says the new display makes pages “indistinguishable from paper”.</p>
<p>A common complaint with Kindle devices is the slight lag while flipping pages or opening books. Amazon says the new devices have a faster processor that eliminate this lag. It says a new page flip feature lets you move back and forth between a book without losing track of the page you were on. Fantasy novel lovers will love this feature as Amazon says looking up maps at the beginning of the book becomes much easier.</p>
<p>When you look up a word in the dictionary, the Kindle Paperwhite stores them in a list that you can access quickly. So if you keep forgetting the meaning of certain words, this list will be handy. The new device also features Wikipedia integration.</p>
<p>The new Kindle also has FreeTime, which lets you create profiles for children and makes it easy to keep a check on what they read.</p>
<p>“Kindle is the best-selling e-reader in the world for six years running, and now it’s even better,” Amit Agarwal, vice president and country manager, Amazon India, said.</p>
<p>Kindle Paperwhite will be available from over 250 retail outlets in India.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1961862&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>After revolutionising the way we listen to music and experience movies, Dolby Laboratories now want to change the way we view television. The global leader in audio technologies has announced that televisions running its new Dolby Vision technology will become available in certain markets by the end of this year.</p>
<p>So what is Dolby Vision? &#8220;Today&#8217;s television images have limitations imposed through legacy. The brightness of the content has been substantially reduced to deliver it on the traditional CRT TVs. The maximum brightness a TV can show you is 100 nits, while the eye is capable viewing of much brighter images,&#8221; explains Mathias Bendull, Senior Director, Broadcast Business, Dolby Laboratories . While the latest televisions  Even the new televisions are capable of up to 1000 nits, but Bendull says since the content is also constrained they just upscale what is available. &#8220;We think this is the wrong way and are working with the industry bodies to change the standard to 10,000 nits. We are also working with everyone one in the value chain to enable this content,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The brightness gives the director a totally different way to tell the story. For instance, from a colour perspective blues are very weak now an they have the lowest colour allocation. This information is there in the original master, but is dropped in the BluRay or broadcast as TVs are not capable of showing it,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/d2-vert.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1961859" alt="D2-vert" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/d2-vert.jpg?w=480&#038;h=534" width="480" height="534" /></a>While the Dolby Vision televisions from Sharp, TCL and Vizio will be available in certain markets by the end of this year, the company has tied up with Netflix, Amazon and Microsoft for content delivery. &#8220;We get everybody to see the value in the product before launching anything. So soon you will have directors also shooting in this technology,&#8221; he says, adding that digital cameras don&#8217;t need any upgradation for Dolby Vision quality images. The Dolby Vision content will mean 25 per cent more info, so a 8MB stream will need to be 10MB with the new stream.</p>
<p>Dolby will encode the normal image and add an enhancement layer for the additional nits. So even TVs without the Dolby Vision capabilities will be able to play the information, though it will not be as good.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='480' height='267' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/PGYdD5UUKhI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>However, don&#8217;t expect Dolby Vision to come on regular TVs for some time to come. The technology is being packaged as complementary to Ultra HD or 4K and will be a premium solution for sometime to come. &#8220;We are not competing with Ultra HD. In fact, a combination of the two That will be the big differentiator for people to buy a new television with Dolby Vision,&#8221; Bendull added. Smaller and cheaper screens are on the way, but it will take time. In the future, you could see the same Dolby Vision logos on anything from smartphones to tablets and laptops.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1961840&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/wifi-world11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1961171" alt="wifi-world11" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/wifi-world11.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480" width="480" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>In a perfect digital world, you will be able to watch high definition video on your PC in office, switch the stream to the smartphone or tablet as you step out, continue the same video in your car and finally let the home television finish it off as you come back from work. That perfect world, offering a perfect ‘continuum’ for all your content, is not far away. In fact, you can already see some links in the chain I mentioned above.</p>
<p>However, for this seamless interplay of content across devices, you will have to commit your loyalties. For the continuum is likely to be limited to circles created by companies, hardware and platforms. So you will have a Sony or Samsung ecosystem, or one that limits you to devices powered by Intel or running Windows or Apple’s operating systems. Yes, the circles will overlap, but how seamless that experience will be remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Most companies have already started packing in technologies that let devices talk and share content between themselves. There is DLNA, or the Digital Living Network Alliance, which is supported by most top brands; Intel’s Wireless Display or WiDi and Miracast, which is limited to wirelessly sharing video. The chances are that if you have recently bought a smartphone, tablet, laptop or entertainment console, it would have at least one of these options. It is becoming increasingly difficult to stay isolated or not have the ability to share their content.</p>
<p>BlackBerry took the Miracast plunge with its BB10.2 update. Explaining the move, BlackBerry India’s product manager Gautam Shah told me that with people moving towards a connected and ‘smart’ lifestyle, it is becoming extremely important for us to have a single-screen ecosystem which provides wireless and seamless connectivity across various appliances/devices.</p>
<p>Despite the ecosystem barriers, these new technologies will let many users share content across operating systems. But this will work better with photos, video and music, and when it comes to productivity the ecosystem will continue to be a barrier, as anyone who has worked at the same time with a Mac and Windows device will tell you. A big trigger behind the increasing adoption of these technologies is the growing clout of the smartphone as the hub of all content and digital activity in a person’s life. So if you have a great video you shot while partying with friends, you just don’t have the patience to find the wires that will let you show it on a larger screen. Almost every new smartphone comes with a good wireless streaming technology. Even the most affordable of devices come with at least simple Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The other big factor here is that connected households are now connected wirelessly. According to Philip Solis of ABI Research, the Wi-Fi installed base of products is “4 billion and growing”. This is why for many years now one of the focus areas at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas has been technologies that make Wi-Fi better and, of course, faster. This year, semiconductor giant Broadcom Corporation launched new 5G Wi-Fi system-on-chips that will help deliver HD-quality content, online gaming and other high-bandwidth applications to multiple devices in the connected home.</p>
<p>It is technologies like these that are making people talk more about the so-called Internet of Things. The continuum I spoke about earlier will be a part of this, for the devices that take part in this content sharing will be intelligent enough to know when and what to share. And they will do it between themselves without any help from the user. They will also do much more than share content. They will talk to themselves. For instance, the printer will know that it has to switch on as the scanner is doing a job that will need to be printed. There is no doubt that all this talking is going to be done wirelessly. The only question is whether the printer and scanner will have to be from the same company for them to start a conversation?</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1961158&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1960969" alt="CES 2014" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/ces-ie.jpg" /> Smartphones aren’t really much of a thing at CES anymore because most of the big manufacturers now save the unveiling of their flagship devices for their individual conferences and press events
<p>CES is an open house these days. While most of the media attention is on announcements from major brands in the industry such as Samsung Electronics, LG, and Sony, of late smaller companies and new startup have been shaking things up. CES 2014 was the show it promised to be with hundreds of new devices and technologies on show. We pick 10 of the best, maybe not the ones that have got a lot of attention.</p>
<p><strong>10. 3Doodler</strong></p>
<p>The Kickstarter darling made its big public appearance at CES 2014 and the result was quite exciting. This 3D printing pen takes all of the modeling out of 3D printing and opens up creating objects to pretty much everyone—including kids. While you might not be able to do quite as much as you could with an actual 3D printer, it is a lot of fun to play with for only $99 (Rs 6,090).</p>
<p><strong>9. Mophie Space Pack</strong><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1961011" alt="CES 2014" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mophiezlfi480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /><br />
There are always an insane amount of smartphone accessory companies at CES, but few of them manage to capture the attention of audiences. Then there was a Mophie Space pack. This iPhone 5/5s case not only charges your phone with additional battery, it also adds 32GB of storage to your device. The Mophie lets you drop your videos, pictures, and documents straight into its storage and even lets you play videos right from it. Not only that, the Space Pack is designed beautifully and surprisingly doesn’t add a lot of heft to the phone.</p>
<p><strong>8. Steam Machines</strong><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1961015" alt="CES 2014" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/steam480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /><br />
The desire to break into the home console market has been growing among both consumers and companies for years now, whether it’s from independent Android consoles like the Ouya or big rumored living room takeovers from the likes of Valve or Apple. At CES, Valve CEO Gabe Newell finally lifted the lid off of the first generation of Steam Machines. The amount of computers on display was a bit shocking—as was the announcement that the consoles would range from anywhere between $500 (Rs 30,760) and $6000 (3,69,120). While many of these models still feel like prototypes in many ways, there is no longer any question regarding whether or not Valve is actually serious about the living room market. They are—and Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have reason to be paying attention.</p>
<p><strong>7. LG’s Curved TV</strong><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1961010" alt="LG Curved TV" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/lg480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /><br />
The whole curved screen has quickly become the great gimmick of 2014—that is, until LG showed off its 105” OLED 4k TV that just happened to have a nice flexible display on it. The curvature to this massive, gorgeous television feels just right—and unlike the curved displays on their smartphones, actually enhances the experience. This might be another product that won’t be hitting dealer shelves anytime soon, but that doesn’t take anything from the fact that LG has made an immersive and interesting television.</p>
<p><strong>6. Pebble Steel Smartwatch</strong><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1961016" alt="CES 2014" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/pebble480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /><br />
The Pebble Smartwatch was on the top of our best mobile gadgets of 2013, and for good reason. It was the first—and perhaps the only—smartwatch that made sense for the average person that doesn’t want strangers staring at their wrist while walking down the street. The Steel isn’t just a 2014 update to the original model—it is Pebble’s next step toward reaching the mainstream market. Both the leather and aluminum straps look and feel fantastic—and while they’re no Rolex, the update might be enough for those who don’t currently wear a watch every day.</p>
<p><strong>5. Playstation Now</strong><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1961013" alt="CES 2014" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/play480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /><br />
Playstation Now isn’t exactly a gadget—but for gamers, this online game streaming service was the most important announcement at CES this year. Sony had purchased the cloud gaming service Gaikai in 2012, but it wasn’t until this year at CES that we knew what for. Not only does Playstation Now effortlessly solve the backwards compatibility problem, but now Sony just may have the Playstation 4’s killer app—the thing that will make gamers want to reserve space for it under their TV.</p>
<p><strong>4. Alcatel OneTouch Idol X+</strong><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1961008" alt="CES 2014" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/acazul418.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /><br />
Alcatel’s entry into the high-end smartphone market is good news cause it will ultimately make these devices more affordable. The prices of the best smartphones were skyrocketing with each consecutive generation costing more than its predecessor. Sure enough, inflation has something to do with it, but not everything. Major handset makers are using the power of their brands to feed their greed. With the likes of Alcatel emerging, the West might see a cut in prices. We in India are lucky to have Micromax and other local phone makers.</p>
<p><strong>3. Asus Transformer Book Duet</strong><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1961009" alt="CES 2014" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/asus480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /><br />
Multi-platform devices are coming. The Asus Transformer Book Duet is not the first such device by any stretch of imagination, but it is getting us closer to that [multi-platform] dream. This laptop is made for heavy usage, boasting top-notch specs while allowing folks to use it both for business and leisure. It’s likely many other OEMs will follow-up with similar devices that merge Windows 8 and Android into a single device.</p>
<p><strong>2. Samsung Galaxy Note Pro</strong><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1961012" alt="CES 2014" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/note480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /><br />
The massive 12.2” tablet is Samsung’s answer to both the iPad Air and the Surface 2. Samsung has taken Android and placed what they call the Magazine UX on top of it. While we are not so certain the new homescreen interface is necessarily the best for &#8216;professionals&#8217;, it takes the best parts of Windows 8’s live tiles and is a big improvement over most of Samsung’s typical TouchWiz Android skins. The Note Pro also includes the Note 3’s excellent stylus to make for a big tablet that is fun to interact with and write on.</p>
<p><strong>1. Sony Xperia Z1 Compact</strong><br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-1961014" alt="CES 2014" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sony480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /><br />
Smartphones aren’t really much of a thing at CES anymore because most of the big manufacturers now save the unveiling of their flagship devices for their individual conferences and press events. However, Sony quietly brought what might be their best smartphone in years to the show: the Xperia Z1 Compact. Despite the silly name, the Z1 Compact has an excellent camera and accessible form factor that might just make it the early frontrunner in the 2014 Android scene.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1960956&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dual boot and dual modes are catching the fancy on manufacturers, whether or not it is becoming popular with the buyers. If price was one of the reasons that put off buyers from the 2-in-1 computers could change all that with its affordable price tag.</p>
<p>At Rs 19,990, the new Lenovo IdeaPad A10 is arguably most affordable dual-mode notebook and the first based on Android. It is around Rs 2,000 cheaper than the cheapest Chromebook and could hence woo a lot of first-time computer buyers.</p>
<p>Weighing just 1 kg, the A10 comes has a 10-point multi-touch and can flip 300 degrees. So it becomes easy to go to a productive laptop mode and consumption friendly stand mode. The company also claims a 10 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>The device is powered by a quad-core Cotex-A9 ARM processor and will run Lenovo&#8217;s customised Android 4.2 with 2 GB RAM.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1960047&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/apple-macbook-air-1200x830-1024x708.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1959947" alt="Apple MacBook Air 2013 versions " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/apple-macbook-air-1200x830-1024x708.jpg" /></a> Apple MacBook Air 2013 versions
<p>Ever since Steve Jobs first pulled it out of a simple manila envelope, the Macbook Air has been the epitome of portable computing—a high-powered laptop that&#8217;s sleek and lightweight. The 2013 edition of the Mac Air continues the tradition, boosting battery and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 11-inch LED display (1366&#215;768 pixels) | 1.3GHz dual-core 4th Generation Intel Core i5 processor | Intel HD5000 Graphics | 4GB DDR3 RAM | 128GB SSD | 720p Webcam | Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac | Bluetooth 4 | 2xUSB3.0, 1xThunderbolt ports | 1.08kgs | Up to 9 hours battery life | Mac OS X Mavericks</p>
<p><strong>Design:</strong> If you&#8217;ve seen any Macbook Air before this, then you&#8217;ve seen the new one. It looks exactly the same—brushed metal finish, aluminium unibody with rounded edges and that familiar Apple logo on top. Premium components mean that the lid is easy to open/shut and stays firm, without any wobble.</p>
<p><strong>Screen:</strong> Some people might find the 1366&#215;768 pixels resolution of the 11-inch screen to be low, but really, that resolution is fine for this size. I&#8217;ve tried 11&#8243; laptops with 1920&#215;1080 pixels and rather than clarity, everything gets miniaturized. The one thing that is an issue, though, is that the screen is not matte. For a notebook that stresses on its portability, it would have been nice to be able to use it anywhere without screen glare. It&#8217;s not as bad as the Macbook Pro, but it could have been better.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> The new Mac Air is powered by Intel&#8217;s Haswell processor and HD5000 graphics. And the performance shows. You can edit videos and images just as easily and smoothly as you can play games like Bioshock Infinite.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gadgets/ditching-the-apple-tax-is-the-macbook-air-cheaper-than-windows-laptops/" target="_blank"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Also, read: Is The Macbook Air Cheaper Than Windows Laptops? </span></strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Memory:</strong> The notebook ships with a 128GB SSD, so you won&#8217;t have much trouble with storage. But if you need more, unfortunately, the 11-inch model does not a memory card slot. It would have been a nice addition.</p>
<p><strong>Software:</strong> The new model ships with the latest Mac OS X Mavericks, and the good news is that Apple is now giving its iWork suite free with that. Just head to the Mac App Store and download it—that&#8217;s a great bonus!</p>
<p><strong>Keyboard:</strong> The Macbook Air has one of the best keyboards on any laptop in the world—in fact, the best one, in my opinion. As someone who writes for a living, I haven&#8217;t used anything which compares to the Macbook keyboard for the past few years, and the new model keeps that up, complete with the ability to work at night with backlighting.</p>
<p><strong>Battery:</strong> Man, if you were impressed with the battery life of previous generations of Airs, you&#8217;ll love this one. The new Macbook Air has the best battery I&#8217;ve seen on any notebook. It lasts for over 10 hours of normal usage; over 5 hours of continuous video playback of a 1080p video; and over 7 hours of continuous internet browsing. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> If you are looking for a laptop that combines performance, battery and portability, the Macbook Air is the best purchase right now. As we noted, even at its price of Rs. 61,990, it is a cheaper deal than any comparative Windows laptop, even if you were to go on hardware alone. Add in the fact that Apple is giving goodies worth Rs. 5,000 free with purchases and it&#8217;s a no-brainer.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1959937&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1959264&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/macbook1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1959454" alt="Macbook" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/macbook1.jpg" /></a> With the 2013 Macbook Air models, things have changed. The Macbook is cheaper now!
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Traditionally, buying a Macbook has always meant that you shell out more than what you would for a Windows laptop with equivalent hardware. But with the 2013 Macbook Air models, things have changed. There’s no longer a “Mac Premium” or an “Apple Tax” as going with a Windows machine would mean spending the same amount. In fact, the Macbook is cheaper! </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">I was in the market for a new laptop. I&#8217;m not a Mac guy &#8212; I still use a PC dual &#8212; booting between Linux and Windows and wanted a notebook PC that gives me the same setup. But there were a few requirements:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fantastic battery life:</strong> Even &#8220;very good&#8221; would not do, I needed a minimum of a full work day without charging, which is 8-9 hours for me.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight &amp; portable:</strong> I needed to be able to take this notebook with me anywhere I go without thinking twice about the weight I have to carry around. This also meant a smaller screen, preferably 11 inches, but 13 inches would do as well.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful:</strong> I test software, I edit images, I usually have at least 15 tabs open in Chrome—this could not be a machine that would buckle under that pressure. It&#8217;s good if it ran on Intel&#8217;s new Haswell processors because of the graphics chipset boost, but obviously, a dedicated graphics card was better. And yeah, an SSD was a must.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I started searching for something which would do what I wanted. I have always eschewed buying a Macbook because it was usually more expensive than a Windows laptop with equivalent hardware. But surfing through all the options in India, I got a surprising result: the new Macbook Air is actually cheaper than any 11-inch or 13-inch high-end Windows ultrabook.</p>
<p>The Macbook Air has an 11-inch screen (1366&#215;768 pixels), 1.3GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 Haswell processor, Intel HD5000 graphics, 4GB DDR3 RAM, 128GB SSD. It clocks over 10 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>The closest competitor is the Sony Vaio Pro, which has the same inner hardware, but boasts an 11-inch touchscreen with a FullHD 1920&#215;1080 pixels resolution. In our review, it clocks a little over 6 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>The Macbook Air costs Rs. 61,990 in stores, and you can get a further Rs 5,000 discount or buy an Apple product of that price (depending on where you purchase the device). The 11&#8243; Sony Vaio Pro costs Rs 69,990 and discounts are in the range of Rs 3,000 to Rs 5,000. Both the laptops also come in 13-inch versions with a similar price difference.</p>
<p>The Macbook Air is actually a good Rs 10,000 lesser than a Windows laptop with similar specs. The screen and the battery life are all that separate these two. Other Windows machines with similar specs are priced far higher than the Sony Vaio Pro. Some of the other Windows makers like Lenovo and Dell should be coming out with competing machines soon, but the price would be similar to the Sony Vaio Pro at best.</p>
<p>For a price-sensitive market like India, this is a radical shift in what Apple has always offered. I&#8217;m not going to get into a Mac vs. Windows war here. I find both have their merits and as a gamer, I&#8217;d always pick Windows. But there&#8217;s no doubt that Mac is a more stable operating system, and doesn&#8217;t slow down with usage like Microsoft&#8217;s offering.</p>
<p>The larger point, though, is that the argument of a Macbook Air or a similar Windows laptop now no longer includes an &#8220;Apple Tax&#8221;. If anything, a Macbook Air is cheaper.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/eye4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1959034" alt="Lenovo Yoga Tablet has excellent ergonomics, battery life but an inferior display." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/eye4.jpg" /></a> Lenovo Yoga Tablet has excellent ergonomics, battery life but an inferior display.
<p>Can you use a tablet with one hand? For most tablets, the answer is, not for long periods. Lenovo is attempting to change that with a cylindrical metal grip on one side which lets users hold the tablet easily.<br />
Lenovo’s Yoga moniker is no longer reserved for ultrabooks that can be bent backwards. The Chinese manufacturer, which recently said that it has moved from being a PC maker to a PC-plus company, has brought the Yoga brand name to two unconventional tablets. Lenovo Yoga Tablet comes in two screen sizes: the 8-inch variant costs Rs 22,999, and the 10-inch model is Rs 28,999. We reviewed the 8-inch Yoga Tablet.</p>
<p><em><strong>Build Quality and Design</strong></em><br />
In a market full of look-alikes, the Lenovo Yoga Tablet stands out for its unique design. The tube grip on one edge of the tablet makes it easy to hold. Twisting the tube reveals a tiny stand, which by far is the most innovative addition to a tablet. If you have ever used an iPad with Apple’s smart cover, you would know how much the typing experience improves after you fold the cover into a triangle . The stand on the Yoga Tablet lets you do the same thing without paying about<br />
Rs 4,000 more. But at 401 grams, the tablet is too heavy for single-hand use.<br />
Users can also use the stand to prop up the tablet. This, along with the front-facing speakers and Dolby sound, make watching films enjoyable on the Yoga Tablet. The only gripe is that the speakers are not loud enough for noisy places, but suffice for watching films at home. Holding a tablet in your hand while watching films is cumbersome for various reasons such as aching or sweating hands, and the device’s rising temperature, especially during the summer. The tablet’s stand eliminates that irksome experience altogether.<br />
Lenovo is known for making sturdy devices, as is evident from the company’s rugged ThinkPad laptops. The Yoga Tablet is no exception. The back panel of the tablet is made of metal, and so is the tube grip. This gives it a sturdy feel.<br />
The placement of the power button is unconventional — at one end of the tube grip — but it’s easy to find once users get accustomed to the device.</p>
<p><strong><em>Display and Performance</em></strong><br />
Yoga Tablet 8’s pricing pits it squarely against last year’s iPad Mini, and the display is just a shade inferior when compared to Apple’s device. However, those looking to buy the 10-inch Yoga Tablet can get a much better display on the iPad Mini Retina (Rs 28,900). Yoga Tablet runs Android 4.2.2, but Lenovo has customised the OS. The app drawer has been removed entirely, which means that you will not have to tap a button to view a list of apps. All your apps are on the home screen by default, just like the layout in Apple’s iOS.<br />
One area where the software differs from iOS, is that you can place widgets on the home screen. I did not like Lenovo’s customisation, since stock Android feels much smoother and refined. There is no point trying to change the interface if the company cannot improve the user experience. A slight lag was noticed when swiping between home screens, especially after many widgets were placed on one of the home screens.<br />
For a mid-range tablet, the device performes as expected. It is capable of running most games, but don’t buy it if you want to play heavy games, such as Real Racing 3, all day. As with most tablets, the Yoga Tablet’s 5 megapixel camera is poor.<br />
One rarely uses the words Android and excellent battery life in the same sentence. Earlier this year, Lenovo’s P780 smartphone debunked that stereotype, although the phone was a little too bulky for most. With the Yoga Tablet, Lenovo has given users excellent battery life in a sleek form. The secret — the tube grip houses its battery. It lasted<br />
10-11 hours on moderate to heavy usage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Should You Buy It?</em></strong><br />
It’s good enough for most users, since it supports 3G and voice calls. The tablet deserves credit for excellent ergonomics and battery life. However, buyers will have to live with the Yoga Tablet’s low-resolution display and the dearth of excellent tablet-optimised apps on Android.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1959027&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/m_id_456545_sony_video_headset.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1958731" alt="M_Id_456545_Sony_video_headset" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/m_id_456545_sony_video_headset.jpg?w=600&#038;h=334" width="600" height="334" /></a>A virtual-reality headset from Sony almost puts you inside a video by allowing you to widen your view when you turn your head up, down or side to side.<br />
Sony&#8217;s $1,000 &#8220;Wearable HDTV&#8221; worked as intended in a demo. But a few quirks made me believe it&#8217;ll still be a while before we can really step into a recorded video scene and look around for ourselves.</p>
<p>The HMZ-T3W fits snugly on your head, even while wearing glasses, but you need someone&#8217;s help strapping it in. A big soft pad rests on your forehead, while straps around the back of your skull give you a snug fit. At 11.3 ounces, the device is fairly light. Because it doesn&#8217;t sit on your nose, I can imagine sitting through a full-length movie with it on. A set of headphones is required. A hooded viewer contains two screens measuring 0.7 inches diagonally. Each screen delivers high-definition images in 720p resolution to each eye. Little slider knobs under each screen help you focus.</p>
<p>In a demo at the International CES gadget show, you are put on a motorcycle racing down the English countryside. Looking down shows the pavement speeding by, looking up shows the clouds. When swiveling to the right or left, I felt like waving to the crowds alongside the road &#8211; although I would have looked like a dork to anyone in the real world looking on.</p>
<p>The footage was shot using an action camera with a 170-degree field of view. Sony says the screen is equivalent to viewing a 750-inch screen from 65 feet away, though it&#8217;s almost the same as saying you&#8217;re watching a 60-inch screen from five feet away.</p>
<p>A sensor that captures motion was clipped to the back straps in the demo. It measured my head movement, so the view on the screens shifted accordingly. But there was a slight drift. A blind spot on my right gradually encroached into my field of vision, while looking all the way left required me to crane my neck further and further as it went on. The HMZ-T3W gave me a flavor of what&#8217;s possible with video headsets. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d buy one, but trying it out was a fun ride.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1958699&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Logitech's Z443 Multimedia Speakers are good if you need tonnes of bass on your desktop<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1958656&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/logitech-z443-speakers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1958663" alt="Logitech Z443 Speakers" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/logitech-z443-speakers.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>When it comes to computer peripherals Logitech is one that commands the most brand recollection. Though a bit premium for many, it still promises quality and durability for those who are willing to spend that little bit extra. Their latest is the Z443 multimedia speaker with subwoofer. Here is the review.</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/speaker-system-z443.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1958665" alt="speaker-system-z443" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/speaker-system-z443.jpg?w=120&#038;h=140" width="120" height="140" /></a>The wooden finish of the Z443 looks classy and fibre board body feels sturdy. It will definitely go with your furniture. The speakers are behind a fabric netting, full with the Logitech logo in chrome. The front panel in the sub-woofer has volume and bass controls. The volume control also has the on/off switch. The set up is quite easy with the satellites being plugged into the subwoofer.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/speaker-system-z443-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1958664" alt="speaker-system-z443 (1)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/speaker-system-z443-1.jpg?w=120&#038;h=140" width="120" height="140" /></a>The Z443 is made for people who like to play around with their bass. Or should I say, play everything with their bass. That intention is clear when you put the bass controls almost as prominently as the volume. But the bass here is good enough to be flaunted. I tested with some heavy bass numbers by Cyberoptics, Khalifa and Dr Dre to really push the sub woofers. The results were surprisingly good for a 2.1 set. At the top of the bass dial, you can feel the vibrations in the subwoofer and even the table it is kept on.</p>
<p>Then I went to the other extreme and tried some Soul by Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathway. The results were even better, after all this is the kind of music I like to hear. The vocals really touched a chord and rights where they should. At the audio is true even at the high volumes, which is hard to find in desktop speakers.</p>
<p>The wooden body gave me the impression that the acoustics should be good. I tested it with a <a title="Azora" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CZxLXxbejc" target="_blank">Yuki Matsui</a> guitar solo I have always adored. I was not disappointed, especially since the last time I tested this was on Creative T4 for that costs six times as much as this one. Yes, this works for all kinds of music you would want to hear on your PC.</p>
<p>My only grouse with the Z443 is that it does not give some additional source options. For instance a USB port would have been a welcome addition, especially when you just want to listen to songs without the PC on.</p>
<p><strong>Should you buy this:</strong> If it fits the budget go ahead and upgrade your old desktop speakers. If you are looking for something that will work will all you devices from smartphones and tablets to the PC then get a Bluetooth option.</p>
<p>Price: <strong>Rs 5,995</strong><br />

<p>You can now mail someone whose email address you don&#8217;t have. It is as simple as that. It also means you will get mail from people not in your address book.</p>
<p>Google on Friday announced a change in its policies which allows you to mail people you know but don&#8217;t know the email address of. &#8220;Starting this week, when you&#8217;re composing a new email, Gmail will suggest your Google+ connections as recipients, even if you haven&#8217;t exchanged email addresses yet,&#8221; said a post from Google. However, a mail send like this will land in your Social category and not the main inbox.</p>
<p>&#8220;Emailing Google+ connections works a bit differently to protect the privacy of email addresses,&#8221; says the post, explaining how privacy will be maintained. &#8220;Your email address isn&#8217;t visible to your Google+ connections until you send them an email, and their email addresses are not visible to you until they respond,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<a name="pd_a_7704698"></a>
<div class="PDS_Poll" id="PDI_container7704698" data-settings="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/static.polldaddy.com\/p\/7704698.js&quot;}" style="display:inline-block;"></div>
<div id="PD_superContainer"></div>
<noscript><a href="http://polldaddy.com/poll/7704698">Take Our Poll</a></noscript><script type='text/javascript'>
(function(d,c,j){if(!d.getElementById(j)){var pd=d.createElement(c),s;pd.id=j;pd.src='http://s1.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/shortcodes/js/polldaddy-shortcode.js';s=d.getElementsByTagName(c)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(pd,s);}  else if(typeof jQuery !=='undefined')jQuery(d.body).trigger('pd-script-load');}(document,'script','pd-polldaddy-loader'));
</script>
<p>The mail specifies that &#8220;only after you respond or add them to your circles, can they start another conversation with you&#8221;.<br />
However, users can control whether people can reach you with a new setting in Gmail on the desktop. It lets you decide who gets to mails you &#8212; everyone on Google+, extended circles, circles or no one.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1958052&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lenovo&#8217;s big announcement at the 2014 International Consumer Electronics Show was the third generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon, now the world’s lightest 14-inch ultrabook, and the ThinkPad 8, an 8-inch Windows 8 tablet.</p>
<p>The New X1 Carbon weighs only 1.27 kg and has the durability promised by most ThinkPad devices. In fact, this goes a notch further and is forged from Carbon Fiber, which weighs less than magnesium and aluminum but is stronger than both. It features an Adaptive Keyboard, which dynamically adjusts based on the software or application being used to highlight the most relevant keys. It also integrates voice and gesture control.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/800px-white_shark.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1957047" alt="Great White Shark" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/800px-white_shark.jpg" /></a> Great White Shark
<p>Great white sharks, top predators of the world&#8217;s oceans, may live up to 70 years and more, far longer than previously thought, says a new study.</p>
<p>Researchers used radiocarbon dating to determine age estimates for adult white sharks, also known as great whites, in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean. The first successful radiocarbon age-validation study analysed vertebrae from four male and four female white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) caught between 1967 and 2010 in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Researchers from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) compared radiocarbon values from the shark vertebrae with reference chronologies documenting the marine uptake of carbon 14 produced by the atmospheric bomb testing. Samples were dated  and the result was the first radiocarbon age estimates for adult white sharks.</p>
<p>Estimated bomb radiocarbon dating age of the oldest female white shark sampled was 40, and for the oldest male 73. Ages for the three other males were 9, 14, and 44, while the other females sampled had estimated ages of 6, 21, and 32. Previous studies of white sharks from the Pacific and Indian Oceans suggested that none of the examined specimens were older than 23 years.<br />
Researchers suggest that either white sharks are living significantly longer and growing slower in the Northwest Atlantic than either the Pacific or Indian Oceans, or longevity has been underestimated in previous studies.</p>
<p>Knowledge is limited about the age and growth rates of white sharks, apex predators that live in coastal and offshore waters throughout the world. Sharks are typically aged by counting alternating opaque and translucent band pairs deposited in sequence in their vertebrae.    It is unclear whether these band pairs are deposited annually, making it difficult to accurately estimate age or provide estimates for longevity for many shark species.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1957044&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

It is the first game of its kind in the messaging platform from the Japanese company and lets players steer and jump their cars as they try to drive as far as possible.</p>
<p>Players score depending on how far they can travel and how many other vehicles they can pass before they run out of gas.<br />
Points convert to prizes and players can acquire gold and trophies depending on how many points they get. These can then be exchanged for many unique characters and over 50 different types of cars.</p>
<p>Each car and character has a different set of abilities, so there is plenty of scope for players to find the playing style that suits them the best. Social features include ranking against friends, opportunity to exchange tires and boast about new high scores.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1957038&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sting.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1959932" alt="Decent phone along with good light and location must be keep in mind while carrying out a sting to get the best results. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sting.jpg" /></a> Decent phone along with good light and location must be keep in mind while carrying out a sting to get the best results.
<p>Now that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has given an official sanction for stinging those corrupt officials in your area, here are five things you must keep in mind to get the best results.</p>
<p><strong>1. DECENT PHONE:</strong> Phones come in all shapes, sizes and price ranges, but except for the top bracket, most of them have horrible cameras. So make sure you are using one of those phones with cameras that will help you differentiate the victim from the accused. Otherwise the sting will, well, lose its sting.</p>
<p><strong>2. DECENT LIGHT:</strong> Even the best of phone cameras perform horribly if the light is not good. So avoid stings in dark rooms. Use your skills in persuasion, or show the money as bait, to draw the target to a brighter part of the office, or wherever you are conducting the sting.</p>
<p><strong>3. DECENT LOCATION:</strong> So where will you keep the camera? Obviously, you can&#8217;t do the sting with the camera in your hand. So you could put it in your shirt pocked with the lens peering out. Since you might need to make a hole in the pocket for best results, don&#8217;t wear your best shirt to the sting. The next best location is to strap the camera to your chest and make a hole where the lens comes. You could also keep it in a bag on the tablet, again with a hole for the camera. Other locations like caps, pant pockets and shoes could lead to awkward situations. This also rules out the use of the phablet, as there is no way you can hide a 6-inch phone in any of these places.</p>
<p><strong>4. DECENT LANGUAGE:</strong> Use your best language while stinging your target, after all you don&#8217;t want to appear on national television as a foulmouthed whistleblower. Also, make sure you speak clearly so that everyone is on the same page when it comes to deciphering the video in the end. But make sure you are not making it too obvious. A microphone would have been a great accessory, but it would also be a dead giveaway.</p>
<p><strong>5. DECENT STORAGE:</strong> You don&#8217;t want to run out of space in the middle of a sting, so make sure your phone&#8217;s memory card has at least 2GB of free space. Yes, you will need to delete a lot of songs and item number videos to make the space, but it will be totally worth it. After all, the hallelujah moment in the entire exercise might come much after you have set the camera rolling.</p>
<p>Now, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and sting those corrupt babus.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1957023&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/iball-andi-uddaan-safety-smartphone-for-girls-priced-at-rs-8999.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1957004" alt="iBall-Andi-Uddaan-safety-smartphone-for-girls-priced-at-Rs-8999" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/iball-andi-uddaan-safety-smartphone-for-girls-priced-at-rs-8999.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>By Namrata Rao</strong></span></p>
<p>One thing&#8217;s for sure. iBall brand from Mumbai-based Best IT World has come a long way since making its fist-size mobile phone for the elderly. That said, how long it can sustain in the cut-throat and ever-evolving smartphone market, will depend on how swiftly it can incorporate the changing dynamics of the market. But if the recently launched Andi Uddaan smartphone is any indication, the nearly 13-year-old maker of pen drives and PC accessories is definitely on the right track.<br />
The iBall Andi Uddaan is essentially targeted at women and it is as girly a gadget as can be with hearts and crystals studded on to the pink and ivory body, as well as the home screen. That&#8217;s not all. The company gives a pink back cover, a little pink purse and a pink flip cover, among other regular accessories, inside the box.</p>
<p>However, what makes Uddaan unique is a feature dedicated exclusively to women&#8217;s safety. The so-called SOS button at the back (in the shape of a heart), when pressed, sets off a loud alarm alerting people nearby. What&#8217;s more, text messages are sent and phone calls are made automatically to five pre-defined emergency contacts, with the text message providing the geographical location of the phone&#8217;s owner in real time. The message also gets posted to the mobile phone owner&#8217;s Facebook account.</p>
<p>The tracking facility in the phone allows the user to add her daily route on the map and authorise up to 10 people to track her movements live on the map. This can be useful in times of emergency and the company has used women&#8217;s safety as a key advertising plank. Not a bad strategy at all and brilliant timing too. Other safety measures include an ICE feature that allows the user to save vital information such as blood group, medical history, details of people to contact in case of any emergency etc.</p>
<p>Once you get through the security features of the phone, it has all the common specifications that are found today in almost all budget Android phones.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/iball-andi-uddaan-smartphone-reviewspricefull-specifications-2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1957003" alt=" iBall Andi Uddaan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/iball-andi-uddaan-smartphone-reviewspricefull-specifications-2.png" /></a> iBall Andi Uddaan
<p>The sleek 11mm-thick phone weighs around 170 gm with a 1.3 GHz dual-core A7 processor, powered by Google&#8217;s Android 4.2 Jellybean OS and has 512 MB RAM and 4 GB internal storage (which can be expanded to 32 GB) —quite common these days. It is a dual-SIM phone with a five-inch screen and pixel density of 220 pixels per square inch. What sets the Uddaan apart, though, is the 5 MP front camera—something not common in phones in this range.</p>
<p>During our testing, the SOS button worked faultlessly. The alarm is so loud and irritating that it will definitely make heads turn. SMSes were sent and calls were also made to the pre-designated numbers during our testing.</p>
<p>The phone also worked pretty well when several features were tested simultaneously. In terms of power in the sub-15,000 price range, the phone is second only to some models made my Micromax that are quad-core. The touch experience, though, was just a tad short of perfect. The 2,000 mAh battery lasted over one-and-a-half days on standby. You can also watch videos on the phone without hurting your eyes.</p>
<p>The iBall Andi Uddaan is a stylish phone with the best feature being its SOS button. So if you are a girl who has been late to jump on to the smartphone bandwagon, this is your chance, and a pretty one at that.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated street price: Rs 10,999</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1957002&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong><em>Galaxy Note 10.1 is loaded with features—multi-window, smart stay, air view, etc—but Too many features also mean the device, at times, does tend to lag but, fortunately, this lag is not frustrating</em></strong></p>
<p>Although Samsung may be bracing for its weakest smartphone profit growth this year since 2007 as arch rival Apple challenges its domination in China&#8217;s $80 billion market—according to Reuters, from January 17, Apple will make its phones available via China Mobile through which Samsung has been successfully selling smartphones for seven years, hurting the Korean company&#8217;s sales—Samsung continues its strong grip over the Indian market. And though new players such as Micromax and Gionee are eating into the sales of established players in India, products from companies such as Samsung are seeing increasing interest among the buyers. In fact, according to Google India Zeitgeist—which tracks the year&#8217;s major events and trends based on Google searches—the Samsung Galaxy S4 was the most searched for mobile device in the country in 2013.</p>
<p>This year, one mobile device that just might enter the Google India Zeitgeist list is the recently launched Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 edition). Promising what the company calls the &#8220;best viewing experience&#8221;, the new Galaxy Note 10.1 boasts of extremely high WQXGA resolution with crystal clear viewing quality and big screen. In fact, the resolution offers the user utmost viewing experience and full HD contents are fully supported without compromising quality. This is one tablet in which every image and video is displayed more vividly and more sharply than many other similar devices. The Galaxy Note 10.1 also allows magazine-like experience via its 10.1-inch large screen. You can create your own menu screen by pinning your most used and loved apps, websites, videos, files, and folders to your screen. Then, there is enough screen space to do multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, you can activate two apps at the same time, and you can also draw or scribble while you are doing something else, like watching a movie.</p>
<p>This tablet also gets a new exterior design. The extra space from the bezel is removed, making it smaller in size and lighter in weight without a reduction in the screen size. Then, the leather-like back cover gives the Galaxy Note 10.1 a more classic look. It has got a very solid build quality and is easy to grip. But while this tablet is fairly light at 547 gm, it remains heavy enough for single-handed usage—more often than not, you have to use both hands to operate this tablet. Sadly, there is no case or cover included in the box that can ensure ease of operation.</p>
<p>One can also compose and manage notes easily and quickly on this tablet. For instance, you can quickly scribble notes and then the S Note will edit the same and convert it into digital text. The S Pen that this tablet comes equipped with has a very comfortable grip and is light. As soon as you take the S Pen out of its slot, a feature called Action Memo appears on the screen. This memo connects you to seven things that you are most likely to do—call, save contact info, send SMS or email, search web and location, add tasks. The S Pen itself is a wonder—if you hold it like a pen, the rubberised tip gives a very &#8216;pen-like&#8217; feel when writing on the screen and the handwriting recognition is just brilliant!</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-note-10-1-angle-grey.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1956998" alt="galaxy-note-10-1-angle-grey" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/galaxy-note-10-1-angle-grey.jpg?w=480&#038;h=508" width="480" height="508" /></a>This tablet has another fine feature called the Scrapbooker, with which one can easily collect and organise a variety of content, including webpages, YouTube videos, videos on device, etc, in one place called the Scrapbook.</p>
<p>The front of the screen has two capacitive keys to the left and right of the home screen button in the middle, but because the tablet is wide enough at 243 mm, operating those keys with your thumbs, while holding the tablet with both hands, can be an issue at times. There is a speaker grille on each side of the tablet and the sound is loud yet clear. The Galaxy Note 10.1 has a front and a rear camera, both of which are at par with cameras on other tablets in this segment.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Note 10.1 is loaded with features—multi-window, smart stay, air view, etc—some of which Samsung users might already be aware of, but people coming from iOS or even vanilla Android may have to climb the learning curve. And once you get a hang of things, this tablet can be  extremely productive. Again, too many features also mean the device, at times, does tend to lag but, fortunately, this lag is not frustrating. Mention must be made of the 8,220 mAh battery which lasts very long even with heavy usage. Priced at Rs 49,990, the Galaxy Note 10.1 can prove to be a very productive tablet for professionals. It is, indeed, among the few tablets we hate to dislike.</p>
<p><strong>Estimated street price: Rs 49,990</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1956997&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ten years after NASA landed two rovers on Mars for a 90-day mission, one is still exploring, and the project has generated hundreds of thousands of images from the planet&#8217;s surface.</p>
<div>
<p>Now the Smithsonian&#8217;s National Air and Space Museum is presenting more than 50 of the best photographs from the two rovers known as Spirit and Opportunity in an art exhibit curated by the scientists who have led the mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirit and Opportunity: 10 Yearsa Roving Across Mars&#8221; opens Thursday and includes many large-scale photographs of craters, hills, dunes, dust clouds, meteorites, rock formations and the Martian sunset. The Smithsonian&#8217;s first exhibit of art from the Martian rovers marks the 10th anniversary of the mission.</p>
<p>John Grant, a planetary geologist at the museum who is part of the rover mission team, organized the exhibit, in part as a travel log with images on one side from Sprit and images from Opportunity on the other. The rovers landed in January 2004 on opposite sides of Mars and began exploring volcanic deposits and plains, as well as meteorites and impact craters, so the exhibit also focuses on the science, Grant said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every one of the images you see here tells a story of discovery that goes along with the story of beauty on Mars,&#8221; Grant said. It&#8217;s a look at an alien planet through the rovers&#8217; eyes, he said.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/art-mars-rovers_kuma.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1956724" alt="This image provided by NASA shows a view by the Mars Rover Spirit of a sunset over the rim of Gusev Crater, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) away. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/art-mars-rovers_kuma.jpg" /></a> This image provided by NASA shows a view by the Mars Rover Spirit of a sunset over the rim of Gusev Crater, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) away.
<p>Uncovering signs of the past presence of water and a more habitable environment are among the rovers&#8217; most important discoveries. Some were made by accident.</p>
<p>After about 800 days, one of Spirit&#8217;s front wheels stalled and stopped functioning. So the engineering team decided to continue driving it in reverse, dragging the broken wheel across the Martian surface. That dragging dug a trench behind the rover that soon uncovered a new material as white as snow. It turned out to be silica material that would normally be found in hot springs and hydrothermal systems — habitable environments.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a total surprise,&#8221; said Steven Squyres, an astronomy professor at Cornell University who headed the Mars Exploration Rover mission. &#8220;It was just pure good luck. We wouldn&#8217;t have even seen that if we didn&#8217;t have the busted wheel.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rovers also found concretions and layered sedimentary rocks made of sulfate salt that showed water had once been on the planet&#8217;s surface.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/art-mars-rovers_kuma-3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1956723" alt="This image provided by NASA shows loose, BB-sized, hematite-rich spherules embedded in this Martian rock like blueberries in a muffin and released over time by erosion. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/art-mars-rovers_kuma-3.jpg" /></a> This image provided by NASA shows loose, BB-sized, hematite-rich spherules embedded in this Martian rock like blueberries in a muffin and released over time by erosion.
<p>While some panoramic images clearly show the red Martian landscape, other images focus on other colors that can be found in Mars&#8217; rocks, soil and sky. One image of the Martian sunset shows a bluish color in the sky, which is usually pink in the daytime due to the reddish dust in the atmosphere. But it turns blue at sunset — the opposite of Earth, Squyres said.</p>
<p>Jim Green, NASA&#8217;s director of planetary science, said the rovers have made huge strides in learning about Mars to eventually send humans there. Another rover called Curiosity is also now exploring the surface, and NASA plans to send more rovers before humans.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, there were many who would look down upon people using a Micromax phone. There are still many of those people around. But Micromax is no longer the &#8220;cheap phones brand&#8221; it used to be. In fact, at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas, the world&#8217;s largest stage for technology and gadgets, this Indian company showed that it means business. Business at a global level to be precise.</p>
<p>Known in India for bringing top-end specs at mid range prices, Micromax&#8217;s big global announcement was chip giant Intel&#8217;s first dual-boot Windows and Android tablet. Intel has been trying its best to get a foothold in the mobile space, and with the second largest smartphone maker in the second largest smartphone market. So it is actually a coup of sorts for both companies.</p>
<p>Incidentally, around the same time, Taiwan&#8217;s Asus too announced an Intel-powered Transformer Book Duet TD300, running both Android and Windows 8 on the same processor. But that is more of laptop. This is a more of a tablet. Hence Micromax&#8217;s is the first dual-boot tablet. The definitions in tech are that thin these days.</p>
<p>Announced at CES on Monday, the Micromax LapTab will be available for consumers in February. It is powered by an Intel Bay Trail-M processor and will be this first-of-its-kind tablet will run both Android 4.2.2 Jelly Bean and Windows 8, with just a reboot enabling the switch over.</p>
<p>At the launch, Micromax co-founder Rahul Sharma made it clear this was their &#8220;next leap&#8221;, &#8220;raising the innovation bar globally&#8221;. We should have know this was coming. It was just months ago that the company signed Hollywood heart-throb Hugh Jackman as its brand ambassador. That was indication enough that this company was not eyeing just India, it had the world in its sight. After all, a lot of hinterland India, where Micromax has been making hay for a few years, would not even recognise the wolverine star.</p>
<p>But in Africa and West Asia, people do recognise this face. That is the sort of market Micromax has been eyeing for a few years  now. It helps that consumers in these geographies are very similar to India and have similar purchasing powers. But a dual-boot device is not meant for them. That is for the urban geek. For that growing consumer base, Micromax will offer the price advantage very few global players bring to the table. Sharma calls this &#8220;democratising technology for people around the world&#8221;. Coming from the world&#8217;s largest democracy, this might be an export that will sell across the world.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1956626&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/k135-zoom-big.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-1956625" alt="Acer K135 projector" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/k135-zoom-big.png" /></a> Acer K135 projector
<p>Like most other gadgets, projectors too have been becoming compact over the past few years. But the smallest of the lot, the so-called Pico projectors, are not as bright as the best projectors. They usually have a brightness of around 100 Lumens, which means you need a really dark room to get an image that is good enough. However, a new breed of devices now aims to pack portability along with bright bulbs. Of course, these projectors are not as small as the hand-held projectors &#8212; they just can&#8217;t be with the brighter lamps. But they pack a lot more features than the average Pico. The Acer K135 LED projector is one such, and we put it to the test.</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>Despite its size, which is not much larger than a Discman, the K135 packs a bright 500 Lumens lamp. It weighs just 435 grams, which makes it very portable. The power button is on top, just beside a menu console surrounded by four directional buttons. There is a small focus toggle towards the front. The device has an HDMI input as well as a USB port. Since a lot of people will be using this on the move, it can also project from a micro-SD card.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p>The K135 is easy to set up and run, especially if you have an HDMI source. The USB port would obviously be the best bet when you are on the move. But this works better with documents and photographs. The device could not recognise a whole lot of video formats. However, it can open most common document formats like .doc and .pdf. There is also a Wi-Fi but we just couldn&#8217;t go anywhere with it. Selecting the setup in that section kept taking us back to the menu as we did not have the UBS Wi-Fi adapter that makes this work.</p>
<p>The 500 Lumens lamp is pretty good for a projector this size. So you can use this to beam important presentations when in a hotel room a day before a meeting. Plus, for these kinds of scenarios you have the option of selecting the wall colour for a clearer image. There is a 2w speaker which you can use when you have no other options, only when you have no other option.</p>
<p>The image quality is really good and we suggest you run this mostly in HD. You can go Full HD from the source, but you will need at least eight feet space to make good use of it. One grouse is the fact that this does not have short-throw, which is almost an industry standard in projectors this size. That would have added real value. Now, you need at least three feet space to get a small, but decent, image. The remote is also a bit of a head ache as you need to remember to click the right button to select, which is not natural at all. You end up clicking the menu button to select and this just restarts the entire process.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='560' height='315' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KBhi8aBSMEo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Should you buy it:</strong> Buy this if you are looking for portability as a key factor and have a laptop with an HDMI port to run this effectively. I wouldn&#8217;t suggest this as home theatre option as there are better projectors from Acer itself which are more compatible for entertainment use.</p>
<p><strong>Rs 44,999</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/artm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1952810" alt="Scientists have developed an artificial cannabis-like molecule that could reduce pain and joint inflammation in osteoarthritis" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/artm.jpg" /></a> Scientists have developed an artificial cannabis-like molecule that could reduce pain and joint inflammation in osteoarthritis
<p>Scientists have developed an artificial cannabis-like molecule that could reduce pain and joint inflammation in osteoarthritis.<br />
Researchers from the University of Nottingham developed the synthetic compound which inhibits a pain-sensing pathway in the spinal cord known as the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2).<br />
Although cannabis can effectively relieve pain, its use in medicine is limited because of its other psychological effects.<br />
The compound, called JWH133, is completely synthetic but is designed to selectively target CB2 in a similar way to the drug.<br />
Levels of the CB2 receptor in the spinal cord have been shown to be closely linked to the severity of pain among osteoarthritis sufferers, &#8216;The Telegraph&#8217; reported.<br />
Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage at the ends of bones wears away, causing joint pain and stiffness.<br />
There is no effective drug treatment to slow the progression of the condition, but interventions include pain relief, exercise, physiotherapy, weight loss and joint replacement.<br />
&#8220;This finding is significant, as spinal and brain pain signalling pathways are known to make a major contribution to pain associated with osteoarthritis,&#8221; said Professor Victoria Chapman, who led the study.<br />
&#8220;These new data support the further evaluation of the selective cannabinoid-based interventions for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain,&#8221; she said.<br />
The study was published in the Public Library of Science ONE journal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1952809&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/acer_iconia_w4_flat1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1952711" alt="Acer Iconia W4" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/acer_iconia_w4_flat1.jpg" /></a> Acer Iconia W4
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>By Mihir Patkar</strong></span></p>
<p>Unlike most devices, the Acer Iconia W4 puts the full-fledged Windows 8 operating system on a portable tablet with an 8-inch screen, much like an iPad Mini.<br />
<strong>Quick Tech Specs:</strong> 8-inch IPS display (1280&#215;800 pixels) | 1.8GHz quad-core Intel Atom Z3740 processor | 2GB RAM | 64GB storage + microSD slot | 5MP rear camera, 2MP front camera | Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n | 415gms | 4950mAh battery | Windows 8.1<br />
<strong>Design:</strong> The Iconia W4 has a plastic body made to seem like metal, but it&#8217;s still solid and feels good to hold. It&#8217;s much heavier than tablets of this size and it gets uncomfortable to hold the tablet up and read books for more than half an hour.<br />
<strong>Screen:</strong> No complaints about the W4&#8242;s screen. It&#8217;s bright, the resolution is decent and the viewing angles are good. The only issue is that it&#8217;s not clearly visible in direct sunlight.<br />
<strong>Performance:</strong> Most of the Modern UI apps run fine, but beware if you plan on running Firefox or Chrome. These web browsers quickly hog the limited resources and the Iconia W4 will start crawling. It especially struggles if you connect it to a large screen via the HDMI cable.<br />
<strong>Memory:</strong> You get 51.9GB of available on the 64GB version that we tested. Install a few apps and let System Restore perform a few backups and this quickly drops to 43GB. So if you were using the 32GB version of the W4, that&#8217;s only 11GB of storage space available to you. Thankfully, there&#8217;s a microSD slot so you can add extra memory if needed.<br />
<strong>Software:</strong> We have a detailed article about running Windows 8 on an 8-inch tablet. Here&#8217;s the short version: Despite the power of Windows and Microsoft Office, it doesn&#8217;t feel good and does not offer as useful an experience as Android or iOS.<br />
<strong>Camera:</strong> The rear camera on the W4 is practically useless. Sure, you can click a few snaps when you&#8217;re out in natural light, but that&#8217;s about it. Photos taken indoors, at night, or in dim environments are noisy and grainy. The front cam, however, does the job for video calling. Again, just make sure you have something lighting your face.<br />
<strong>Battery:</strong> The best part of the tablet, without a doubt, is its battery. On continuous video playback, it lasted for 7 hours and 20 minutes. On a Wi-Fi browser test where a non-Flash page was reloaded every 15 seconds, the W4 died after 4 hours and 50 minutes. Generally, these are far better numbers than we have seen for most 8-inch tablets.<br />
<strong>Verdict:</strong> At a price of Rs. 26,999 for the 64GB version, there is simply no way we can recommend the Acer Iconia W4. You can get the 16GB iPad Mini or the 32GB Nexus 7 2013 version with a SIM card slot for the same price, both of which are far better deals. You&#8217;d be wasting your money on the Iconia W4.</p>

You&#8217;d be wasting your money on the Iconia W4.</span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1952660&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Philips on Monday launched a 27-inch gaming monitor with G-SYNC at the CES in Las Vegas. The 272G5DYEB monitor promises ultra smooth play to gamers thanks to the new NVIDIA G-SYNC which synchronizes display refresh rates to the PC&#8217;s GPU, eliminating screen tearing and minimising display stutter and input lag. &#8220;With G-SYNC, images display the moment they are rendered, scenes appear instantly, objects are sharper, and game play is smoother,&#8221; a release said.</p>
<p>The display will be available for purchase within a few months at $649, about Rs 40,000.</p>
<p>The monitor also offers 144Hz refresh rate with 1ms response time for fast action, 300cd/cm2brightness and a 1000:1 typical contrast ratio, and displays up to 16.7M colors. The slim black monitor is both wall mountable and height adjustable. &#8220;This 27-inch Philips monitor is a perfect gaming partner, with G-SYNC technology bringing breakthrough display performance and giving major competitive edge,&#8221; Chris Brown, TPV Global Product Marketing said in a release.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1952451&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Chipmaker NVIDIA has just pushed the game for cores to a whole new level. Its latest, the Tegra K1, launched at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas just hours ago, has an unprecedented 192 cores, making it a super chip in all restpects.</p>
<p>Tegra K1 will also be the first to feature the NVIDIA Kepler architecture that powers the fastest graphics card on the planet, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 Ti. This will in effect bring next-generation PC gaming to the mobile platforms.</p>
<p>The company said Tegra K1 is offered in two pin-to-pin compatible versions, a 32-bit quad-core (4-Plus-1 ARM Cortex-A15 CPU) and a custom NVIDIA-designed 64-bit dual Super Core CPU. This Project Denver CPU delivers high single-thread and multi-thread performance. Both versions deliver stunning graphics and visual computing capabilities powered by the 192-core NVIDIA Kepler GPU, NVIDIA claimed.</p>
<p>So what does Tegra K1, bring for the user?</p>
<ol>
<li>It will offer support for the latest PC-class gaming technologies like DirectX 11, OpenGL 4.4 and tessellation. This will enable it to run the world&#8217;s most advanced game engine, Epic Games&#8217; Unreal Engine 4. It will hence have the same graphics features as next-gen gaming consoles like the Xbox One, PS 4 and faster performance in comparison to earlier consoles like the Xbox 360 and PS 3.</li>
<li>It will offer advanced computation capabilities to speed applications for computer vision and speech recognition. Plus, it will support NVIDIA CUDA, the world&#8217;s most pervasive parallel computing platform that enables computer vision, advanced imaging, speech recognition, video editing and more.</li>
<li>More cores will bring in energy efficiency and NVIDIA claims it will be more than any other mobile GPU at the same power level. Kepler is the world&#8217;s fastest and most energy-efficient GPU architecture, powering all 10 of the world&#8217;s most energy-efficient supercomputers.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/acer_iconia_w4_flat.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1952178" alt="Acer Iconia W4" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/acer_iconia_w4_flat.jpg" /></a> Acer Iconia W4
<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Tablets are fantastic devices, whether for reading, playing games, watching movies or simply browsing the web. But in all these activities, the user is a consumer. There is pre-created content that you access. A tablet, whether it&#8217;s the iPad or an Android device, isn&#8217;t suited for creation; for true productivity, if you will.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Windows 8 was meant to work well on touchscreen devices with its Modern UI, while still retaining the core functionality with the &#8216;Desktop&#8217; app, which transported you to the familiar Windows interface. There have been plenty of touchscreen laptops running Windows 8, but they don&#8217;t offer the kind of portability that a tablet does.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Acer Iconia W4 changes the game. It puts Windows 8 on an 8-inch tablet, just like the iPad Mini or the Samsung Galaxy Note 5100. Is this the first tablet that actually lets you be as productive as you would be on a laptop?</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The short answer: Nope! The Acer W4 is a great example of the massive gap that lies between theory and practicality. On paper, you get the convenience of Windows with the added benefit of being customized for touchscreens. In reality, it&#8217;s an operating system that fails on both aspects.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Problem With Windows 8</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There are two distinct personalities in Windows 8, or the subsequent 8.1 update. The first is the Modern UI, which features fancy &#8220;Live Tiles&#8221; and a new breed of apps that are made for touchscreens. The other is the Desktop mode, which appears as an &#8216;app&#8217; in the Modern UI.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Modern UI is satisfactory as a touchscreen interface alone. It falters in some aspects when compared to the likes of iOS and Android, but scores on some others — there&#8217;s plenty to like and dislike, just like any operating system. But its undoing lies in the lack of a good app ecosystem. The Windows Store simply does not have the same number or quality of apps that are available on Android, let alone the iPad. And because of that, it&#8217;s almost impossible to recommend it for tablet use alone. Unlike the traditional desktop, touchscreen devices rely a lot on apps optimized for touch usage; without those, Windows 8 isn&#8217;t an experience that&#8217;s worth the money.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">And then comes Desktop mode. When you first tap it, the sense of familiarity it provides is a feeling that you lack on Android and iOS. This is Windows. On a tablet, this is Windows. You know it, you&#8217;ve worked with it, you know what you can do with it. But the moment you go beyond the looks, it starts falling apart. Since it wasn&#8217;t made for touch inputs, it&#8217;s difficult to operate it with your fingers. You will need to pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard and a trackpad too — make no mistake, you still need that trackpad for a regular mouse&#8217;s input when you&#8217;re in &#8220;productivity mode&#8221;, as such. There&#8217;s an awkward keyboard accessory, but it is too cumbersome. In fact, there isn&#8217;t a single keyboard for any tablet out there that turns it into a laptop without compromising on portability. The Microsoft Surface comes closest, but even that hasn&#8217;t cracked the engineering yet. So without that input of a keyboard and mouse, Windows 8.1 on a touchscreen feels lacking.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Put the two together and you can see why Windows 8 doesn&#8217;t work on a tablet form factor yet. For it to be a device that enables productivity, it needs a lot more: a keyboard, a mouse, and a USB port for pen drives.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Key Is Input</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The iPad was made for touch input. Android is made for touch input. Windows 8 tries to serve both touch and non-touch; and in doing that, it loses out on both markets. I have used Windows 8 convertible laptops, and in those, it makes sense to use it as a regular notebook PC for 90% of the time in Desktop mode and undock the screen for the 10% to indulge in some reading or light browsing in Modern UI.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">With an 8-inch tablet, the bulk of your usage is in the Modern UI, which does not have the apps to be a good tablet OS. And there&#8217;s no real way to use it as a laptop, unless you prop it up on a table and attach a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In the end, I&#8217;m left confused. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m supposed to use the Acer Iconia W4, or what I&#8217;m meant to use it for. The  iPad and Android tablets are clear in their purpose as devices to help you consume data, which is what I do on them. With Windows 8, I&#8217;m not so sure and that confusion meant that the tablet spent more time lying on its side than in my hand.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Snapchat,the red-hot private messaging service,said on Thursday that it knew for months about a security loophole that allowed hackers this week to harvest millions of phone numbers and announced changes to its systems.</p>
<p>An anonymous group called Snapchat DB posted the usernames and phone numbers of 4.6 million Snapchat users on New Year\&#8217;s Eve,days after the startup &#8211; headed by 23-year old founder Evan Spiegel &#8211; brushed off warnings that its app still contained security loopholes.</p>
<p>The hacker group,which claimed to be based in the United States and Europe,made the entire database available for download but redacted the last two digits of every phone number. Snapchat DB said it was working to raise awareness about Snapchat\&#8217;s security holes,not out of malicious intent.</p>
<p>In its first public statement since the leak,Snapchat said in a blog post on Thursday that no &#8220;snaps&#8221; &#8211; the contents of messages &#8211; were compromised or accessed as part of the hack.</p>
<p>Snapchat was first alerted to the vulnerability in August by a security group called Gibson Security. Snapchat said it made changes to its system to address the weaknesses,but the company also published a blog post downplaying the threat as &#8220;theoretical&#8221; on Dec. 27.</p>
<p>Snapchat DB carried out the hack and disclosed the phone numbers just four days later.</p>
<p>The hack was a rare black eye for a high-flying appmaker started by Stanford University undergraduates in 2011. Snapchat has soared in popularity over the past year because it allows its users &#8211; mostly teens &#8211; to send private pictures and messages that self-destruct after 10 seconds at most.</p>
<p>Snapchat\&#8217;s immense popularity among young users has made it one of the most closely watched social media companies in the world,and Facebook Inc reportedly offered $3 billion last year in a failed acquisition bid.</p>
<p>Snapchat asks new users for their phone number so that their friends can find them on the service. The phone numbers were not attached to any real names.</p>
<p>Calling the hackers\&#8217; disclosure an &#8220;abuse&#8221; of its system,Snapchat said Thursday that it was first told by security experts in August that its &#8220;Find Friends&#8221; feature may contain a weakness.</p>
<p>The company did not apologize for the leaks but said it would carry out some changes to prevent further unwanted disclosures.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be releasing an updated version of the Snapchat application that will allow Snapchatters to opt out of appearing in Find Friends after they have verified their phone number,&#8221; the company wrote. &#8220;We\&#8217;re also improving rate limiting and other restrictions to address future attempts to abuse our service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rate limiting restricts how many times a party can query the Snapchat servers.</p>
<p>CHANGES \&#8217;PROMISING\&#8217;</p>
<p>In an email to Reuters,the group claiming to be behind the New Years Eve hack called it &#8220;promising&#8221; that Snapchat was beginning to address its security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let\&#8217;s hope they aren\&#8217;t trying to downplay the situation once again and avoid the heat,but instead taking reasonable steps to secure sensitive user information,&#8221; Snapchat DB said. &#8220;Actions speak louder than words.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1215693&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BlackBerry Ltd said on Friday it had filed a lawsuit against a company co-founded by &#8220;American Idol&#8221; host Ryan Seacrest that offers a physical keyboard that can be attached to some of Apple Inc&#8217;s touchscreen iPhone 5 models.</p>
<p>The company,Typo Products LLC,is currently taking pre-orders for the $99 keyboard,which features angled miniature keys similar to those used on many of BlackBerry&#8217;s devices.</p>
<p>Canada&#8217;s BlackBerry,a once dominant smartphone maker that has lost market share to the iPhone and other touchscreen devices,said Typo&#8217;s keyboard infringes its own design.</p>
<p>The allegation has not been proven in court. Typo and Seacrest could not immediately be reached to comment on the legal proceedings.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are flattered by the desire to graft our keyboard onto other smartphones,but we will not tolerate such activity without fair compensation for using our intellectual property and our technological innovations,&#8221; Steve Zipperstein,BlackBerry&#8217;s chief legal officer,said in a statement.</p>
<p>BlackBerry posted billions in losses in recent quarters as its latest devices sold poorly,but it has maintained a loyal niche of customers who prefer to type on a physical keyboard.</p>
<p>The BlackBerry complaint is case no. 3:14-cv-23 in the United States District Court for the northern district of California.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1215397&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers using data from NASA&#8217;s Cassini spacecraft have found that Saturn&#8217;s rings formed around 4.4 billion years ago,shortly after the planet itself took shape.</p>
<p>The origin of Saturn&#8217;s ring system remains hotly debated,with some researchers arguing that it&#8217;s a relatively young structure and others holding that it coalesced long ago,at roughly the same time as the gas giant&#8217;s many satellites.</p>
<p>The new study,using data gathered by NASA&#8217;s Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft,strongly supports the latter scenario,researchers said.</p>
<p>Cassini&#8217;s measurements suggest that &#8220;the main rings would be [extremely old,rather than hundreds of millions of years old,&#8221; said Sascha Kempf,of the University of Colorado in Boulder.</p>
<p>Saturn&#8217;s main ring system is huge but razor-thin,measuring about 280,000 kilometres across but just 33 feet or so in the vertical direction.</p>
<p>The rings are composed primarily of water ice,but they contain small amounts of rocky material contributed by micrometeoroid bombardment,&#8217;LiveScience&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>Kempf and his colleagues used Cassini&#8217;s Cosmic Dust Analyzer instrument to measure just how frequently such tiny particles cruise through the Saturn system.</p>
<p>They found that a surprisingly small amount of dusty material comes into contact with the rings.</p>
<p>After measuring the low rate of dust recruitment,the team calculated that the rings have likely existed for about 4.4 billion years.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be consistent with an old ring system,&#8221; Kempf said.</p>
<p>The study was presented at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1215060&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Snapchat,the red-hot private messaging service,said on Thursday that it knew for months about a security loophole that allowed hackers this week to harvest millions of phone numbers and announced changes to its systems.</p>
<p>An anonymous group called Snapchat DB posted the usernames and phone numbers of 4.6 million Snapchat users on New Year&#8217;s Eve,days after the startup &#8211; headed by 23-year old founder Evan Spiegel &#8211; brushed off warnings that its app still contained security loopholes.</p>
<p>The hacker group,which claimed to be based in the United States and Europe,made the entire database available for download but redacted the last two digits of every phone number. Snapchat DB said it was working to raise awareness about Snapchat&#8217;s security holes,not out of malicious intent.</p>
<p>In its first public statement since the leak,Snapchat said in a blog post on Thursday that no &#8220;snaps&#8221; &#8211; the contents of messages &#8211; were compromised or accessed as part of the hack.</p>
<p>Snapchat was first alerted to the vulnerability in August by a security group called Gibson Security. Snapchat said it made changes to its system to address the weaknesses,but the company also published a blog post downplaying the threat as &#8220;theoretical&#8221; on Dec. 27.</p>
<p>Snapchat DB carried out the hack and disclosed the phone numbers just four days later.</p>
<p>The hack was a rare black eye for a high-flying appmaker started by Stanford University undergraduates in 2011. Snapchat has soared in popularity over the past year because it allows its users &#8211; mostly teens &#8211; to send private pictures and messages that self-destruct after 10 seconds at most.</p>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s immense popularity among young users has made it one of the most closely watched social media companies in the world,and Facebook Inc reportedly offered $3 billion last year in a failed acquisition bid.</p>
<p>Snapchat asks new users for their phone number so that their friends can find them on the service. The phone numbers were not attached to any real names.</p>
<p>Calling the hackers&#8217; disclosure an &#8220;abuse&#8221; of its system,Snapchat said Thursday that it was first told by security experts in August that its &#8220;Find Friends&#8221; feature may contain a weakness.</p>
<p>The company did not apologize for the leaks but said it would carry out some changes to prevent further unwanted disclosures.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be releasing an updated version of the Snapchat application that will allow Snapchatters to opt out of appearing in Find Friends after they have verified their phone number,&#8221; the company wrote. &#8220;We&#8217;re also improving rate limiting and other restrictions to address future attempts to abuse our service.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rate limiting restricts how many times a party can query the Snapchat servers.</p>
<p>CHANGES &#8216;PROMISING&#8217;</p>
<p>In an email to Reuters,the group claiming to be behind the New Years Eve hack called it &#8220;promising&#8221; that Snapchat was beginning to address its security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope they aren&#8217;t trying to downplay the situation once again and avoid the heat,but instead taking reasonable steps to secure sensitive user information,&#8221; Snapchat DB said. &#8220;Actions speak louder than words.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214953&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you tried talking a selfie with a DSLR? Well,it is tough to say the least.</p>
<p>What if you could take a selfie with your DSLR but using your iPhone? Sounds weird,right?</p>
<p>The MaxStone is a small coin-size device that fixes to most DSLR models and lets you control the camera using an iPhone app. So with the small MaxStone hanging from the camera you can use your <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/702400282/maxstone-iphone-your-camera" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b>iPhone to click</b></font></a> a selfie or a group photo with you in it. The app will also let you click long exposure and time lapse shots without shaking the camera.</p>
<p style="text-align:Right"> <img src="http://static.indianexpress.com/frontend/iep/story_images/micnandu01.jpg" align="Left" vspace="4" border="0" alt="MaxStone"> </p>
<p>There is more to this neat little device,created as a Kickstarter project by New York-based MaxMax Inc. With the MaxStone paired with the phone it can be used as a remote trigger for the iPhone camera as well. Plus,it can also be used to locate the phone when needed. This same feature alerts you if the camera,with the MacStone,attached it take beyond a certain distance of the phone.</p>
<p>The app can be used to control up to four cameras simultaneously,and that means you can take pictures of the same subject from multiple angles if you have so many cameras. The CR2032 battery should last at least six months.</p>
<p style="text-align:center"> <img src="http://static.indianexpress.com/frontend/iep/story_images/micnandu02.jpg" align="center" vspace="4" border="0" alt="MaxStone"> </p>
<p>The best thing about the device is the fact that it will cost upwards of $29,almost the same as a cheap remote trigger for your DSLR. The first units are expected to ship in March 2014. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Computer hackers posted online usernames and partial phone numbers of 4.6 million users of mobile photo-sharing service Snapchat,media reports said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A website called SnapchatDB.info made the information available for download,according to tech news site TechCrunch. </p>
<p>As on Wednesday night,the site SnapchatDB.info has been suspended.</p>
<p>In a statement to TecCrunch,SnapchatDB said that it got the information through a recently identified and patched Snapchat exploit and that it was making the data available in an effort to convince the messaging app to beef up its security.</p>
<p>With Snapchat,users can send photos and videos that disappear shortly after they are viewed and have been lately gaining popularity especially among young users.</p>
<p>Snapchat drew attention in November when reports emerged that it had turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook. The two-year old company has so far raised more than $123 million in funding.</p>
<p>Snapchat could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside of regular U.S. business hours.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214526&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The group also posts contact information of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer on its Twitter account.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214523&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Syrian Electronic Army,an amorphous hacker collective that supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,claimed credit on Wednesday for hacking into the social media accounts of Internet calling service Skype.</p>
<p>The group also posted the contact information of Steve Ballmer,Microsoft Corp&#8217;s retiring chief executive,on its Twitter account along with the message,&#8221;You can thank Microsoft for monitoring your accounts/emails using this details. #SEA&#8221;</p>
<p>That message was an apparent reference to revelations last year by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that Skype,which is owned by Microsoft,was part of the NSA&#8217;s program to monitor communications through some of the biggest U.S. Internet companies.</p>
<p>A message posted on Skype&#8217;s official Twitter feed on Wednesday,apparently by the hacking group,read: &#8220;Don&#8217;t use Microsoft emails (hotmail,outlook),They are monitoring your accounts and selling the data to the governments. More details soon. #SEA&#8221;</p>
<p>Similar messages were posted on Skype&#8217;s official Facebook pages and on a blog on its website before being taken down in late afternoon. The SEA later tweeted out copies of the message &#8220;for those who missed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Representatives for Microsoft could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The NSA&#8217;s practices essentially made Microsoft and other technology companies partners in government surveillance efforts against private citizens in the United States and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Last month Microsoft joined seven other top technology companies in pressing President Barack Obama to rein in the U.S. government&#8217;s electronic spying in a meeting at the White House.</p>
<p>Media companies,including the New York Times and the BBC,have repeatedly been targeted by the Syrian Electronic Army and other hacker activist groups that deface websites and take over Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>Obama and his national security team are trying to decide what recommendations to adopt from an outside panel&#8217;s review of the NSA&#8217;s activities.</p>
<p>A U.S. District judge in December ruled that the U.S. government&#8217;s gathering of Americans&#8217; phone records is likely unlawful and raised what he called &#8220;serious doubts&#8221; about the value of the so-called metadata counter-terrorism program.</p>
<p>A second federal judge ruled later in the month that the program was constitutional,raising the likelihood that the issue will be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>This week,a monitoring group said the death toll in Syria&#8217;s civil war,which began in March 2011 as peaceful protests against four decades of rule by Assad&#8217;s family,had risen to at least 130,000.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214523&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of mobile internet users in India seems all set for explosive growth with a report by Internet &amp; Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International predicting that there will be 155 million people accessing the web through their phones by the end of March. </p>
<p>With a quarter-over-quarter growth of 20%,this number is expected to cross 185 million by June 2014,says the Mobile Internet In India 2013 report released Wednesday. </p>
<p>According to the report,in October 2013,India had 110 million mobile internet users,with just 25 million in rural India. Urban Indias dominance of this segment is expected to continue for at least a couple of quarters.</p>
<p>Indicating that many Indians were accessing the internet for the first time on mobile devices,the report says across both urban and rural India over half the internet users where on the mobile. </p>
<p>One of the reasons for this increase in mobile internet penetration is the fact that the average cost per user fell to Rs 387 from Rs 460 in 2012,even though the actual per cent of data costs in mobile bills has gone up slightly from 43% to 45% over the past year. </p>
<p>The other reason is the falling costs of Internet enabled smart devices. In fact,a I-Cube Mobile Internet survey conducted in 35 cities in 2013 puts the median cost of web-enabled mobile phone at Rs 7,000 with 52% of mobile internet users owning devices priced between Rs 6,501 and Rs 14,000.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214293&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[At CES in Las Vegas,selling trends is a gamble for tech firms as the consumers gotten wiser and pickier<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214262&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a couple of days,tech journalists and analysts from around the world will start converging at Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show (CES),the largest such exposition in the world. Like most of the endeavours in the desert city that hosts CES every year,this expo is often a gamble for the large tech companies and small start-ups that vie for eyeballs there. Tech companies try to set the agenda for the rest of the year,launching their most-awaited devices. The start-ups hope their innovations will be picked up by journalists and written about,or just picked up by a larger company,which is even better. This year,the companies will showcase connected cars,smart homes,wearable devices and smarter smartphones,the only catch being that they did the same last year. </p>
<p>In the past few years,CES has not been able to underline what particular innovation or product would become one of the bigger trends of the year. It has tried to set the agenda for the tech year at the heavily-curated environs of the show and the resultant trends are often what the companies want you to think it will be. Often this is wishful thinking,which consumers don&#8217;t want anything to do with. The guy on the street,who finally buys the gadgets,now has a mind of his own. Pampered by smart but cheap devices,he is becoming more demanding. So,for all the trumpet blowing at CES,the tech firms actually have their fingers crossed,hoping this new product finally catches the fancy of buyers. With too many launches,and too many PR pitches queering the pitch in Vegas,larger players are now patronising smaller shows like the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona,the IFA in Berlin and the Computex in Taiwan. It is easier for them to connect with audience at these shows than at the melee that CES is slowly becoming.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214262&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google launched its Nexus 5 smartphone globally and much to our surprise,the company redeemed itself for the mistakes it made with Nexus 4 in India by bringing the latest Nexus much earlier than last time around (almost one year). The stock Android 4.4 KitKat version is the best way to differentiate between the experience on a Nexus device and other vendor branded devices. The latest Nexus 5 therefore is no different,and gives the experience that Google wants to offer to users on Android.</p>
<p>LG has flourished under the stewardship of Google for its Nexus devices,enabling it to iron out the flaws they have had in their previous smartphones. With Nexus 5,LG has taken the expectations to a whole new level. It is priced at R29,999 for the 16 GB version and R33,999 for the 32 GB phone.</p>
<p>So whats all the hoopla about Nexus 5 you may ask? For starters,it sports a five inch full high definition display,runs on the latest stock Android 4.4 KitKat OS,packs in a 2.2 GHz Snapdragon 800 CPU with 2 GB RAM and then the usual culprits8 megapixel rear and 1.2 megapixel front cameras,plenty of connectivity options and a 2300 mAh battery.</p>
<p>Not the most good looking smartphone,but its a definite step up from the glossy looks of the Nexus 4. That said with Nexus 5,you get a well-built sturdy device that comes with Corning Glass 3 display. During our usage,we found the display to be effective and even after some rough treatment the display refused to wither down. The full high definition display is bright,crisp and offers a colourful viewing experience. At 130 grams,the phone is a hair lighter than the Nexus 4,which weighs 139 grams.</p>
<p>The other change in Nexus 5 is the placement of speakers,which are now more conventionally placed at the bottom unlike at the rear as was the case in the Nexus 4. Stock Android version has its hits and misses. The performance is smooth but we did miss some applications that should have been pre-installed.</p>
<p>One really interesting thing is that Hangout is the default app for messaging and SMS on the Nexus 5. So one has to install an SMS app from the Play Store to get standalone SMS capability. Camera is a big improvement over Nexus 4,but it is still well short of other major devices in the market,most notably the Nokia Lumia 1020. But for the pricing,Nexus 5 offers images of credible quality. Imaging capability in real time is sluggish and the auto-focus and clicking images is not the smoothest ride though.</p>
<p>Battery life on the Nexus 5 is average and during normal usage,which we define as two hours of Web surfing and messaging,three hours on Wi-Fi,three-four hours on 3G and one hour of gaming,the smartphone lasted for little over half a day. Nothing to really boast about,but manageable. Google Voice feature deserves a mention,as it stands out for its effectiveness and accuracy. It is quick,effective and informative with any information delivered in no time.</p>
<p>In terms of raw performance the Nexus 5 scored 21754 on Antutu,7813 on Quadrant,13402 (Unlimited) on 3DMark and 1353 on Vellamo HTML5. The Nexus 4 on the other hand scored 16440,4245,7075 (extreme) and 1159 respectively. It clearly indicates that the Nexus 5 is a far better performer.</p>
<p>Overall,the Nexus 5 is a pure delight and ranks as one of the top smartphones in the market this year. LG has done it again; the product is a sure value-for-money. If an iPhone or Windows Phone device is not your cup of tea,then the Nexus 5 is a must have.</p>
<p><i>Estimated street price: Rs 29,999 (16 GB)</i></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214233&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of mobile Internet users in India seems all set for explosive growth with a report by Internet &amp; Mobile Association Of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International predicting that there will be 155 million people accessing the web through their phones by the end of March 2014. </p>
<p>With a quarter-over-quarter growth of 20 per cent,this number is expected to cross 185 million by June 2014,says the Mobile Internet In India 2013 report released Wednesday. According to the report,in October 2013,India had 110 million mobile internet users,with just 25 million in rural India. Urban India&#8217;s dominance of this segment is expected to continue for at least a couple of quarters. Indicating that many Indian&#8217;s were accessing the internet for the first time on mobile devices,the report says across both urban and rural India over half the Internet users where on the mobile.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the end the 4 did push out the incumbent 3,after all if had been there for 365 days. As predicted by us,the Google doodle for December 31 did transform to reveal 2014. The animated number are now on celebrating the New Year,complete with blaring speakers and a disco ball. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/googles-new-years-eve-doodle-will-transform.-you-can-bet-on-it/1213727/" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b>Google&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Eve doodle will transform. You can bet on it</b></font></a></p>
<p>Even last year,Google had marked the last day of 2012 with a doodle that finally morphed into another the next day. So while December 31,2012 was marked by a doodle of people partying hard,January 1,2013 showed the same scene almost empty with just the cleaners around. </p>
<p>This has been a recurring theme with Google&#8217;s doodles every New Year&#8217;s Eve since 2011. It is always the same doodle that transforms into another to mark the transition of the year. Before that,there was no tradition of having a special doodle on December 31,though the new year was always marked with one. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214119&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of volunteers from different parts of Assam have made an innovation of sorts by designing an Assamese word processor similar to the Microsoft Word with a spell checker and word suggestions to boot. </p>
<p>Named Jahnabi,the word processor has came as a boon for those who need help in writing the language and can be easily used by those with a rudimentary knowledge of Assamese.</p>
<p>&#8220;The website <a href="http://www.jahnabi.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.jahnabi.org</a> has received more than 60,000 hits and the free-of-cost software downloaded by more than 1,000 people since it was launched online on November 25 last,&#8221; says Mridul Kumar Sharmah,one of the members of the team.</p>
<p>The Unicode compliant software with a size of 7 mega bytes has at present nearly 2.5 lakh Assamese words and 108 readymade Assamese phrases in its dictionary and counting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The programming of the processor is based on dotnet platform and C# language containing around 15,000 lines of code,&#8221; Utpal Phukon,the only programmer in the Jahnabi team,said.</p>
<p>It took almost 25 days to complete the beta version of the software and the final software was designed in four months,he said.</p>
<p>The software contains automatic suggestions for words. Just type the alphabet K and all the words beginning with Ka would appear like Kalam and Kamal. There are also 600 Assamese idioms. The user has the option to create a shortcut for frequently used idioms. There is also a facility to add words to the user&#8217;s dictionary.</p>
<p>&#8220;If one types the alphabets K and M,words like Kamal and Kamtapur would be listed. All one has to do is click on the word which is required from the list. This makes it easy for people who do not have an in-depth knowledge of the language,&#8221; Sharmah said. </p>
<p>&#8220;The main aim to develop the processor is to popularise the Assamese language through Internet and social networking sites as most of the people in the state have rudimentary knowledge of the language due to reasons best known to them,&#8221; Sharmah said.</p>
<p>As for the vowel symbols which represent the long E,short E and the like,known as the swara sinha in Assamese,one has to type a double I for the vowel symbol representing a long E to appear and the alphabet O in capital for a long oo sound as in the word pool.</p>
<p>A list of what each letter of the English alphabet on a QWERTY keyboard corresponds to in Assamese has been given at the beginning to aid the writer.</p>
<p>&#8220;With more and more people using the computer on an everyday basis,writing mails and other articles in English is favoured.This advanced software tool,which also has a spell check in Assamese,was a long-felt need and we hope it will help in the learning of the Assamese,&#8221; Sharmah said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our group,which ranges from people aged between 25 and 42 years,we have a doctor,a teacher,a businessman,an engineer,an administrator,a student and others who worked in their free time with us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The software will be updated frequently with more and more words being incorporated.</p>
<p>Suggestions to make the software more user-friendly are also welcome,he said. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214106&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Snapchat,Vine,and Candy Crush Saga earned coveted spots on smartphones this year,making them among the most downloaded apps of the year.</p>
<p>There are more than a million apps on Apple Inc&#8217;s App Store and Google Inc&#8217;s Play store,the two dominant marketplaces for apps,which see billions of downloads each year.</p>
<p>This year,the most downloaded apps were new takes on communication,gaming,and entertainment,according to mobile app experts.</p>
<p>&#8220;2013 was a really interesting year in terms of maturation,milestones and new trends,&#8221; said Craig Palli,chief strategy officer at Fiksu,a mobile marketing company based in Boston.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most downloaded apps were in familiar categories,but offered new twists,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>While old favorites such as Instagram,Facebook and Twitter  available for iPhone,Android and other devices &#8211; continued to be popular ways of communicating with friends,Snapchat eclipsed them in downloads in 2013,becoming the sixth most downloaded free app of the year on the App Store,according to Apple.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snapchat went from being a niche app to achieving much more critical mass,so much so that Facebook was reportedly willing to spend billions of dollars to acquire the company,&#8221; said Palli.</p>
<p>With Snapchat,users can send photos and videos that disappear shortly after they are viewed.</p>
<p>Launched in 2011,the app&#8217;s user base continued to grow rapidly in 2013,with over 13 million people using the app in October,according to the lastest available estimates from global information and measurement company Nielsen. In December alone,over 400 million pieces of content were shared through the app,according to Snapchat,based in Venice,CA.</p>
<p>Vine,a video sharing app released earlier this year by microblogging company Twitter Inc (TWTR.N),was the fourth most downloaded free app in 2013. The app,for iPhone,Android and other devices,allows users to share videos under six seconds in length. Nielsen estimates over 6 million people in the US were using the app in October of this year.</p>
<p>Snapchat and Vine fall into a category that mobile analytics firm Flurry calls camera-enhanced messaging,which they said grew eightfold in 2013.</p>
<p>&#8220;The communications category underwent phenomenal growth this year. Messaging apps like Snapchat,Line,Kakao (KakaoTalk) and WeChat are all exploding and becoming bigger than the carriers in their home countries in terms of users,&#8221; said Simon Khalaf,chief executive of San Francisco-based company Flurry.</p>
<p>CRUSHING SAGA</p>
<p>Games were another popular category,with Candy Crush Saga for iPhone,Android and Kindle Fire securing its position as the top downloaded free app,and as the top revenue grossing app. It has been downloaded over 500 million times since its launch last year,according to its creator King,based in the UK. Nielsen estimates that over 20 million people in the US were playing the game in October of this year.</p>
<p>In the entertainment category,Pandora continued to be the leading way to stream music and was the ninth most downloaded,and third top grossing,app in 2013.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly the device has swallowed radio,&#8221; said Palli. &#8220;Despite the new entrants,Pandora remains the dominant player in the space,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>But the biggest trend of 2013,according to Palli,is the emergence of apps as a way to control companion devices,which he believes will continue to grow in 2014.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day,apps that pair with devices were among some of the top downloaded apps on the App Store.</p>
<p>The Fitbit app,for iPhone and Android,pairs with an electronic wristband to track metrics such as steps taken,distance traveled,and calories burned. It was the 16th most downloaded app on December 25,according to Palli,who monitored the Apple rankings.</p>
<p>Other apps that pair with devices,such as Chromecast,UP by Jawbone,and GoPro were also among the top downloads that day.</p>
<p>Khalaf predicts that apps for televisions will be the trend to watch for 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think 2014 could be the year the TV industry gets disrupted by mobile,&#8221; said Khalaf.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think about it,every American spends $100+ dollars per month on a service that is not personalized and not mobile. It&#8217;s an area that&#8217;s ripe for disruption and I think someone will come up with new content,maybe a new device and more importantly a better business model.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214096&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this age of instantaneous knowledge,what was funny in the morning is old news by night. This year,it felt like we encountered a brand new,need-to-watch YouTube video about more than once everyday. These 5 videos were shared more often than any others this year- they made us laugh,they made us cry,they made us watch them over and over again.</p>
<p>1. Emotional Baby Cries at Mom&#8217;s Singing (28,738,666 views)</p>
<p><iframe width="400" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nIsCs9_-LP8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>An emotional baby girl named Mary Lynne Leroux reacts to her mother Amandas singing by crying her eyes out. The baby was only ten months old when this video was taken,but she seems to really feel all the emotions in that song (My Heart Cant Tell You No).</p>
<p>2. What does the fox say? (312,748,863 views)</p>
<p><iframe width="400" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jofNR_WkoCE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The band Ylvis still doesn&#8217;t know what the fox says,but the viral hit exploring that question has been named YouTube&#8217;s top trending video of 2013.</p>
<p>3. Harlem shake (26,384,116 views)</p>
<p><iframe width="400" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/384IUU43bfQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The online viral video craze that started in February this year is a dance craze that took over the world post Psy&#8217;s retirement of &#8220;Gangnam Style&#8221;. The Harlem Shake,which originated in New York City over 30 years ago is an alchoholic hip shake dance.</p>
<p>4.Twerking girl on fire ( 15,037,218 views)</p>
<p><iframe width="400" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/CddMD3QqTFs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>In this internet viral hit a girl is seen twerking upside down on a door when her flatmate walks in through,which leads to a fiery carnage as she smashes through a glass table with candles.</p>
<p>5. I quit job resignation ( 17,181,632 views)</p>
<p><iframe width="400" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ew_tdY0V4Zo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This video was created by a 25-year-old American,which was used as her resignation. She can be seen dancing around her deserted office to a Kayne West song.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1213849&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smartphones have become smarter over the years,but they have not yet been able to get a fix on how to make batteries last as long as they should. Over the past year or so people have been carrying extra power in battery packs that go wherever their devices go. Things could change in the New Year. </p>
<p>US-based mobile device accessories company  Lepow International is all set to launch new 2-in-1 magnetic power banks and phone cases at 2014 International CES. Its two new models,Pixels and Pie,feature 3000mAh power capacity with a magnetized connection between the power bank and case. The new cases will be available for Samsung Galaxy S3,Note 2,HTC,and Apple iPhone 5 and iPad Mini. </p>
<p>CEO Jacky Fan says their power bank and phone cases are easily attached using the magnetic plate that is on both of the items. &#8220;Additionally,both models come in stylish fashion colors,allowing the user to choose the combination of colors that match his or her style.</p>
<p>Unlike one-piece smartphone case chargers,these new models allow users to remove the extra battery and reduce weight when needed. The covers come with LED lights that on a shake show how much power is left. </p>
<p>The Lepow Pixels and Pie power banks and phone cases will be available online for $79.99.</p>
<p>CES is the world&#8217;s largest technology show.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1213756&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is that time of the year. When one thing gives way to the other. So Google&#8217;s animated doodle for December 31,2013,is one that will in a few hours change to usher in the New Year. Rest assured that the numbers will change,with the four coming in place of 3 when the clock strikes 12. </p>
<p>Even last year,Google had marked the last day of 2012 with a doodle that finally morphed into another the next day. So while December 31,2012 was marked by a doodle of people partying hard,January 1,2013 showed the same scene almost empty with just the cleaners around. </p>
<p>This has been a recurring theme with Google&#8217;s doodles every New Year&#8217;s Eve since 2011. It is always the same doodle that transforms into another to mark the transition of the year. Before that,there was no tradition of having a special doodle on December 31,though the new year was always marked with one. </p>
<p>Here is a look at doodles over many years. </p>
<p><b>Doodle for 2012-13</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samsung said a 110-inch TV that has four times the resolution of standard high-definition TVs is going on sale for about $150,000 in South Korea.</p>
<p>The launch of the Samsung 110-inch TV giant television set on Monday reflects global TV makers&#8217; move toward ultra HD TVs,as manufacturing bigger TVs using OLED proves too costly.</p>
<p>Last year,Samsung and rival LG Electronics,the world&#8217;s top two TV makers,touted OLED as the future of TV. OLED screens are ultrathin and can display images with enhanced clarity and deeper color saturation.</p>
<p>But Samsung and LG failed to make OLED TVs a mainstream that would replace the LCD television sets and still struggling to mass produce larger and affordable TVs with OLED. </p>
<p>Meanwhile,Japanese media reported last week that Sony Corp. and Panasonic Corp. decided to end their OLED partnership.</p>
<p>Demand for U-HD TVs is expected to rise despite dearth of content while its price will likely come down faster than that of the OLED TVs. Much of the growth is forecast to come from China,a major market for the South Korean TV makers. Chinese TV makers have been making a push into the U-HD TV market as well.</p>
<p>According to NPD DisplaySearch,global sales of ultra-HD TV sets will surge from 1.3 million this year to 23 million in 2017. More than half of the shipments will be taken by Chinese companies between 2013 and 2017,according to NPD.</p>
<p>While Chinese TV makers have been seeking to boost sales of U-HD TVs with a lower price and a smaller size,Samsung&#8217;s strategy is to go bigger with a higher price tag. Samsung&#8217;s 110-inch U-HD TV measures 2.6 meters by 1.8 meters. It will be available in China,the Middle East and Europe. In South Korea,the TV is priced at 160 million won ($152,000) while prices in other countries vary.</p>
<p>Samsung said it received 10 orders for the latest premium TVs from the Middle East. Previously,the largest U-HD TV made by Samsung was 85-inch measured diagonally.</p>
<p>The ultra-HD TVs are also known as &#8220;4K&#8221; because they contain four times more pixels than an HD TV.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1213364&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed a new technique which can recover the faces of bystanders from reflections in the eyes of photographic subjects,an advance that could help identify criminals.</p>
<p>As the most commonly photographed objects are faces,there is potential in mining detailed facial images for hidden information,researchers said.</p>
<p>Until now,photographers might reasonably have assumed that their own face was absent from the image. But research,led by Dr Rob Jenkins from University of York overturns this assumption.</p>
<p>By zooming in on high-resolution passport-style photographs,Jenkins and co-researcher,Christie Kerr from the University of Glasgow were able to recover the faces of bystanders from reflections in the eyes of photographic subjects.</p>
<p>The recovered bystander images could be identified accurately by observers,despite their low resolution.</p>
<p>To establish whether these bystanders could be identified from the reflection images,the researchers presented them as stimuli in a face-matching task.</p>
<p>Observers who were unfamiliar with the bystanders&#8217; faces performed at 71 per cent accuracy while participants who were familiar with the faces performed at 84 per cent accuracy.</p>
<p>In a test of spontaneous recognition,observers could reliably name a familiar face from an eye reflection image.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pupil of the eye is like a black mirror. To enhance the image,you have to zoom in and adjust the contrast.</p>
<p>&#8220;A face image that is recovered from a reflection in the subject&#8217;s eye is about 30,000 times smaller than the subject&#8217;s face. Our findings thus highlight the remarkable robustness of human face recognition,as well as the untapped potential of high-resolution photography,&#8221; Jenkins said.</p>
<p>The researchers say that in crimes in which the victims are photographed,such as hostage taking or child sex abuse,reflections in the eyes of the photographic subject could help to identify perpetrators.</p>
<p>Images of people retrieved from cameras seized as evidence during criminal investigations may be used to piece together networks of associates or to link individuals to particular locations.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Plos One. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1212374&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Yahoo Weather for iPad</p>
<p>Free</b></p>
<p>Earlier this year,Yahoo launched its Weather app for iPhones. The app is a visual treat and showed how weather information can be displayed in an eye-pleasing format. This month,Yahoo launched the same app optimised for iPads. Even though the app makes the most of the iPad&#8217;s large display,its performance leaves a lot to be desired. When scrolling up or down,there is a noticeable lag. The smooth transitions between various weather data,such as temperature,forecasts,wind,etc that are seen on the iPhone version,are missing in the iPad variant. Transitions are choppy and make for a terrible user experience. The app was tested on an iPad Air,which is the best iPad in the market. I checked the App Store to make sure that I wasn&#8217;t the only one facing the issue and found three reviews complaining of choppy animations. This is very disappointing,considering that the iPhone version of the same app won Apple&#8217;s design award earlier this year. Apple had said,Yahoo! Weather has great layout and typography,compelling animations,fast image processing,and clear iconography. This attention to detail means that in a saturated category,an app can rise above the crowd.</p>
<p>The iPad variant has all the makings of an excellent weather app. Rain forecast information has a great animation that shows raindrops blending with rain icons. Great effects can be seen for wind and sunrise,sunset timings. Yahoo has paid attention to all details but the most crucial one  transitions. Let&#8217;s hope that this is fixed in future iterations.</p>
<p><b>Facebook Messenger</p>
<p>iOS,Android</p>
<p>Free</b></p>
<p>Over the past couple of months,Facebook has revamped and polished its Messenger app. Messenger makes it easy to message Facebook users,whether who are not your friends if you have their telephone number. Recent updates to Messenger have given it an iOS 7 design and have integrated it tightly with the Facebook app. If you have both apps installed,everytime you open chats on the Facebook app,it redirects you quickly to the Messenger app. From Messenger,two taps can take you to a user&#8217;s Facebook profile. The switch feels intuitive. When you are in a conversation,tap their profile picture to access their timeline or call them. </p>
<p>Facebook Messenger has come a long way in the past two months. New stickers by Chumbak add a distinctively Indian feel to chats. The app&#8217;s refinement is evident in the way it handles messages. When you send a message,it is slightly transparent while sending and becomes opaque when it has been sent. This is a nice touch,as opposed to the icons,loading bars or sent text seen in other apps.</p>
<p>Having said that,there are some things that need improvement. When an app is read by your friend,you will see seen written under the message. It would be nice to have a non-text way to convey this. Developers have managed to do the same for sending and sent. Another minor annoyance is the sent from Messenger text that appears when you&#8217;re chatting with a friend who has also installed Messenger. This should be removed as a blue icon on the avatar indicates that they are on Messenger. Another problem is the delay between notifications and messages appearing in the iPhone app. Many times,I saw messages in notifications on the lockscreen,but when I opened FB Messenger,it took a few seconds to show those messages. The app showed a connecting message during the delay. I&#8217;ve noticed this in many iOS apps,so I&#8217;m guessing that this is an OS issue as opposed to an app bug.</p>
<p><i>Note: We tested FB Messenger version 3.1.1 on an iPhone 5S and Yahoo Weather version 1.5.1 on an iPad Air. At the time of testing,these were the latest builds available on the App Store. We checked for updates before filing the story. However,developers may have launched new features or fixed bugs by the time you read this.</i></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1212360&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft India today said it is introducing Guardian,a new safety application (app),available exclusively for Windows phone users in India.</p>
<p>Incidents such as &#8216;Nirbhaya&#8217; prompted the global IT giant to come out with an app aiming at protecting women,Microsoft IT India Managing Director Raj Biyani said.</p>
<p>Explaining its features,Biyani said Guardian enables users to switch on a &#8216;track me&#8217; feature in the app that lets friends and family track them in real time using Microsoft Windows Azure cloud services and Bing Map APIs.</p>
<p>Guardian users can call for help through an &#8216;SOS&#8217; alert button and also connect to security agencies,police and hospitals easily via this app in times of distress.</p>
<p>The app was developed over six months by a group of enthusiastic Microsoft employees in India,within the Microsoft Garage. Microsoft Garage is a global employee innovation initiative that gives Microsoft employees an outlet to explore ideas in their free time,Biyani said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our employees wanted to do something to enable people to feel safer in our cities. So they used their spare time to develop Guardian. It is a robust personal security app with more safety features and capabilities than any other comparable app available to Indian smartphone users today,&#8221; Biyani told reporters after launching the App.</p>
<p>To use Guardian effectively,users need to add the names of friends,family members and security groups to the settings and in an emergency situation,the app can be used to alert them,via the SOS button. All the user has to do is tap the SOS button,a Microsoft official said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The phone then sends a distress SMS to all buddy mobiles,notifying them of the emergency along with location details. At the same time the SOS button also sends emails to buddy email IDs and posts to private Facebook groups,if registered,&#8221; the official said.</p>
<p>Guardian uses Microsoft Windows Azure cloud services and Bing Map APIs extensively and can help security authorities and medical teams track the user. The phone can be traced even if it is broken. The application is capable of one touch video recording that may be used later as evidence,the official added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1211959&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Taiwanese authorities today slapped a fine of 20 million Taiwanese dollar (USD 667,000) on US tech giant Apple for violating a fair trade law over local iPhone pricing. </p>
<p>The Fair Trade Commission said an Apple unit in charge of Taiwan sales had interfered in the pricing and mobile phone payment rates of three local telecom service providers,despite selling them the distribution rights to the phones.</p>
<p>It said investigations found that Chunghwa Telecom,Far Eastone Telecommunication and Taiwan Mobile had submitted their pricing plans to Apple for approval or confirmation before new models hit the market,while Apple had also asked the Taiwanese companies to change or adjust prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple deprived the telecom operators of liberty to decide on the prices based on their own cost structures and competitive market situation,to restrict competition &#8230; and violate the fair trade law,&#8221; the commission said in a statement,urging Apple to immediately stop its illegal actions.</p>
<p>Apple,which can appeal the ruling,could face an additional fine of up to 50 million Taiwanese dollar if it fails to comply,the commission said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1211640&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A NASA spacecraft has sent holiday greetings from the outer solar system.</p>
<p>The space agency yesterday released dazzling new images of the ringed planet Saturn and its moons. The Cassini spacecraft took the pictures earlier this year.</p>
<p>Saturn resembled an ornament in one image,with a jet stream swirling at its north pole along with a hurricane-like storm.</p>
<p>Cassini also peered through the hazy atmosphere of Saturn&#8217;s largest moon,Titan,revealing hydrocarbon lakes. The icy Saturn moon Enceladus appears as a white snowball.</p>
<p>Cassini,funded by NASA and the European and Italian space agencies,was launched in 1997. The spacecraft reached Saturn in 2004 and has been studying the planet and its many moons.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1211558&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With its third flagship smartphone in half a year,Gionee seems to be going for the kill. The Chinese mobile manufacturing,design and R&amp;D company has announced its new smartphone,the ELIFE E7,powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor and Android based operating system AMIGO 2.0.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BenQ and other projector makers have constantly been trying ,to push up the lamp life of projectors. The company has now announced a new range of SmartEco Technology Projectors with four models &#8212; MS504,MX505,MS521P and MX522P &#8212; designed for small- to medium-sized spaces. </p>
<p><b>What is new:</b> Users will now get up to 10000 hrs lamp life,which will add up to about 10+ years of projection. There will be up to 80 per cent lamp power savings on electricity consumption,thereby reducing replacement costs by half.  A 3000 ANSI Lumens projection lamp ensures the best viewing quality for naturally lit environments or large venues. A &#8220;no source detected&#8221; mode automatically lowers brightness to a third when no display has been detected for more than three minutes. </p>
<p style="text-align:Right"> <img src="http://static.indianexpress.com/frontend/iep/story_images/benqzulfidec24.jpg" align="center" vspace="4" border="0" alt="BenQ"> </p>
<p><b>What else is there: </b>The MS521P and MX522P,feature direct 3D Blu-ray compatibility by HDMI cable while the MS504 and MX505 deliver stereoscopic 3D-ready projection. The MS504 and MX505 projectors add an audio pass-through function when teachers require only sound,while the projectors&#8217; teaching templates enable presenters to write on whiteboards without the need to draw lines. The new projectors feature high contrast ratio of 13000:1 and BenQ&#8217;s Colorific image quality to provide users with accurate,crisp,and long lasting color. </p>
<p><i><b>Price:</b> MS504 (Rs28,000),MS521P (Rs 30,000) MX505 (Rs 35,000) and MX522P (Rs 40,000)</i></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1211170&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Cook.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1210819&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple Inc enthusiasts across the globe are in for a treat as the iconic creator of iPhone (latest in market being the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c) smartphone and iPad tablet has &#8220;big plans&#8221; lined up for the next year,indicates Timothy D. Cook. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot to look forward to in 2014,including some big plans that we think customers are going to love,&#8221; Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook said in a letter to its employees.</p>
<p>Extending greetings for the Christmas and the New Year,Cook said,&#8221;This holiday season,tens of millions of people around the world,from all walks of life,are experiencing Apple products for the first time.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/carsearch" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b>What does you dream car cost? Check price</b></font></a></p>
<p>He expressed &#8220;pride&#8221; on the stellar performance by the California-headquartered firm in 2013. </p>
<p>&#8220;We introduced industry-leading products in each of our major categories in 2013,showing the breadth and depth of innovation at Apple,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>During the year,the company extended its leadership in the smartphone market with the launch of iPhone 5s and 5c,besides,unveiling the latest version of its operating system,iOS 7.</p>
<p>It also released the latest version of operating system for its PCs and servers (OS X Mavericks) free to its customers,while introducing the iPad Air and the iPad mini with Retina display.</p>
<p>Last week,Apple began shipping the latest version of its laptop,Mac Pro,from a manufacturing facility in Austin,Texas (the US).</p>
<p>In 2013,Apple App Store marked its 50 billionth download,Cook added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together we&#8217;ve shown the world that innovation at Apple goes beyond our products to the way we do business&#8230; I consider myself the luckiest person in the world for the opportunity to work at this amazing company with all of you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In India too,Apple saw iPhone sales beating all expectations to soar 400 per cent in the April-June 2013 quarter. </p>
<p>Earlier this year,Cook had hinted that Apple had lots of products lined up in 2014 including some new product segments.</p>
<p>In a conference call with investors following the firm&#8217;s fourth quarter earnings,Cook said consumers would &#8220;see exciting new products from us in the fall and across 2014.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of new product categories specifically,if you look at the skills that Apple has from hardware/software and services,and the incredible app ecosystem,this set of things is very unique. No one has a set of skills like this.</p>
<p>&#8220;We obviously believe that we can use our skills at building other great products that are in categories that represent areas that we do not participate today. We&#8217;re pretty confident about that,&#8221; he had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1210819&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first humanoid robot in space with speech capability made small talk with a Japanese astronaut and said it had no problem with zero gravity on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Footage released by the robot&#8217;s developers on Friday showed Kirobo performing its first mission on the station,talking in Japanese with astronaut Koichi Wakata to test its autonomous conversation functions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/picture-gallery/first-humanoid-robot-in-space-chats-with-astronaut/4160-1.html" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b>PHOTOS: First humanoid robot in space chats with astronaut</b></font></a></p>
<p>Wakata says he&#8217;s glad to meet Kirobo,and asks the robotic companion how it feels about being in a zero-gravity environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m used to it now,no problem at all,&#8221; Kirobo quips. </p>
<p>Kirobo is programmed to process questions and select words from its vocabulary to construct an answer,instead of giving pre-programmed responses to specific questions.</p>
<p>The creator of the robot,Tomotaka Takahashi,said the autonomous functions meant nobody knew how well Kirobo would be able to answer Wakata&#8217;s questions.</p>
<p>Though Kirobo had some awkward pauses and Wakata spoke more slowly than usual at times in their chat earlier this month,Takahashi said conversations smoothed out over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through layers of communication,we were able to observe the initial stages of a relationship begin to develop between a human and a robot,and I think that was our biggest success&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>NASA says its Robonaut 2 was the first humanoid robot ever to fly in space. The torso-only robot without legs has been on the International Space Station since 2011.</p>
<p>Kirobo took off from Japan&#8217;s Tanegashima Space Center for the International Space Station this summer aboard a space cargo transporter. Wakata arrived in November and will assume command of the station in March.</p>
<p>The project is a joint endeavour between advertising company Dentsu,automaker Toyota,and Takahashi at the University of Tokyo&#8217;s Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology.</p>
<p>Experiments with Kirobo will continue until it returns to Earth at the end of 2014.</p>
<p>In the meantime,Kirobo says he wants to ask Santa for a toy rocket this Christmas.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1210766&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple and China Mobile announced a long-anticipated agreement today to bring the iPhone to the world&#8217;s biggest phone company.</p>
<p>The deal might help to boost iPhone sales in a market where Apple Inc. faces intense competition. The iPhone already is available in China through two smaller carriers but the latest deal links it with a bigger network and state-owned China Mobile Ltd.&#8217;s marketing power.</p>
<p>The iPhone is popular with Chinese customers who can afford it but it has been eclipsed by lower-priced smartphones from Samsung and local brands.</p>
<p>The iPhone 5S and 5C will go on sale in Apple and China Mobile stores beginning Friday,January 17. China Mobile customers can register for phones starting Wednesday.</p>
<p>The companies didn&#8217;t announce pricing or the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p>The deal comes a month before China&#8217;s Lunar New Year holiday in late January,a big gift-buying season. That &#8220;will provide an immediate boost to Apple&#8217;s share in China,&#8221; said analyst Nicole Peng of Canalys,a research firm.</p>
<p>Forecasts of possible increased iPhone sales under a deal with China Mobile vary widely,from 10 million to 40 million. </p>
<p>A key issue is whether it leads to additional sales or only prompts existing users to switch to China Mobile.</p>
<p>The iPhone will help China Mobile promote a new fourth-generation network that received government approval this month. But analysts say Apple needed the agreement more than the Chinese carrier. That gave China Mobile leverage in negotiations over how to split costs,which for the high-priced iPhone usually includes subsidising handset sales.</p>
<p>The iPhone faces tough competition from cheaper smartphones running Google&#8217;s Android software. Collectively,Android phones far outsell Apple&#8217;s iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook told the official Xinhua News Agency in January that he expects China to surpass the United States as its biggest market. About 50 million iPhones have been sold in China in the past 2 and a half years,according to analyst estimates.</p>
<p>China Mobile has more than 750 million mobile accounts. However,a survey by Bernstein Research said some China Mobile customers use smaller carriers for data service. Apple already has agreements with China Telecom Ltd. and China Unicom Ltd.,which have about 455 million mobile accounts.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s share of China&#8217;s smartphone sales declined to 6.2 per cent in the third quarter from 7.9 per cent a year earlier,according to Canalys.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese device maker Lenovo wants to be known as a PC+ brand in the marketplace. Acutely aware that the PC market is fast dwindling and there is a strong customer demand for new-age mobility devices such as smartphones,tablets and convertibles,this $34-billion Beijing-headquartered company has rolled out an aggressive business strategy in order to drive revenues in what it calls the PC Plus segment. A strong performance in the second fiscal quarter ended September 30,2013 is proof that Lenovos transformation strategy is playing out well,but more on it later. First,a look at its new-found aggression to improve the market share in India.</p>
<p>Lenovo has identified India as a high growth market for the companys future growth,says Amar Babu,managing director,Lenovo India. The market worldwide has trended towards smartphones and India is no exception,as the young and tech-savvy people are opting for the latest devices that can perform multiple functions. We are looking at product expansion and focused marketing to strengthen our market in India.</p>
<p>Last week,Lenovo introduced its stylish and sleek smartphonethe Vibe X. It sports features comparable to those of a high-end superphone such as the face orientation rotation feature,the smart call feature,the Smart swipe,the pocket mode,etc,but is attractively priced at R25,999. Globally,we have emerged as the No. 4 smartphone brand. In India,we have made an interesting beginning and we expect our growth trajectory to continue with the introduction of newer models, says Amar,responsible for driving the overall business and growth of the brand in India.</p>
<p>Lenovo forayed into Indias fast-growing smartphone segment last year and has since introduced a slew of mobile phones,tablets and convertibles in the market. It is targeting the entire spectrum of the market top level,premium segment,middle segment and the entry-level segment. Lenovo expects to garner 5% share of the smartphone market in the country in the next few years. It intends to launch a number of devices to consolidate its presence in the Indian market. After a detailed study of the consumer requirements,we aim to address the major mobility demands of the country, he adds.</p>
<p>The Indian smartphone market grew by 229% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2013,according to research firm,IDC. Vendors shipped a total of 12.8 million smartphones in Q3FY13 compared to 3.8 million units in the same period of 2012. Q3FY13 grew by close to 28% over the units shipped in the second quarter of 2013. IDC has revised the Q2FY2013 numbers for smartphones from 9.3 million to 10.02 million.</p>
<p>The growth in the smartphone market continues to drive the overall growth numbers for the phone marketgiven that theres still a huge potential for smartphone penetration in India,this trend is expected to continue in the coming quarters, says Manasi Yadav,senior market analyst with IDC India.</p>
<p>According to CyberMedia Research,Lenovo has figured for the first time amongst the top three India tablet PC vendors in its recent survey. Tablet shipments in July-September 2013 touched 1.20 million units,recording a growth of 9% year-on-year and a modest 4.7% increase quarter-on-quarter. Lenovo notched up a market share of 13.3% in tablet shipments in Q3,2013.  </p>
<p>Globally,Lenovo continues to </p>
<p>diversify its business and build a strong foundation for the future in the PC Plus era with robust performance in PCs and mobile devices like tablets and smartphones. The company posted a record 29 million devices sold in the second fiscal quarter ended September 30,2013 which is about four devices every second. Lenovos second quarter mix of sales from mobile internet and digital home (MIDH) products,which includes smartphones,smart TV and much its tablet business,was 15% of total revenues ($9.8 billion),up from 8% one year ago and 4% two years ago,with steadily improving profitability.</p>
<p>In fact,Lenovo ranked second in combined PC and tablet shipments,and was the third-largest supplier of smart connected devices,which includes PC,smartphone and tablet products,growing shipments 36% year-over-year. Lenovos combined shipments of smartphones and tablets surpassed those of PCs for the second quarter in a row. It also continued to be the worlds fourth largest smartphone supplier,rapidly expanding shipments 78% year-over-year. Finally,Lenovo had a record high of 2.3 million global tablet shipments,up 4.2 times year-over-year,driven by sales outside China. Together,these results show Lenovos rapid ongoing transformation into a PC Plus company.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1210561&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The price of latest BlackBerry handsets are expected to fall further as the Canadian smartphone maker plans more sales incentives to distributors and operators for pushing the sales of its BB10 devices.</p>
<p>In order to improve sales and stimulate global demand for BlackBerry 10 devices,the company executed marketing campaigns and reduced the price on new shipments of BlackBerry 10 smartphones during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2014,the company said in an SEC filing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company plans to implement further sales incentives with its carrier and distributor partners to increase sell-through,which could be applicable to all BlackBerry 10 devices shipped in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2014,&#8221; the company said in the filing.</p>
<p>The smartphone maker suffered huge loss of USD 4.4 billion in its third quarter ended November 30,mainly due to unsold handsets,</p>
<p>&#8220;The company can no longer reasonably estimate the amount of the potential sales incentives that may be offered on certain BlackBerry devices in future periods,resulting in revenues for BlackBerry 10 devices,and BlackBerry 7 devices in certain regions,&#8221; the filing said.</p>
<p>BlackBerry lowered price of its high-priced handset in India,BlackBerry Q10,to about Rs 40,000 from Rs 45,000. The device is available for about Rs 36,000 through online stores.</p>
<p>In February,the company launched its full-touch screen smartphone BlackBerry Z10 for about Rs 43,500 which is now available in the Indian market at about 40 per cent less price of Rs 25,000.</p>
<p>BlackBerry also said the &#8216;sell-through levels&#8217; for BlackBerry 10 devices decreased during the second quarter of fiscal 2014,causing the number of BlackBerry 10 devices in the channel to increase above the company&#8217;s expectations.</p>
<p>The smartphone maker has to cancel plans to launch two devices to mitigate inventory risk,it said.</p>
<p>BlackBerry recorded a primarily non-cash,pre-tax charge against inventory and supply commitments of approximately USD 1.6 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and this charge was primarily attributable to its BlackBerry 10 devices.</p>
<p>During the third quarter,the company sold approximately 4.3 million smartphones to end customers. Of the total smartphones sold,approximately 3.2 million were BlackBerry 7 devices which include models like BlackBerry Curve,Bold,Torch etc.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1210534&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[BlackBerry said it hoped to expand the relationship with FoxConn to its top-of-the-line smartphones.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1210219&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BlackBerry Ltd said on Friday it was entering a handset production deal that lowers the risk it will have to take more massive writedowns on unsold smartphones,and its shares surged even though it posted dismal quarterly results.</p>
<p>The stock rose as much as 17 percent after the company announced the five-year partnership with Taiwan&#8217;s Foxconn Technology Co Ltd,which will initially build low-end devices for sale in Indonesia and other emerging markets. BlackBerry said it hoped to expand the fledgling relationship to its top-of-the-line smartphones.</p>
<p>The deal is unconventional in that BlackBerry will no longer pay upfront for components used in the devices made on its behalf in Foxconn&#8217;s Indonesian and Mexican factories.</p>
<p>Instead,Foxconn will take a share of profit on each device in return for taking on inventory management,which can result in writedowns if smartphones go unsold. Foxconn will also help with developing,designing and distributing the handsets.</p>
<p>Chief Executive John Chen,who took the helm at BlackBerry last month,said he expected the Foxconn deal to help BlackBerry&#8217;s handset business turn cash-flow positive,and for the company as a whole to post a profit for the fiscal year that begins in early 2015.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost like BlackBerry is disposing of its consumer handset business without actually disposing of it,&#8221; said Jefferies analyst Peter Misek,who likened the deal to what Hewlett-Packard Co and Dell have done with laptops.</p>
<p>The move,which comes a month after BlackBerry said it was giving up on a plan to sell itself,helped take the sting out of the massive,$4.4 billion loss that it posted for the quarter ended November 30,as smartphone sales shriveled.</p>
<p>A new line of devices running on BlackBerry 10 software has failed to gain traction,forcing the company to write off $1.6 billion of inventory and supply commitments for the quarter. The previous quarter it wrote off $934 million for unsold phones.</p>
<p>The Waterloo,Ontario-based company pioneered the concept of on-the-go email,and for years its pagers and phones were must-have devices for political and business leaders. But in recent years it has lost its once-dominant market share to Apple Inc&#8217;s iPhone and a slew of smartphones powered by Google Inc&#8217;s (GOOG.O) Android operating system.</p>
<p>As of Thursday&#8217;s close,the stock had fallen 47 percent this year. It was last trading up 14 percent on Nasdaq at $7.13.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most immediate challenge for the company is how to transition the devices operations to a more profitable business model,&#8221; said Chen,who is credited with turning around Sybase,a database and mobile software company,before it was sold to German software company SAP AG in 2010.</p>
<p>Chen has said he is counting on strong growth in BlackBerry&#8217;s service business,which manages smartphone traffic on the internal networks of corporate and government clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just jettisoning all the stuff and driving on with the part of the business that makes money makes a heck of a lot of sense to me and that is very clearly where Chen is going,&#8221; said Ross Healy,a portfolio manager at Macnicol &amp; Associates who owns a small number of BlackBerry shares.</p>
<p>Carolina Milanesi,an analyst at Kantar Comtech,said the deal is a good move for Foxconn,the world&#8217;s largest electronic parts manufacturer and a major partner of Apple Inc.</p>
<p>&#8220;This might be the first step for them to try and diversify,and experiment with putting their brand on the products they make,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>DEVICES ARE A CHALLENGE</p>
<p>In his first presentation to analysts after the release of BlackBerry&#8217;s results,Chen struck an upbeat tone tempered with a heavy dose of realism. The mix may have helped soothe nervous investors who had sharply lowered their expectations for BlackBerry after a string of disappointing news.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that he&#8217;s not the old guard,he&#8217;s not there trying to do what Lazaridis and Thorsten were up to. He&#8217;s actually been taking some concrete steps,&#8221; said Mark McKechnie,an analyst at Evercore Partners,referring to BlackBerry&#8217;s founder Mike Lazaridis and Thorsten Heins,Chen&#8217;s predecessor.</p>
<p>Chen moved quickly to stamp his authority on BlackBerry,hiring several former colleagues from his time at Sybase and SAP for senior roles in corporate strategy,marketing,and enterprise strategy,a key unit in the stripped-back company.</p>
<p>BlackBerry sold about 4.3 million handsets in the third quarter,with older BlackBerry 7 models accounting for about 3.2 million of that number.</p>
<p>The company recognized hardware revenue on 1.9 million devices,down from 3.7 million in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>On a brighter note,its cash pile grew to $3.2 billion from $2.6 billion a quarter earlier,but that included $1 billion raised by issuing convertible notes to a group of investors last month after calling off a months-long search for a buyer.</p>
<p>Service revenue slipped 13 percent as fewer people paid to use BlackBerry&#8217;s secure network,and the company said that level of decline could be expected to continue.</p>
<p>Along with the writedown on unsold phones,the company also slashed by $2.7 billion the carrying value of some long-lived assets,mostly licensing deals made when it was far larger.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1210219&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are in the market for luxury audio systems for your home,then price is unlikely to be a barrier. Smart Group,which provides home automation solutions,has launched Everest DD66000 speakers for this market. Made by JBL,this premium speaker system costs Rs 1 crore.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s new: Smart Group says the speaker system can handle all genres of music and is targeted at audiophiles. The company claims that these speakers have authoritative bass,a pure,detailed midrange and open,extended high-frequency response beyond 50kHz. The speakers are supposed to be able to reproduce the sonic environment present on the original recording.</p>
<p>What else is there: The system is available in various finishes such as rosewood,cherry and ebony with gray removable grille cloth,and maple with a light gray grille cloth. The price of the system varies between Rs 99 lakh and Rs 1 crore depending on the finish. These speakers have the 1501AL 380mm (15-inch) woofer for solid bass reproduction.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1209905&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the first Ultrabooks were announced,they were supposed to slowly,but surely,become the computing system of choice for the mobile generation. Two years on,Ultrabooks remain a niche category. However,they have forced manufacturers to understand the importance of portability in present day computing. </p>
<p>&#8220;There is no doubt that Ultrabooks have changed the entire design paradigm. Everyone from manufacturers to consumers now accept the sleek design format as the standard,&#8221; explains Sandeep Aurora,director,Marketing and Market Development at Intel India. &#8220;No one now wants to be seen with a bulky laptop these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ultrabook was a standard set by Intel for manufacturers to take on the onslaught from tablets,a category in which it hardly had any presence. While the initial models more or less stuck to the standards,soon they started taking liberties in everything from thickness and weight to the $1,000 price suggestion. </p>
<p>While Ultrabooks don&#8217;t have a large market share among computing devices,they have been successful in making the average laptop become thinner and lighter. The Ultrabook USP of a 10-second wake up from sleep has also become pretty much standard across mid-range devices at the moment. </p>
<p>Meanwhile,the Ultrabook itself has moved on to become a convertible that can become a tablet when needed. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1209550&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Cyber Media Research&#8217;s (CMR) India Quarterly Tablet PC Market Review,3Q (July-September) 2013,December 2013,about 1,204,410 Tablets were sold in the quarter by as many as 43 domestic and international vendors. However,only thirteen vendors shipped in significant volumes of more than 20,000 units during the period. The overall growth in shipments of tablets in the India market registered a 9.0% year-on-year (3Q CY 2013 over 3Q CY 2012) growth,but a more modest 4.7% quarter-on-quarter (3Q CY 2013 over 2Q CY 2013) increase due to limited offerings from vendors battling BIS certification guidelines.</p>
<p>Dwelling on individual vendor performances,Tarun Pathak,Analyst,CMR Telecoms Practice said,While Samsung leads,Lenovo has figured for the first time amongst the Top 3 India Tablet PC vendors,while <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/news/aakash-maker-datawind-enters-smartphone-market-with-subrs-5000-pocketsurfer5/1207420" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b>Datawind</b></font></a> continues to maintain its position in this exclusive club. </p>
<p>However,we saw quite a few vendors exiting the Tablet category altogether,or launching their offerings in the Enterprise Tablets space. Key reasons for this are low profitability in the entry-level Tablets market vis-à-vis a more promising future for growth of the Enterprise Tablets market, he said.</p>
<p>The market is expected to pick up towards the end of the year,once Tablet PC vendors are through with their BIS certifications. This is also expected to lead to some market consolidation. Only serious players with a long term vision are likely to remain committed to this category of devices. As far as technological trends are concerned,the 3G Tablets market will continue to grow and Android will remain the dominant OS,though it is expected to lose some share to the Windows and iOS platforms,once Windows 8.1 OS-based Tablet devices,the Apple iPad Air and Apple iPad Mini 2 launch in India during the October-December 2013 quarter, Pathak concluded.</p>
<p>Faisal Kawoosa,Lead Analyst,CMR Telecoms Practice stated,It is becoming interesting to watch this space as the market grows and matures. Like the consumer segment,Android OS-based Tablets dominate the India Enterprise Tablet PC space as well. But with more vendors committing to Windows OS-based Tablets,the interest levels amongst customers are showing increasing trend. In a couple of quarters we expect Windows OS-based Tablets gaining significant traction within the India Enterprise segment.</p>
<p>There is no clear leading industry vertical where the adoption has been distinctly higher than others. But going forward,BFSI,Pharmaceuticals and Retail are a few segments that are expected to take the lead. Some interesting developments are taking place in these sectors on the Tablet PC as a platform. However,solutions-oriented ODMs are most likely to rule the roost, Kawoosa cautioned.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1209542&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2-in-1 devices,which work as both a PC and tablet,are expected to find more consumer preference in 2014 as prices fall and more people opt for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2013,we saw a lot of OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) coming out with 2-in-1 devices,which could be used both as a PC and tablet. They called it swivel,hybrids and some other names too,&#8221; Sandeep Aurora,Director,Marketing and Market Development,Intel South Asia,said.</p>
<p>People chose these devices as it was easy to carry and yet allowed people to continue working,just like they would work on their desktops,on the go,he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year,we expect prices to come down a little,which would drive the adoption further,&#8221; Aurora said.</p>
<p>He added the prices could come down to sub-Rs 30,000 as more OEMs launch their products. Currently,2-in-1s cost Rs 34,000 and above.</p>
<p>Talking about the roadmap for 2014,Aurora said the focus for the company is clearly on tablets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will have processors for both tabs and smartphones but the focus is more towards tablets. &#8220;Also,going forward all our OEM partners will be manufacturing devices based on Baytrail (Intel&#8217;s new architecture),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Asus has come out with their first Baytrail powered device,while Acer is launching their Baytrail powered tablet today.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the introduction of &#8216;Bay Trail&#8217; powered devices also,we expect 2-in-1 devices to hit low price points,Aurora said.</p>
<p>The Baytrail processors will also power a variety of affordable laptops,desktop PCs and all-in-ones.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1209529&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[D90T tablet is well made and is worth the investment for enthusiasts.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1209211&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are an entertainment lover,this device is for you. We are talking about the D90T tablet from EAFT Technologies,priced at R16,990. The tablet focuses on music enthusiasts with its WorldSpace radio app and anyone looking for long battery life. Its 8000mAh battery ensures that there is enough power to get through all the tasks in a given day.</p>
<p>The tablets 9.7-inch IPS display offers a good ratio for landscape or portrait viewing and is the ideal size for viewing content,be it reading books or watching videos. The Cortex A9 dual core processor at 1.6 GHz along with the Mali 400 MHz GPU simplifies multitasking and provides a good combination for smooth handling of multimedia and rendering.</p>
<p>The D90T supports 10 point multi-touch. Therefore,you can play the piano on your tablet or play extreme games right from your tablet! However,the tablet looks pretty ordinary as if to attempt an iPad. Its build feels pretty plasticky as if deliberately built to a price. Edges may feel to be slightly sharp when holding. As a </p>
<p>result,the Destiny D90T scores a low 5/10 on look-and-feel.</p>
<p>The D90T weighs 610 grams,which is just about what the competition offers for this screen size. The Micromax Funbook Pro is a 10-inch tablet and weighs 600 grams. However,the D90Ts weight is lesser than the Spice Stellar Pad MI 1010,which is another 10-inch tablet but weighs 667 grams.</p>
<p>The tablet has two cameras of 2 megapixel each at front and back,the rear camera even gets an LED flash. However only the front camera is of good use,which is for video chatting. The rear camera does take pictures but you can only use the images as thumbnails and nothing much. The Android version is just 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich OS,which is obsolete in terms of the competition offered. The interface and touch responsiveness is just about average and in terms of pre-loaded applications,you mainly have Office suites,Evernote,Dropbox and Photobooth (in addition to Worldspace).</p>
<p>When fully charged,streaming a movie on YouTube over Wi-Fi caused the battery to drain in a little over seven hours. Not meant for the budget conscious!</p>
<p>Estimated street price</p>
<p>Rs 16,990</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1209211&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sony has pipped rival Microsoft by bringing its latest gaming console,the PlayStation 4,to the Indian market. There are many reasons to buy the console,which will be available from January 6 next year.  An awesome gaming experience tops that list. But with a standalone tag of Rs 39,990,price is certainly not one of them. </p>
<p>During the launch,Sony PlayStation&#8217;s country head Atindriya Bose blamed taxes in India for the premium. The console costs $400 (Rs 25,000) in the US,Eur 400 (Rs 35,000) in Europe,SGD 639 (Rs 32,000) in Singapore and HKD 3,380 (Rs 27,000) in Hong Kong. Barring Brazil,where import duties pushed the price up so much that Sony is considering manufacturing PS4 in the country,the price in most countries is lower than in India.</p>
<p>The problem is that Rs 39,990 does not buy you the best gaming experience. Most gamers would want to own the PlayStation Eye,a motion-sensing camera,and an extra controller. These cost Rs 4,990 each. Add to that the cost of games. First-party titles (those developed and published by Sony) will cost Rs 3,999 while third-party games will cost between Rs 2,499 and Rs 4,499. Most gamers will look to buy at least three titles with the console,which will cost between Rs 7,500 and Rs 12,000.</p>
<p style="text-align:right"><img src="http://static.indianexpress.com/frontend/iep/story_images/Gaming_PS4.jpg" align="right" vspace="4" border="0" alt="Gaming_PS4"></p>
<p>Thus,the total cost of a PlayStation 4 shoots up to around Rs 60,000. It seems that Sony is looking to make the most of being the first of the new generation of consoles in India. Gamers will be hoping for a price cut when Microsoft Xbox One hits shelves here. </p>
<p>In this day and age,when one can easily hook up an iPad Air (or Android tablets) to a TV and a wireless controller for a great gaming experience,it remains to be seen whether expensive consoles (and games) appeal to the target audience.</p>
<p>The price might be high,but Sony has built a feature-rich console to justify the cost. The PS4 is designed to provide a great HD gaming experience and it comes with 8 GB of unified system memory that is shared by the processor and the graphics card. It comes with 500 GB of storage and connectivity options include ethernet,WiFi,two USB 3.0 ports and Bluetooth. It supports Blu-Ray discs and DVDs,but will not be able to play PS3 games.</p>
<p>The most improved PS4 part is the DualShock 4 controller. The new controller has a touchpad similar to those found in laptops,a dedicated share button for the social network age,and a light bar that alerts players about in-game parameters such as low health. It also has ports for headphones and a microphone,which will improve the multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>PS4 exclusive games are Killzone: Shadow Fall,Knack,inFAMOUS: Second Son and Driveclub. Other launch titles include FIFA 14,NBA LIVE14,Assassins Creed IV,Witcher 3 and Elder Scrolls online will be games exclusive to the console.</p>
<p>In case you are among those who cannot afford a PS4,you might want to consider buying a PS3. Some may recall that sales of the PlayStation 2 went up after the launch of PS3 in 2006. Going by that,it seems reasonable to expect sales of PS3 to rise,given that it is available for Rs 17,000 (12 GB) to Rs 22,990 (500 GB).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1209178&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With more and more people using the iPad as their primary productivity machine,the on-screen keyboard that occupies around half the screen space becomes a bit of a killjoy. Plus,most users have to look down to type,which isn&#8217;t the best posture.</p>
<p>To get over these two awkward problems,Logitech,on Tuesday,launched keyboard covers for those who want to use iPad Air or Mini as their primary work tablet. Apart from making typing easier,Logitech claims these keyboard covers protect your tablet. These keyboards use Bluetooth to connect to the iPad and last up to three months on a full charge,according to Logitech.</p>
<p>Logitech Ultrathin keyboard cover for iPad Air comes with a magnetic clip that snaps on to the magnets on the tablet. It comes with keys for cut,copy and paste. This costs Rs 6,995. </p>
<p>Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Folio for iPad Air has a stand that holds your iPad upright when you want to type and you can push it back all the way when you&#8217;re not typing. It costs Rs 6,495. The Folio cover for the iPad Mini is priced at Rs 5,795.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1208720&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s official. Lenovo is trying its best to shrug of its tag as a PC manufacturer and seem to find  a better opportunity for growth in PC-plus devices. On Tuesday,it launched in India a new high-end phablet,the Vibe X,at Rs 25,999 in a bid to get mileage out of the fastest growing smartphone segment in the fastest growing smartphone market. </p>
<p>The Vibe X flagship smarpthone claims to be the lightest five-inch smartphone in the market at just 121 gram and is just 6.9mm thick. The 20/20 vision crystal-clear display is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 screen. There is a 13MP rear camera with a BSI sensor that promises good low light performance and a 5MP front camera. The Android 4.2 phone is powered by a quad-core 1.5GHz processor with 2GB RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Lenovo has also added some exclusive apps like SHAREit which enables phone-to-phone data transfer at 4Mbps speed. </p>
<p>Lenovo India MD Amar Babu said the device combines the best of their phone and PC expertise. Incidentally,the Lenovo MD said the company was now selling more smart devices than PC,which is,or used to be,their core business.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1208705&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tablet is expected to become the next big device for gaming. It has always been a gaming device,but has lacked the power needed for top end games that makes consoles popular these days. </p>
<p>But there are signs that all this is going to change. Xolo,the premium devices brand from phone manufacturer Lava,has announced the launch of the Xolo Play Tegra Note,a seven-inch tablet powered by the all-new NVIDIA Tegra 4  for a very affordable Rs 17,999.</p>
<p>As the name suggests,this tablet will be aimed at the gaming crowd and will benefit from the quad-core processor with a 72-core GeForce GPU and quad-core CPU with a fifth battery-saver core. It will also feature the NVIDIA TegraZone for easy access to Tegra-optimized games with enhanced visuals and exclusive features. Then there is support for a variety of Bluetooth game controllers. What more could a gamer ask for?</p>
<p>For other tasks,the Android Jelly Bean tablet has an industrial design and ships with unique chisel tip stylus featuring NVIDIA DirectStylus technology. The camera is powered by NVIDIA Chimera computational photography architecture to deliver stunning new features. Plus,the NVIDIA PureAudio offers rich,deep audio with the &#8220;widest frequency range&#8221; in tablets through front-facing stereo speakers with a bass-reflex port.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1208660&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been a massive rise in the number of cyber attacks aimed at gamers in 2013,with India alone accounting for 2,07,245 attempts,says Kaspersky Labs. </p>
<p>The cyber security company has identified 4.6 million pieces of gaming focused malware,together accounting for over 11.7 million attacks globally. On average,users were hit by 34,000 attacks related to gaming malware daily. Kaspersky Lab experts are recommending users take the right precautions,especially with PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One scheduled to be launched in India soon. </p>
<p>Globally,Russian gamers were the worst hit as hackers made 88,13,050 attempts this year,followed by Vietnam with 5,03,947 and China with 3,76,058. India came fourth.</p>
<p>Ksapersky warns that underground forums are full of cyber crooks selling access to peoples gaming accounts,fuelled by attacks on gaming companies themselves. Malware targets specific games,such as the hugely popular Minecraft.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1208259&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine playing a video game while moving freely throughout your house!</p>
<p>A revolutionary new technology that uses radio signals to track a person through walls and obstructions could change the way video games are played,scientists say.</p>
<p>Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed the new high-resolution,3D motion tracking system dubbed &#8220;WiTrack,&#8221; which can pinpoint a person&#8217;s 3-D location to within 10 to 20 centimetres  about the width of an adult hand. </p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine playing an interactive video game that transforms your entire home into a virtual world. The game console tracks you as you run down real hallways away from video game enemies,or as you hide from other players behind couches and walls. This is what WiTrack can bring to video gaming,&#8221; said Dina Katabi,a professor of computer science and engineering and co-director of the MIT Centre for Wireless Networks and Mobile Computing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year,Katabi and her graduate student Fadel Adib unveiled WiVi,a system that detects humans through walls and can track the direction of their movement using WiFi signals.</p>
<p>Based on this earlier work,Katabi and Adib developed WiTrack in collaboration with Rob Miller,a professor of computer science and engineering,and graduate student Zach Kabelac.</p>
<p>In comparison to WiVi,WiTrack has significantly higher accuracy and can track both two-dimensional and three-dimensional movement using specialised radio waves,as opposed to WiFi signals. </p>
<p>WiTrack operates by tracking specialised radio signals reflected off a person&#8217;s body to pinpoint location and movement.</p>
<p>The system uses multiple antennas: one for transmitting signals and three for receiving. </p>
<p>The system then builds a geometric model of the user&#8217;s location by transmitting signals between the antennas and using the reflections off a person&#8217;s body to estimate the distance between the antennas and the user.</p>
<p>WiTrack is able to locate motion with significantly increased accuracy,as opposed to tracking devices that rely on wireless signals,said Adib.</p>
<p>The system&#8217;s ability to track motion through obstructions could make it particularly useful not only in gaming,but also in tracking elderly patients at high risk of falling.</p>
<p>Current approaches to fall detection require individuals to continuously wear sensors or install cameras in the person&#8217;s home,researchers said.</p>
<p>While WiTrack does not require individuals to wear sensors or install cameras,it can still detect falls with very high accuracy. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1208253&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is some good news for Nokia lovers. The Finnish smartphone giant,which hasn&#8217;t been in the best of shape recently,finally has a phablet in the Indian market. That is significant in two ways &#8212; phablet make up more than 30 per cent of all smartphones sold in India and this is among the top 3 markets for Nokia Lumias. </p>
<p>This is why the success of the Lumia 1520,a large screen smartphone,will be crucial for the company,especially in India. With a six-inch screen,a Pureview quality 20MP camera and the best microphones in town,this device has a lot going for it. But one thing that is not going its way it the price,which at Rs 46,999 might be a bit to steep for the Indian market. Phablet buyers in India have Android offerings starting as low as Rs 10,000. We can only hope that the love for Lumia and Windows Phone strong enough for you to buy this phone. </p>
<p>The real window of opportunity for Nokia is to project the Lumia 1520 as a business phone,especially with a lot of long-time BlackBerry loyalists looking for options when an upgrade comes up. The Integration with Windows will work really well for most enterprise grade users. The multi-directional microphone,Skype and Microsoft Office will all add to this value. </p>
<p><b>Nokia Lumia 1520 specifications</b> </p>
<p>The phone will run Windows Phone 8 and is powered by a 2.2GHz Snapdragon quad-core processor with 2GB RAM. The phone has a 6-inch Full HD screen as well as a PureView 20 MP camera with Zeiss optics. The Nokia Lumia 1520 is by all means a good phablet,maybe not priced right for many of us.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the most consumer savvy business phone in the market,&#8221; said Nokia&#8217;s director for smartphone devices Vipul Mehrotra. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1208233&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>LG Curved OLED TV</p>
<p>Price 9,99,900</p>
<p>Panoramic view</b></p>
<p>Curves seems to be the new buzzword in LGs design centre in South Korea. The company on Wednesday announced two new products,a television and a smartphone,with curved screens  the G Flex phone and the Curved OLED TV. However,there is no date on the availability of the G Flex. </p>
<p>The Red Dot design award winning television is curved,but it also has a crystal transparent stand and a very intuitive and natural user interface with smart touch controls. The 55-inch TV also has a front facing film type speaker which promises theatre quality sound. The immersive viewing angles of the curved screen have been augmented by four colour (WRGB) technology.</p>
<p><b>HTC Desire 501</p>
<p>Price 16,890</p>
<p>Colourful patterns</b></p>
<p>While the market has seen phones of a variety of colours,HTC has stepped in another direction by going for colourful patterns on the Desire 501. Following the launch of the dual-SIM Desire 600 earlier this year,HTC has announced three new phones in the range. Available in three colours  brown,green and a checkered blue  the Desire 501 is a dual-sim phone in which both SIM cards are active. Priced at Rs 16,890,it has a 4-inch screen,8GB storage,1 GB RAM,1.15 GHz dual-core processor and expandable memory up to 32 GB. It has an 8-MP rear camera and a 2.1-MP front camera.</p>
<p><b>BenQ EW2740L</p>
<p>Price 25,000 </p>
<p>Eye-friendly screen</b></p>
<p>BenQ has come out with monitors that cause less strain to your eyes. If you stare at the monitor for long hours,you might want to take a look at BenQs EW series monitors  EW2440L (24-inch) and EW2740L (27-inch). The 24-inch variant costs Rs 18,000 and the 27-inch variant costs Rs 25,000. BenQ claims that these are flicker-free,which eliminates eye fatigue and headaches. Another eye-friendly feature is its low blue light display. It is worth noting that most monitors allow users to adjust this value. The settings can be found under RGB values.</p>
<p><b>Asus Transformer trio</p>
<p>Price 98,099 </p>
<p>Windows or Android</b></p>
<p>Over the past few years,Asus has forayed into a series of hybrid devices,the latest being the Transformer Book Trio. The 11.6-inch device comprises a tablet that docks to a keyboard. The display has a resolution of 1920×1080 pixels and the tablet has an Intel Atom z2560 processor clocked at 1.6 GHz,64 GB storage and 2 GB RAM. This device can run Android Jelly Bean and Windows 8,and users can switch between the two at the tap of a button. To run Windows,the tablet needs to be docked to the keyboard. The keyboard dock is no accessory,for it houses an Intel Haswell processor,HD 4400 graphics,4 GB RAM,1 TB storage,two USB 3.0 ports and a microHDMI port.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1207807&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google Inc has removed an experimental privacy feature from its Android mobile software that had allowed users to block apps from collecting personal information such as address book data and a user&#8217;s location.</p>
<p>The change means that owners of smartphones using Android 4.4.2,the latest version of the world&#8217;s most popular operating system for mobile devices released this week,must provide access to their personal data in order to use certain apps.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said the feature had been included by accident in Android 4.3,the version released last summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are suspicious of this explanation,and do not think that it in any way justifies removing the feature rather than improving it,&#8221; said Peter Eckersley,technology projects director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The digital rights website first publicized the change in a blog post on Friday.</p>
<p>Android users who wish to retain the privacy controls by not upgrading to Android 4.4.2 could be vulnerable to security risks,Eckersley said. &#8220;For the time being,users will need to chose between either privacy or security on the Android devices,but not both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many third-party apps for Android devices,such as music-identifying service Shazam and popular smartphone flashlight apps,require access to personal information that does not always have an obvious connection to the app&#8217;s functionality,such as phone call information and location data.</p>
<p>The privacy feature allowed users to pick and choose which personal data a third-party app can collect,Eckersley said. Users had to install a special Apps Ops Launcher software,which was created by another company,in order to access the hidden privacy controls.</p>
<p>Android software was loaded on 81 per cent of all smartphones shipped worldwide in the third quarter,according to industry research firm IDC. Apple Inc&#8217;s iOS,the software used on the iPhone,had 12.9 percent market share.</p>
<p>Privacy has become an increasingly important issue as smartphones,which are loaded with consumers&#8217; personal information,become the primary computing device for many consumers. In November Google agreed to pay a $17 million fine to settle allegations that it secretly tracked Web users by placing special digital files on the Web browsers of their smartphones.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1207624&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter Inc was forced to nix a change to its &#8220;block&#8221; feature on Thursday after attracting a wave of protest from users who said the new policy empowered perpetrators of online abuse.</p>
<p>The humbling reversal on one of the most sensitive policy issues facing the social network came as Twitter encountered user revolt for the first time as a public company.</p>
<p>Under the short-lived change on Thursday,a blocked Twitter user could view or tweet at the person who blocked him or her,but that activity would have been rendered invisible to the victim as if the offending account did not exist.</p>
<p>Under the re-instated policy,users could prevent their harassers from following them or interacting with their tweets. Users are also explicitly notified if they are blocked.</p>
<p>Before it backtracked,Twitter had said Thursday that the change was meant to protect victims of harassment who wanted to filter out abusive messages but feared that the act of blocking a user would prompt retaliation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have decided to revert the change after receiving feedback from many users &#8211; we never want to introduce features at the cost of users feeling less safe,&#8221; vice president of product Michael Sippey wrote in a blog post.</p>
<p>Chief Executive Dick Costolo initially sought to address the mounting criticism by saying on Twitter that the new features were widely requested by victims of abuse.</p>
<p>But many were not convinced. Within hours,the service was flooded with angry users,including many who did not understand the nuances of the new policy,and hundreds had signed an online petition to reverse the change.</p>
<p>&#8220;New @twitter block policy is like a home security system that instead of keeping people out puts a blindfold on YOU when they come in,&#8221; said user @edcasey.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Just ignore them &amp; they&#8217;ll stop&#8217; is a dangerous thing to say to bullied kids &amp; a dangerous thing to say to stalked/harassed Twitter users,&#8221; wrote @red3blog,another user.</p>
<p>Keeping abuse in check is a key issue for the company,which needs to keep hold of existing users and attract hundreds of millions of new ones to justify the stratospheric valuation that investors have placed on its stock.</p>
<p>Twitter shares have risen 35 percent to $55.33 the past two weeks on investor expectations that the company can sustain its growth for years and mature into an internet powerhouse.</p>
<p>The changes were announced Thursday after the market close.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s swift about-face similarly drew an outpouring of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people have spoken and Twitter listened,thanks,&#8221; said user @samar_ismail.</p>
<p>The controversy highlighted Twitter&#8217;s dilemma over how it should police the freewheeling service or stamp out abuse.</p>
<p>Twitter,which once espoused a radically hands-off approach to moderating content,was pressed in August to strengthen its &#8220;report abuse&#8221; functions after two high-profile women in the United Kingdom,feminist and journalist Caroline Criado-Perez and Labour Party politician Stella Creasy,were subjected to a deluge of death and rape threats.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s top executive in the U.K.,Tony Wang,and Del Harvey,the head of its trust and safety team,issued personal apologies to the women after revising Twitter&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p>Twitter said Thursday that the company&#8217;s policies were still evolving and that the block feature remained problematic because some users were fearful that their harassers would be notified when they become blocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moving forward,we will continue to explore features designed to protect users from abuse and prevent retaliation,&#8221; Sippey,the Twitter executive,wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve built Twitter to help you create and share ideas and information instantly,without barriers. That vision must coexist with keeping users safe on the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The backlash was a rare event for a company that for the most part has been hailed for championing its users,who now number more than 250 million worldwide.</p>
<p>Although Twitter has made unpopular design tweaks,it has maintained a better policy record than social media rival Facebook Inc,which has repeatedly upset users with abrupt changes to its privacy policies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1207262&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sony has overtaken rival Microsoft and announced that its next generation gaming console PlayStation 4 will be launched in India on December 18. Meanwhile,there has been no announcement from Microsoft on the launch or availability of Xbox One in India.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 4 marks Sony&#8217;s move away from the Cell architecture seen in PS3. Cell architecture was jointly developed by Sony,Toshiba and IBM,but many developers found it difficult to make games for the PS3 due to its complicated architecture. Sony has used AMD processors in the PS4 in a bid to make it developer-friendly. </p>
<p>Sony PS4 is the successor to the PS3,which was launched in 2006. PS4 was first launched in the US on November 15,followed by Europe,Australia and UAE. The India launch of the console is scheduled ahead of countries such as Japan,Indonesia and Singapore. In the US,PS4 costs $400 (Rs 25,000).</p>
<p>The console has done well in the US,with reports indicating that 2.1 million units were sold within 15 days of the US launch. Sony&#8217;s PS4 has been priced aggressively against Microsoft Xbox One,which costs $500 (Rs 31,000). However,that hasn&#8217;t hit sales of Microsoft&#8217;s console in the US (2 million units sold since launch).</p>
<p>Details about pricing and availability in India will be known after the launch. Stay tuned.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1207215&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Micromax sold 6.8 mn phones in the July-September quarter including 2.2 mn smartphones.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1207208&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India&#8217;s Micromax,which has become the country&#8217;s No. 2 smartphone brand just five years after selling its first handset &#8211; a $30 made-in-China model &#8211; is looking to go upmarket and overseas.</p>
<p>The unlisted company sold 6.8 million phones in the July-September quarter including 2.2 million smartphones,and is on track to surpass $1 billion in sales in the fiscal year ending in March.</p>
<p>With heavy advertising and phones based on Google Inc&#8217;s  Android software starting at $50 &#8211; almost half the price of a comparable Samsung model &#8211; Micromax has brought smartphones to the masses in a price-sensitive market where basic handsets still dominate.</p>
<p>Among all types of phones,Micromax ranks third in India after Nokia and Samsung Electronics.</p>
<p>The company,which started out selling IT software and telecoms gear,entered the handset market with cheap phones featuring bigger screens,and the capability to use two SIM cards so customers can take advantage of bargains from competing carriers &#8211; a feature Nokia was slow to match.</p>
<p>Now Micromax is looking to broaden its market by wooing brand-conscious Indians with more spending power. In October,it rolled out a 19,000-rupee ($310) &#8220;phablet&#8221; with a 5-inch screen promoted by &#8220;Wolverine&#8221; star Hugh Jackman &#8211; an unusual choice in a country where Bollywood actors and cricket stars are the preferred brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>In January,it will begin selling phones in Russia,followed by Romania,where competitors also include Samsung and Nokia. UK-based Fly also sells China-made phones in Russia and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Micromax has also tried to tap the Brazilian and the Middle Eastern markets with basic phones,but did not manage to build scale and closed the operations.</p>
<p>Industry watchers say Micromax,which is backed by private equity firms TA Associates and Sequoia Capital,has its work cut out pushing into pricier segments dominated by global brands and building its brand from scratch in new markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Operators worldwide are already flooded with choices from other low-cost Asian Android smartphone players,&#8221; said Neil Mawston,a UK-based executive director at Strategy Analytics.</p>
<p>SIMS FOR ALL OCCASIONS</p>
<p>As mobile Internet prices in India have started falling,the smartphone market has taken off,with Micromax and other local vendors of low-cost China and Taiwan-made phones such as Karbonn and LAVA pushing hard into small towns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Effectively,they gave people,the youngsters especially,the first opportunity to graduate to a smartphone. And a good quality smartphone,&#8221; said Himanshu Chakrawarti,chief executive at The Mobile Store Ltd,a large mobile phone retail chain.</p>
<p>In India,where about 250 million handsets are sold annually,smartphones accounted for 20 percent of sales in the latest quarter. Few,however,can afford an Apple  iPhone or a high-end Samsung Galaxy.</p>
<p>To keep costs down,Micromax mostly uses chipsets made by MediaTek and Spreadtrum,which tend to be cheaper than those made by industry leader Qualcomm Inc . It does not have its own manufacturing plant,outsourcing production to China and Taiwan,but will start assembling some phones at a plant in northern India from next quarter.</p>
<p>Rahul Sharma,a company co-founder,said he got the idea for a dual-SIM phone when he saw his cook used three SIM cards.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said one SIM card is local,and a second is for me to call my native village because the plan is very attractive,&#8221; Sharma said during an interview at his office near New Delhi.</p>
<p>MOVING UP MARKET</p>
<p>As Micromax moves into the higher end,it competes more directly with international offerings in the 15,000-rupee and above price range,where brand matters more to consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think Micromax will struggle in the higher end of the smartphone market because richer Indian consumers often prefer the cachet of international brands,&#8221; Mawston said.</p>
<p>Some retailers also say Micromax&#8217;s after-sales service lags that of global brands. &#8220;We do acknowledge that and are working very,very hard on that,&#8221; Sharma said.</p>
<p>Micromax will keep pushing up the feature chain even as it continues to offer budget models,with plans to launch smartphones with faster &#8220;octa-core&#8221; processors,16 megapixel cameras and high-definition screens.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1207208&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[If you stare at the monitor for long hours,you might want to take a look at BenQ's EW series.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1206882&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you stare at the monitor for long hours at home or office,you might want to take a look at BenQ&#8217;s EW series monitors  EW2440L (24-inch) and EW2740L (27-inch). The 24-inch variant costs Rs 18,000 and the 27-inch variant costs Rs 25,000. </p>
<p>The latest range of flicker-free monitors from BenQ eliminate eye fatigue and headaches. Another eye-friendly feature is its low blue light display. BenQ says most displays have high blue light,which causes eye strain. It is worth noting that most monitors allow users to adjust this value. The settings can be found under RGB values.</p>
<p>BenQ&#8217;s country head Rajeev Singh said the technology has advanced only recently. &#8220;From LCD screens,we moved to LED and now we have flicker-free monitors. BenQ is pioneering this change in monitors.</p>
<p>But these monitors don&#8217;t just stop at eye care. They come equipped with an HDMI MHL (mobile high-definition link) port that allows users to connect their Android smartphones,provided they are compatible,to these monitors. An MHL cable comes in the box and users can plug in one end on their Android phone&#8217;s micro-USB port and the other to the monitor. Another cable is plugged in to a power socket for the connection. Once connected,the technology worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>On the target audience,Singh said,We expect both consumers and businesses to buy these monitors. Professionals are realising that buying a branded PC doesn&#8217;t always get you the best display. You are not looking at the computer or keyboard,you are staring at the screen. So it becomes very important to have a flicker-free screen.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1206882&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
