REUTERS/Toby Melville" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Keith Weir LONDON (Reuters) - One of Arsene Wenger&amp;#039;s first acts on becoming Arsenal manager in 1996 was to ban his tired players from refuelling with chocolate bars on long trips home after away matches. As Wenger prepares for his landmark 1000th match in charge of Arsenal on Saturday, the methods he helped to pioneer in English soccer are now second nature to the current generation of players. &amp;quot;He changed their way of eating to what was known as the Evian water and broccoli diet!&amp;quot; said David Dein, the former Arsenal vice-chairman who convinced the board to hire his friend Wenger, overcoming their misgivings about giving the job to a relatively unknown foreigner. As well as changing the culture at Arsenal, Wenger also transformed the playing style of a team that had built successes over the previous decade on a rock solid defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"></media:credit></item><item><title>Dan Henderson's take on 'greatest fight in UFC history' may surprise you</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/dan-henderson-s-take-on--greatest-fight-in-ufc-history--may-surprise-you-182209097-mma.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/v4zhF8UqRLRNgADc7iv7NA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2014-03-21/51dce690-b123-11e3-84f5-9547b2943d40_133994145.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="131999241JH024_UFC_139_Shog" align="left" title="131999241JH024_UFC_139_Shog" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;His first fight against Mauricio &amp;#039;Shogun&amp;#039; Rua ranks highly in many fans&amp;#039; minds, but Hendo himself didn&amp;#039;t think much of it in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/dan-henderson-s-take-on--greatest-fight-in-ufc-history--may-surprise-you-182209097-mma.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 23:52:08 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://sports.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Sports</source><guid isPermaLink="false">dan-henderson-s-take-on--greatest-fight-in-ufc-history--may-surprise-you-182209097-mma</guid><media:content url="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/v4zhF8UqRLRNgADc7iv7NA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2014-03-21/51dce690-b123-11e3-84f5-9547b2943d40_133994145.jpg" type="image/jpeg" width="130" height="86"></media:content><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/dan-henderson-s-take-on--greatest-fight-in-ufc-history--may-surprise-you-182209097-mma.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/v4zhF8UqRLRNgADc7iv7NA--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://l.yimg.com/os/publish-images/sports/2014-03-21/51dce690-b123-11e3-84f5-9547b2943d40_133994145.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="131999241JH024_UFC_139_Shog" align="left" title="131999241JH024_UFC_139_Shog" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;His first fight against Mauricio &amp;#039;Shogun&amp;#039; Rua ranks highly in many fans&amp;#039; minds, but Hendo himself didn&amp;#039;t think much of it in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"></media:credit></item><item><title>Toronto's Ranger has sore neck, no concussion</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/torontos-ranger-sore-neck-no-concussion-180935101--spt.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/fK6nm9Pwnf0vrGKQspS91w--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/25566da71ff2f00b4e0f6a706700f79e.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="Toronto Maple Leafs&amp;#039; Paul Ranger is taken off the ice on a stretcher after hitting the boards head first from a check by Tampa Bay Lightning&amp;#039;s Alex Killorn during first period NHL action in Toronto on Wednesday March 19, 2014.

Soccer's governing body also denied media reports that 800 flights could be re-routed or cancelled during the month-long tournament in Brazil due to airspace restrictions near airports in the host cities. The Itaquerao stadium, being built by the Corinthians club, is due to open on April 15, nearly four months after the December 31 deadline set by FIFA although Brazilian media reports said this week it might not even be ready by then. There had been uncertainty over who would finance temporary installations such as media and VIP facilities, sponsors' tents and stadium screens but FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke said this had now been sorted out.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/fifa-says-impasse-resolved-over-corinthians-stadium-175458584--finance.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 23:24:58 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">fifa-says-impasse-resolved-over-corinthians-stadium-175458584--finance</guid></item><item><title>Rondon has torn elbow ligament, will miss season</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/rondon-torn-elbow-ligament-miss-season-164636265--spt.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/eqkr8AtWIgnQe4os1SoLVQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/65816628479e190b4f0f6a70670012cc.jpg" width="130" height="86" alt="FILE - In this Aug. 26. 2013, file photo, Detroit Tigers pitcher Bruce Rondon watches from the dugout during the second inning of a baseball game against the Oakland Athletics in Detroit.

Five years after humbling England in the 2009 World Twenty20, Netherlands chased down a target of 190 in only 13.5 overs to advance ahead of Zimbabwe and Ireland on net run rate. The all rounder, who also contributed with a 15-ball 31 during Friday's chase, said he was reminded of the "special night" when Netherlands picked off the target set by England on the last ball at Lord's. "In 2009 we beat England and that was a pretty special night," Borren said.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/netherlands-captain-hails-memory-monster-chase-135521583--spt.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 19:41:06 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">netherlands-captain-hails-memory-monster-chase-135521583--spt</guid></item><item><title>Bellini, Brazil’s 1st World Cup winning captain dies at the age of 83</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/bellini-brazil-1st-world-cup-141012188.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/u5oaTnVb6KoL4QKzn7AIdw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-IN/homerun/Sportskeeda.in/54ba8936dee517c08ac04f27d338f51f" width="130" height="86" alt="Bellini, Brazil’s 1st World Cup winning captain dies at the age of 83" align="left" title="Bellini, Brazil’s 1st World Cup winning captain dies at the age of 83" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bellini, Brazil’s 1st World Cup winning captain passes away Bellini, Brazil’s first ever World Cup winning captain (1958), died yesterday due to complications following a heart attack.
