Puyol, who has been battling with knee problems for the past few seasons, is again injured while fellow centre-half Gerard Pique is still recovering from a calf strain. Coach Gerardo Martino has a lack of options in defence where Javier Mascherano, who previously played in midfield, has become a regular centre-half. Sergio Busquets and Alex Song have also been tried out in the position but their lack of pace has been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"></media:credit></item><item><title>Brijesh Patel to be manager for India at World T20</title><description>World T20 Bangladesh: Brijesh Patel appointed as the manager for the Indian cricket team.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/brijesh-patel-manager-india-world-141417922.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 19:44:17 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.sportskeeda.com">Sportskeeda</source><guid isPermaLink="false">brijesh-patel-manager-india-world-141417922</guid></item><item><title>Stats: Asia Cup 2014 – Top run scorers for India</title><description>Stats of runs scored by Indian players at the 2014 Asia Cup in cricket.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/stats-asia-cup-2014-top-140915107.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 19:39:15 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.sportskeeda.com">Sportskeeda</source><guid isPermaLink="false">stats-asia-cup-2014-top-140915107</guid></item><item><title>BNP Paribas Open: Analysing the wide open WTA playing field</title><description>BNP Paribas Open: Analysing the wide open WTA playing field - Li Na, Sharapova, Azarenka, Radwanska</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/bnp-paribas-open-analysing-wide-140725835.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 19:37:25 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.sportskeeda.com">Sportskeeda</source><guid isPermaLink="false">bnp-paribas-open-analysing-wide-140725835</guid></item><item><title>Everton's Jagielka "unlikely" to face Arsenal, says Martinez</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/evertons-jagielka-unlikely-face-arsenal-says-martinez-135751577--sow.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/Xai2ovW3BZFNjekokVfv1w--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-03-06T135751Z_1_CDEEA2512SH00_RTROPTP_2_SOCCER-ENGLAND-CUP.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="Everton&amp;#039;s Jagielka holds the leg of team mate Oviedo as he lies with a broken leg during their English FA Cup soccer match against Stevenage in Stevenage" align="left" title="Everton&amp;#039;s Jagielka holds the leg of team mate Oviedo as he lies with a broken leg during their English FA Cup soccer match against Stevenage in Stevenage" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;(Reuters) - Everton captain Phil Jagielka looks set to miss their FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal on Saturday after failing to recover from a hamstring injury, manager Roberto Martinez said on Thursday.

Beset by injuries and bogged down in a controversy over referees, Fiorentina face the daunting prospect of a trip on Sunday (1130 GMT) to Juve who have a 100 percent home record in the league and are 11 points clear at the top. After that, they must face Antonio Conte's side twice more in a Europa League round of 16 tie. It is probably the last thing coach Vincenzo Montella wants as he battles to keep his side in the race for a third place finish in Serie A which would earn a place in next season's Champions League final qualifying round.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/fading-fiorentina-face-juventus-triple-header-134903858--sow.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 19:19:03 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">fading-fiorentina-face-juventus-triple-header-134903858--sow</guid></item><item><title>Who is the greatest player of the open era – The Nadal vs Federer debate</title><description>Who is the greatest player of the open era - The Nadal vs Federer debate</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/greatest-player-open-era-nadal-134849924.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 19:18:49 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.sportskeeda.com">Sportskeeda</source><guid isPermaLink="false">greatest-player-open-era-nadal-134849924</guid></item><item><title>Dennis sees echoes of Senna in Button</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/dennis-sees-echoes-senna-button-134753322--f1.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/IOWjY7AiaA05J75r5jDqXw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-03-06T134753Z_1_CDEEA2512BV00_RTROPTP_2_MOTOR-RACING-MCLAREN.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="McLaren Formula One driver Jenson Button of Britain drives the new MP4-29 during pre-season testing at the Jerez racetrack in southern Spain" align="left" title="McLaren Formula One driver Jenson Button of Britain drives the new MP4-29 during pre-season testing at the Jerez racetrack in southern Spain" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Alan Baldwin WOKING, England (Reuters) - McLaren boss Ron Dennis sang the praises of his Formula One driver line-up on Thursday and detected echoes of Ayrton Senna in Jenson Button&amp;#039;s relationship with the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/dennis-sees-echoes-senna-button-134753322--f1.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 19:17:53 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">dennis-sees-echoes-senna-button-134753322--f1</guid><media:content url="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/IOWjY7AiaA05J75r5jDqXw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-03-06T134753Z_1_CDEEA2512BV00_RTROPTP_2_MOTOR-RACING-MCLAREN.JPG" type="image/jpeg" width="130" height="86"></media:content><media:text type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/dennis-sees-echoes-senna-button-134753322--f1.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/IOWjY7AiaA05J75r5jDqXw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-03-06T134753Z_1_CDEEA2512BV00_RTROPTP_2_MOTOR-RACING-MCLAREN.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="McLaren Formula One driver Jenson Button of Britain drives the new MP4-29 during pre-season testing at the Jerez racetrack in southern Spain" align="left" title="McLaren Formula One driver Jenson Button of Britain drives the new MP4-29 during pre-season testing at the Jerez racetrack in southern Spain" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Alan Baldwin WOKING, England (Reuters) - McLaren boss Ron Dennis sang the praises of his Formula One driver line-up on Thursday and detected echoes of Ayrton Senna in Jenson Button&amp;#039;s relationship with the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear="all"/&gt;</media:text><media:credit role="publishing company"></media:credit></item><item><title>Ecuador to reinstate Benitez's number 11 for World Cup</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/ecuador-reinstate-benitezs-number-11-world-cup-134623342--spt.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/DmdAq.w0YnmAu5QYRy3UOg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-03-06T134623Z_1_CDEEA25129E00_RTROPTP_2_SOCCER.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="The coffin of Ecuador soccer player Benitez is seen in the middle of Ruminahui Coliseum during his funeral in Quito" align="left" title="The coffin of Ecuador soccer player Benitez is seen in the middle of Ruminahui Coliseum during his funeral in Quito" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Rex Gowar LONDON (Reuters) - Ecuador dropped the number 11 shirt from their team in honour of striker Christian Benitez who died last July but FIFA regulations mean they must reinstate it in their World Cup squad, coach Reinaldo Rueda said. &amp;quot;Chucho&amp;quot;
