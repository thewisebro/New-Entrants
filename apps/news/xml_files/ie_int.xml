				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pervez-4802.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1982540" alt="The special court had dismissed 70-year-old Musharraf's appeal to conduct the treason trial of the former president in a military court on February 21." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pervez-4802.jpg" /></a> The special court had dismissed 70-year-old Musharraf&#8217;s appeal to conduct the treason trial of the former president in a military court on February 21.
<p>Embattled former Pakistani military dictator Pervez Musharraf will soon challenge in the Supreme Court the rejection of his appeal for conducting his high-profile treason trial in a military court.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have decided to challenge the order of the Special Court. It is still under process,&#8221; key lawyer in Musharraf&#8217;s legal team Mohammad Ali Saif said.</p>
<p>He clarified that no petition has been filed as being reported by a section of the local media. The special court had dismissed 70-year-old Musharraf&#8217;s appeal to conduct the treason trial of the former president in a military court on February 21.</p>
<p>The court had dismissed Musharraf&#8217;s petition saying it has the mandate to try him. Initially, Musharraf had filed three applications that challenged the appointment of the head of the prosecution team, the establishment and the jurisdiction of the special court.<br />
Musharraf is scheduled to appear before the Special Court on March 11.</p>
<p>He is likely to be indicted on that day. He faces treason charges for suspending, subverting and abrogating the Constitution, imposing an emergency and detaining judges of the superior courts.</p>
<p>If convicted, he could face life imprisonment or the death penalty. This is the first time in Pakistan&#8217;s history that a former military chief is facing trial for treason.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002743&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Riot police have used tear gas and pepper spray during scuffles with union members protesting austerity measures, during a ban on demonstrations in parts of central Athens due to a visit by German President Joachim Gauck.</p>
<p>Scuffles broke out today when a group of several dozen demonstrators attempted to break through a police cordon on a major avenue in an effort to march to the Finance Ministry.</p>
<p>The demonstrations were unrelated to the visit by Gauck, who was meeting with his Greek counterpart and was due to visit the site of a Nazi massacre in central Greece tomorrow.</p>
<p>Authorities banned all demonstrations from 8 AM to 7 PM local time in parts of the city, citing security concerns.</p>
<p>Several hundred union members, mainly construction workers, had already scheduled demonstrations.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002722&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An American anchor for the Moscow-funded Russia Today television network resigned live on air in protest at the deployment of Russia-backed forces in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Liz Wahl said during a broadcast on Wednesday that she could no longer work for the network, which she accused of &#8221;whitewashing&#8221; moves by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>&#8220;My grandparents came here as refugees during the Hungarian revolution, ironically to escape the Soviet forces,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally, I cannot be part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of Putin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth, and that is why, after this newscast, I am resigning.&#8221;</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='480' height='267' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/8p2KK0g7kKE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>Her resignation comes after another US-based RT host, Abby Martin, criticized the actions of pro-Russian military units on her show.</p>
<p>Reacting to the latest embarrassment, RT accused Wahl of a &#8220;self-promotional stunt&#8221; and questioned her professionalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when someone makes a big public show of a personal decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margarita Simonyan, RT&#8217;s editor-in-chief, posted a staunch defence of the network, saying its reporters were being persecuted in a media &#8220;war&#8221; with the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was never such persecution of our journalists and the entire channel as there is now,&#8221; wrote the 33-year-old on her LiveJournal blog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Abby and Liz are different guys, they are not Russian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their motherland is now comparing my motherland to Nazi Germany&#8230; No, there is a real war, not in Crimea, thank God, but in the media,&#8221; Simonyan wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is tough to be the black sheep,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why do I continue working on the channel which alone is resisting thousands, tens of thousands of Western media by telling a different side of the story?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because this is my motherland and there is no other way for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to CNN, Wahl said she hesitated before deciding to make her views public.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feared what measures they would take against me, what retaliatory measures they would take against me,&#8221; she said, adding that she had been &#8220;contemplating quitting for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become very clear&#8230; especially in the face of this crisis with Crimea, is that the objective of RT has been to promote the Putinist propaganda, to promote the conflict as Putin wants us to see it and to bash the US,&#8221; Wahl said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002709&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lawmakers in the embattled Crimean region of Ukraine have decided to hold a referendum March 16 on whether Crimea should become part of Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our response to the disorder and lawlessness in Kiev,&#8221; Sergei Shuvainikov, a member of the local Crimean legislature, said Thursday. &#8220;We will decide our future ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parliament in Crimea, which enjoys a degree of autonomy under current Ukrainian law, voted 78 with eight abstentions in favor of holding the referendum. Local voters will also be given the choice of deciding to remain part of Ukraine, but with enhanced local powers.</p>
<p>There was no immediate response from the Ukrainian central government to the vote. On Wednesday, Ukraine&#8217;s prime minister told The Associated Press that Crimea would remain part of Ukraine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002549&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A NATO airstrike in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday accidentally killed five Afghan soldiers, government officials said, while the coalition said it was investigating reports of the incident.</p>
<p>The deaths are likely to worsen already fraught relations between the US-led NATO coalition and President Hamid Karzai, who has often seized on botched airstrikes to launch bitter criticism of the international military effort in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;At 3:30 am on Thursday Morning, due to a NATO airstrike in Charkh district, Logar province, five service members of the Afghan national army were martyred and eight others were wounded,&#8221; defence ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi said on his Twitter account.  Khalilullah Kamal, the Charkh district governor, said he had visited the site of the attack, which he said was from a US drone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The post is totally destroyed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Americans used to be in that post but since they left, the ANA (Afghan army) took over. The post is on a hilltop. The attack was conducted by drones.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Karzai, who is due to stand down after elections on April 5, in an interview this week expressed his &#8220;extreme anger&#8221; towards the United States as it prepares to end its 13-year war in Afghanistan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002431&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/saadi-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002447" alt="The authorities said al-Saadi, one of the deposed Libyan leader's eight children, will be treated &quot;in accordance with international law.&quot; (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/saadi-med.jpg" /></a> The authorities said al-Saadi, one of the deposed Libyan leader&#8217;s eight children, will be treated &#8220;in accordance with international law.&#8221; (Reuters)
<p>Niger on Thursday extradited to Libya one of Moammar Gaddafi&#8217;s sons, al-Saadi, who fled as his father&#8217;s regime crumbled in 2011 and who was under house arrest in the desert West African nation ever since, the government in Tripoli said.<br />    <br />The authorities said al-Saadi, one of the deposed Libyan leader&#8217;s eight children, will be treated &#8220;in accordance with international law.&#8221;<br />    <br />A Libyan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said al-Saadi arrived early on Thursday at the Tripoli airport and was transferred to a prison in the capital.<br />    <br />Shortly after the news broke, photographs circulated on social media showing al-Saadi in a blue prison uniform while Libyan guards were shaving his hair and beard.<br />    <br />Al-Saadi was known for his love of professional soccer and a playboy lifestyle. His brief career in Italian football ended after a failed drug test. He headed Libya&#8217;s Football Federation and was also former head of the country&#8217;s special forces.<br />    <br />Like most of Gaddafi loyalists and ex-regime officials, al-Saadi is wanted for his role in curbing protests against his father&#8217;s rule and the killing of protesters.<br />    <br />But unlike his brother, Seif al-Islam, who was groomed to be Gaddafi&#8217;s successor, al-Saadi is not sought by the<br />International Criminal Court. Seif al-Islam is held by a militia in the western Libyan town of Zintan, which refuses to hand him over to the central government for trial.<br />    <br />With the extradition, al-Saadi joins Seif al-Islam as the only two of Gaddafi&#8217;s children currently in Libya. At least three other Gaddafi&#8217;s sons were killed during the uprising while the rest of the children sought asylum in neighbouring Algeria, along with Gaddafi&#8217;s wife and al-Saadi&#8217;s mother, Safiya.</p>
<p>The mother, a sister and two brothers, were granted asylum in Oman in 2012 and moved there from Algeria.<br />    <br />The rule of law is still weak in Libya after decades of Gaddafi&#8217;s reign. Courts are still paralysed and security<br />remains tenuous as unruly militias proliferate.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002435&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/locklearm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002432" alt="Navy Admiral Samuel Locklear also lamented the &quot;slow but steady&quot; relationship between China and the US.

<p>A rising China is unlikely to threaten the pre-eminence of the US military power globally, a top Pentagon commander has said, after Beijing&#8217;s move to hike its defence budget by more than 12 per cent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pre-eminence of the US military power globally will remain in place for a long time, and that even a rising China will not be able to globally threaten that,&#8221; Navy Admiral Samuel Locklear, Commander of the US Pacific Command (PACOM), told lawmakers during a Congressional hearing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think where we have the most concern are in the region &#8211; where we happen to have four or five very important allies to us &#8211; where the PRC has introduced some of their military capabilities that on the surface would appear to want to deny access to the United States and limit our ability to defend our allies and to protect our interests in that region,&#8221; Locklear said.</p>
<p>Locklear said that the US should not be surprised by China&#8217;s desire to build a military to defend their interests, both regionally and globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should also be recognising that as a rising China, there is benefit to the world for a peaceful, prosperous China that is transparent and that participates in the international institutions and is a net provider of security rather than a net user of security,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Locklear also lamented the &#8220;slow but steady&#8221; relationship between China and the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are making progress and kind of breaking down the barriers we have to understand each other. This is an essential part of having a peaceful, prosperous, stable China that has a military that helps,&#8221; Locklear said.</p>
<p>The PACOM Commander, however, said the Chinese military is on the rise and wondered whether the world will see it as a net provider of security or whether Beijing will use its muscle to pursue regional claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;So whether their military will rise, I think that is a given. It will. The question is, is it transparent?  What is it used for?  Is it in cooperation in the larger security environment that its neighbours and that we as a Pacific nation want them included?  So that remains the question to see how they proceed,&#8221; Locklear said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002422&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 21-year-old Indian-origin university student has mysteriously disappeared while enjoying a vacation with friends in the US state of Florida.</p>
<p>Reny Jose, a mechanical engineering major and a member of Martel College at Rice University, was on a spring break at the time of his disappearance in the Panama City Beach,Florida.</p>
<p>The Bay CountyOffice Sheriff&#8217;s in Florida has been searching for him after Jose was last seen on Monday evening.</p>
<p>His friends told authorities that he went for a walk in the evening and never returned. He arrived to Panama City<br />
Beach on Saturday with his friends.</p>
<p>The Sheriff&#8217;s Office was contacted by Jose&#8217;s friends who reported him missing from the beach-front home he was<br />
renting.</p>
<p>Jose&#8217;s clothing and personal items were found in a garbage can near the home, including his mobile phone.</p>
<p>The family of the college student left for Panama City Beach to help with the search efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were contacted yesterday by the Sheriff&#8217;s Department notifying us that he was reported missing and that they were conducting search efforts,&#8221; said Jismi George, Reny Jose&#8217;s cousin.</p>
<p>A Sheriff&#8217;s Office Air Unit has been covering the area and surrounding beaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just pretty much working with what we have right now and that&#8217;s not too much, so you know they&#8217;re doing<br />
the best they can but obviously they are not doing too well,&#8221; George said.</p>
<p>Jose&#8217;s sister, Reashma Jose, has created a Facebook page to help find her brother. &#8220;My family and I are so<br />
thankful for all your prayers and support,&#8221; Reashma wrote on the social media site.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is the third Indian-American student who has gone missing in the last few weeks, with their<br />
parents originally from Kerala.</p>
<p>Jasmine Joseph, 22, a nursing student from New York has been missing for over a week now.</p>
<p>Southern Illinois University student Pravin Varughese was found dead in Carbondale after missing for six days.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002407&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ladies, beware of what you wear &#8211; if you are in Massachusetts!</p>
<p>The top court in Massachusetts has ruled that &#8216;upskirting&#8217; &#8211; the practice of secretly photographing under a woman&#8217;s skirt &#8211; is not prohibited by state law.</p>
<p>The shocking decision by the Massachusetts&#8217;s high court said that a state law intended to prohibit &#8216;Peeping Tom&#8217; voyeurism of completely or partially undressed people did not apply to those who take pictures of people who are fully clothed.</p>
<p>The ruling on Wednesday exonerated a man previously charged with taking unauthorised pictures of women on a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority trolly.</p>
<p>Michael Robertson was charged in December 2011 with the act before successfully appealing the ruling to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, &#8216;Boston.com&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The court focused on the language of the law, which prohibits secret photography of &#8220;a person &#8230; who is partially nude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A female passenger on a MBTA trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering [private] parts of her bodyis not a person who is &#8216;partially nude&#8217;, no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing,&#8221; the court said in its ruling.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Speaker of the House Robert DeLeo described the court&#8217;s ruling as obeying a legal loophole that he intends to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ruling of the Supreme Judicial Court is contrary to the spirit of the current law. The House will begin work on updating our statutes to conform with today&#8217;s technology immediately,&#8221; DeLeo said.</p>
<p>According to &#8216;New York Daily News&#8217;, several Twitter users also immediately voiced criticism, with one woman writing: &#8220;Not all assault is physical. &#8216;Upskirting&#8217; is a disgusting violation. And it&#8217;s just been given the green light by a court.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002398&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thousands of Venezuelans mourned the passing of President Hugo Chavez on the first anniversary of his death Wednesday, while National Guard troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets at anti-government activists who pressed on with street protests despite the commemorations.</p>
<p>Chavez&#8217;s successor, President Nicolas Maduro, angrily announced that he would break off relations with Panama, which he accused of being a &#8220;lackey&#8221; of the US in what he has repeatedly called a conspiracy to topple his government through the daily protests that have left at least 18 dead since mid-February.</p>
<p>Maduro said he made the move because Panama asked for the Organization of American States to study the situation in Venezuela. Maduro considers the OAS to be dominated by the US government, which has denied his claims that it is acting against Venezuela&#8217;s government.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t accept the interventionism of anyone, because our international policy is a policy of peace, of cooperation, of respect, of the anti-imperialist Latin American union,&#8221; Maduro said.</p>
<p>Panama&#8217;s Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing &#8220;astonishment&#8221; at Maduro&#8217;s action and called his comments &#8220;unacceptable insults.&#8221; It denied that the request for the OAS to discuss Venezuela was interference in Venezuelan affairs, saying the proposal had the  &#8220;sole purpose to assist in bringing together the different actors in that sister country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Venezuela is mired in economic crisis and daily anti-government demonstrations, and Wednesday was no exception as protests erupted in at least six cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The National Guard attacked with a lot of fury against the guys and used tractors to violently take down the barricades,&#8221; said Mari Marcano, a protester on the tourist island of Margarita. &#8220;They launched a lot of tear gas, shot rubber bullets.&#8221;</p>
<p>In restive central Lara state, the leader of a small center-left opposition party, Hector Alzaul Planchart, was shot dead by unknown assailants as he left his party offices in Barquisimeto, according to media reports.</p>
<p>Despite the protests, the pomp-soaked anniversary of Chavez&#8217;s passing was a time for sadness and nostalgia for many Venezuelans. Thousands gathered at the capital&#8217;s parade grounds to honor the socialist leader who died of cancer on March 5, 2013.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t like an anniversary; it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re mourning,&#8221; said Gledis Hernandez, 43, who took her daughter and niece to the memorial parade in Caracas. She said Chavez gave her an apartment when her home was washed away in floods, but &#8220;right now we&#8217;re living in a sad situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vendors hawked Chavez T-shirts, pins and hats. Visitors were given a newspaper upon entering the area with the headline &#8220;Chavez lives!&#8221; on the front and a cardboard cutout of Chavez riding a bike tucked within. Inside, tanks and soldiers paraded before a waving Maduro and military jets screamed overhead.</p>
<p>The military parade, attended by Chavez friends Bolivian President Evo Morales, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and Cuban President Raul Castro among others, kicked off a 10-day commemoration. Afterward, they participated in a ceremony at Chavez&#8217;s hilltop mausoleum, and that was followed by the television premier of Oliver Stone&#8217;s documentary &#8220;My Friend Hugo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maduro seems in a stalemate with the political opposition. His administration shows no sign of crumbling, but he appears unable to stop the student-led protests. Instead, he moves ahead with a peace effort that the opposition calls farcical while his foreign minister rebuffs offers for outside mediation.</p>
<p>Inflation in Venezuela hit 56 percent last year, slashing the buying power of the poor who Chavez lifted above the poverty line using the state&#8217;s oil profits. Simple grocery shopping has become a daily odyssey as residents hunt for scarce items like flour, cooking oil and toilet paper, and wait hours in line when they&#8217;re lucky enough to find them.</p>
<p>Luisa Teresa Guzman, 64, said she still cries over Chavez. Wearing a red beret, red shirt and red pants at the entrance to the parade grounds, she said Maduro can carry the revolution forward. &#8220;That&#8217;s why Chavez left him there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a month of protests has drawn international attention to the country&#8217;s struggles.</p>
<p>In San Antonio de los Altos, in Miranda state, protesters blocked roads, but were driven off by hundreds of National Guard troops, national police and other authorities with tear gas and rubber bullets. Protests were also reported in Valencia, San Cristobal, Merida and Barinas.</p>
<p>Ruben Velasquez, 44, making his way from the parade grounds, said the protests are simply an expression of the situation people are living now in Venezuela.</p>
<p>He said life had worsened in every way since Chavez&#8217;s death, particularly with regard to the economy and crime. He supports Maduro, because he works in the government customs agency, but only to a point.</p>
<p>&#8220;If things escape from his (Maduro) hands I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s going to have support from anyone,&#8221; Velasquez said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002304&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/soldier.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001780" alt="Uniformed men, believed to be Russian servicemen, march outside a military base in Crimea; (Below) US Secretary of State John Kerry stands next to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov (background right) in Paris on Wednesday.

Reuters
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The European Union added a significant financial underpinning to the struggling Ukraine government on Wednesday in the midst of the East-West crisis with Russia over Ukraine’s future, offering aid worth as much as $15 billion over the next two years.</span></p>
<p>The offer comes on top of the $1 billion in American loan guarantees to ease Ukraine’s economic transition, announced here on Tuesday by Secretary of State John Kerry during a visit aimed at reassuring the interim Ukraine authorities and challenging Russia, which escalated the crisis last weekend by seizing control of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Kerry met later on Wednesday in Paris with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V Lavrov, as part of an attempt to arrange the first face-to-face talks between representatives of the Russian and interim Ukraine governments since the crisis boiled over. The Russians have refused to recognise the interim Ukraine government’s legitimacy.</p>
<p>Lavrov insisted earlier Wednesday in Madrid that Russia had no control over “self-defense forces” in Crimea, which Russian troops have effectively occupied, surrounding and neutralising the thin Ukrainian military presence there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Russia accused Ukraine of &#8220;hallucinating&#8221; on Wednesday after Kiev warned a UN atomic agency meeting of risks to the safety of its nuclear power plants in case of a Russian invasion, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Envoys of the two neighbours engaged in a fiery verbal exchange during a session of the 35-nation governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), diplomats who attended the closed-door discussions said.</p>
<p>The standoff in Crimea, and the larger struggle over Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that is deeply intertwined with Russia economically, are at the heart of these diplomatic and financial maneuvers.</p>
<p>The offers of loans are crucial, because Ukraine is in dire economic shape, with a promised Russian loan of $15 billion in abeyance since the ouster of Yanukovych and Russia’s decision on Tuesday to cancel a large discount on natural gas supplies.</p>
<p>The American and European offers are also intended to answer political criticism in Washington and some European countries that the West is not doing enough to support Ukraine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001772&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli naval forces raided a ship in the Red Sea early Wednesday and seized dozens of advanced rockets from Iran destined for Palestinian militants in Gaza, the military said.</p>
<p>The ship, the KLOS C, was carrying Syrian-made M-302 rockets and was intercepted more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) south of Israel off the coasts of Sudan and Eritrea, military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told reporters.</p>
<p>He said the M-302 rockets have a range of up to 100 miles (160 kilometers) and would have significantly improved the capabilities of Gaza militants, putting nearly all of Israel in their range. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah used M-302s in a 2006 war with Israel, the military says.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from Iranian officials about the Israeli claims.</p>
<p>The operation, codenamed &#8220;Full Disclosure,&#8221; followed months of intelligence gathering. Lerner said the shipment originated in Syria. From there the weapons were flown to Iran and departed from the Bandar Abbas port. Lerner said the Iranians tried to &#8220;obscure their tracks&#8221; by shipping first via Iraq and then out to sea. The shipment was destined for Sudan from where it would be moved overland through Egypt to Gaza. Israel says militants have used similar routes in the past.</p>
<p>Lerner said the 17-man crew of the ship, flying under a Panama flag, were not suspects and were probably unaware of the cargo. The vessel was being brought to Israel.</p>
<p>Video released by the military showed Israeli soldiers on the ship inspecting the rockets, which were kept in large boxes. The video also showed beige bags containing cement with the words &#8220;Made in Iran,&#8221; in English, written on them.</p>
<p>Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said the weapons were &#8220;strategically important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Iran trains, funds and arms terror groups in the region and around the world and its failed attempts to transfer the arms that were discovered this morning is more proof of that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamic militant group that already possesses thousands of rockets. A number of smaller groups, including the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad, and al-Qaida-inspired groups also possess rockets. The military did not specify which group the shipment was believed to be destined for.</p>
<p>Israel accuses Iran of supplying rockets and other arms to its foes — militants in Gaza and Lebanon&#8217;s Hezbollah — and it has moved to intercept weapons shipments in the past.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Israel seized the cargo ship Victoria loaded with weapons sent by Iran to Gaza militants, including land-to-sea missiles.</p>
<p>In November 2009, Israel took over the Iranian Francop vessel off the coast of Cyprus and captured hundreds of tons of rockets, missiles, mortars, grenades and anti-tank weapons on board that it said were headed to Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Israel is also suspected of carrying out airstrikes in Sudan on arms shipments believed to be bound for Gaza. Israel has never confirmed carrying out the strikes.</p>
<p>In January 2002, Israeli forces stormed the Karine A freighter on the Red Sea, and confiscated what the military said was 50 tons of missiles, mortars, rifles and ammunition headed for Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>In May 2001 off its coast, Israel captured the vessel Santorini, packed with explosives that Israel said were being sent from Hezbollah to Palestinian militant groups.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001620&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The United States says Iran must clear up suspicions it worked on atomic arms if it hopes to get full relief from sanctions choking its economy.</p>
<p>Iran and six world powers now are working on a deal that highlights sanctions relief in exchange for agreement by Tehran to scale back nuclear programs that could be turned toward making a bomb.</p>
<p>But U.S. envoy Joseph Macmanus told the International Atomic Energy Agency&#8217;s 35-nation board Wednesday that Tehran must also fully cooperate with the IAEA in its probe of the weapons allegations.</p>
<p>He says clearing up suspicions that Iran worked on nuclear arms &#8220;will be critical&#8221; to any final accord meant to give Tehran full final sanctions relief.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001590&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;I have killed my sons &#8211; Fahad (2) and eight-months-old Yousuf &#8211; as I had no food to feed them,&#8221; Bisma told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband is a drug-addict and he never bothered to take care of family. Since I didn&#8217;t want to see my children becoming beggars, I decided to kill them,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She said it was not a story of one day that she had no food to feed her children.Bisma admitted, &#8220;I drowned my elder son in a bath tub and strangled the younger one.&#8221;</p>

(AP)
<p>A survey of 42,000 women across the European Union suggests that about one in 10 have been the victims of sexual violence, and half of them reported being raped.</p>
<p>Described as the largest of its kind, the survey released on Wednesday by the EU&#8217;s Agency for Fundamental Rights is the most ambitious effort yet to gauge the extent of sexual violence  and harassment experienced by the 186.6 million women in the EU&#8217;s 28 nations.</p>
<p>The survey suggests that more than 100 million women were subject to sexual harassment broadly defined in 11 categories ranging from indecent exposure to inappropriate requests for a date. Only one woman in seven reported their most serious incident of intimate partner violence to police. Released on International Women&#8217;s Day, the EU survey was based on face-to-face interviews with women aged between 15 and 74 in all 28 EU countries.</p>
<p>It was conducted from March to September 2012 by a consortium headed the UN -affiliated European Institute for Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.5 per centage points.</p>
<p><strong>Among the findings:</strong></p>
<p>RAPE AND OTHER SEXUAL VIOLENCE</p>
<p>Ten per cent of respondents reported some form of sexual violence since the age of 15, with one in 20 saying she had been raped. That would be more than 9 million rape victims when applied to all women between 15 and 74 in the EU. CHILDHOOD ABUSE</p>
<p>Twelve per cent reported some form of sexual abuse by an adult before age 15, with 1 per cent indicating they were forced to have intercourse with an adult. Some 27 per cent reported physical abuse before age 15 at the hands of an adult. Men were perpetrators of 97 per cent of cases of sexual violence against children, but in cases of physical violence men slightly outnumbered women.</p>
<p>ABUSE WITHIN A RELATIONSHIP</p>
<p>Of respondents who are or have been in a relationship with a man, 22 per cent reported physical and or sexual violence from their partner. Some form of &#8220;psychological violence&#8221; by a current or previous partner was reported by 43 per cent. Examples included humiliation, threats of physical harm and limitations on freedom of movement such as taking away respondents&#8217; car keys or locking them in.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001272&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pak-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001267" alt="he US maintained USD 280 million in military aid to Pakistan for the fiscal year 2015 beginning in October 2014. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pak-med.jpg" /></a> Under the FMF, the US maintained USD 280 million in military aid to Pakistan for the fiscal year 2015 beginning in October 2014. (Reuters)
<p>Arguing that Pakistan will remain a key player in counter terrorism post-2014, the US has proposed USD 280 million in military assistance to the country, although it wants to cut civilian aid in an effort to acknowledge India&#8217;s concerns about misuse of the funds.</p>
<p>Marred by financial constraints, the Obama administration has proposed to substantially cut civilian aid to Pakistan to USD 446 million for the next fiscal year as against USD 703 million in 2013, which among other things the State Department argued is aimed at improving ties with India.</p>
<p>&#8220;The OCO (Overseas Contingency Operations) resources will support critical US activities such as sustaining close cooperation with Pakistan, ensuring the safety of Pakistani nuclear installations, working with Pakistan to facilitate the peace process in Afghanistan, and promoting improved relations with India,&#8221; the State Department said as it proposed USD 446 million in civilian aid to Pakistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;FY 2015 funding for Pakistan is crucial to meeting key US strategic priorities of combating terrorism, strengthening security in both Pakistan and the region, and maintaining stability in Afghanistan post-transition,&#8221;the Department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pakistan will remain a key player in US counter terrorism and nuclear nonproliferation efforts in FY 2015, as well as in our long-term objectives of economic development and stability in the region,&#8221; the State Department said in its annual budget proposals to the Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developing an enduring and collaborative relationship with an increasingly stable and prosperous Pakistan that plays a constructive role in the region will therefore continue to be a priority for the United States,&#8221; the State Department said proposing USD 100 million to Pakistan under the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for the fiscal year 2015.</p>
<p>Under the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) category, the US maintained USD 280 million in military aid to Pakistan for the fiscal year 2015 beginning in October 2014.</p>
<p>Given the ongoing transition in Afghanistan and continued terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets throughout Pakistan, FMF is essential to Pakistan&#8217;s efforts to increase stability in its western border region and ensure overall stability within its own borders, the Department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The USD 280 million Pakistan requests will enhance the Pakistan Army, Frontier Corps, Air Force, and Navy&#8217;s ability to conduct counter insurgency (COIN) and counter terrorism (CT) operations against militants throughout its borders and will improve Pakistan&#8217;s ability to deter threats emanating from those areas, and encourage continued US-Pakistan military-to-military engagement,&#8221; the State Department said.</p>
<p>The OCO supports a robust diplomatic presence and critical assistance programmes to support the government and its people following Pakistan&#8217;s first democratic transition.</p>
<p>&#8220;These funds will help facilitate increased stability and prosperity in this strategically important nation and will enable us to sustain a presence necessary to achieve essential strategic priorities of eliminating terrorism and enhancing stability in Pakistan and the region following the transition in Afghanistan,&#8221; the State Department said.</p>
<p>Pakistan lies at the heart of the US&#8217; counter terrorism strategy, the peace process in Afghanistan, nuclear non-proliferation efforts, and economic integration in South and Central Asia, it said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001224&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Democrats need to wake up and understand the stakes involved in holding on to control of the US Senate in the November congressional elections, President Barack Obama told Democratic Party donors at a fundraiser on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something about midterms &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what it is about us. We get a little sleepy. We get a little distracted. We don&#8217;t turn out the vote. We don&#8217;t fund campaigns as passionately,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That has to change and it&#8217;s got to change right here because too much is at stake for us to let this opportunity slip by,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Obama was speaking to a group of more than 40 donors who paid $10,000 to $32,400 a ticket to attend a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee event at the home of former Senator Chuck Robb and his wife, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb.</p>
<p>It is one of 30 fundraisers the president plans to headline through June. He will attend two more on Wednesday in Boston.</p>
<p>Obama said he planned to devote time and energy to working for Democratic candidates because advancing issues ranging from the environment to women&#8217;s health issues depend on keeping control of the Senate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want to do is just emphasize the degree to which everything you all care about, advancing every issue that is of deep concern to you, depends on us successfully maintaining a Democratically controlled Senate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You better hope Democrats stay in the saddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>A third of the 100-member Senate is up for grabs in November elections as well as all 435 seats in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Republicans believe they have a good chance to pick up the six seats they need to take control of the Senate based on public dissatisfaction with Obama. Democrats are in a tight spot, forced to defend 21 seats to only 14 for Republicans.</p>
<p>That has prompted the White House this year to promote populist measures such as raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance benefits and investing in preschool programs.</p>
<p>In the 2010 midterms, Republicans took control of the House after what Obama called a &#8220;shellacking&#8221; from voters frustrated with the economy. &#8220;We paid a dear price for not paying enough attention,&#8221; Obama told donors on Tuesday, recalling the 2010 losses.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001144&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday that it was largely up to Ukrainians to resolve their country&#8217;s crisis, and said instability in the Black Sea nation would have regional repercussions.</p>
<p>The leaders spoke by telephone about the situation in Ukraine and its southerly Crimea region, which lie across the Black Sea from Turkey. Crimea has a large Turkic speaking minority and is now under Moscow&#8217;s control. Erdogan told Putin &#8220;that it is foremost the responsibility of Ukrainians to resolve the country&#8217;s crisis&#8221; and emphasised that &#8220;instability in (Ukraine) would negatively affect the entire region&#8221;, a statement from Erdogan&#8217;s office said.</p>
<p>A Kremlin statement focused on Crimea and suggested the two leaders were in broad agreement. &#8220;Both sides expressed certainty that, despite the aggressive actions of radical and extremist forces of the Maidan, there would be success in providing for inter-ethnic and interfaith peace and calm in Crimea,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Maidan&#8221; refers to the square in the Ukrainian capital that was the focus of a bloody, three-month political confrontation that led to the overthrow of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich last month.</p>
<p>There is tension in Crimea between Christian Slavs, including ethnic Russians, and Crimean Tatars &#8211; Turkic speaking Muslims who were exiled en masse by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin but now make up about 12 percent of Crimea&#8217;s population.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000897&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jinping-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000799" alt="People of all ethnic groups of the country should cherish ethnic unity, said Jinping." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jinping-med.jpg" /></a> People of all ethnic groups of the country should cherish ethnic unity, said Jinping.
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called for resolute opposition to any act that could damage the country&#8217;s ethnic unity amid growing anger over the recent knife attacks by militants from Xinjiang in Kunming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will build a &#8216;wall of bronze and iron&#8217; for ethnic unity, social stability and national unity,&#8221; he said while joining a panel discussion with members from the minority ethnic groups of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>The tradition of all ethnic groups in the country &#8220;breathing the same air and sharing the same fate&#8221; should be handed down from generation to generation, Xi was quoted as saying by state-run Xinhua news agency. &#8220;Unity and stability are blessings, while secession and turmoil are disasters. People of all ethnic groups of the country should cherish ethnic unity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His comments came amid growing anger among the majority Han community over the mass knife attack at the railway station in Kunming, capital of southwest Yunnan Province, on Saturday that left 33 people killed and over 143 injured. Chinese police held al-Qaeda linked East Turkestan Islamic Movement, fighting for the independence of Xinjiang, responsible for the gruesome attacks. Four militants from the eight-member group, including two women, which carried out the attacks, have been captured.</p>
<p>Local native Muslim Uyghurs in the northwestern Xinjiang province felt agitated with increasing settlements of majority Han Chinese from mainland China.</p>
<p>Xi also urged that everything possible be done to accelerate the social and economic development of China&#8217;s minority ethnic groups and the ethnic areas and to bring concrete benefits to people there. Meanwhile, a self-exiled Uyghur leader urged China not to crackdown on the Uyghurs in Xinjiang for what the militant have done.</p>
<p>Strongly condemning the violence, Rebiya Kadeer, leader of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress (WUC), said: &#8220;It is absolutely vital the Chinese government deal with the longstanding and deteriorating human rights issues facing Uyghurs if tensions are to be reduced.&#8221;</p>
<p>BBC quoted WUC statement as saying that it &#8220;unequivocally condemns the violence&#8221; and also expressed condolences to thevictims of the attack and their families. It urged Beijing &#8220;to refrain from using this as a pretext to further and indiscriminately crackdown on Uyghurs as precedents suggest, and to show a measured response&#8221;, it said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000795&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/putin-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000767" alt="Putin had ordered tens ofthousands of Russian troops participating in military exercises near Ukraine's border to return to their bases." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/putin-med.jpg" /></a> Putin had ordered tens of thousands of Russian troops participating in military exercises near Ukraine&#8217;s border to return to their bases.
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow reserves the right to use all means to protect Russianin Ukraine as US Secretary of State John Kerry was on his wayto Kiev.</p>
<p>Tensions remained high in the strategic Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea with troops loyal to Moscow firing warning shots to ward off protesting Ukrainian soldiers.</p>
<p>In first comments since fugitive Ukraine President ViktorYanukovych fled Kiev, Putin said he considers him to still beUkraine&#8217;s leader, and hopes that Russia won&#8217;t need to use force in predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine. Earlier, the Kremlin said Putin had ordered tens of thousands of Russian troops participating in military exercises near Ukraine&#8217;s border to return to their bases.</p>
<p>The massive military exercise in western Russia involving 150,000 troops, hundreds of tanks and dozens of aircraft was supposed to wrap up anyway, so it was not clear if Putin&#8217;s move was an attempt to heed the West&#8217;s call to de-escalate the crisis that has put Ukraine&#8217;s future on the line.</p>
<p>It came as Kerry was on his way to Kiev to meet with the new Ukrainian leadership that deposed a pro-Russian president,and has accused Moscow of a military invasion in Crimea. The Kremlin, which does not recognise the new Ukrainian leadership, insists it made the move in order to protect Russian installations and its citizens living there.</p>
<p>Today, Russian troops who had taken control of the Belbekair base in the Crimea region fired warning shots into the air as around 300 Ukrainian soldiers, who previously manned the airfield, demanded their jobs back.</p>
<p>About a dozen Russian soldiers at the base warned theUkrainians, who were marching unarmed, not to approach. They fired several warning shots into the air and said they wouldshoot the Ukrainians if they continued to march toward them.The shots reflected tensions running high in the Black Seapeninsula since Russian troops estimated by Ukrainianauthorities to be 16,000 strong tightened their grip over theweekend on the Crimean peninsula, where Moscow&#8217;s Black SeaFleet is based. Ukraine has accused Russia of violating a bilateralagreement on conditions of a Russian lease of a naval base inCrimea that restricts troop movements, but Russia has argued that it was acting within the limits set by the deal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000762&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The murder trial of deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi was adjourned to Thursday for the court to consider a defence request for new judges.</p>
<p>The trial is part of a relentless government crackdown against Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood movement since the military ended his turbulent year-long rule on July 3. Morsi is accused of inciting the killing of opposition protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012.</p>
<p>At today&#8217;s hearing, a lawyer representing one of Morsi&#8217;s co-defendants requested that two of the three judges be replaced, alleging that one of them spoke about the case in a media interview.</p>
<p>Lawyer Mohamed al-Masri had initially asked that the court include the judge&#8217;s interview in the trial records. &#8220;But since this request was ignored, we are presenting a recusal request,&#8221; head defence lawyer Mohamed al-Damati told cAFP. A similar request for appointing new judges has been made in two other trials involving Morsi, and an Egyptian appeals court is expected to decide on it on April 9.</p>
<p>In one of the trials, Morsi and others are accused of breaking out of jail during the 2011 uprising that toppled<br />
veteran president Hosni Mubarak. The second trial concerns accusations of espionage against the Islamist president.A date for a fourth trial, on charges of insulting the judiciary, has yet to be set.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000763&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Laxmi, a victim of acid attack and a standard-bearer for the movement to end acid attacks, has been selected by US prestigious International Women of the Courage Award.</p>
<p>Laxmi would receive the award from US First Lady Michelle Obama at an awards ceremony at the State Department here.</p>
<p>She was 16 when an acquaintance threw acid on her face while she waited at a bus stop in New Delhi&#8217;s busy Khan Market in 2005, disfiguring her permanently.</p>
<p>Her attacker, a friend&#8217;s 32-year old brother, planned to use the acid to destroy Laxmi&#8217;s face after she refused to respond to his romantic advances.</p>
<p>Many acid attack victims never return to normal life:they often go to great lengths to hide their disfigurement, many forgo education or employment rather than appear in public, and suicide is not uncommon. But Laxmi did not hide,&#8221; the State Department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She became the standard-bearer in India for the movement to end acid attacks. She made repeated appearances on national<br />
television, gathered 27,000 signatures for a petition to curb acid sales, and took her cause to the Indian Supreme Court,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8221;Laxmi&#8217;s petition led the Supreme Court to order the Indian central and state governments to regulate immediately the sale of acid, and the Parliament to make prosecutions of acid attacks easier to pursue,&#8221; the State Department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much is left to be done, and Laxmi continues to advocate on behalf of acid attack victims throughout India for increased compensation, effective prosecution and prevention of acid attacks, and rehabilitation of survivors,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Secretary of State John Kerry, who was earlier scheduled to be present at the awards ceremony, is now travelling to Kiev in the aftermath of the Ukrainian situation. He would be represented by Deputy Secretary of State Heather A Higginbottom.</p>
<p>Last year, Nirbhaya, a courageous 23-year-old girl whose brutal gang rape on a moving bus in Delhi in December 2012,triggered widespread protests, received the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The award would be presented to Laxmi along with other awardees from countries across the globe.</p>
<p>Established in 2007, the annual Secretary of State&#8217;s International Women of Courage Award honors women around the globe who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women&#8217;s equality, and social progress, often at great personal risk.</p>
<p>This is the only Department of State award that pays tribute to emerging women leaders worldwide.</p>
<p>Among other awardees are Nasrin Oryakhil (Afghanistan), Roshika Deo (Fiji), Bishop Rusudan Gotsiridze (Georgia), Iris Yassmin Barrios Aguilar (Guatemala), Fatimata Toure (Mali), Maha Al Muneef (Saudi Arabia), Oinikhol Bobonazarova (Tajikistan), Ruslana Lyzhychko (Ukraine) and Beatrice Mtetwa (Zimbabwe).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000620&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mush-yogi.jpg" /></a> Musharraf is scheduled to appear before the Special Court on March 11. (PTI)
<p>The hearing in the high-profile treason case against former Pakistani military dictator Pervez Musharraf was postponed on Tuesday till Wednesday after the judges failed to turn up due to a boycott called by lawyers over the brazen terror attack on a local court .</p>
<p>After a rare gun and bomb attack in the capital on Monday that left at least 11 people dead, including additional sessions judge Rafaqat Awan, and injured 25 others, the lawyer community had announced a call for strike.</p>
<p>Registrar Abdul Ghani Soomro adjourned the case&#8217;s hearing until Wednesday as special court judges did not reach court premises on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The defence and prosecution lawyers had informed the registrar of their mutual decision to seek excuse from appearance in the court today due to lawyers&#8217; strike.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of Musharraf&#8217;s lawyers Ahmed Raza Kasuri said the special court had been constituted in the capital city, adding that the District Bar and the Islamabad High Court had announced boycott of court proceedings for a week.</p>
<p>Following the attack on Monday, there were security threats surrounding the special court, he said.</p>
<p>He criticised the capital police and demanded strict action be taken against high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>He said if weak security prevailed, then Musharraf would not appear in the court and they would have to request the special court to transfer the hearing of the trial to a safer location.</p>
<p>Kasuri said when Musharraf missed court hearings due to his concerns regarding security, he was made fun of but yesterday&#8217;s attack was an example of the lack of security they were talking about.</p>
<p>Musharraf is scheduled to appear before the Special Court on March 11. He is likely to be indicted on that day.</p>
<p>This is the first time in Pakistan&#8217;s history that a former military chief is facing trial for treason.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000607&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday told troops to return to their permanent bases after calling a <a title="Russia on ‘wrong side of history’: Obama on Ukraine crisis" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/russia-on-wrong-side-of-history-obama-on-ukraine-crisis/">snap drill</a> to check their battle-readiness last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;The commander-in-chief President Vladimir Putin gave the order to the <a title="Ukraine says Russia issues ultimatum to surrender or face an all-out assault" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/ukraine-says-russia-issues-ultimatum-to-surrender-or-face-an-all-out-assault/">troops and units taking part in military exercises</a> to return to their permanent bases,&#8221; Putin&#8217;s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies.</p>
<p>Putin on February 26 ordered snap combat readiness drills involving <a title="Russia’s actions on Ukraine unacceptable: European Union top leaders" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/russias-actions-on-ukraine-unacceptable-european-union-top-leadersrussias-action-deeply-concerning-says-european-union-top-leaders/">thousands of troops</a>, in what was ostensibly a routine exercise.</p>
<p>The drill involved army, navy and airforce troops based in the central and western military districts, a vast territory that includes regions bordering Ukraine but also extending to the Arctic.</p>
<p>The drill did not include any regions beyond Russia&#8217;s borders such as Crimea, the Ukrainian Black Sea region which has become a flashpoint in the standoff between Moscow and Ukraine&#8217;s new authorities after the ousting of president Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had said that the drill would include military exercises &#8220;on Russia&#8217;s borders with other countries, including Ukraine&#8221;. The drill, which was initially announced to finish yesterday, came shortly before Russian security forces began operating covertly in Crimea and Putin gained permission from senators for military intervention.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000581&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A US girl&#8217;s snarky Facebook post has cost her father USD 80,000 he had won in a legal settlement.</p>
<p>Patrick Snay, 69, a former headmaster of Gulliver Preparatory School in Florida was set to receive the amount after settling a 2011 age discrimination suit with the school he once headed.</p>
<p>However, his daughter,Dana ruined the USD 80,000 deal by blabbing about it on Facebook,  the &#8216;Miami Herald&#8217; reported. &#8220;Mama and Papa Snay won the case against Gulliver. Gulliver is now officially paying for my vacation to Europe this summer. SUCK IT,&#8221; she wrote on the social networking website.</p>
<p>The message circulated among the former Gulliver student&#8217;s 1,200 Facebook friends and eventually made its way back to the school.</p>
<p>The school claimed the post violated the settlement&#8217;s confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>A judge last week tossed out the settlement, ruling the ex-employee and his daughter breached the terms of a confidential agreement when she took to social media to brag about it, the report said.</p>
<p>The case came to fore in 2010 when Gulliver declined to renew Snay&#8217;s contract following years of employment. Snay claimed age discrimination and retaliation that involved his daughter.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000526&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000530" alt="Snake-handling Kentucky pastor Jamie Coots died from a rattlesnake bite at church. (AP Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler.jpg" /></a> Snake-handling Kentucky pastor Jamie Coots died from a rattlesnake bite at church. (AP Photo)
<p>Three days after pastor Jamie Coots died from a rattlesnake bite at church, mourners leaving the funeral went to the church to handle snakes.</p>
<p>Coots, who appeared on the National Geographic Channel&#8217;s &#8220;Snake Salvation,&#8221; pastored the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name church founded by his grandfather in Middlesboro, Ky. The third-generation snake handler was bitten during a service on February 15 and died later at his home after refusing medical help. Now his adult son, Cody Coots, is taking over the family church where snakes are frequently part of services.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler2_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2000531" alt="snakehandler2_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler2_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=417" width="480" height="417" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;People think they will stop handling snakes because someone got bit, but it&#8217;s just the opposite,&#8221; said Ralph Hood, a professor of psychology at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, who has been studying snake handlers for decades. &#8220;It reaffirms their faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The practice of snake handling in the United States was first documented in the mountains of East Tennessee in the early 20th Century, according to Paul Williamson, a professor of psychology at Henderson State University who, along with Hood, co-wrote a book about snake handlers called, &#8220;Them That Believe.&#8221;  In the 1940s and 1950s, many states made snake-handling illegal (it&#8217;s currently illegal in Kentucky), but the practice has continued, and often law enforcement simply looks the other way.</p>
<p>The basis for the practice is a passage in the Gospel of Mark. In the King James Version of the Bible, Mark 16:17-18 reads: &#8220;And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandling_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2000532" alt="snakehandling_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandling_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=382" width="480" height="382" /></a></p>
<p>Snake handling gained momentum when George Hensley, a Pentecostal minister working in various Southern states in the early 1900s, recounted an experience where, while on a mountain, a serpent slithered beside him. Hensley purported to be able to handle the snake with impunity, and when he came down the mountain he proclaimed the truth of following all five of the signs in Mark. Hensley himself later died from a snake bite.</p>
<p>Today the practice is most common in Southern Appalachian states, and snake handlers often use native rattlesnakes and copperheads. Such churches are independent, and often call themselves &#8220;signs following&#8221; churches.</p>
<p>Andrew Hamblin, who co-starred on &#8220;Snake Salvation,&#8221; said he was with Coots when he died.</p>
<p>&#8220;I held him in my arms when he took his last breath,&#8221; said Hamblin, who is pastor at the Tabernacle Church of God in the nearby community of LaFollette, Tenn.</p>
<p>He believes that Coots, 42, would have died Feb. 15 no matter what; If not by a snake, then a stroke or some sort of accident.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandlercoots_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2000536" alt="Snakehandlercoots_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandlercoots_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=321" width="480" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s appointed time of death trumps everything,&#8221; Hamblin said.</p>
<p>Williamson said believers describe the feeling they get when they are handling snake, &#8220;Like a high, but a greater high than any drug or alcohol. It&#8217;s a feeling of joy, peace, extreme happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that many snake handlers believe that when God anoints them, they will be protected, but they still recognize there is danger. For instance, if the spirit leaves them and they don&#8217;t put down the snake quickly enough, they could be bitten.</p>
<p>Coots had handled snakes many years and had been bitten several times, always relying on prayer, and not medical help, to heal him. In &#8220;The Serpent Handlers: Three Families and Their Faith,&#8221; a book focusing on prominent snake-handling families, Coots is interviewed and describes a bite that took part of his finger, saying he had done something he shouldn&#8217;t have done (he doesn&#8217;t say what) and God was punishing him. Describing another painful bite, Coots says he was bitten after the spirit had moved out of him but he continued holding the snake for egotistical reasons.</p>
<p>Hood knew Coots well, and attended his standing-room only funeral service last week. At a gathering at the church afterward, some mourners were handling snakes, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the service, what everybody recognized and accepted is that he died obedient to God and that his salvation is assured,&#8221; said Hood.</p>
<p>At church service on Saturday, a week after Coots died, both Cody Coots and his mother handled the rattler that killed his father, said Williamson, who attended the service. Calls to the Coots family have not been returned.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2000533" alt="snakehandler_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>Williamson said he has documented 91 snake bite deaths among serpent handlers since 1919; Each year, about five people die from snake bites in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Williamson said questions of why a snake-handling believer dies from a bite are no different from the questions believers of various faiths have about why bad things happen to good people.</p>
<p>Coots&#8217; death was the second snake bite death at his church, which was founded in 1978. Melinda Brown, a 28-year-old mother of five, died in 1995, two days after she was bitten by a rattlesnake during a service.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/k1-BhaX5GSE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>Coots was then a 23-year-old pastor, and Brown spent the two days it took her to die at Coots&#8217; house. At the time, Coots told reporters that Brown had decided to put her fate in God&#8217;s hands rather than go to the hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything that happened, where it happened, was the Lord&#8217;s will,&#8221; Coots said.</p>
<p>Brown&#8217;s husband, John Wayne &#8220;Punkin&#8221; Brown, continued to handle serpents after his wife&#8217;s death. He was killed by a snake in 1998, at the age of 34, while preaching at an Alabama church.</p>
<p>His last words to the congregation were, &#8220;No matter what else, God&#8217;s still God.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000528&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kerry left Monday for the Ukrainian capital. The European Union&#8217;s foreign ministers, meantime, issued a Thursday deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull back his troops or face a rejection of visa liberalization and economic cooperation negotiations long in the works.</p>
<p>Sanctions from the European Union would cut off Russian exports of natural gas, uranium and coal to its largest customer. Still, Western governments acknowledge that there are few options beyond economic and diplomatic penalties.

<p>Winter weather shut down much of Washington on Monday, although the snowfall wasn&#8217;t as bad as predicted.</p>
<p>Snow covered a thin layer of ice in the capital city early Monday, and officials warned people to stay off treacherous  roads. Schools were canceled, bus service was halted in places and federal government workers in the DC area were told to stay home Monday.</p>
<p>Up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow were forecast from Baltimore to Washington _ lower than earlier predictions but enough to cause headaches for the region. The latest frigid blow of the harsh winter threatened as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of snow by the end of the day in Washington, Baltimore and elsewhere in the Mid-Atlantic region. Up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of snow was predicted to the north in Philadelphia, while nearly a foot (30 centimeters) of snow was expected in parts of New Jersey.</p>
<p>Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency. School systems in Baltimore, Washington and many suburban areas were closed, as were all Smithsonian museums except for the National Air and Space Museum. However, the U.S. Supreme Court was expected to be open and had arguments scheduled for Monday.</p>
<p>More than 2,600 flights in the United States were canceled as of Monday morning, according to flight tracking site  FlightAware.com. The bulk of the problems were at airports in Washington, New York and Philadelphia.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000466&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama-llll.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000435 " alt="Obama government provide a package of assistance to the Ukrainians, to the people and that government (AP photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama-llll.jpg" /></a> Obama said that he spent the weekend talking to leaders across Europe. (AP photo)
<p>US President Barack Obama has said Russia was on the &#8220;wrong side of history&#8221; and its invasion in Ukraine was an attack on sovereignty of a nation, warning that he was considering economic and diplomatic options to punish Moscow if it didn&#8217;t reverse course quickly.</p>
<p>Obama asserted that America&#8217;s interest was in seeing the Ukrainian people be able to determine their own destiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;My interest is seeing the Ukrainian people be able to determine their own destiny,&#8221; Obama told White House reporters in a joint press availability with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia has strong historic ties to the Ukraine&#8230;There are strong commercial ties between those two countries. And so all of those interests I think can be recognized. But what cannot be done is for Russia, with impunity, to put its soldiers on the ground and violate basic principles that are recognized around the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Asserting that the US and its global partners were supportive of the interim Ukrainian government, Obama said &#8220;the strong condemnation that it has received from countries around the world indicates the degree to which Russia is on the wrong side of history on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secretary of State John Kerry will be travelling to Kiev to indicate the US support for the Ukrainian people, to offer very specific and concrete packages of economic aid &#8212; because one of the things the US concerned about is stabilising the economy even in the midst of this crisis, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are also indicating to the Russians is that if, in fact, they continue on the current trajectory that they&#8217;re on, that we are examining a whole series of steps &#8211; economic, diplomatic &#8211; that will isolate Russia and will have a negative impact on Russia&#8217;s economy and its status,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve already suspended preparations for the G8 summit. I think you can expect that there would be further follow-up on that. We are taking a look a whole range of issues that John Kerry mentioned on Monday,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>Obama said that he spent the weekend talking to leaders across Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the world is largely united in recognising that the steps Russia has taken are a violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty, Ukraine&#8217;s territorial integrity; that they&#8217;re a violation of international law; they&#8217;re a violation of previous agreements that Russia has made with respect to how it treats and respects its neighbours,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, as a consequence, we got strong statements from NATO, from the G7, condemning the actions that Russia has taken. We are going to continue these diplomatic efforts during the course of this week,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question for the Russian government generally is if their concern is the rights of all Ukrainians are respected, if, in fact, their primary concern, as they&#8217;ve stated, is that Russian speakers and Russian nationals are not in any way harmed or abused or discriminated against, then we should be able to set up international monitors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And an international effort that mediates between various parties, that is able to broker a deal that is satisfactory to the Ukrainian people &#8212; not to the United States, not to Russia, but to the Ukrainian people &#8212; and we should be able to deescalate the situation,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>The US, he said, has been very specific with the Russians about how that might be done under the auspices of either the United States or the OSCE, or some other international organisation.</p>
<p>&#8220;So there are really two paths that Russia can take at this point. Obviously, the facts on the ground in Crimea are deeply troubling and Russia has a large army that borders Ukraine. But what is also true is that over time this will be a costly proposition for Russia. And now is the time for them to consider whether they can serve their interests in a way that resorts to diplomacy as opposed to force,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Referring to the calls being made from the Congress about doing something, Obama said one thing they can do right away is to work with the administration to help provide a package of assistance to the Ukrainians, to the people and that government.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they get back in, assuming the weather clears, I would hope that would be the first order of business. Because at this stage there should be unanimity among Democrats and Republicans that when it comes to preserving the principle that no country has the right to send in troops to another country unprovoked, we should be able to come up with a unified position that stands outside of partisan politics,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And my expectation is that I&#8217;ll be able to get Congress to work with us in order to achieve that goal,&#8221; Obama said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000416&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/billgates.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000381" alt="Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is back on top of the list of the world's richest people. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/billgates.jpg" /></a> Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is back on top of the list of the world&#8217;s richest people. (AP)
<p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is back on top of the list of the world&#8217;s richest people.</p>
<p>Forbes magazine announced its ranking of the world&#8217;s billionaires on Monday.</p>
<p>Gates, who led the list for 15 of the past 20 years, won the spot back from Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu, who had topped the list for the past four years. Gates&#8217; net worth is estimated at $76 billion; Slim Helu follows at $72 billion.</p>
<p>Spanish clothing magnate Amancio Ortega, known for the Zara retail chain, maintained his third-ranked spot and came out ahead of famed US investor Warren Buffett, who ranked fourth. Larry Ellison of Oracle came in fifth.</p>
<p>Forbes says a record 1,645 billionaires made the list this year, with an average net worth of $4.7 billion. That&#8217;s up from 1,426 billionaires last year with a net worth of $4.2 billion. Total net worth of this year&#8217;s list was $6.4 trillion, up from $5.4 trillion last year.</p>
<p>The magazine said that 1,080 of the billionaires were self-made, 207 inherited their wealth and 352 inherited a portion but are still growing it.</p>
<p>The largest net worth gainer on the list was Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, who more than doubled his fortune to $28.5 billion as the value of his company&#8217;s stock soared. He ranks 21st on the list.</p>
<p>The social media giant helped bring a few notable newcomers to the list, including Facebook&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, who recently sold their business to Facebook for $19 billion.</p>
<p>Forbes said 268 billionaires were new to the list, beating out a prior high of 226 newcomers in 2008. And a record number of women made the list this year, with 172 women joining, up 25 percent from last year.</p>
<p>Altogether 100 people dropped out of the rankings, while 16 passed away.</p>
<p>The US was the country with the greatest number of billionaires at 492, followed by China with 152 and Russia with 111. Billionaires from four new countries joined, adding Algeria, Lithuania, Tanzania and Uganda to the geographic mix.</p>

<p>At least 32 Indian fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy for allegedly poaching in the country&#8217;s waters off the coast of the Delft islet in Jaffna.</p>
<p>Their eight trawlers were seized  on Monday, a Naval spokesman said. The fishermen were being taken to the port of Kankesanturai to be handed over to the fisheries surveillance officials, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>Commenting on the arrest, fisheries ministry spokesman Narendra Rajapaksa said the Indian fishermen had violated accord reached during January&#8217;s bilateral fishing talks to stop bottom trawling.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000284&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The US has said its Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Pakistan again, refusing the allegations that America does not want to see peace in the south Asian country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our actions and our efforts, including the recent strategic dialogue we had with Pakistan, and our ongoing engagement the Secretary (of State) was there last summer; (and) he said he hopes to go again,&#8221; State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters during a conference call on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an ongoing  a vital shared strategic interest with the government of Pakistan in ending terrorism and pursuing a stable, peaceful and prosperous region,&#8221; she said responding to a question on the allegations made by the Pakistani politician Imran Khan that the US does not want peace in his country.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the proof is in the pudding, and we remain very closely tied with the government of Pakistan in fighting terrorism and coordinate it with them in that effort as well,&#8221; Psaki said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000229&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>British Prime Minister David Cameron, <a title="Angela Merkel tells Putin to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/angela-merkel-tells-putin-to-respect-ukraines-territorial-integrity/" target="_blank">German Chancellor Angela Merkel </a>and French President Francoise Hollande warned of  repercussions for Russia over its &#8220;completely unacceptable&#8221; actions in Ukraine.</p>
<p><a title="British government boycotts Sochi Paralympics over Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/british-government-boycotts-sochi-paralympics-over-ukraine/" target="_blank">Cameron </a>spoke separately to both leaders about the escalating crisis, and agreed that a joint response was needed, according to a spokesman from Cameron&#8217;s office. &#8220;In both calls, the leaders agreed that the international community should speak with one voice and send a clear message to Russia that its actions in Ukraine were completely unacceptable,&#8221;said the statement on Monday.</p>
<p>A special European Council has been called for Thursday, and the three leaders agreed &#8220;it would be important to be clear about the costs and consequences for the <a title="Ukraine says Russia issues ultimatum to surrender or face an all-out assault" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/ukraine-says-russia-issues-ultimatum-to-surrender-or-face-an-all-out-assault/" target="_blank">Russian government </a>of continuing to violate Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty,&#8221;said the spokesman. The trio vowed to support the Ukrainian people and government and also suggested a major role for the United Nations and other international organisations in resolving the crisis.</p>
<p>Cameron earlier earned that Russia will face diplomatic, political, and economic pressure in response to its violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty. Cameron, who chaired a meeting of British military and security chiefs in London to discuss the crisis, said the world needed to send a &#8220;clear message&#8221; to Moscow.</p>
<p>He said &#8220;What we want to see is a de-escalation rather than a continuation down the path that the Russian government has taken, violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another country. &#8221; So we shall have to bring to bear diplomatic, political, economic and other pressures in order to make this point. &#8220;That is the very clear message the whole world needs to send to  the Russian government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cameron was speaking after <a title="Obama calls leaders of UK, Poland and Germany on Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/obama-calls-leaders-of-uk-poland-and-germany-on-ukraine/" target="_blank">Ukraine&#8217;s</a> military said Russia had issued an ultimatum to Ukrainian forces to surrender in the Crimea or face an all-out assault on the Black Sea peninsula. The Russian Black Sea fleet dismissed the claims as &#8220;nonsense&#8221;, but Cameron said the reports were &#8220;deeply concerning&#8221;, adding that &#8220;we all want to see stability and countries obeying the  rule of law&#8221;. British Foreign Secretary William Hague warned Russia on Monday of &#8220;consequences and costs&#8221; as he met Ukraine&#8217;s new Western-backed leaders in Kiev.</p>
<p>&#8220;This cannot be the way in the 21st century to conduct international affairs,&#8221; Hague said. &#8220;It is not an acceptable way to  behave and there will be consequences and costs,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000238&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>STEVEN ERLANGER</strong></p>
<p>Western nations sought a political and economic response to the crisis in Ukraine Monday as Russia strengthened its hold on Crimea and more pro-Russian demonstrations were taking place in the big cities of Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>There were unconfirmed reports the commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, headquartered in the Crimea port of Sevastopol, had ordered Ukrainian forces in Crimea to surrender by 5 am Tuesday local time — 10 pm Monday Eastern Standard Time — or face assault by Russian forces. But Russia’s Foreign Ministry issued a conflicting statement, saying the Black Sea Fleet was not involved.</p>
<p>The EU foreign ministers met in emergency session in Brussels to discuss possible punitive steps against Russia unless it pulled its troops back to its own bases in Crimea, including suspension of talks with Moscow on visa liberalization. But France and Germany said sanctions were not on the table, urging dialogue first.</p>
<p>Visiting the new government in Kiev, British Foreign Secretary William Hague urged Russia to pull back its forces in Crimea or face “significant costs”, echoing comments made by President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, who was due here Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hague also emphasized diplomacy. “The world cannot just allow this to happen,” he told BBC. “The world cannot say it’s OK in effect to violate the sovereignty of another nation in this way.”</p>
<p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V Lavrov, responded that Russia was only protecting its interests and those of Russian citizens in Ukraine. The use of Russian troops is necessary “until the normalization of the political situation” in Ukraine, he said at an opening of a monthlong session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. “We are talking here about protection of our citizens and compatriots, about protection of the most fundamental of the human rights &#8211; the right to live, and nothing more.” But he did not specify what threats Russian citizens faced from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Crimea was relatively calm, with Russian forces continuing their military standoffs around Ukrainian bases to neutralize them and seek their surrender. The Ukrainian military personnel were effectively hostages, hemmed in by Russian troops.</p>
<p>In Donetsk, however, in eastern Ukraine, Yanukovych’s native region, a large pro-Russian demonstration led to some violence. About 1,000 pro-Russian demonstrators occupied the first floor of the regional government building that has already been flying the Russian flag for several days. The protesters, waving Russian flags and shouting, “Putin, come!”, were unable to go higher because lifts were disabled and stairwell doors shut. They had entered through a side door after confronting police, who were guarding the front entrance.</p>
<p>The rally seemed the latest in a series in eastern cities that Kiev says are encouraged or even organized by Russia.</p>
<p>The Donetsk protest leader, Pavel Gubarev, demanded that the parliament in Kiev be declared illegitimate, a pro-Russian governor be accepted in Donetsk and all security forces be put under regional command, much as has happened already in Crimea.</p>
<p>In Sevastopol, at the headquarters of Ukraine’s naval forces, six heavily armed men in unmarked uniforms and masks stood outside, cheered on by locals waving Russian flags and loudly proclaiming loyalties.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000183&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/crimea-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999924" alt="People stand aboard the Ukrainian navy corvette Ternopil vessel as it stands at harbor in Sevastopol.

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ukraine&#8217;s military said on Tuesday that Russia had given its forces an ultimatum to <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/russia-demands-2-ukraine-warships-surrender-or-face-seizing-of-ships/" target="_blank">surrender</a> in Crimea or face an all-out assault on the strategic Black Sea peninsula that has been overrun by Kremlin-backed troops.</span></p>
<p>But Russia&#8217;s Black Fleet swiftly denied any such demand and the country&#8217;s parliament speaker said there was no need yet for Moscow to use its &#8220;right&#8221; to launch military action in Ukraine. &#8220;The ultimatum is to recognise the new Crimean authorities, lay down our weapons and leave, or be ready for an assault,&#8221; regional Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov told AFP in the Crimean capital Simferopol.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be at 1:00 am, 2:00 am, 3:00 am (Tuesday). There are different times,&#8221; he said. Ukraine has accused Russia of pouring more troops into Crimea as world leaders grappled with Europe&#8217;s worst standoff since the Cold War. Crimea &#8211; the strategic host to Tsarist and Kremlin navies since the 18th century &#8211; has been under de-facto occupation by Moscow-backed forces who have raised Russian flag over government buildings and blocked Ukrainians troops inside their barracks across the peninsula.</p>
<p>The new leaders in Kiev branded Russia&#8217;s actions a declaration of &#8220;war&#8221; and jittery global markets plunged on Monday over fears of a conflict while the price of oil surged. The Moscow market alone at one stage lost 13 per cent on a Black Monday of trading that saw the ruble hit historic lows.</p>
<p>World leaders were holding a series of urgent meetings and telephone conversations to try to avert a conflict and also to help Ukraine avert a possible catastrophic debt default.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999922&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Osama bin Laden&#8217;s son-in-law was introduced to prospective jurors on Monday at the start of his trial on charges that he conspired to kill Americans and support terrorists in his role as al-Qaida&#8217;s spokesman after the Sept. 11 attacks.</span></p>
<p>Sulaiman Abu Ghaith is the highest-ranking al-Qaida figure to face trial on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks. The government plans to show jurors during its opening statement a picture of Abu Ghaith seated with bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders on the day after Sept. 11, 2001, as they make statements about the attacks.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan asked Abu Ghaith to turn and face the potential jurors before asking if any knew him. None did. The judge drew silence as well when he asked if there was anyone who had never heard of al-Qaida.</p>
<p>The questioning was part of a process designed to shrink a jury pool of dozens of prospective jurors to the 12 anonymous jurors and several alternates necessary before opening statements begin as early as Wednesday.</p>
<p>The trial, expected to last about three weeks, began a year after Abu Ghaith was brought to the United States following his capture in Jordan.</p>
<p>Kaplan told prospective jurors that the intent of the trial was to decide whether Abu Ghaith had conspired to kill Americans, whether he conspired to provide material support and resources to terrorists and whether he actually supplied material support and resources to terrorists.</p>
<p>Prosecution evidence also will include post-9/11 videos in which the charismatic bearded man promises more attacks on the United States as devastating as those that destroyed the World Trade Center. &#8220;The Americans must know that the storm of airplanes will not stop, God willing, and there are thousands of young people who are as keen about death as Americans are about life,&#8221; Abu Ghaith said in an Oct. 9, 2001, speech.</p>
<p>In one widely circulated propaganda video, Abu Ghaith can be seen sitting with bin Laden and current al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri against a rocky backdrop. Defense lawyers for the balding and bearded defendant, who wore a beige suit to court Monday, asserted last week that some of the government&#8217;s evidence relates to a detainee at Guantanamo Bay with a similar name to Abu Ghaith rather than to the defendant, who has pleaded not guilty. Kaplan on Friday called the mistaken identity claim &#8220;utterly meritless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith&#8217;s attorneys are also trying to enlist help from professed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed to bolster the case for acquittal, though it hasn&#8217;t come fast enough for them to gain permission from Kaplan for Mohammed to testify, perhaps through a video link to Guantanamo Bay. If convicted, Abu Ghaith could face life in prison.</p>
<p>The Kuwaiti-born defendant was flown to the United States a year ago from Jordan, where he was captured as he headed to Kuwait, which had revoked his citizenship after 9/11.</p>
<p>In an affidavit, Abu Ghaith said he left Afghanistan in 2002 and entered Iran, where he was arrested and held in prisons and interrogated extensively. He said he was heading home to Kuwait to see family when his flight landed instead in Amman, Jordan, where he was handcuffed and turned over to American authorities.</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith is married to bin Laden&#8217;s eldest daughter, Fatima, one of nearly two dozen children bin Laden was believed to have fathered before he was killed in Pakistan by U.S. special forces in 2011. Before heading to Afghanistan in 2000, Abu Ghaith was an imam at a Kuwaiti mosque.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999914&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian Hindus including two women have been barred from entering the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib near here as they had no visa to enter the district, where the Sikh shrine is located.</p>
<p>A source in Evacuee Trust Property Board told PTI that the Hindus &#8211; Vaneet Gupta, Neelam Gupta, Narindar Kumar, Hari Om and Vijay Lakhshami &#8211; reached Gurdwara Janamasthan, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, by a car from Lahore yesterday. The Gurdwara authorities, however, handed them over to the ETPB officials after finding that they had no visa on their passports for the district, some 80 kilometres from Lahore.</p>
<p>When asked about the alleged visa violation, the Hindus said they &#8220;wanted to visit the Sikh holy place out of respect&#8221;, the source said.</p>
<p>The Hindus had come here to attend festivities in connection with the &#8216;Shivratri&#8217; at historic Katasraj Mandir in Chakwal district, some 250 kilometres from here. When contacted, Deputy Secretary (Hindu Affairs) Azhar Sulahry said the Hindus in question had visa for Lahore and Chakwal only.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hindu pilgrims were sent back to Gurdawar Dera Sahib Lahore from Nankana and today they left for India along with other members of the group,&#8221; he said. Over 150 Hindu pilgrims had arrived here on February 25 to attend the Shivratri festival at the Katasraj Mandir.</p>
<p>While accepting in principle invitation by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit that country, Singh had made it clear that he would undertake the trip only if there is a possibility of a &#8220;substantive&#8221; outcome. India has been unhappy over the slow pace of progress in the trial of the 26/11 Mumbai attackers in Pakistan and feels that Islamabad is deliberately dragging its feet in ensuring that the culprits are punished.</p>
<p>New Delhi is also agitated that Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafeez Sayeed is being permitted to roam around free in Pakistan and also make provocative anti-India speeches.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999817&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Military clashes between China and Japan cannot be ruled out and the People&#8217;s Liberation Army will fight back if provoked, a top Chinese official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;At present we cannot completely rule out the possibility of clashes in East Asia, but it is not decided by China,&#8221; said Qian Lihua, a member of China&#8217;s top political advisory body, the National Committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>The Chinese army will not stir up a war but will fight back against any provocation, Qian, a major general who used to head the foreign affairs office under the Ministry of National Defence, was quoted by state-run Xinhua news agency as saying.</p>
<p>His comments came amid reports that Japan is forming a new amphibious force to deal with any invasion of the islands held by it in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>China and Japan are at loggerheads over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands and relations between the two countries have steadily deteriorated in recent months.</p>
<p>Qian said it is impossible and impractical for Japan&#8217;s right-wing forces or militarism forces to cause big trouble, chaos, conflicts and even wars against China as the country was not in the same situation as in 1894 or in the 1930s, when Japan waged two wars against China.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese army and the Chinese people are capable of containing the development of Japan&#8217;s militarism and will prevent them from making trouble around China,&#8221; Qian added.</p>
<p>China will make efforts to control risk, prevent conflict escalation and try to bring the China-Japan relation back on the right track, he said.</p>
<p>No country wants to have wars considering the current economic difficulties. &#8220;If there is a war, it will only damage the hard-earned economic recovery,&#8221; Qian said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999511&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukraine.jpg"><img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukraine.jpg" alt="Unidentified armed men patrol around a Ukraine&#039;s infantry base in Perevalne, Ukraine, Sunday, March 2, 2014." class="size-full wp-image-1999369" /></a> Unidentified armed men patrol around a Ukraine&#8217;s infantry base in Perevalne, Ukraine, Sunday, March 2, 2014.
<p>Pro-Russian troops today took over a ferry terminal on the easternmost tip of Crimea close to Russia, exacerbating fears that Moscow is planning to bring even more troops into this strategic Black Sea region.</p>
<p>The seizure of the terminal in the Ukrainian city of Kerch about 20 kilometres by boat to Russia, comes as the West try to figure out ways to halt and reverse the Russian incursion.</p>
<p>Early today, soldiers were operating the terminal, which serves as a common departure point for many Russian-bound ships. The men refused to identify themselves, but they spoke Russian and the vehicles transporting them had Russian license plates.</p>
<p>Ukraine said that they are the same Russian soldiers who have occupied airports in Crimea, smashed equipment at an air base and besieged a Ukrainian infantry base in this peninsula.</p>
<p>Outrage over Russia&#8217;s military moves mounted in world capitals, with US Secretary of State John Kerry calling on President Vladimir Putin to pull back from <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/world-scrambles-as-russia-tightens-grip-on-crimea/" target="_blank">&#8220;an incredible act of aggression.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>A day after Russia captured the Crimean Peninsula without firing a shot, fears grew in the Ukrainian capital and beyond that Russia might seek to expand its control by seizing other parts of eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Senior Obama administration officials said the US now believes that Russia has complete operational control of Crimea, a pro-Russian area of the country, and has more than 6,000 troops in the region.</p>
<p>Faced with the Russian threat, Ukraine&#8217;s new government moved to consolidate its authority, naming new regional governors in the pro-Russia east, enlisting the support of the country&#8217;s wealthy businessmen and dismissing the head of the country&#8217;s navy after he declared allegiance to the pro-Russian government in Crimea.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was no reason for Russia to invade Ukraine and warned that &#8220;we are on the brink of disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that our Western partners and the entire global community will support the territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine,&#8221; he said yesterday in Kiev.</p>
<p>World leaders rushed to try to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. NATO held an emergency meeting in Brussels, Britain&#8217;s foreign minister flew to Kiev to support its new government and Kerry was to travel to Ukraine tomorrow.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998560&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kunming-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997827" alt="With a heavy police presence, normal operations have resumed and passengers can walk into and out of the station with no new restrictions. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kunming-480.jpg" /></a> With a heavy police presence, normal operations have resumed and passengers can walk into and out of the station with no new restrictions. (AP)
<p>Chinese police have launched a manhunt to capture five militants from Xinjiang who reportedly fled after taking part in the deadly knife attacks at a railway station in Kunming city in which 33 people were killed and 143 others injured.</p>
<p>Four of the attackers were killed, while one woman militant who was injured was captured after the incident yesterday.  A search is on for the other militants, stated to be from the banned separatist East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an al-Qaeda-backed outfit.</p>
<p>ETIM, is active in the northwestern Xinjiang province which has witnessed deep ethnic unrest between native Muslim Uyghurs and Han settlers from mainland China in recent years. The Kunming municipal government said that evidence at the crime scene showed that the Kunming station attack was orchestrated by separatist forces from Xinjiang.</p>
<p>No further details have been given.</p>
<p>Thirty-three people including four militants were killed in the attacks and 143 injured, 33 of them seriously. A group of  10 attackers hailing from Xinjiang attacked the crowed with large knives hacking people indiscriminately, Chinese security officials said.  The attack lasted about 25 minutes after which the remaining militants escaped.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a semblance of normalcy has returned to Kunming city after the gruesome knife attacks. Order has been restored in Kunming, capital of southwest China&#8217;s Yunnan Province, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.  At the train station where the attacks happened, train arrivals resumed yesterday after three trains were disrupted. Part of a major road in front of the railway station is still under traffic control and a waiting area on a square east of the station has been cordoned off.</p>
<p>With a heavy police presence, normal operations have resumed and passengers can walk into and out of the station with no new restrictions. Security screening of passengers and luggage is being carried out and staff are maintaining  order in more crowded areas.</p>
<p>Security has been beefed up at the city&#8217;s Changshui International Airport, with increased security personnel and tougher scrutiny of passengers and luggage. The foreign affairs office of the Yunnan provincial government said there were no reports that foreigners were killed or injured in the attacks. Neither are Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao citizens among the victims.</p>
<p>President Xi Jinping has ordered law enforcement agencies to strike out with full force and bring those accountable to  justice as as soon as possible. Xi urged the greatest efforts to treat the injured and help those who have lost their loved ones. Premier Li Keqiang has ordered police forces nationwide to beef up security, particularly at public places of big crowds.</p>
<p>Senior Chinese security official Meng Jianzhu is in Kunming overseeing the security situation. Separately, the city&#8217;s  education authorities said all local middle and primary schools will open as normal on Monday but with enhanced security.  School officials will be on duty before and after class and police officers will be patrolling school campuses and surrounding areas. Following reports of shortage of blood for the injured, more than 2,000 Kunming citizens have donated 560,000 millilitres of blood so far.</p>
<p>A total of 27 medical experts have been dispatched to Kunming to help the treatment of victims, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said on Monday. The experts were recruited from 12 hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu,  Guangzhou and other cities.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997744&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the threat of a showdown between Russia and the West over Ukraine loomed large, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has deplored Moscow&#8217;s military build up on the Crimean peninsula and called on President Vladimir Putin to respect the country&#8217;s territorial integrity.</p>
<p>Merkel told Putin in a telephone call last night that his country has violated international law with its &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; military intervention in Crimea, a government spokesman said.</p>
<p>She reminded Putin that under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, his country is committed to respect the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine and its existing borders.</p>
<p>Russia also violated the 1997 treaty with Ukraine on stationing its Black Sea fleet in Crimea, Merkel told Putin.</p>
<p>Putin defended Russia&#8217;s military intervention in Crimea, but accepted a dialogue offer from Merkel, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He told Merkel that the steps taken by his government were intended to defend Russia&#8217;s interests and to protect the Russian citizens and Russian-speaking population in Ukraine, who feel threatened by the events in Crimea and in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Russian president agreed to Merkel&#8217;s proposal to create a &#8220;contact group&#8221; to explore the possibilities for a political solution to the present crisis in Ukraine and to send a fact-finding mission there, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The chancellor also spoke to US President Barack Obama last night, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the G-7 group of leading industrialised nations have suspended their preparations for their next summit in Sochi in southern Russia in June, in response to the country&#8217;s military intervention in Crimea.</p>
<p>In a joint statement issued by the White House in Washington, the group comprising the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, Japan and Italy said Russia&#8217;s actions in Ukraine &#8220;contravenes the principles and values on which the G-7 and G-8 operate&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;As such, we have decided for the time being to suspend the participation in activities associated with the preparation of the scheduled G-8 summit in Sochi in June until the environment comes back where the G-8 is able to have meaningful discussions,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>The G-7 nations condemned Russia&#8217;s &#8220;clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in contravention of Russia&#8217;s obligations under the UN charter and its 1997 basing agreement with Ukraine,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>They called on the Russian government to address any ongoing security or human rights concerns it has with Ukraine through direct negotiations or through international mediation or observation under the auspices of the UN or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the statement said.</p>
<p>The G-7 nations &#8220;are united in supporting Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and its right to chose its own future&#8221;.</p>
<p>They also pledged their support for Ukraine in its efforts to restore unity, stability and political and economic health in the country.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998154&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/oscar1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997740" alt="In this Monday, Aug. 19, 2013 file photo, Oscar Pistorius cries as he prays with his sister Aimee, right, and brother Carl in the magistrates court in Pretoria, South Africa. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/oscar1.jpg" /></a> In this Monday, Aug. 19, 2013 file photo, Oscar Pistorius cries as he prays with his sister Aimee, right, and brother Carl in the magistrates court in Pretoria, South Africa. (AP)
<p>&#8220;Blade Runner&#8221; <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/oscar-pistorius/" target="_blank">Oscar Pistorius</a> arrived at the Pretoria High Court on Monday for the start of his murder trial, opening a decisive chapter in the story of the rise and fall of one of the world&#8217;s best known athletes.</p>
<p>The first witness at Oscar Pistorius&#8217; murder trial told the court on Monday she heard &#8220;blood-curdling&#8221; screams from a woman followed by four shots, offering dramatic testimony of the incident in which Pistorius shot dead his girlfriend last year.</p>
<p>Taking the stand just after the Olympic and Paralympic star pleaded not guilty to murdering 29-year-old model Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine&#8217;s Day last year, Michelle Burger, who lived in a nearby estate, told of being woken in the middle of the night by a woman screaming and shouting for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was still sitting in the bed and I heard her screams,&#8221; Burger said, speaking in Afrikaans through an interpreter. &#8220;She screamed terribly and she yelled for help. Then I also heard a man screaming for help. Three times he yelled for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just after her screams, I heard four shots. Four gunshots &#8230; &#8216;Bang &#8230;bang, bang, bang&#8217;,&#8221; she said, her voice cracking with emotion. At Burger&#8217;s request, her testimony was not shown on television, but the audio was broadcast live.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very traumatic for me. You could hear that it was blood-curdling screams,&#8221; Burger added.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old Pistorius, who was born without legs but reached the 2012 Olympic 400 metres semi-final running on carbon-fibre &#8220;blades&#8221;, argues that the killing of law graduate Steenkamp was a tragic case of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>He says he mistook her for an intruder hiding in the upstairs toilet of his luxury Pretoria home.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997737&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dccccccccc.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997733" alt="Cameron tweeted because of the serious situation in Ukraine, it would be wrong for UK Ministers to attend the Sochi Paralympics.&quot;" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dccccccccc.jpg" /></a> Cameron tweeted because of the serious situation in Ukraine, it would be wrong for UK Ministers to attend the Sochi Paralympics.

<p>The British government will boycott the Winter Paralympics in Sochi over host Russia&#8217;s military action in Ukraine, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.</p>
<p>The British premier on Sunday said he and Foreign Secretary William Hague thought it would be &#8220;wrong&#8221; for ministers to go to the Games, which start on Friday, given the unfolding events in nearby Ukraine.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth II&#8217;s youngest son, Prince Edward, who is patron of the British Paralympic Association, &#8220;has, on the advice of government, cancelled a planned visit to Russia&#8221; to attend the Games.</p>
<p>A Downing Street spokesman said Cameron was &#8220;gravely concerned&#8221; about the situation in Ukraine. Hague is in Kiev to meet the new Ukrainian authorities, make clear London&#8217;s support for them and to urge continued restraint.</p>
<p>He tweeted after meeting Ukrainian political leaders that the &#8220;violation&#8221; of the former Soviet republic&#8217;s sovereignty was &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;. Hague announced earlier that Britain would not take part in preparatory meetings this week in Russia for the G8 summit, due to be held in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in June.</p>
<p>&#8220;In current circumstances, the prime minister is clear that the focus of our engagement with Russia must be the situation in Ukraine, rather than other normal business,&#8221; the Downing Street spokesman said.</p>
<p>Ukraine warned Sunday it was on the brink of disaster and called up military reservists after Russia&#8217;s threat to invade its Western-leaning neighbour risked sparking the worst crisis since the Cold War.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prime minister remains gravely concerned about events in Ukraine and is determined to pursue all avenues to reduce tensions and de-escalate a very dangerous situation,&#8221; said the Downing Street spokesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;A stable Ukraine is in the interests of everyone. &#8220;The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine has been violated and this cannot be the way to conduct international affairs.&#8221; He added that Cameron and Hague &#8220;have also decided that it would be inappropriate for UK ministers to attend the Sochi Paralympics in current circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prime minister remains fully supportive of our Paralympic athletes&#8217; participation at Sochi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cameron did not attend the Sochi Winter Olympics last month, though there is no tradition of British premiers attending the Winter Games.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997700&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP Photo)
<p>North Korea on Monday deported a 75-year-old Australian missionary detained since last month for allegedly distributing religious materials.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-based John Short was arrested after leaving  &#8220;Bible tracts&#8221; in a Buddhist temple in the capital Pyongyang during a tour.</p>
<p>The North&#8217;s state-run KCNA news agency said the &#8220;generous&#8221; decision to release and expel Short had been taken in light of his advanced age and a signed &#8220;confession&#8221; and apology.</p>
<p>A copy of Short&#8217;s statement was released along with photos showing him affixing his thumb in red ink to the document which he also signed and read out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realise that my actions are an indelible hostile act against the independent right and laws of the (North),&#8221; the confession read.</p>
<p>&#8220;I request forgiveness &#8230; and am willing to bow down on my knees,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Confessions and self-criticisms &#8212; scripted by the authorities &#8212; are normally a pre-requisite for detained foreigners seeking release in North Korea.</p>
<p>Short&#8217;s statement stated that US and other western media reports labelling the North as a closed country without religious freedoms were &#8220;inaccurate and wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although freedom of worship is enshrined in North Korea&#8217;s constitution, it does not exist in practice and religious activity is severely restricted to officially-recognised groups linked to the government.</p>
<p>In his statement, Short also admitted distributing religious texts on the Pyongyang subway during a previous tour to the North in 2012.</p>
<p>&#8220;I now realise the seriousness of my insult to the Korean people &#8230; and for this I truly apologise,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Australia has no diplomatic representation in North Korea, but its foreign ministry said it had confirmed Short&#8217;s release through the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly this is welcome news,&#8221; the ministry said.</p>
<p>She said the Australian authorities had told her he was believed to be on the flight to Beijing.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997586&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/uniaea.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997649" alt="IAEA said Iran was sticking to the nuclear freeze it agreed under the November interim deal. (AP Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/uniaea.jpg" /></a> IAEA said Iran was sticking to the nuclear freeze it agreed under the November interim deal. (AP Photo)
<p>Top International Atomic Energy Agency officials will meet on Monday to assess Iran&#8217;s compliance with a six-month nuclear freeze agreed under an interim deal with world powers last November.</p>
<p>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that despite &#8220;thousands of hours&#8221; of inspection, the United Nations&#8217; atomic watchdog had found no evidence of military objectives in Iran&#8217;s nuclear drive.</p>
<p>Rouhani spoke after Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday said nuclear negotiations were &#8220;going well&#8221;. &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping by the first deadline (July 20) we will reach an agreement,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the meeting of the IAEA&#8217;s 35-member Board of Governors &#8212; their second official parley this year&#8211; Iran will hold expert-level talks with world powers.</p>
<p>In its latest report on Iran last month, the IAEA said Iran was sticking to the nuclear freeze it agreed under the November interim deal. The watchdog&#8217;s report came a month after the deal came into force.</p>
<p>Iran and the so-called P5+1 group of world powers &#8212; UN Security Council members Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, plus Germany &#8212; are seeking to reach a lasting accord that would allay Western suspicions that Tehran&#8217;s nuclear activities mask military objectives.</p>
<p>As part of such a comprehensive deal, the six seek to pressure Iran over its ballistic missile programme, which could theoretically provide Tehran with a device to deliver a nuclear warhead, should it choose to build one.</p>
<p>The IAEA said last month  that uranium enrichment to medium levels &#8212; the main concern to the international community &#8212; &#8220;is no longer taking place&#8221;, as agreed in the November deal.</p>
<p>The IAEA also said that a proportion of Iran&#8217;s medium-enriched uranium stockpile &#8220;is being down-blended, and the remainder is being converted to uranium oxide&#8221;.</p>
<p>Enrichment to low purities however &#8220;continues at a rate of production similar to that indicated&#8221; in the last report from November, meaning that Iran&#8217;s stockpile of this material rose in the last three months.</p>
<p>This is consistent with the agreement with world powers, as long as by the end of the six-month period on July 20 the stockpile is not higher than at the start. Iran is currently building a facility to convert this type of material to oxide form, from which it would be more difficult to enrich to weapons grade, the IAEA report said.</p>
<p>In addition, Iran has not installed any additional uranium enrichment centrifuges at either of its facilities, Natanz and Fordo, according to the IAEA.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997496&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 11 people, including a judge, were killed and 25 others injured Monday when suicide attackers threw grenades and fired indiscriminately in the premises of a local court in Islamabad, Pakistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two gunmen when challenged blew themselves up. This was a suicide attack,&#8221; Inspector General of Police Sikandar Hayat told reporters.</p>
<p>Dr Ayesha of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences said 11 people were dead and over 25 were brought in as injured of whom five are in serious condition. He said majority of the killed and injured were young lawyers.</p>
<p>Additional Session Judge Rafaqat Ahmad Khan was among those killed.</p>
<p>The attack comes just days after Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said Islamabad was a safe city.</p>
<p>This is the first terrorist attack in the heart of Islamabad in a long time. A large number of expatriates stay in the F-8 area of the capital where the attack took place.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses said the gunmen, first threw grenades and then fired indiscriminately with assault rifles.</p>
<p>The incident happened around 9 AM and firing continued for nearly 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Rangers personnel and commandos secured the area after the attack and carried out search operations.</p>
<p>The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan spokesperson Shahidullah Shahid, who had announced a ceasefire two days back, announced that his group was not involved in the attack.</p>
<p>Chief Justice of Pakistan Tassaduq Hussain Jillani took notice of the attack. A three-member bench headed by the chief justice will hear the case regarding the attack tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Interior Secretary will also appear before the court along with Chief Commissioner of Islamabad and police chief.</p>
<p>The federal capital is heavily secured and is considered as one of the safest city in Pakistan. However, today&#8217;s attack has put the security lapses under scanner.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Interior Minister Nisar condemned the attack. Bar Councils across Pakistan have called for a strike today to condemn the blast.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997614&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The leaders stressed that the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia should start immediately.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997541&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1997550" alt="obama" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama.jpg" /></a> Earlier, President Obama had warned his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin against violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.
<p>US President Barack Obama and his European allies expressed &#8220;grave concern&#8221; over Russia&#8217;s violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, terming it a threat to international peace and security.</p>
<p>President Obama spoke separately with British Prime Minister David Cameron, Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski and German Chancellor Angela Merkel last afternoon and discussed the Ukrainian crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The leaders expressed their grave concern over Russia&#8217;s clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, which is a breach of international law and a threat to international peace and security,&#8221; the White House said in a statement yesterday.</p>
<p>They stressed that the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia should start immediately, with international facilitation as appropriate, it said.</p>
<p>The leaders affirmed the importance of unity within the international community in support of international law and their support for the Ukrainian government, including its territorial integrity and its efforts to move forward with elections in May so that the Ukrainian people can continue to determine their own future in this historic hour.</p>
<p>According to the White House, leaders pledged to work together on a package of multilateral and bilateral financial assistance to help Ukraine as it pursues urgently needed reforms to stabilise its economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The leaders agreed to continue to coordinate closely, including bilaterally, and through appropriate international organisations,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>Earlier, President Obama had warned his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin against violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and asked him to pull the forces back to their bases in Crimea or face political and economic isolation.</p>
<p><strong>Kerry will travel to Ukraine</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Kiev tomorrow to show support for the Ukrainian government after Russia&#8217;s intrusion into the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Kiev on March 4, Secretary Kerry will meet with senior representatives of Ukraine&#8217;s new government, leaders of the Rada, and members of civil society,&#8221; State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki said yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Secretary will reaffirm the United States&#8217; strong support for Ukrainian sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and the right of the Ukrainian people to determine their own future, without outside interference or provocation,&#8221; Psaki said.</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland will also travel to Vienna and Austria where she will meet with senior officials of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and represent the US at a special meeting of the OSCE permanent council on Ukraine.</p>
<p>Earlier, in an interview to the ABC News, Kerry hoped that the Russian military action in Ukraine is not going to be a disaster.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has already happened is a brazen act of aggression in violation of international law, in violation of the UN Charter, in violation of the Helsinki Final Act, in violation of the 1997 Ukraine-Russia basing agreement,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia has engaged in a military act of aggression against another country and it has huge risks. It&#8217;s a 19th century act in the 21st century that really puts at question Russia&#8217;s capacity to be within the G8,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are busy right now coordinating with our counterparts in many parts of the world,&#8221; he said, referring to the series of global outreach by the US leaders including President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not looking for a US-Russia, East-West redux here. What we want is for Russia to work with us, with Ukraine. If they have legitimate concerns about Russian-speaking people in Ukraine, there are plenty of ways to deal with that without invading the country,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have the ability to work with the government; they could work with us; they could work with the UN; they could call for observers to be put in the country. There are all kinds of alternatives. But Russia has chosen this aggressive act which really puts in question Russia&#8217;s role in the world and Russia&#8217;s willingness to be a modern nation and part of the G8,&#8221; Kerry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The invasion of Crimea has already happened. That&#8217;s absolutely accurate. And we believe that President Putin should make the decision to roll it back. And we will continue to press for that as well as for his legitimate engagement with the current Government of Ukraine in order to avoid further increase in the tension and the crisis,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997541&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Japan joined the <a title="Obama calls leaders of UK, Poland and Germany on Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/obama-calls-leaders-of-uk-poland-and-germany-on-ukraine/" target="_blank">United States</a> and its other allies on Monday in criticising Moscow&#8217;s decision to send troops into Ukraine , the foreign ministry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision by Russia on Saturday  on the authority for use of the armed forces of the Russian Federation in <a title="Putin takes on West over Ukraine, pins blame for stirring passions in Kiev" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/putin-takes-on-west-over-ukraine-blames-west-for-stirring-passions-in-kiev/" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> heightens the tension in the region and would harm the peace and stability of the international  community,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this regard, Japan expresses grave anxiety and concern over the decision,&#8221; it said. On Sunday, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius held telephone talks and agreed to closely cooperate on the situation in Ukraine, the foreign ministry has said.</p>
<p>On Monday it said &#8220;Japan strongly expects that the situation in Ukraine will be settled in a peaceful manner and strongly urges all the parties concerned to behave with maximum self-restraint and responsibility, to fully observe the relevant international laws.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997427&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/russia-support-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997277" alt="Some of the more than ten thousand of pro-Kremlin demonstrators holding a Russian flags march in central Moscow, Russia. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/russia-support-480.jpg" /></a> Some of the more than ten thousand of pro-Kremlin demonstrators holding a Russian flags march in central Moscow, Russia. (AP)
<p>Thousands marched freely through Moscow on Sunday in support of Russia using military force in neighbouring Ukraine, while at an anti-invasion protest nearby dozens were detained. Russian state television ratcheted up its pro-invasion rhetoric over the weekend and showed what it claimed were buses full of refugees pouring across the Ukrainian border, fleeing what anchors call the &#8220;fascist thugs&#8221; who took power after Russia-leaning President Viktor Yanukovych fled the country last week after months of protest.</p>
<p>At least 10,000 people waving Russian flags rallied in central Moscow. Some dressed in Soviet military uniforms and shouted slogans like &#8220;Fascism will not pass!&#8221; and &#8220;No to Nazism!&#8221; &#8211; evoking parallels with the repulsion of Hitler&#8217;s troops from Ukraine in World War II.<br /> <br />But at an anti-invasion protest near Red Square, dozens of demonstrators &#8211; one of whom held up just a blank piece of poster paper in protest &#8211; were quickly detained by police. The Associated Press witnessed more than 50 detentions and spotted at least five police vans, which carry between 15 and 20 protesters, driving away from the square.<br /> <br />Since parliament gave President Vladimir Putin the green light to use military force in Ukraine late on Saturday, the Russian leader has defied calls from the West to pull back his troops, insisting that Russia has a right to protect its interests and those of Russian-speakers in the strategic Black Sea region of Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine.<br /> <br />Russia&#8217;s state-controlled media has played almost nonstop footage of the Ukrainian crisis since the announcement, highlighting what it says are videos of attacks on pro-Russian activists by activists from Kiev or regions further west.<br /> <br />Russia on Sunday claimed that 675,000 of Ukraine&#8217;s population of 46 million had fled across the border to Russia, and showed the governors of Russia&#8217;s western-most regions gearing up to accept the flood of refugees. State-owned channel Russia One showed what it alleged were cars lining up to flee the border into Russia &#8211; but the sign marking the border was actually for Shegini, a town on Ukraine&#8217;s western border with Poland.<br /> <br />While many Russians have long believed Moscow should maintain strong ties with Ukraine&#8217;s east and south, the media campaign has helped nudge public opinion toward favouring more dramatic action. A poll by independent Levada Center released on Feb. 26 showed that 43 per cent of Russians considered the protests in Ukraine a &#8220;violent government coup,&#8221; while 45 per cent believed the protests were sponsored by Western governments attempting to win &#8220;geopolitical influence&#8221; in the region.<br /> <br />&#8220;We are one brotherly nation, we are all Russians in our souls,&#8221; said Galina Kravchuk, a retiree at the pro-invasion rally who said she had lived in Crimea all her life but was visiting her daughter in Moscow. &#8220;Those protesters (in Ukraine) are hired. They are paid by the West and by America.&#8221;<br /> <br />But among many at the rally, active support seemed paper thin. Many were delivered to the square by buses marked as city government property, and others confessed that they had been forced by their employers to attend. &#8220;The boss forced us to come,&#8221; said Elena, who wouldn&#8217;t give her last name for fear of repercussions at her workplace. &#8220;Do you really think that all these people came here voluntarily? Never.&#8221;</p>

<p>Igniting a tense standoff, Russian forces surrounded a Ukrainian army base Sunday just as the country began mobilizing its military in response to the surprise Russian takeover of Crimea. Outrage over Russia&#8217;s tactics mounted in world capitals, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry calling on<a title="Mass rally in Moscow in support of Russian invasion of Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/mass-rally-in-moscow-in-support-of-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/" target="_blank"> President Vladimir Putin</a> to pull back from &#8220;an incredible act of aggression.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fearing that Europe&#8217;s borders were being rewritten by force, world leaders rushed to find a diplomatic solution to reverse what had already happened on the ground: Russia captured the Black Sea peninsula on Saturday without firing a shot.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was no reason for Russia to invade Ukraine and warned that &#8220;we are on the brink of disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that our western partners and the entire global community will support the territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine,&#8221; he said Sunday in Kiev.</p>
<p>NATO held an emergency meeting in Brussels, Britain&#8217;s foreign minister flew to Kiev to support its new government and the U.S., France and Britain debated the possibility of boycotting the next Group of Eight economic summit, being held in June at Sochi, the host of Russia&#8217;s successful Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>In Kiev, <a title="Putin takes on West over Ukraine, pins blame for stirring passions in Kiev" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/putin-takes-on-west-over-ukraine-blames-west-for-stirring-passions-in-kiev/" target="_blank">Moscow</a> and other cities, thousands of protesters took to the streets to either decry the Russian occupation or celebrate Crimea&#8217;s return to its former ruler.</p>
<p>&#8220;Support us, America!&#8221; a handful of protesters chanted outside the U.S. Embassy in Kiev. One young girl held up a placard reading: &#8220;No Russian aggression!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia! Russia!&#8221; the crowd chanted in Moscow.</p>
<p>Kerry, interviewed Sunday on U.S. television news shows, talked about boycotting the G-8 summit, as well as possible visa bans, asset freezes and trade and investment penalties against Russia. Kerry said all the foreign ministers he had talked to were prepared &#8220;to go to the hilt&#8221; to isolate Russia.</p>
<p>Still, politicians were treading carefully, knowing it was a delicate time for Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are on a very dangerous track of increasing tensions,&#8221; German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said. &#8220;(But) it is still possible to turn around. A new division of Europe can still be prevented.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, however, Ukraine&#8217;s new government and other countries have been powerless to counter the stealth Russian military tactics. Armed men in uniforms without insignia have moved freely about Crimea for days, occupying airports, smashing equipment at an air base and besieging a Ukrainian infantry base.</p>
<p>Putin has defied calls from the West to pull back his troops, insisting that Russia has a right to protect its interests and those of Russian-speakers in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine. His confidence is matched by the knowledge that Ukraine&#8217;s 46 million people have divided loyalties between Russia and Europe. While much of western Ukraine wants closer ties with the 28-nation European Union, its eastern and southern regions like Crimea look to Russia for support.</p>
<p>Russia has long wanted to reclaim the lush Crimean Peninsula, which was part of its territory until 1954. Russia&#8217;s Black Sea Fleet pays Ukraine millions every year to be stationed at the Crimean port of Sevastopol and nearly 60 percent of Crimea&#8217;s residents identify themselves as Russian.</p>
<p>The new Ukrainian government came to power last week following months of pro-democracy protests against a pro-Russian president, Viktor Yanukovych, and his decision to turn Ukraine toward Russia instead of the EU. Yanukovych fled to Russia after more than 80 people were killed in the protests. He insists he&#8217;s still president.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, has ordered Ukraine&#8217;s armed forces to be on full alert and stepped-up security at nuclear power plants, airports and other strategic infrastructure. On Sunday, the government called reservists into action but no overt military actions by Ukraine were seen.</p>
<p>Turchynov also appointed 18 new regional governors, including two oligarchs in the eastern cities of Dneprotrovsk and Donetsk, as big business and the new Ukrainian government banded together against Russia.</p>
<p>Russian troops, meanwhile, pulled up to the Ukrainian military base at Perevalne on the Crimean Peninsula in a convoy Sunday that included at least 13 trucks and four armored vehicles with mounted machine guns. The trucks carried 30 soldiers each and had Russian license plates.</p>
<p>In response, a dozen Ukrainian soldiers, some with clips in their rifles, placed a tank at the base&#8217;s gate, leaving the two sides in a tense standoff. It appeared to be the first known case of outmatched Ukrainians standing up to Russian military might.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, civilians backing both Ukraine and Russia walked over to view the standoff at Perevalne, some shaking their heads in amazement in the geo-political developments right in their own town.</p>
<p>Unidentified soldiers were also seen cutting power to the headquarters of the Ukrainian Naval forces in Crimea — whose own commander defected later Sunday and pledged his allegiance to &#8220;the people of Crimea.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Ukrainian security official later said the head of the country&#8217;s Black Sea fleet — Adm. Denis Berezovsky — had been dismissed and faces a treason investigation after declaring allegiance to the pro-Russian government of the Crimea region and offering no resistance to the Russian troops.</p>
<p>The speaker of Crimea&#8217;s legislature, Vladimir Konstantinov, was quoted as saying local authorities do not recognize the new government in Kiev. He said a planned referendum on March 30 would ask voters about the region&#8217;s future status.</p>
<p>A convoy of hundreds of Russian troops was also seen heading toward Simferopol, the regional capital of Crimea. Armed men in military uniforms without markings strolled around Simferopol&#8217;s central plaza, Lenin Square, outside its Council of Ministers building.</p>
<p>In Brussels, NATO&#8217;s secretary general said Russia had violated the U.N. charter with its military action in Ukraine, and he urged Moscow to &#8220;de-escalate the tensions.&#8221; NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen spoke before a meeting Sunday of the alliance&#8217;s political decision-making body to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>Ukraine is not a NATO member, meaning the U.S. and Europe are not obligated to come to its defense. But Ukraine has taken part in some alliance military exercises.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very important that we all do everything we can to calm tensions,&#8221; said British Foreign Minister William Hague, who flew to Kiev on Sunday.&#8221; The Ukrainians have said to me in the last couple of days that they will not rise to provocations.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he has urged Russian officials to &#8220;speak directly to the Ukrainians&#8221; but so far they had not.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama talked with Putin by telephone for 90 minutes Saturday and expressed his &#8220;deep concern&#8221; about &#8220;Russia&#8217;s clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty.&#8221; Obama warned that Russia&#8217;s &#8220;continued violation of international law will lead to greater political and economic isolation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Moscow, at least 10,000 people bearing Russian flags marched freely through the city Sunday, while a few dozen demonstrating on Red Square against the invasion of Ukraine were quickly detained by Russian riot police.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand that the West wants to attack us and seize this territory. It (the West) is dangerous to us,&#8221; said Victor Sidelin, a Moscow resident at the march.</p>

<p>A Ukrainian security official says the head of the country&#8217;s Black Sea fleet has been dismissed and faces a treason investigation after declaring allegiance to the pro-Russian government of the Crimea region.</p>
<p>Deputy National Security Council Secretary Viktoria Siumar told journalists at a briefing that Adm. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/ukraine-navy-chief-switches-allegiance-to-russia/" target="_blank">Denis Berezovsky</a> had been fired and replaced by another officer. She said he had offered no resistance when his headquarters was surrounded and then transferred his allegiance to the regional parliament in Crimea.</p>
<p>The parliament has elected a pro-Russian leader who says he does not recognize the newly elected central government. Siumar said his headquarters was surrounded by pro-Russian forces.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997165&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/turkey-pm-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992778 " alt="Turkey-PM-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/turkey-pm-480.jpg" /></a> Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erodogan blamed his former ally of causing instability within his party ahead of elections.
<p>Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erodogan called on Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen on Sunday, a onetime ally who has become a bitter foe, to stop meddling in the country&#8217;s politics. &#8220;I was naive. I used my best endeavours to support him,&#8221; Erdogan told party loyalists at an election rally, referring to Gulen, who lives in exile in the United States.</p>
<p>Erdogan has blamed Gulen and his supporters in Turkey of launching a major corruption probe targeting key members of<br />
his inner circle that has shaken his government to the core ahead of key elections on March 30. At the rally in the southwestern city of Isparta, Erdogan accused Gulen of interfering in Turkish politics and urged him to return to the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years ago I asked him to return to Turkey. He did not. I ask him again. If you&#8217;re honest and sincere, stop stirring up this country,&#8221; he said. The Gulen movement was a key backer of Erdogan&#8217;s Islamic-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) when it first came to power in 2002. The two came together to tame the influence of Turkey&#8217;s once-powerful military which staged three coups since 1960 as the self-declared guardians of the secular state.</p>
<p>But the alliance shattered after December police raids which saw which dozens of Erdogan&#8217;s key business and political allies detained on allegations of bribery in construction projects, gold smuggling and illicit trade with Iran. Erdogan, who has dominated politics for 11 years, has repeatedly accused so-called Gulenists in the police and judiciary of being behind the graft probe and retaliated by sacking hundreds of police and prosecutors.</p>
<p>In the latest episode in the escalating feud, the Turkish parliament passed a bill Friday to shut down thousands of<br />
private schools many of which are run by the Gulen movement. The legislation sets September 1, 2015 as the deadline to<br />
close down the schools, which were one of the sources of the row between the Gulen movement and the AKP. &#8220;They are going to lose USD 1 billion annual income (from the schools). That&#8217;s why they are going mad,&#8221; said Erdogan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997114&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken a gamble on Ukraine and is betting that U.S. President Barack Obama will blink first. Wounded by a personal political defeat in a battle for influence over Russia&#8217;s Slavic neighbour, Putin is fighting back, and presenting the crisis as a question of symmetry.</p>
<p>In his view, the West &#8220;stood by&#8221; and allowed armed men to direct events in the capital Kiev &#8211; now he is &#8220;standing by&#8221; as armed men extended their control over the Crimea region. The former KGB spy blames the West for stirring passions in Kiev, encouraging an opposition to break agreements to restore peace and allowing what Moscow calls &#8220;extremists&#8221; and &#8220;fascists&#8221; to dictate political developments in Ukraine. Now authorised by parliament to deploy Russia&#8217;s military in Ukraine to protect national interests and those of Russian citizens, Putin is taking on a West he feels has cut Moscow out of talks on the future of Russia&#8217;s Orthodox Christian brothers. How far he will go is the big question.</p>
<p>While Moscow has put 150,000 troops on high alert near Ukraine&#8217;s border, it has shown no signs, yet, of sending them and denies Ukrainian allegations it sent the protesters who have hoisted Russian flags in some eastern towns. Putin is saying nothing in public on Ukraine &#8211; and has not done so since Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich was deposed more than a week ago.</p>
<p>At the centre of attention as one Western leader after another calls to urge him not to use force, he is betting the West&#8217;s response will be weak. His calculation is that Obama has few levers at his disposal and no appetite for war over a remote Black Sea peninsula with symbolic and strategic value to Russia as home to a Russian naval base, but little economic significance.</p>
<p>The two presidents spoke by phone for 90 minutes on Saturday. The call appeared to have ended in a stalemate. Putin is banking on salvaging something out of a battle over Ukraine that he appeared to have won when Yanukovich spurned trade and political deals with the European Union in November, but then seemed to lose when Yanukovich was ousted after three months of protests.</p>
<p>&#8220;The West told Putin to get lost over Ukraine,&#8221; said Sergei Markov, a pro-Putin political analyst and director of the Institute for Political Studies in Moscow, underlining the depth of hurt Putin felt over Ukraine. Accusing Western powers and international organisations of trying to ignore Moscow in talks on financial assistance for Kiev, Markov said: &#8220;What we are saying is that if there are any U.N., IMF, G-8 agreements without consultations with us, then we will see them as illegitimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reclaiming Crimea, a former Russian territory handed to Ukraine by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1954, would win Putin kudos among core voters and especially nationalists.If the status quo established in the last few days holds, with Russian forces already in charge in Crimea, he can hope to have won back Crimea without a shot being fired in anger or the necessity of taking on another drain to the state coffers.</p>
<p>Even if a pullback is forced on him, Putin will still portray himself as the defender of national interests and those of Russians abroad. In the eyes of many voters, he hopes, he will not have given up Ukraine without a fight. While he has been busy defending national interests, his lieutenants have been lambasting the West over Ukraine, accusing it of manipulating events and working with a government chosen by gun-toting &#8220;extremists&#8221;.</p>
<p>Combined with an orchestrated wave of nationalist indignation over attempts to limit use of the Russian language and persecute Russians in a country many consider an extension of their own, Putin&#8217;s stance plays well at home. His insistence that Ukraine&#8217;s new leaders stick to the terms of a European Union-brokered political agreement last month with Yanukovich goes down well.</p>
<p>This month, his popularity ratings have bounced back to almost 70 percent, according to an opinion poll by independent pollster Levada. &#8220;Putin has not forgiven the fact that the agreement was not fulfilled and that is one of his greatest motivations. He considers he is acting in a symmetrical way,&#8221; said Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin spin doctor.&#8221;I think that the authorities think it&#8217;s very helpful that people are getting themselves worked up about this&#8230; And the majority feel in a patriotic mood about Crimea and Ukraine. I think it&#8217;s positive for the Kremlin. They won&#8217;t refuse action.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether he takes action may still depend on the West.Military intervention in Ukraine has higher stakes than the war Russia fought with Georgia in 2008 &#8211; invading Ukraine&#8217;s southeast could transform Putin, a man who wanted the Sochi Winter Olympics to show Russia&#8217;s modern face, into a pariah. If Western powers decide to try to punish Russia with sanctions, Putin will be likely again to pursue a &#8220;symmetrical&#8221; policy and hit back with similar moves.</p>
<p>This would go down well with core supporters, but might risk unsettling the wealthy businessmen whose support helps cement Putin&#8217;s grip on power. But there is a risk Putin could be forced into action over  Crimea by the nationalist thinking that he has let loose &#8211; and this would be particularly risky if he were pushed into action to defend Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine. The decision to seek authorisation to send in troops looked less like a prelude to war and more like a threat aimed at getting Kiev and the West to cut a deal, Professor Mark Galeotti from the Center of Global Affairs at New York University wrote on his blog.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the language toughens and the troops roll, though, it&#8217;s getting harder to believe that common sense is going to prevail in the Kremlin.&#8221; In broadcasts with Cold War overtones, state television has many times repeated footage of parliament accusing Washington of crossing a red line by warning that Moscow will face &#8220;costs&#8221; if it intervenes in Ukraine.</p>
<p>It has run image after image of pro-Russian protesters raising the Russian flag above administrative buildings in several eastern regions, including the industrial centres of Donetsk and Kharkiv. The patriotic mood has caught on. For every dissenter wondering whether this is the worst thing Russia could do since it crushed opposition in Czechoslovakia in 1968, there are dozens more who say the West is fomenting violence.</p>
<p>Near Red Square and the Defence Ministry in Moscow on Sunday, a few hundred protesters waved banners calling for &#8220;No War&#8221;. Dozens were detained.But their numbers could not match the thousands who turned out for a demonstration for the &#8220;defence of the Ukrainian people&#8221; in central Moscow. &#8220;Fascism will not win,&#8221; the protesters chanted. &#8220;Crimea is Russia. We are for Russian unity.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997065&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>Pakistan on Sunday said it was suspending its targeted military air strikes against the Taliban insurgents, a day after a month-long ceasefire announced by the banned group.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the positive announcement yesterday by the Taliban, the government has decided to suspend the air strikes which were continuing for the past few days,&#8221; Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said in a statement issued here.</p>
<p>The statement said that &#8220;the government and armed forces of Pakistan, however, reserve the right for a befitting response to any act of violence (by the Taliban)&#8221;.</p>
<p>The announcement by the government came hours after gunship helicopters carried out strikes in Khyber agency killing at least five terrorists.</p>
<p>In a statement issued last evening, Shahidullah Shahid, spokesman of the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had said, &#8220;We announce a month-long ceasefire from today and appeal to all our comrades to respect the decision and refrain from any activity during this period.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ceasefire was welcomed by the government, and Irfan Siddiqui, the head of the state negotiators, told PTI: &#8220;We welcome this announcement. This is a happy and positive development. We are hopeful that the dialogue process will move ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that the government committee had sought an unconditional ceasefire from the Taliban for the talks, which were suspended due to terrorist acts, to move ahead.</p>
<p>Dialogue between Islamabad and the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) that began last month was suspended after the militants beheaded 23 Frontier Corps personnel.</p>
<p>The military retaliated with a series of targeted air strikes that left more than 100 insurgents dead.</p>
<p>Nisar said that since the government took over in June last year‚ neither formal military operation nor any unjustified activity has been carried out.</p>
<p>He said any action carried out during this period was in reaction to the terrorist activities and to stop such activities.</p>
<p>Some 40,000 people have been killed during a nearly decade-long insurgency in Pakistan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997050&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ukraine mobilised for war on Sunday and Washington threatened to isolate Russia economically, after President Vladimir Putin declared he had the right to invade his neighbour in Moscow’s biggest confrontation with the West since the Cold War.</span></p>
<p>“This is not a threat: this is actually the declaration of war to my country,” Ukraine’s Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk, head of a pro-Western government that took power when Russian ally Viktor Yanukovych fled last week, said.</p>
<p>Putin secured permission from his parliament on Saturday to use military force to protect Russian citizens in Ukraine and told US President Barack Obama he had the right to defend Russian interests and nationals.</p>
<p>Russian forces have already bloodlessly seized Crimea — an isolated Black Sea peninsula where Moscow has a naval base.</p>
<p>On Sunday they surrounded several small Ukrainian military outposts there and demanded the Ukrainian troops disarm. Some refused, leading to standoffs, although <span style="line-height:1.5em;">no shots were fired.</span></p>
<p>All eyes are now on whether Russia makes a military move in predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow demonstrators have raised Russian flags over public buildings in several cities.</p>
<p>Russia has staged war games with 1.5 lakh troops along the land border, but so far they have not crossed. Ukraine’s security council has ordered all armed forces on highest alert. However, Kiev’s small and under-equipped military is seen as no match for Russia’s superpower might.</p>
<p>US Secretary of State John Kerry condemned Russia for what he called an “incredible act of aggression” and threatened “very serious repercussions”. “You don’t just, in the 21st century, behave in 19th-century fashion by invading another country on a completely trumped-up pretext,” Kerry told CBS programme Face the Nation.</p>
<p>Kerry said Moscow still had a “right set of choices” to defuse the crisis. Otherwise, G8 countries and other nations were prepared to “to go to the hilt to isolate Russia”.</p>
<p>“They are prepared to isolate Russia economically. The rouble is already going down. Russia has major economic challenges,” he said. He mentioned visa bans, asset freezes and trade isolation.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s envoy to the United Nations said Kiev would ask for international military support if Russia expanded its military action in his country.</p>
<p>The new government announced it had fired the head of the navy and launched a treason case against him for surrendering Ukraine’s naval headquarters to Russian forces in the Crimean port of Sevastopol.</p>
<p>Obama spoke to Putin for 90 minutes by telephone on Saturday after the Russian leader declared he had the right to intervene and secured a unanimous yes vote from his parliament. The Kremlin said Putin told Obama Russian speakers were under threat from Ukraine’s new leaders. Putin’s justification — the need to protect Russian citizens — was the same as he used to launch a 2008 invasion of Georgia, where Russian forces seized two breakaway regions.</p>
<p>Ukraine, which says it has no intention of threatening Russian speakers, has appealed for help to NATO, and directly to Britain and the United States, as co-signatories with Moscow to a 1994 accord guaranteeing Ukraine’s security.</p>
<p>Washington has proposed sending monitors to Ukraine under the flags of the United Nations or Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, where Moscow has a veto.</p>
<p>So far, the Western response has been largely symbolic. Obama and others suspended preparations for a G8 summit in Sochi. Some countries recalled ambassadors. Britain said its ministers would stay away from the Paralympics due next in Sochi.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/thailandm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997011" alt="The anti-government protesters withdrew from several stages erected at key intersections around Bangkok. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/thailandm.jpg" /></a> The anti-government protesters withdrew from several stages erected at key intersections around Bangkok. (AP)
<p>People on Sunday voted peacefully in five Thai provinces where opposition protests had blocked balloting during snap polls last month, the first step to complete a controversial election that could pave the way for the formation of a new government.</p>
<p>No violence was reported during the voting and the Election Commission said the polling was &#8220;peaceful&#8221;.</p>
<p>Around 120,000 people were registered to vote across over 100 constituencies in the five provinces, it said.</p>
<p>Reports said voter turnout was only around 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Violence had erupted in Bangkok and other parts of the country ahead and during the February 2 snap polls, boycotted by main opposition Democrat Party demanding the ouster of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.</p>
<p>Opposition-backed protesters had blocked polling in several opposition stronghold provinces and in some parts of Bangkok on February 2 and during advance polling on January 26.</p>
<p>Thailand has been in a political crisis since mass rallies began in November. The protesters are demanding an unelected People&#8217;s Council to replace the Yingluck regime.</p>
<p>The protesters accuse Yingluck of acting as a proxy for her fugitive brother, former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup in 2006. He lives in self-exile in Dubai to escape a jail term on a corruption conviction.</p>
<p>The poll panel was unable to announce the results of the limited polls held then as results can be announced only when polls have been held in all constituencies.</p>
<p>Under Thai laws, 95 per cent of the 500 seats in the lower house of parliament must be filled for a new government to be formed.</p>
<p>The polls came a day after demonstrators abandoned an attempted shutdown of Bangkok as part of their plans to scale down of the protests.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, anti-government protesters dismantled all the rally stages at major intersections and moved to the Lumpini Park, the sprawling green lung of the Thai capital near the central business district.</p>
<p>Addressing the protests, rally leader and former opposition lawmaker Suthep Thaugsuban said the People&#8217;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) would continue their struggle to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>However, one of the stages at an intersections near the Government House, supervised by an anti-government monk, has not been dismantled as the monk vowed to stay on.</p>
<p>Since November, seventy attacks against protesters have resulted in over 23 deaths and 768 injuries.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996993&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ukraine&#8217;s new prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull back his military on Sunday in the conflict between the two countries, warning that &#8220;we are on the brink of disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comments from Yatsenyuk came as a convoy of Russian troops rolled toward Simferopol, the capital of <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/ukraine-crisis-canada-threatens-to-join-us-in-snubbing-g8-summit-in-russia/99/">Ukraine&#8217;s Crimea region</a>, a day after Russian forces took over the strategic Black Sea peninsula without firing a shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no reason for the Russian Federation to invade Ukraine,&#8221; Yatsenyuk said after a closed session of his new parliament in Kiev.</p>
<p>So far, the new government in Kiev has been powerless to react to Russian military tactics.</p>
<p>Putin has defied calls from the West to pull back his troops, insisting that Russia has a right to protect its interests and Russian-speakers in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine. However, there has been no sign of ethnic Russians facing attacks in Crimea, where they make up about 60 percent of the population, or elsewhere in Ukraine.</p>
<p>On the road from Sevastopol, the Crimean port where Russia has its key Black Sea naval base, to Simferopol, Associated Press journalists on Sunday saw 12 military trucks carrying troops, an armored vehicle armed with a machine gun and also two ambulances.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama spoke with Putin by telephone for 90 minutes on Saturday and expressed his &#8220;deep concern&#8221; about &#8220;Russia&#8217;s clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity,&#8221; the White House said.</p>
<p>Obama warned that Russia&#8217;s &#8220;continued violation of international law will lead to greater political and economic isolation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The US also said it will suspend participation in  &#8220;preparatory meetings&#8221; for the Group of Eight economic summit planned in June to be held at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, site of the just-concluded 2014 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius agreed, saying on French radio Europe that planning for the summit should be put on hold.  France &#8220;condemns the Russian military escalation&#8221; in Ukraine, and Moscow must &#8220;realize that decisions have costs,&#8221; he said Sunday.</p>
<p>But the US and other Western governments have few options to counter Russia&#8217;s military moves.</p>
<p>NATO&#8217;s North Atlantic Council, the alliance&#8217;s political decision-making body, and the NATO-Ukraine Commission were to meet on Sunday. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the allies will &#8220;coordinate closely&#8221; on the situation in Ukraine, which he termed &#8220;grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ukraine is not a NATO member, meaning the US and Europe are not obligated to come to its defense. But Ukraine has taken part in some alliance military exercises and contributed troops to its response force.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, announced late Saturday that he had ordered Ukraine&#8217;s armed forces to be at full readiness because of the threat of &#8220;potential aggression.&#8221; He also said he had ordered stepped-up security at nuclear power plants, airports and other strategic infrastructure.</p>
<p>On Crimea, however, Ukrainian troops have offered no resistance.</p>
<p>The new government came to power last week following months of pro-democracy protests against the now-fugitive president, Viktor Yanukovych, and his decision to turn Ukraine toward Russia instead of the European Union.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s population of 46 million is divided in loyalties between Russia and Europe, with much of western Ukraine advocating closer ties with the EU, while eastern and southern regions look to Russia for support. Crimea, a semi-autonomous region that Russia gave to Ukraine in the 1950s, is mainly Russian-speaking.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996960&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A militant car bomb prematurely exploded overnight in eastern Afghanistan, killing nine insurgents and four civilians, authorities said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The blast happened in Logar province, some 10 kilometers (six miles) north of the capital, Pul-e-Alam, said Din Mohammad Darwesh, a spokesman for the provincial governor. Darwesh said it appeared insurgents, who he identified as three Afghans and six Pakistanis, set off the bomb too early.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the explosion completely destroyed a nearby civilian house in which two women and two children were killed,” he said in a telephone interview. “Police and local residents retrieved the bodies. “Two days earlier, additional Afghan soldiers deployed to the capital after receiving an intelligence report about a possible attack.</p>
<p>Meanwhile today, a lone suicide bomber entered a police station in southern Kandahar province, though officers’ fire forced him to detonate his explosive vest early, only wounding one civilian, said Zia Durrani, spokesman for Kandahar’s police chief.</p>
<p>Also in Kandahar, 12 Taliban escaped from the 1,200-inmate Kandahar Prison after a prison employee falsely put their names on a list of detainees who were scheduled for release, Durrani said. The men walked out of the prison and the prison employee has disappeared, he said. Two of the 12 have been recaptured, he said.</p>
<p>Kandahar Prison has seen spectacular escapes in the past. In 2011, more than 450 prisoners, many of them Taliban fighters, tunneled their way out of the prison and fled in buses that had been dispatched to collect them.</p>
<p>Southern Afghanistan, and Kandahar in particular, has been the site of some of the heaviest fighting in the protracted Afghan conflict as Afghan and international combat troops have tried to root out a stubborn insurgency. But the Taliban have been tenacious and most Afghans say the Taliban still rule in much of the countryside.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996935&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five Indians were among 11 expatriates killed in a deadly blast at a Turkish restaurant  in Doha, Qatar.</p>
<p>The blast tore through the Turkish restaurant, which is attached to a mall in Doha and next to a petrol station on Thursday, killing 11 people, five of them Indians.</p>
<p>Qatar government has announced a probe into the explosion that also injured 35 people.</p>
<p>The Indian victims have been identified as Riyas Kizhakemanolil, Abdul Saleem Palangad, Zakaria Padinjare Anakandi, Venkatesh and Shaikh Babu, The Peninsula reported.</p>
<p>Four Nepali nationals and two people from the Philippines were also killed in the explosion.</p>

<p>The Indian Embassy is in contact with all concerned to repatriate the bodies to their native places, Ambassador Sanjiv Arora said.</p>
<p>Of the 10 injured still undergoing treatment, eight are adults and two children. They comprise three Nepalese, three Pakistanis, two Filipinos, one Egyptian and one Indian, Gulf Times reported.</p>
<p>Qatari Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani visited the site.</p>
<p>The Interior Ministry announced the formation of a special committee to investigate the incident and a report is expected to be submitted by the end of this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;The investigation is going in full swing and the initial report is expected to be issued by the end of this week,&#8221; local Arabic-language Al Sharq newspaper reported today.</p>
<p>With serious concern being raised about the safety of gas tanks and cylinders used in eateries, especially those based in petrol station complexes, Qatari authorities are gearing up to launch inspection campaign at eateries across the country to ensure that they comply with the safety standards and requirements, the paper said.</p>
<p>The campaign will be launched soon, with participation of the Civil Defence Department, Ministry of Municipality and Urban Planning and other departments, it said.</p>
<p>Earlier, preliminary investigations suggested a gas tank on the roof of the restaurant and gas cylinders on neighbouring roofs exploded, the Qatar News Agency had reported.</p>
<p>The blast was the second major incident in Qatar after a fire in Villaggio Mall killed 19 people, including 13 children in May 2012.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996832&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Think stock)
<p>In a shocking incident, a 9-year-old boy in China inserted four sewing needles into his stomach as a form of self-punishment for scoring &#8216;only&#8217; 99-per cent in his exam.</p>
<p>Doctors in Heilongjiang Province spent over two hours removing the needles that were buried in the child&#8217;s stomach. The boy&#8217;s father found lumps on his son&#8217;s stomach while bathing him, but the boy was not letting him check closely, &#8216;Global Times&#8217;  reported.<br />
However, the boy suffered intense stomach pain and was admitted to The 2nd Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University.</p>
<p>The youngster said he had pierced his stomach with the needles as punishment for not scoring 100 per cent in his final exams as he did previously, the report said. He stuck himself with two needles at the start of the winter holiday and another two as the new term was about to begin, the boy said.</p>
<p>Surveys have shown that pressure to succeed sets in early for Chinese students, so much so that one in four secondary students consider suicide, according to Shanghaiist.</p>
<p>The report said China&#8217;s students were ranked as the most stressed in the world in 2009, with high school students having longest study hours as compared to those in Japan, US and Korea.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996796&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China plans to launch a cargo ship into space in 2016 to serve the Tiangong-2 space laboratory which is currently in orbit, a Chinese space scientist said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The cargo ship, named &#8220;Tianzhou&#8221; or &#8220;Heavenly Vessel&#8221; in Chinese, will be delivered by the newly-developed Long March-7 carrier rocket and dock with Tiangong-2 automatically, Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China&#8217;s manned space program, told<br />
state-run Xinhua news agency.</p>
<p>Cargo transportation system that supplies goods and propellants is a key technology China must master to build its own space station, he said. Tiangong-1, China&#8217;s first space lab and target orbiter, was sent to orbit on September 29, 2011.</p>
<p>China is expected to launch the Tiangong-2 space lab around 2015. &#8220;A manned spaceship has limited transportation capacity and costs highly,&#8221; Zhou said ahead of the annual session of the advisory body, which is scheduled to open on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;A cargo ship will not return to the earth and does not need to carry people in its launching and docking processes,which makes its transportation of goods more economical and efficient,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Tianzhou cargo ship can send supplies to the space station, including propellants, living necessities for astronauts and equipment for scientific research. It can destroy various wasted materials, he said. It can also send large-sized facilities and equipment for the construction of the space station, he added.</p>
<p>Three cabin structures are being designed for the Tianzhou cargo ship, a fully-enclosed one, a semi-open one and a wholly-open one, he said. The loading capacity of the cargo ship will reach the world-class level and will be even better than some developed countries, he said.</p>
<p>Researchers are busy developing the Long March-7 carrier rocket, which has a new-generation engine and uses harmless propellants. It has a carrying capacity of more than 13 tonnes, he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996742&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express photo)
<p>Accusing Russia of carrying out a military &#8220;invasion&#8221; in Ukraine, US Secretary of State John Kerry has said that it will have &#8220;profound&#8221; effect on US-Russia ties.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <a title="Canada pulls away ambassador from Moscow over Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/canada-pulls-away-ambassador-from-moscow-over-ukraine/" target="_blank">United States</a> condemns the Russian Federation&#8217;s invasion and occupation of the Ukrainian territory, and its violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity in full contravention of Russia&#8217;s obligations under the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, its 1997 military basing agreement with Ukraine, and the 1994 Budapest Memorandum,&#8221; Kerry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless immediate and concrete steps are taken by<a title="US calls on Russia to withdraw forces from Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/us-calls-on-russia-to-withdraw-forces-from-ukraine/" target="_blank"> Russia</a> to deescalate tensions, the effect on US-Russian relations and on Russia&#8217;s international standing will be profound,&#8221; Kerry said in a statement yesterday. Kerry also said he had held a joint conference call with his global counterparts &#8220;to coordinate on next steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I convened a call this afternoon with my counterparts from around the world, to coordinate on next steps. We were  unified in our assessment and will work closely together to support Ukraine and its people at this historic hour,&#8221; Kerry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the coming days, emergency consultations will commence in the UN Security Council, the North Atlantic Council, and  the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in defence of the underlying principles critical to the maintenance of international peace and security,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As President Obama has said, we call for Russia to withdraw its forces back to bases, refrain from interference elsewhere in Ukraine, and support international mediation to address any legitimate issues regarding the protection of minority rights or security,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kerry also sought to tackle Russian concerns over the political upheavals in Ukraine, saying, &#8220;From day one, we&#8217;ve made clear that we recognise and respect Russia’s ties to Ukraine and its concerns about treatment of ethnic Russians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But these concerns can and must be addressed in a way that does not violate Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, by directly engaging the Government of Ukraine,&#8221; Kerry said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the top US diplomat had also spoken with Ukrainian interim president Oleksandr Turchynov. Kerry assured the Ukrainian leader about the &#8220;strong support of the United States&#8221; and commended it &#8220;for showing the utmost restraint in the face of the clear and present danger to the integrity of their state, and the assaults on their sovereignty.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996704&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Canada says it is pulling its ambassador from Moscow over the <a title="US calls on Russia to withdraw forces from Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/us-calls-on-russia-to-withdraw-forces-from-ukraine/" target="_blank">crisis in Ukraine</a>. A statement issued by Prime Minister Stephen Harper after an emergency Cabinet meeting says Canada also is pulling out  of the Group of Eight process being chaired by Russia for an international economic summit in June.</p>
<p>Harper strongly condemns Russia&#8217;s military intervention in Ukraine and urges President Vladimir Putin to withdraw his troops. International pressure is growing on Russia after its troops took over the strategic Crimea region on  Saturday.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s parliament granted Putin authority to use the military to protect Russian interests in Ukraine, where a new  government has been named after demonstrations pushed President Viktor Yanukovych from office.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama, U.N. Security Council members and others are asking Russia to de-escalate tensions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/chinaattack.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996730" alt="A group of militants armed with knives and swords attacked people randomly at the crowded Kunming railway station in China.

(AP Photo)
<p>China on Sunday blamed an unprecedented &#8220;terrorist attack&#8221; by knife-wielding assailants at a railway station that killed 33 people and injured over 130 on Islamist militants from the volatile Xinjiang province and described the slashing rampage as the country&#8217;s 9/11.</p>
<p>It was a macabre night at the crowded Kunming railway station, the city known for its serenity, when a group of black-clad knife and sword-wielding attackers, including two women, mowed down people at random, sending shock waves across the nation which prides itself in its watertight security.</p>
<p>Police fatally shot four attackers, including a woman, during the mass knife-attack which went on for 25 minutes in Kunming, the capital of southwest Yunnan province. They are searching for at least five more attackers.</p>
<p>Over 10 &#8220;terrorist suspects&#8221; were involved in the last night&#8217;s attack, while left 33 people, including 29 civilians, dead and over 130 injured. Most of the victims sustained head injuries as the militants went on the stabbing spree.</p>
<p>One more female suspect has been arrested and is being treated in hospital for unspecified injuries. Reports said Chinese police captured an injured woman militant who was reportedly being interrogated to get more details.</p>
<p>Evidence at the crime scene showed that the attack was orchestrated by separatist forces from Xinjiang, home to the mostly-Muslim Uygur minority, the municipal government of Kunming said today.</p>
<p>TV footage showed police recovering swords carried by some of the assailants.</p>
<p>Nothing justifies civilian slaughter in China&#8217;s &#8220;9-11&#8243;, state-run Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on the last night&#8217;s dreadful attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;China was outraged and the world shocked after separatists from Xinjiang knifed down innocent civilians at a crowded train terminal in Kunming Saturday night,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a typical terrorist attack and also a severe crime against humanity. It was China&#8217;s &#8217;9-11&#8242;&#8221;, it said.</p>
<p>It is the first time militants from the banned East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) from Xinjiang have been blamed for carrying out such a large-scale attack from<br />
their remote homeland.</p>
<p>It follows an incident in Beijing&#8217;s iconic Tiananmen Square in October which shook the country&#8217;s Communist leadership, forcing them to establish a state committee to<br />
ensure national security.</p>
<p>The attack came ahead of the commencement of China&#8217;s Parliament beginning from tomorrow, an annual political season that lasts about a fortnight.</p>
<p>Observers said the attack is a shock to the Chinese government as the militants chose a soft target like Kunming, which is far from tightly secured capital Beijing.</p>
<p>The banned ETIM, an alleged al-Qaeda linked group, is fighting for the independence of Xinjiang province, which is endowed with natural resources, including oil.</p>
<p>Last year three members of a family, including two women, tried to carry out an attack at the Forbidden city near the Tiananmen Square where the Parliament holds its session at the Great Hall of People. Five persons were killed in the attack.</p>
<p>The attacks point out that the ethnic conflict in Xinjiang, which borders Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) and Afghanistan, is spilling over to mainland China.<br />
Overseas Xinjiang groups allege severe repression by the Chinese security forces.</p>
<p>The province is witnessing violent ethnic conflict in recent years as ethnic Muslim Uygurs, who form over 45 per cent of the provincial population, resented the settlements of China&#8217;s Han majority.</p>
<p>Before the emergence of ETIM, the province witnessed several riots between the two communities.</p>
<p>Senior Chinese security official Meng Jianzhu, who rushed to Kunming last night on the directive of President Xi Jinping, pledged to harshly punish terrorists in accordance with the law to ensure social stability.</p>
<p>Meng, head of the Commission for Political and Legal Affairs of the CPC, said the attack caused big losses to people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>The terrorists were devoid of conscience as they brutally attacked unarmed civilians and exposed their anti-humanity and anti-society nature. They should be harshly punished in accordance with the law, he said.</p>
<p>Xi, who is regarded as the most powerful Chinese leader in recent years as he headed, Presidency, CPC and the military, ordered authorities to firmly suppress terrorists&#8217; rampant momentum, official media reported.</p>
<p>The President, who also heads recently formed China&#8217;s national security commission, asked law enforcement agencies to crackdown on violent terrorist activities in all forms,</p>
<p>Safeguard social stability and guarantee the safety of people&#8217;s lives and property.</p>
<p>A day after the attack, eyewitnesses recalled the horrific moment with Kunming resident Yang Haifei saying he was buying a ticket when he saw a group of people rushed into the station and started attacking people.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a person come straight at me with a long knife and I ran away with everyone,&#8221; he said, adding that the attackers caught those who were slower. &#8220;They just fell on the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At first I thought it was just someone fighting, but then I saw blood and heard people scream, and I just ran,&#8221; said Liu Chen, a 19-year-old student from Wuhan City of central China&#8217;s Hubei Province, who was visiting Yunnan.</p>
<p>The killing spree showed that terror attacks are spreading from Muslim Uygur Xinjiang to rest of the areas which makes it imperative to tighten security all across the<br />
country, an official media report here said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the Tiananmen car crash incident that happened in October 2013 marked the first sign that terrorism was starting to trickle into China&#8217;s central and eastern areas, this massacre can clarify that the eastward expansion of Xinjiang terrorism is accelerating,&#8221; a report in Global Times website said today.</p>
<p>The attack &#8220;signals and sets alarm for the rest of China, especially large cities, that terrorism has already crept in.</p>
<p>This new tendency pushes China&#8217;s anti-terrorism efforts into a much more severe and demanding situation,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means other cities and provinces, which were previously believed to be unlikely to be targeted by terrorism, must prepare for any possible attacks by terrorists,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is not dealing with this issue alone any more. People must realise that a handful of extremists do not represent tens of millions of local residents in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not only an irrational and biased mindset to put the blame on the entire Uygur community or the Muslim world, but the idea will also abet and aid those separatists and terrorists who are desperate to take advantage of ethnic and religious conflicts,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s legislators and political advisors have expressed their support for an iron-fist crackdown on terrorism after the bloody killing spree.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should launch a nationwide campaign against such terrorist activities and resolutely fight the terrorists,&#8221; said Yin Zhuo, director of the Expert Consultation Committee of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army Navy.</p>
<p>Chen Shu, a deputy to the National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC), the country&#8217; s top legislature, urged a &#8220;quick and harsh crackdown on the terrorist activists&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;All countries should join hands to fight terrorist activities like this one,&#8221; he said.</p>

(AP)
<p>Japan pledged more than $200 million in aid on Saturday to help the Palestinian Authority, as representatives from 22 nations reiterated their support of the Palestinians&#8217; quest for their own state.</p>
<p>The pledge was announced by Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida at the second Conference on Cooperation among East Asian Countries for Palestinian Development, held in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.</p>
<p>Kishida said the first disbursement of the aid — about $62 million — was expected later this month.</p>
<p>Ministers and high-ranking officials from 22 countries and five international organizations participated in the one-day conference, which was jointly chaired by Indonesia, the Palestinian Authority and Japan.</p>
<p>The conference agreed to expand the number of participants and encourage greater engagement of civil societies in East Asia to assist the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono expressed hope that &#8220;universal recognition of Palestine as an independent and sovereign state and as a full member state of the United Nations&#8221; would eventually be achieved.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can make this happen if we redouble our effort to support them in nation and state building,&#8221; Yudhoyono said. A joint statement issued at the conclusion the conference said the participants agreed to encourage greater engagement of civil society and nongovernment organizations in East Asian countries.</p>
<p>The statement also said participant countries and international organizations had pledged $210 million to the Palestinians since last year&#8217;s conference, held in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The United Nations voted overwhelmingly last year to recognize a Palestinian state, but the Palestinians still face limitations in controlling their borders and airspace and in trade, and have no unified army or police.</p>

<p>Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper threatened he may join Washington in snubbing June&#8217;s G8 summit in Russia over the country&#8217;s military incursion into Ukraine, and recalled his ambassador to Moscow.</p>
<p>The Russian parliament&#8217;s decision to give Putin the green light to send troops into neighboring Ukraine triggered international outcry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We join our allies in condemning in the strongest terms President Putin&#8217;s military intervention in Ukraine,&#8221; Harper said in a statement yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;These actions are a clear violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. They are also in violation of Russia&#8217;s obligations under international law.&#8221;</p>
<p>US officials have warned that President Barack Obama and other European leaders were unlikely to show up at the G8 summit in the showcase Black Sea resort of Sochi if the Ukraine crisis was not resolved.</p>
<p><strong>US accuses Russia of military &#8216;invasion&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Accusing Russia of carrying out a military &#8220;invasion&#8221; in Ukraine, US Secretary of State John Kerry has said that it will have &#8220;profound&#8221; effect on US-Russia ties.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States condemns the Russian Federation&#8217;s invasion and occupation of the Ukrainian territory, and its violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity in full contravention of Russia&#8217;s obligations under the UN Charter, the Helsinki Final Act, its 1997 military basing agreement with Ukraine, and the 1994 Budapest Memorandum,&#8221; Kerry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless immediate and concrete steps are taken by Russia to deescalate tensions, the effect on US-Russian relations and on Russia&#8217;s international standing will be profound,&#8221; Kerry said in a statement yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Ukraine asks UN council to stop Russian &#8216;aggression&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s ambassador to the United Nations asked an emergency session of the Security Council on Saturday &#8220;to do everything possible now&#8221; to stop Russia&#8217;s &#8220;aggression&#8221; as its troops took over the strategic Crimea region.</p>
<p>But action by the UN&#8217;s most powerful body appears unlikely. As a permanent member, Russia has veto power and can block the council from adopting any resolution criticizing or sanctioning Moscow.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged Russian President Vladimir Putin in a phone call to &#8220;urgently engage in direct dialogue with the authorities&#8221; in Kiev.</p>
<p><strong>Russia has &#8216;right&#8217; to protect interests: Putin</strong></p>
<p>Russia has the right to &#8220;protect its interests and Russian-speaking populations&#8221; in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has told his US counterpart Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Putin told Obama there was a &#8220;real threat weighing on the lives and the health of Russian citizens&#8221; in Ukraine, according to a Kremlin statement.</p>
<p>The Russian president accused the new government in Kiev of supporting &#8220;criminal actions by ultranationalists&#8221;, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p><strong>US calls on Russia to withdraw forces</strong></p>
<p>US President Barack Obama has called his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to &#8220;deescalate&#8221; tensions in Ukraine and asked him to pull his forces back to bases in Crimea.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US calls on Russia to deescalate tensions by withdrawing its forces back to bases in Crimea and to refrain from any interference elsewhere in Ukraine,&#8221; the White House said in a statement on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obama told Putin that, if Russia has concerns about the treatment of ethnic Russian and minority populations in Ukraine, the appropriate way to address them is peacefully through direct engagement with the government of Ukraine and through the dispatch of international observers under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),&#8221; the White House said.</p>
<p>The United States is prepared to participate, the statement said.</p>
<p>Obama spoke with Putin for 90 minutes, during which &#8221;President expressed his deep concern over Russia&#8217;s clear violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity,&#8221; the White House said.</p>
<p>Obama told Putin that his actions were a &#8220;breach of international law, including Russia&#8217;s obligations under the UN Charter, and of its 1997 military basing agreement withUkraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have consistently said that we recognise Russia&#8217;s deep historic and cultural ties to Ukraine and the need to protect the rights of ethnic Russian and minority populations within Ukraine,&#8221; the White House said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Ukrainian government has made clear its commitment to protect the rights of all Ukrainians and to abide by Ukraine&#8217;s<br /> international commitments, and we will continue to urge them to do so,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the coming hours and days, the United States will urgently consult with allies and partners in the UN Security Council, the North Atlantic Council, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and with the signatories of the Budapest Memorandum,&#8221; the White House said.</p>
<p><strong>US may withdraw from G-8</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The US will suspend upcoming participation in preparatory meetings for the G-8. Going forward, Russia&#8217;s continued violation of international law will lead to greater political and economic isolation,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The White House said Obama has directed his Administration to continue working urgently with international &#8220;partners&#8221; to provide support for the Ukrainian government, including urgent technical and &#8220;financial&#8221; assistance.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Obama also spoke separately with French President Francois Hollande and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>&#8220;The leaders agreed that Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected, and expressed their grave concern over Russia&#8217;s intervention in Ukraine,&#8221; the White House said in a statement.</p>
<p>The leaders affirmed the importance of unity within the international community in support of international law, and the future of Ukraine and its democracy, it said.</p>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukraine-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996483" alt="A gunman in unmarked uniform stands guard as troops take control the the Coast Guard offices in Balaklava, outskirts of Sevastopol, Ukraine. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukraine-480.jpg" /></a> A gunman in unmarked uniform stands guard as troops take control the the Coast Guard offices in Balaklava, outskirts of Sevastopol, Ukraine.

<p>Russia executed a de facto military takeover of a strategic region in Ukraine as the parliament in Moscow gave President Vladimir Putin a green light Saturday to proceed to protect Russian interests. The newly installed government in Kiev was powerless to react to the swift takeover of Crimea by Russian troops already in Ukraine and more flown in, aided by pro-Russian Ukrainian groups.</p>
<p>Putin&#8217;s move follows President Barack Obama&#8217;s warning Friday &#8220;there will be costs&#8221; if Russia intervenes militarily, sharply raising the stakes in the conflict over Ukraine&#8217;s future and evoking memories of Cold War brinkmanship. The explicit reference to the use of troops escalated days of conflict between the two countries, which started when Ukraine&#8217;s pro-Russian president was pushed out by a protest movement of people who wanted closer ties to the European Union.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m submitting a request for using the armed forces of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine pending the normalization of the socio-political situation in that country,&#8221; Putin said in his request sent to parliament.</p>
<p>Putin&#8217;s call came as pro-Russian demonstrations broke out in Ukraine&#8217;s Russian-speaking east, where protesters raised Russian flags and clashed with supporters of the new Ukrainian government.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s upper house also recommended that Moscow recall its ambassador from Washington over Obama&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p>Ukraine had already accused Russia on Friday of a &#8220;military invasion and occupation&#8221; of the Crimea peninsula, where Russia&#8217;s Black Sea fleet is based. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk called on Moscow &#8220;to recall their forces, and to return them to their stations,&#8221; according to the Interfax news agency. &#8220;Russian partners, stop provoking civil and military resistance in Ukraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crisis was sparked when Ukraine&#8217;s deposed president, Victor Yanukovych, ditched a deal for closer ties to the EU and instead turned toward Moscow. Months of protests followed, culminating in security forces killing dozens of protesters and Yanukovych fleeing to Russia.</p>
<p>Ignoring Obama&#8217;s warning, Putin said the &#8220;extraordinary situation in Ukraine&#8221; was putting at risk the lives of Russian citizens and military personnel stationed at a naval base that Moscow has maintained in the Black Sea peninsula since the Soviet collapse.</p>
<p>Reflecting a degree of caution, Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin, who presented Putin&#8217;s request to the upper house, told reporters that the motion doesn&#8217;t mean that the president would immediately send additional troops to Ukraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no talk about it yet,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Putin&#8217;s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in remarks on Rossiya 24 television that while the president &#8220;got the entire arsenal of means necessary for settling this situation,&#8221; he hadn&#8217;t yet decided whether to use the Russian military in Ukraine or recall the ambassador from Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will make these decisions depending on how the situation will develop,&#8221; Peskov said. &#8220;We would like to hope that the situation will not develop along the scenario it&#8217;s developing now — that is inciting tensions and making a threat for the Russians on the Crimean Peninsula.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council called an urgent meeting on Ukraine on Saturday, and the European Union foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>Putin&#8217;s motion loosely refers to the &#8220;territory of Ukraine&#8221; rather than specifically to Crimea, raising the possibility that Moscow could use military force in other Russian-speaking areas in eastern and southern Ukraine, where many oppose the new authorities in Kiev. Pro-Russian protests were reported in the eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk and the southern port of Odessa.</p>
<p>In Kharkiv, 97 people were injured in clashes between pro-Russia demonstrators and supporters of the new Ukrainian government, according to the Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s population is divided in loyalties between Russia and Europe, with much of western Ukraine advocating closer ties with the European Union while eastern and southern regions look to Russia for support. Crimea, a semi-autonomous region of Ukraine, is mainly Russian-speaking.</p>
<p>In Saturday&#8217;s parliamentary session in Moscow, a deputy house speaker said Obama had insulted Russia and crossed a &#8220;red line,&#8221; and the upper house recommended the Russian ambassador in Washington be recalled. It will be up to Putin to decide whether that happens.</p>
<p>In Crimea, the pro-Russian prime minister who took office after gunmen seized the regional Parliament claimed control of the military and police there and asked Putin for help in keeping peace, sharpening the discord between the two neighboring Slavic countries.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, said the election of Sergei Aksyonov as prime minister of Crimea was invalid.</p>
<p>Ukrainian officials and some Western diplomats said that a Russian military intervention is already well underway after heavily armed gunmen in unmarked military uniforms seized control of local government buildings, airports and other strategic facilities in Crimea in recent days.</p>
<p>Crimea only became part of Ukraine in 1954 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred jurisdiction from Russia, a move that was a mere formality when both Ukraine and Russia were part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet breakup in 1991 meant Crimea landed in an independent Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia put pressure on Ukraine from another direction when a spokesman for state gas company Gazprom said that Ukraine owed $1.59 billion in overdue bills for imported gas. Sergei Kuprianov was quoted by the RIA-Novosti agency as saying the gas arrears would endanger a recent discount granted by Russia. The discount lowered the price to $268.50 per thousand from other $400. The Russian payment demand and loss of the discount would accelerate Ukraine&#8217;s financial crisis. The country is almost broke and seeking emergency credit from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Russia has taken a confrontational stance toward its southern neighbor after Yanukovych fled the country. Yanukovych was voted out of office by parliament after weeks of protests ended in violence that left more than 80 people dead.</p>
<p>Aksyonov, the Crimea leader, appealed to Putin &#8220;for assistance in guaranteeing peace and calmness on the territory of the autonomous republic of Crimea.&#8221; Aksyonov was voted in by the Crimean parliament on Thursday after pro-Russia gunmen seized the building and as tensions soared over Crimea&#8217;s resistance to the new authorities in Kiev, who took office this week.</p>
<p>Obama called on Russia to respect the independence and territory of Ukraine and not try to take advantage of its neighbor, which is undergoing political upheaval.</p>
<p>He said such action by Russia would represent a &#8220;profound interference&#8221; in matters he said must be decided by the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine,&#8221; he said. Obama did not say what those costs might be.</p>
<p>Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt wrote on Twitter that it was &#8220;obvious that there is Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Likely immediate aim is to set up puppet pro-Russian semi-state in Crimea.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the United Nations, the Ukrainian ambassador, Yuriy Sergeyev, said Friday that Russian transport aircraft and 11 attack helicopters had arrived in Crimea illegally, and that Russian troops had taken control of two airports in Crimea.</p>
<p>He described the gunmen posted outside the two airports as Russian armed forces as well as &#8220;unspecified&#8221; units.</p>
<p>Russia has kept silent on claims of military intervention and has said any troop movements are within agreed rules, even as it maintained its hard-line stance on protecting ethnic Russians in Crimea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, flights remained halted from Simferopol&#8217;s airport. Dozens of armed men in military uniforms without markings patrolled the area. They didn&#8217;t stop or search people leaving or entering the airport, and refused to talk to journalists.</p>

(Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Pakistani officials on Saturday said they had rescued 11 kidnapped foreigners &#8211; eight Iranians, two Tunisians and one Yemeni national &#8211; in the southwest town of Turbat near the Iranian border. The security officials told AFP that those freed did not include a group of Iranian border guards believed to have been kidnapped by jihadists and taken to Pakistan in early February, sparking diplomatic tensions.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;11 foreigners were rescued in a raid in a neighbourhood of Turbat town, some 1,050 kilometres (656 miles) west of Quetta,&#8221; a security official told AFP. The raid had been conducted in an attempt to rescue five Iranian border guards who were kidnapped on February 6 from Iran&#8217;s Sistan-Baluchistan province, officials said. But the freed hostages were not thought to be the guards but believed to be connected to drug cartels operating in the province and to have been held hostage by them, officials said.</p>
<p>Baluchistan is known as a gateway to Asia for drug smugglers and sees a frequent influx of foreigners from Iran and elsewhere. Diplomatic ties between Iran and Pakistan touched a fresh low last week over fate of the kidnapped border guards, when the Iranian Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli reportedly threatened Pakistan that Tehran may send forces into Pakistan to free them.</p>
<p>Home to a large Sunni minority and ethnic Baluch people in a predominantly Shiite country, Sistan-Baluchestan province has been the scene of unrest in recent years. An insurgent group calling itself Jaish-ul Adl, or Army of Justice, has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. The group posted pictures on its Facebook page it said were of the soldiers, handcuffed and being held in an unknown location.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996439&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A group of knife-wielding men attacked a train station in southwestern China on Saturday, leaving at least 27 people dead and another 109 injured, the official Xinhua News Agency said, making it one of the deadliest attacks in China in recent years.</span></p>
<p>Xinhua did not provide more details about the evening attack at the Kunming Railway Station in Yunnan province, or identify the attackers. Kunming city police said they did not have any immediate information to release about the attack.</p>
<p>Local television station K6 said that several of the attackers were shot by police and that victims were being transported to local hospitals.</p>
<p>The state-run Yunnan News said that the men were wearing uniforms when they stormed the railway station and that gunshots were heard after police responded. Photos circulating online showed scattered luggage and bodies lying on the floor in blood.</p>
<p>The motive behind the attack was not immediately clear, but China has seen a number of mass stabbings and other attacks carried out by people bearing grudges against society.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996443&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pakistani Taliban on Saturday announced a month-long ceasefire to facilitate the resumption of peace talks suspended by the government over the recent execution of 23 troops.</p>
<p>&#8220;We announce a month-long ceasefire from today and appeal to all our comrades to respect the decision and refrain from any activity during this period,&#8221; said Shahidullah Shahid, spokesman of the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).</p>
<p>He said directives had been issued to all Taliban factions to respect the truce and honour it by avoiding all &#8220;jihadi activities&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the government would seriously consider our decision and will keep the negotiation process free from all kind of politicking and would make progress in a positive manner,&#8221; Shahid said in a statement issued to the media.</p>
<p>The ceasefire was welcomed by the government, and Irfan Siddiqui, the head of the state negotiators, said : &#8220;We welcome this announcement. This is a happy and positive development. We are hopeful that the dialogue process will move ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if the government and the Taliban were engaged in any back channel parleys, he said: &#8220;You cannot call it back-channel talks. The government committee and the Taliban-nominated committee were in touch with each other away from the media glare.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had sought an unconditional ceasefire from the Taliban for the talks, which were suspended due to terrorist acts, to move ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Siddiqui said the talks would &#8220;resume now and hopefully you will hear some good news&#8221;.</p>
<p>The government suspended the troubled peace process on February 17 after a Taliban faction beheaded 23 Frontier Corps personnel abducted in 2010.</p>
<p>Even as the two sides were holding talks, the Taliban carried out attacks in several parts of the country.</p>
<p>After the process was put on hold, military jets targeted Taliban hideouts in the restive tribal areas, killing over 100 terrorists.</p>
<p>Taliban spokesman Shahid said the decision to announce the ceasefire was made after deliberations involving the TTP &#8216;shura&#8217; or council and the group&#8217;s chief Mullah Fazlullah.</p>
<p>&#8220;TTP had started talks process with the government with sincerity. We are a principled party and take every decision with the consultation of the shura and approval of the TTP chief,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government gave a positive response to our proposals for ending the deadlock in talks and we have been assured of its implementation,&#8221; he said in the statement.</p>
<p>He said the Taliban had acted following an appeal from scholars and in the best interest of the country.</p>
<p>Commentators on TV channels said the announcement came after hectic back-door talks between the government and the banned group.</p>

<p>Since the dialogue was launched to end a nearly decade-long insurgency that has claimed some 40,000 lives, observers have expressed scepticism that it would lead to lasting peace. Experts have pointed out that the Taliban have reneged on previous peace deals or use them to consolidate their position.</p>
<p>The Taliban faction in Mohmand tribal region, which executed the 23 troops, issued a statement supporting the ceasefire.</p>
<p>The faction&#8217;s spokesman, Umer Khurasani, said his group would abide by the truce.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not happy with the behaviour of the government because its secret agencies killed our men without trial in a court of law,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He claimed a Taliban fighter named Abdur Rehman, who was arrested in 2008, was killed by &#8220;agencies&#8221; yesterday. Earlier, another militant, Maulana Hafeezullah, was &#8220;shot dead in Karachi in the custody of the forces&#8221;, he claimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite all this, we will honour and respect the ceasefire announced by our central TTP,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996432&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pro-Russian demonstrations have broken out in major cities in eastern and southern Ukraine, as Russian President Vladimir Putin asked for parliamentary permission Saturday to use troops to protect Russians in the country.</p>
<p>Demonstrators raised the Russian flag on Saturday over Kharkhiv city hall after a demonstration turned violent. Russia supporters clashed with backers of the Ukrainian government who were guarding the building. Government supporters were left beaten and bloodied.</p>
<p>Demonstrators jammed a Russian flag through a broken window in an upper story.</p>
<p>Ukrainian and television news wires reported pro-Russians demonstrations in Donetsk and Odessa. All three cities have large Russian speaking populations.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996422&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">AS Russian armed forces effectively seized control of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula Saturday, the Russian Parliament granted President Vladimir V Putin the authority he sought to use military force in response to the deepening instability in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>The authorization cited a threat to lives of Russian citizens and soldiers stationed in Crimea and other parts of Ukraine, and provided a blunt answer to President Obama, who Friday pointedly warned Russia to respect Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>Even before Putin’s statement in Moscow, scores of heavily armed soldiers had tightened their grip on the Crimean capital, Simferopol, surrounding government buildings, shuttering the airport, and blocking streets, where they deployed Friday.</p>
<p>Large pro-Russia crowds rallied in eastern cities of Donestk and Kharkiv, where there were reports of violence. In Kiev, fears grew within the new provisional government that separatist upheaval would fracture the country just days after civil unrest ended in the ouster of President Yanuovych, a Kremlin ally who fled to Russia.</p>
<p>In Crimea, scores of heavily armed men fanned out across the centre of the regional capital, Simferopol. They wore green camouflage uniforms with no identifying insignia, but they spoke Russian and were clearly part of a Russian military mobilization. In Balaklava, a long column of military vehicles blocking the road to a border post bore Russian plates.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, there was no immediate response from White House; officials had acknowledged on Friday that Washington’s options were limited.</p>
<p>There was also limited response from Europe. Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister, issued a statement saying Russia’s actions in Crimea were “contrary to international law and the principles of European security”.</p>
<p>While the West grappled for a response, a Ukrainian military official in Crimea said soldiers had been told to “open fire” if they came under attack by Russia troops.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996412&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thirteen people, including a child, were killed in two blasts targeting a polio vaccination team in Pakistan&#8217;s northwest on Saturday, the latest in a string of attacks against the campaign to eradicate the crippling disease.</p>
<p>The blasts in Jamrud area of Khyber tribal region, 30 km southwest of Peshawar, occurred when health workers were administering polio drops, said Jhangir Wazir, assistant political agent of the area.</p>
<p>Twelve paramilitary troops and a child were killed and 10 more were injured, sources said. The troops were guarding a convoy of vaccinators.</p>
<p>A vehicle carrying security personnel was destroyed while another was damaged in the attack.</p>
<p>The dead and injured were taken to Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar, while additional security forces rushed to spot. The area was cordoned off and a search operation was launched.</p>
<p>The blasts were the latest attack on efforts to root out the crippling disease in Pakistan, which is one of only three countries where polio remains endemic.</p>
<p>The fifth phase of an anti-polio drive began in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, today amid tight security.</p>
<p>The administration imposed Section 144 CrPC and banned pillion riding on motorcycles to provide security for the campaign.</p>
<p>Nearly 4,500 security personnel have been deployed to provide security to vaccinators.</p>
<p>The Taliban have banned polio vaccinations in parts of the tribal belt till the US stops drone strikes. Tens of thousands of children have been left vulnerable by the ban.</p>
<p>Dozens of health workers and security personnel have died in attacks on polio vaccination teams in the northwest and the port city of Karachi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996409&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Turkey&#8217;s parliament has passed a bill to close down thousands of private schools, many of which are run by an influential Muslim cleric embroiled in a bitter feud with the government.</p>
<p>The move is the latest blow struck in a rivalry between Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his former ally Fethullah Gulen which has seen the Turkish government entangled in a graft scandal and shaken to its core.</p>
<p>In a late-night session yesterday, lawmakers in the 550-seat house voted 226 for and 22 against the bill which sets September 1, 2015 as the deadline to shut down the network of schools.</p>
<p>Around 4,000 private schools in Turkey are run by Gulen, and provide a major source of income for his Hizmet (Service) movement, which describes itself as a global, social and cultural movement inspired by Islamic ideals.</p>
<p>Tensions have long simmered between Erdogan and Gulen, who once worked hand-in-hand as the conservative pro-business middle class rose at the expense of the military and former secular elite.</p>
<p>But they reached breaking point in November when government first floated the idea of shutting down the schools, which aim to help students prepare for high school and university.</p>
<p>Erdogan said at the time he wanted to abolish an &#8220;illegal&#8221; and unfair education system which he charged turned children<br />
into &#8220;competition horses&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who benefit from these courses are the kids of rich families in big cities,&#8221; said the Turkish premier, who himself hails from humble roots and has tried to burnish an image as a man of the people during his term in office.</p>
<p>In mid-December dozens of Erdogan&#8217;s allies were detained in police raids on allegations of bribery in construction projects, gold smuggling and illicit dealings with Iran.</p>
<p>A Turkish court yesterday released the last five suspects detained in the corruption probe, including the sons of two<br />
former ministers.</p>
<p>However the corruption crisis, which dragged down four ministers and prompted a cabinet shake-up, has posed the most serious challenge to Erdogan&#8217;s Islamic-rooted government since it came to power in 2002.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996406&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Beleaguered former dictator Pervez Musharraf was on Saturday summoned by a Pakistani court to appear on March 15 in a case related to the death of a cleric of the radical Lal Masjid during a 2007 military operation.</p>
<p>At the next hearing, the court will also decide on 70-year-old Musharraf&#8217;s plea seeking permanent exemption from appearance in the case.</p>
<p>Additional sessions court judge Wajid Ali granted Musharraf exemption for today&#8217;s hearing.</p>
<p>Following a request by Musharraf&#8217;s lawyer to grant him permanent exemption, the judge said he would decide the issue on March 15.</p>
<p>Cleric Abdul Rasheed Ghazi was killed when army troops cracked down on the Lal Masjid to flush out militants who were holed up in the pro-Taliban mosque in Islamabad.</p>
<p>The operation was conducted at a time when Musharraf was both president and army chief.</p>
<p>At least 100 people, a majority of them extremists, were killed during the operation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996389&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Representatives of 22 nations met in Jakarta on Saturday to discuss Palestinian development, with co-chairs Japan and  Indonesia reiterating their support for a two-state solution.</p>
<p>The second Conference on Cooperation among East Asian Countries for Palestinian Development (CEAPAD) is aimed at boosting infrastructure and supporting the private sector in the Palestinian Territories. But a looming deadline for a  full Middle East peace deal brokered by US Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to feature prominently in talks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We still believe that the two-state vision can be envisaged and realised. And here I must commend the&#8230; efforts of  Mr John Kerry,&#8221; Palestinian prime minister Rami Hamdallah said during the conference&#8217;s opening. Kerry, who coaxed the two sides back to the negotiating table in late July after a three-year hiatus, said on Wednesday a full deal would likely  slip past the April 29 deadline.</p>
<p>The document has not yet been made public, but Hamdallah said Friday &#8220;all issues actually have been (put) on the table&#8221;.</p>
<p>The document is understood to include a non-binding proposal laying out guidelines for negotiating the central issues of the conflict, including such as borders, security, Jerusalem, the settlements and the right of return for Palestinian  refugees.</p>
<p>Hamdallah expressed gratitude to donor nations, but said Israeli settlements were &#8220;severely&#8221; hampering development.  &#8221;Sixty-two percent of all our land is still controlled by the Israeli authorities. This impedes any access we have to natural resources, and severely restricts our development,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people of Palestine have been struggling to achieve this dream for more than five decades,&#8221; Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said at the opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Providing them with capacity-building programme is critical.&#8221; Yudhoyono said that Indonesia envisaged a Middle East  &#8221;at peace with itself and the rest of the world&#8221; and that peace would also depend on a treaty on nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996270&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The UN Security Council has held an &#8220;urgent&#8221; meeting to discuss the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, asking all political actors in the strife-torn country to exercise maximum restraint and resolve issues through inclusive dialogue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Security Council&#8230;reviewed with concern the recent developments in Ukraine,&#8221; Raimonda Murmokaite, Permanent Representative of Lithuania, which holds the rotating presidency of the 15-nation body for February, said.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after the UNSC consultations, Murmokaite said the Council had been briefed by UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Oscar Fernandez-Taranco.</p>
<p>&#8220;Support was expressed for the unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine. The Council agreed that it was important that all political actors in Ukraine exercise maximum restraint and called for an inclusive dialogue recognising the diversity of the Ukrainian society,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Council held closed-door consultations at the request of the Permanent Mission of Ukraine to the UN, which appealed in a letter to the Council President for an &#8220;urgent&#8221; meeting &#8220;due to the deterioration of the situation in the Autonomous Republic of the Crimea, Ukraine, which threatens the territorial integrity of Ukraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the meeting, Ukraine&#8217;s UN ambassador Yuriy Sergeyev accused Russia of illegally sending military planes and attack helicopters and said his country was strong enough to defend itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are strong enough to defend ourselves,&#8221; he said outside the council chamber.</p>
<p>American Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said the US is &#8220;gravely disturbed&#8221; by reports of Russian military deployments into the Crimea.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States calls upon Russia to pull back the military forces that are being built up in the region, to stand down, and to allow the Ukrainian people the opportunity to pursue their own government, create their own destiny and to do so freely without intimidation or fear,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Last week, Members of the Ukrainian Parliament voted to remove President Viktor Yanukovych, and an arrest warrant has reportedly been issued for his arrest.</p>
<p>The move came after more than 100 people were killed last week in the latest wave of deadly clashes in Kiev.</p>
<p>Amid the rapidly unfolding events in Ukraine, UN Chief Ban Ki-moon has called for an inclusive political process to enable the country to emerge from the crisis, one which reflects the aspirations of its people and preserves its unity and territorial integrity.</p>
<p>The Secretary-General has dispatched Robert Serry to Kiev as his Senior Advisor to assure all citizens of Ukraine of the UN&#8217;s support and also convey that he expects all key international actors to work collaboratively to help the country during the crisis.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996272&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ford-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996245" alt="A fluent Arabic speaker, Ford became Washington's first ambassador to Damascus in five years when he was named in late 2010. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ford-med.jpg" /></a> A fluent Arabic speaker, Ford became Washington&#8217;s first ambassador to Damascus in five years when he was named in late 2010. (Reuters)
<p>Robert Ford, the US ambassador to Syria who has been Washington&#8217;s main pointman in efforts to end the war working with opposition leaders battling President Bashar al-Assad, stepped down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Robert Ford is retiring from the foreign service on Saturday after nearly 30 years of distinguished service,&#8221; State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.</p>
<p>She admitted that the departure of Ford, who over the past three years has built up extensive contacts with the opposition leaders and was instrumental in helping to bring them to the Geneva peace talks, would be a loss.</p>
<p>&#8220;His extraordinary leadership has guided our response to one of the most formidable foreign policy challenges in the region,&#8221; Psaki said.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the outbreak of the crisis, Ambassador Ford has worked tirelessly in support of the Syrian people in their pursuit of freedom and dignity.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fluent Arabic speaker, Ford became Washington&#8217;s first ambassador to Damascus in five years when he was named in late 2010.</p>
<p>But just a few months into his post, Ford was abruptly pulled out of the country in October 2011 amid fears for his safety when he became a vocal critic of the Assad regime and its crackdown on the pro-democracy uprising that erupted in March that year. He never returned full-time to Syria.</p>
<p>Ford was increasingly criticised by the regime, which accused him of helping incite violence and was angered when he visited protest hubs outside the capital in a show of solidarity with pro-democracy demonstrators.</p>
<p>In late September 2011, Ford was blocked inside a building for a few hours during a meeting with opposition member Hassan Abdel Azim when nearly 100 angry pro-regime protesters tried to storm the offices.</p>
<p>Washington decided to close the embassy in 2012 as the uprising descended swiftly into a bloody civil war.</p>
<p>Since then, Ford has shuttled between the United States and Turkey, spending hours huddled with opposition leaders based out of Istanbul as he sought to help them form a more cohesive and inclusive body.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996185&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/obamam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993909" alt="Obama and European leaders would consider skipping a G8 summit this summer in the Russian city of Sochi if Moscow intervenes militarily in Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/obamam.jpg" /></a> Obama and European leaders would consider skipping a G8 summit this summer in Sochi,  if Moscow intervenes militarily in Ukraine, U.S. official said. (AP)
<p>US President Barack Obama warned Russia on Friday that military intervention in Ukraine would lead to &#8220;costs,&#8221; as tension<br />
with old foe President Vladimir Putin rose in a Cold War-style crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside of Ukraine,&#8221; he<br />
told reporters. Obama and European leaders would consider skipping a G8 summit this summer in the Russian city of Sochi<br />
if Moscow intervenes militarily in Ukraine, a senior U.S. official said. The G8 includes the world&#8217;s seven leading industrial nations and Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military<br />
intervention in Ukraine,&#8221;Obama said in the White House briefing room. Facing yet another confrontation with Putin after<br />
butting heads with him over Syria, Obama said any violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity would be<br />
&#8220;deeply destabilizing.&#8221; Obama did not spell out what he meant by Russian military intervention.</p>
<p>Russia has a huge naval base in Ukraine&#8217;s Crimea Peninsula and says it has the right to move troops in Ukraine under an<br />
agreement between the two former Soviet neighbors. U.S. officials said they saw indications of Russian troop movements<br />
into Crimea but that their numbers and intentions were unclear.</p>
<p>The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, Republican Mike Rogers, said in a statement:<br />
&#8220;It appears that the Russian military now controls the Crimean peninsula.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vice President Joe Biden called Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk on Friday &#8220;to reaffirm the United States&#8217;<br />
strong support for the new government and our commitment to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and democratic future<br />
of Ukraine,&#8221; the White House said.</p>
<p>The crisis has presented Obama with a difficult challenge days after the ouster of Viktor Yanukovich, Ukraine&#8217;s<br />
pro-Moscow president, who fled to Russia following three months of protests in Kiev. Armed men took control of two<br />
airports in the Crimea region in what the new Ukrainian leadership described as an invasion by Moscow&#8217;s forces, and<br />
Yanukovich surfaced in Russia a week after he fled Kiev.</p>
<p>Ukraine fell into political crisis last year when Yanukovich spurned a broad trade deal with the European Union and<br />
accepted a $15 billion Russian bailout that is now in question. A U.S. response to any Russian intervention in Ukraine<br />
could include avoiding deeper trade and commerce ties that Moscow is seeking, the senior U.S. official said.</p>
<p>Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine now at the Brookings Institution think tank, said it was inconceivable<br />
that the United States would consider a military response were Russia to seek to gain control of Crimea, and that it had<br />
few plausible options to oppose such a move.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at the U.S.-Russian relationship, what kinds of things could we do to punish them? There are not a lot of<br />
good levers there,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Putin has proved immune to U.S. calls for Moscow to stop supporting Syria&#8217;s government in its three-year-old civil war. And the United States was unable to prevent Putin from staging Russian incursions into neighboring Georgia in 2008.<br />
<strong>IMF SEES NO PANIC</strong></p>
<p>In the struggle between the West and Russia for influence in Ukraine, both sides are wielding money. Putin last year<br />
offered $15 billion for Kiev, $3 billion of which has been delivered, in what was widely seen as a reward for  Yanukovich&#8217;s turning away from the EU deal. Now, support from the Washington-based International Monetary Fund is seen  as critical to shoring up Ukraine&#8217;s collapsing finances.</p>
<p>The United States and the EU say they are willing to provide funds alongside an IMF program.Russia also supports the<br />
fund&#8217;s involvement, and an IMF team is set to arrive in Kiev early next week to collect information and start working<br />
on a loan program.</p>
<p>But IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde on Friday suggested there was no rush to help Ukraine, which says it needs<br />
$35 billion over two years to avoid default and may need $4 billion immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not see anything that is critical, that is worthy of panic at the moment,&#8221; Lagarde told reporters. &#8220;We would<br />
certainly hope that the (Ukrainian) authorities refrain from throwing lots of numbers which are really meaningless until<br />
they&#8217;ve been assessed properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers are hammering out details of an assistance package for Ukraine. Senator Chris Murphy, chairman of a Senate<br />
subcommittee on European affairs, said the package would be part of a broader, coordinated program with the EU, the IMF<br />
and other international partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I encourage the new government to implement the necessary economic reforms to stabilize the economy and set Ukraine on<br />
a path to prosperity, including rooting out corruption and increasing transparency in government finances,&#8221; Murphy said.<br />
Republican Senator John McCain, a long-time Putin critic, said diplomatic and economic sanctions could be imposed. But<br />
Putin does not fear the United States, he told.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996138&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;"><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/al.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1995993" alt="The court said Navalny, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin and a leader of anti-Kremlin protests in 2011 and 2012, had violated rules barring him from leaving Moscow." /></a>A Russian court placed opposition leader Alexei Navalny under house arrest for at least two months Friday and barred him from using the Internet or speaking to the media.</span></p>
<p>The court said Navalny, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin and a leader of anti-Kremlin protests in 2011 and 2012, had violated rules barring him from leaving Moscow.</p>
<p>Navalny denounced the ruling as baseless and said it was meant to silence him. Supporters, including members of protest band Pussy Riot, shouted “Freedom!” as he left the courtroom.</p>
<p>“I believe the new measures are based on trumped up grounds in order to restrict my political activities,” Navalny, 37, said in court.</p>
<p>Kremlin opponents say the upheaval in neighbouring Ukraine, where protests forced President Viktor Yanukovych from power after he scrapped plans for closer European Union ties to move closer to Moscow, has deepened Putin’s determination to prevent any revival the earlier street demostrations.</p>
<p>They say Putin is also clamping down on dissent after engineering the release of long-jailed oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and two members Pussy Riot before the Sochi Olympics, which ended last week.</p>
<p>Navalny, who gained prominence with blog posts alleging government corruption, emerged from the biggest protests of Putin’s 14-year rule as the main opposition leader and a potential future challenger in elections.</p>
<p>He is serving a five-year suspended sentence on a theft conviction that will keep him out of a 2018 presidential vote, and has been charged with theft and money-laundering in a separate case that has not come to trial.</p>
<p>Under the terms of his house arrest, which expires on April 28 but is renewable, he is barred from using the Internet and telephone and can only speak to close relatives, his lawyers and the authorities, his spokeswoman Anna Veduta said on Twitter.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995990&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/meinkampfm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995826" alt="Adolf Hitler wrote &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; while in prison. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/meinkampfm.jpg" /></a> Adolf Hitler wrote &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221; while in prison. (AP)
<p>Two rare copies of &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221; signed by the young Nazi leader Adolf Hitler went under the hammer for USD 64,850 in Los Angeles, auctioneers have said.</p>
<p>The two-volume set &#8211; a first edition and a second edition &#8211; of the future German Fuehrer&#8217;s political manifesto had been estimated to go for USD 20-25,000 in a sale organised by Nate D. Sanders Auctions.</p>
<p>Eleven people bid for the volumes, both signed by Hitler and dedicated to Josef Bauer, an early Nazi party member and a leader of the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch bid to overthrow the Bavarian government.</p>
<p>Hitler likely gave them to Bauer as Christmas gifts in 1925 and 1926, expressing best wishes for the holiday season, the auctioneers said.</p>
<p>They called the books &#8220;an ominously signed set of books that futilely warned the world of Hitler&#8217;s intentions,&#8221; adding they were more rare in that they were dedicated to a fellow Nazi leader.</p>
<p>The young Hitler wrote &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221; (&#8220;My Struggle&#8221;) in prison, setting out his political doctrine and blaming Germany&#8217;s woes on an array of groups including Jews and Marxists.</p>
<p>After Hitler&#8217;s rise to power in 1933, millions of copies were published. As of 1936, the Nazi state gave a copy to all newlyweds as a gift.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s auction also sold a leather jacket owned by Albert Speer, Hitler&#8217;s chief architect and minister for armaments and war, which fetched USD 10,068.</p>
<p>After the war, the jacket was seized by an Allied soldier named Ralph, who wrote in a letter to his mother in May, 1945: &#8220;Looked around today in a huge chalet of a high-ranking Nazi. For you I have a gold necklace. And for Dad, I have a great leather jacket&#8230;I took a coat with no Nazi symbols on the outside. Unfortunately, the name of Nazi Albert Speer is stamped in the jacket&#8230;&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995819&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China  sought enhanced &#8220;pragmatic military cooperation&#8221; with Pakistan to jointly safeguard regional peace and stability in the face of the &#8220;ever-changing&#8221; global security situation. Chinese Defense Minister Chang Wanquann, on an official visit to Pakistan, said the &#8220;all-weather&#8221; friendship between the two countries is a strategic choice of the two sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;China and Pakistan should continue to enhance pragmatic military cooperation to jointly safeguard regional peace and stability,&#8221; he was quoted as saying by China&#8217;s state-run Xinhua news agency. During his meeting with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Chang said bilateral military ties &#8220;should become closer in the face of ever-changing international and regional security situations&#8221;.</p>
<p>Chang also called on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who said Pakistan deeply values China&#8217;s support for its national security and territorial integrity. China has emerged the largest international investor in Pakistan, where it is pumping in billions of dollars in sectors like energy and telecommunications. The two countries are also working on the ambitiousKashgar-Gwadar trade corridor that will pass through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, which borders the restive Xinjiang province.</p>
<p>The project includes construction of a 200-km tunnel that will facilitate trade and commuters. Sharif said the corridor would benefit both countries and transform the regional economy as it would dovetail with the strategy of connecting South and Central Asia.</p>
<p>&#8221;Solid foundation for our time-tested and all-weatherfriendship is provided by strong mutual trust, excellent cooperation and convergence of views on regional and global issues,&#8221; Sharif said. The premier expressed confidence that Pakistan-China cooperation, including defence, will continue to grow.</p>
<p>Chang reiterated his government&#8217;s support for Pakistan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995720&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iphone-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995689" alt="Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius stands inside a court during his bail hearing at the magistrate court in Pretoria, South Africa. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iphone-med.jpg" /></a> Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius stands inside a court during his bail hearing at the magistrate court in Pretoria, South Africa. (AP)
<p>South African prosecutors pressing a murder charge against Oscar Pistorius secured a meeting Thursday with Apple officials in the United States over accessing potentially crucial evidence on the double-amputee athlete&#8217;s locked iPhone, they said.</p>
<p>Pistorius claimed he forgot the password for the cellphone, one of a number found at his upscale villa after he shot dead girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp Feb. 14, 2013.</p>
<p>Investigators have been seeking help from Apple through the F.B.I. since last year to get access to the phone, a spokesman for South Africa&#8217;s National Prosecuting Authority said. Investigators from South Africa would now meet with Apple officials Thursday at the tech giant&#8217;s headquarters in California, spokesman Nathi Mncube said.</p>
<p>Pistorius&#8217; trial starts Monday, giving both prosecutors and Pistorius&#8217; defense team just four days to analyze any information on the iPhone. Prosecutors would be obliged to also give any evidence they find to Pistorius&#8217; lawyers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can only add on the evidence we already have,&#8221; Mncube said in an interview with TV station eNCA. &#8220;It cannot be prejudicial to our case. The people concerned, should the evidence be favorable to us, are the defense. Then we have a responsibility to make it available to them as soon as we have it so they can also prepare for the trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prosecution maintains that Pistorius had a fight with Steenkamp before killing her, a cornerstone of its case, and information on the Olympian&#8217;s phone may shed light on events before the pre-dawn shooting last Valentine&#8217;s Day. Pistorius says he shot the model and reality TV star after mistaking her for a dangerous intruder.</p>
<p>South African prosecutors hope to have the information from the phone by late Thursday, Mncube said, adding that they would make any evidence from the phone available to Pistorius&#8217; defense lawyers.</p>
<p>He wouldn&#8217;t comment on what prosecutors might be looking for on the phone.</p>
<p>But even without access to Pistorius&#8217; iPhone, Mncube said the state had enough evidence to support the premeditated murder charge. Court documents indicate prosecutors are expected to build much of their case against the world-famous runner on witnesses who the state claims will testify to hearing a woman in Pistorius&#8217; house screaming before the sound of gunshots. That suggests a fight and contradicts Pistorius&#8217; version of events.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also will likely try to use the trajectory of the bullets from the four shots fired by Pistorius through a toilet door to show he intended to kill Steenkamp and was not fearful and acting in self-defense.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very confident that we have sufficient evidence,&#8221; prosecution spokesman Mncube said. &#8220;And that the evidence we have already will be more than sufficient to secure us hopefully a conviction in this matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutors are seeking a life sentence for Pistorius should he be convicted of murder in Steenkamp&#8217;s killing, meaning he would have to serve at least 25 years in prison before being eligible for parole. There is no death penalty in South Africa.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995678&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/russsia-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995674" alt="Armed men guard Simferopol airport." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/russsia-med.jpg" /></a> Armed men guard Simferopol airport.
<p>Dozens of armed men in military uniforms seized an airport in the capital of Ukraine&#8217;s strategic Crimea region early Friday, a report said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said that 50 or so men were wearing the same gear as the ones who seized government buildings in the city, Simferopol, Thursday and raised the Russian flag.</p>
<p>The report said the men with &#8220;Russian Navy ensigns&#8221; first surrounded the Simferopol Airport&#8217;s domestic flights terminal. The report could not be immediately confirmed. A woman who later answered the phone at the airport said &#8220;no comment,&#8221; and the airport&#8217;s website listed the morning&#8217;s first flight, to Moscow, as boarding on schedule.</p>
<p>The events in the Crimea region have heightened tensions with neighboring Russia, which scrambled fighter jets to patrol borders in the first stirrings of a potentially dangerous confrontation reminiscent of Cold War brinksmanship.</p>
<p>Russia also has granted shelter to Ukraine&#8217;s fugitive president, Viktor Yanukovych, after recent deadly protests in Kiev swept in a new government.</p>
<p>While the government in Kiev, led by a pro-Western technocrat, pledged to prevent any national breakup, there were mixed signals in Moscow. Russia pledged to respect Ukraine&#8217;s territorial integrity.</p>
<p>Yanukovych was said to be holed up in a luxury government retreat, with a news conference scheduled Friday near the Ukrainian border. He has not been seen publicly since Saturday.</p>
<p>As masked gunmen wearing unmarked camouflage uniforms erected a sign reading &#8220;Crimea is Russia&#8221; in Simferopol Thursday, Ukraine&#8217;s interim prime minister declared the Black Sea territory &#8220;has been and will be a part of Ukraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The escalating conflict sent Ukraine&#8217;s finances plummeting further, prompting Western leaders to prepare an emergency financial package.</p>
<p>Yanukovych, whose abandonment of closer ties to Europe in favor of a bailout loan from Russia set off three months of protests, finally fled by helicopter last week as his allies deserted him.</p>
<p>The humiliating exit was a severe blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been celebrating his signature Olympics even as Ukraine&#8217;s drama came to a crisis.</p>
<p>The Russian leader has long dreamed of pulling Ukraine &#8211; a country of 46 million people considered the cradle of Russian civilization &#8211; closer into Moscow&#8217;s orbit.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995643&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cccc.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995576" alt="Chinese President Xi Jinping said  &quot;No Internet safety means no national security&quot;" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cccc.jpg" /></a> Chinese President Xi Jinping said &#8220;No Internet safety means no national security&#8221;
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has put himself in charge of a new body to coordinate cybersecurity, in a sign of Beijing&#8217;s concern over its vulnerability to online attacks and its desire to retain tight control over the Internet.</p>
<p>Reports in state media Friday said the central Internet security and information leading group will draft policy for boosting the country&#8217;s defenses, as well as expanding and improving Internet access.</p>
<p>&#8220;Efforts should be made to build our country into a cyberpower,&#8221; Xi was quoted as saying, calling for more innovation in the industry and improvements to Internet access and connection speeds. Online opinion must be properly guided, while the Internet should help spread &#8220;mainstream values and positive energy,&#8221; Xi said.</p>
<p>With a population of 1.3 billion, China has 618 million Internet users, the most of any country, although much of the rural population remains gravely underserved.,&#8221; Xi said, adding that without boosting Internet access there can be &#8220;no modernization.&#8221;</p>
<p>No details were given about the group, one of several broad-based coordinating agencies nominally led by Xi and other top leaders. Reports on Thursday&#8217;s inaugural meeting at which Xi delivered his remarks did not mention any specific new initiatives.</p>
<p>The U.S. accuses China&#8217;s army and China-based hackers of launching attacks on American industrial and military targets, often to steal secrets or intellectual property. China says it likewise faces a major threat from hackers, and the country&#8217;s military is believed to be among the biggest targets of the U.S. National Security Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command.</p>
<p>Between January and August of last year, more than 20,000 China-based websites were hacked and more than 8 million servers hijacked by zombie and Trojan programs controlled from overseas, the head of the Cabinet&#8217;s Information Office, Cai Mingzhao, told a conference in November.</p>
<p>Zombie and Trojan attacks were up 14 percent over the same period in 2012, Cai said. He estimated that China&#8217;s economy was losing tens of billions of dollars to cyberattacks every year.</p>
<p>Virginia-based Internet security company Mandiant drew attention last year when it issued a detailed report tracing attacks on 141 companies to a hacking unit in Shanghai that experts believe is part of the Chinese Army&#8217;s cyber command. The Chinese government denied the accusations.</p>
<p>Partly as a response, a U.S.-China joint cybersecurity working group was established and has already met once to foster cooperation against third party threats. China has enthusiastically promoted the idea of international cooperation on cybersecurity, but its proposal for a set of rules governing online behavior has been rejected by the U.S. as opening the door to greater regulation and censorship.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s authoritarian communist government heavily polices the Internet for content deemed politically subversive, as well as sites promoting gambling, pornography and other illegal topics. Much foreign content is blocked, including social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. However, that hasn&#8217;t prevented China&#8217;s government and state media outlets such as national broadcaster CCTV from maintaining a lively presence on such blocked sites.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995477&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pentagon.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995583  " alt="Several officials said the CIA has long advocated killing Shami, and that the Pentagon, while initially reluctant to put him on a target list, has more recently come to the CIA's position. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pentagon.jpg" /></a> Officials said the CIA has long advocated killing Shami, and that the Pentagon, while initially reluctant to put him on a target list, has more recently come to the CIA&#8217;s position. (AP)
<p>A US-born al-Qaeda militant hiding in the mountains of northwestern Pakistan is at the centre of a debate inside the government over whether President Barack Obama should once again take the &#8220;extraordinary step&#8221; of authorising the killing of an American citizen overseas.</p>
<p>Abdullah al-Shami was born possibly in Texas but moved with his family to the Middle East when he was a toddler.</p>
<p>Shami has now worked his way up the ranks of al-Qaeda&#8217;s senior leadership in Pakistan. His position in the terrorist group strengthened after he married the daughter of a group leader.</p>
<p>He appears to have risen to become one of al-Qaeda&#8217;s top planners for operations outside Pakistan, including plots against American troops in Afghanistan, the New York Times reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have clear and convincing evidence that he&#8217;s involved in the production and distribution of IEDs,&#8221; the NYT quoted a senior administration official as saying, referring to improvised explosive devices that have long been used to kill American troops in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The debate to whether the US should use drones to kill Shami &#8220;encapsulates some of the thorniest questions raised by the targeted killing programme that Obama has embraced as president: under what circumstances the government may kill American citizens without a trial, whether the battered leadership of al-Qaeda in Pakistan still poses an imminent threat to Americans, and whether the CIA or the Pentagon ought to be the dominant agency running America’s secret wars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shami came to the attention of American authorities in 2008, when another American Bryant Neal Vinas was being trained by al-Qaeda in Pakistan.</p>
<p>An FBI probe revealed that Shami had left the US as a young child and had not maintained any ties to the country.</p>
<p>Even as the Obama administration remains divided on the issue, the Justice Department has been asked to evaluate whether killing Shami in an operation is &#8220;legally justified&#8221;.</p>
<p>Several officials said the CIA has long advocated killing Shami, and that the Pentagon, while initially reluctant to put him on a target list, has more recently come to the CIA&#8217;s position.</p>
<p>The debate over the fate of Shami comes less than a year after Obama announced new guidelines to tighten the rules for carrying out lethal drone operations.</p>
<p>As part of the new rules ordered by Obama, the Pentagon and not the CIA is supposed to carry out any lethal strike against an American overseas.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has complicated discussions about Shami, since the CIA alone carries out drone strikes in Pakistan, under the agency’s covert action authority,&#8221; the report said, adding this was one of the conditions of a bargain that the spy agency struck in 2004 with then Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to allow the CIA to carry out drone strikes.</p>
<p>The debate over Shami&#8217;s fate is the first time that the Obama administration has discussed killing an American citizen abroad since American-born terrorist leader Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in a CIA drone strike in Yemen in 2011.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995515&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(UNRWA)
<p>Gaunt, ragged figures fill the streets for as far as the eye can see in the besieged Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmuk outside Damascus, where some 40,000 are said to be slowly starving to death.</p>
<p>The United Nations distributed shocking images this week of thousands of people, their faces emaciated, desperately flocking to receive food aid that only a few were lucky enough to collect.</p>
<p>&#8220;We live in a big prison,&#8221; said Rami al-Sayed, a Syrian activist living in Yarmuk adding &#8220;But at least, in a prison, you have food. Here, there&#8217;s nothing. We are slowly dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes, crowds of children stop me on the streets, begging me: &#8216;For the love of God, we want to eat, give us food.&#8217; But of course, I have no food to give them,&#8221; Sayed said.</p>
<p>After months of shelling and fierce fighting in and around Yarmuk between rebels and President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s troops, the camp&#8217;s population has shrunk from more than 150,000 to 40,000. Among them are 18,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>Since last summer, the area has been under choking army siege, creating inhumane conditions for its inhabitants. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been living off herbs, but these herbs are bitter. Even animals won&#8217;t eat them and if you go to the orchards to pick herbs from there, to use them to cook soup, you&#8217;ll get sniped,&#8221; said Sayed.</p>
<p>Even the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestinians was overwhelmed by the drama. Since January, the agency has only been able to carry out limited, intermittent food distribution in the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;The situation is really tragic. On the streets, all you see are emaciated people, their faces drained of any life. Sadness is everywhere,&#8221; said Sayed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995452&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/uuuu.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995446" alt="A participant in the competition for the longest ash is dizzied by the smoke of her cigar during theCuba Cigar festival" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/uuuu.jpg" /></a> A participant in the competition for the longest ash is dizzied by the smoke of her cigar during the Cuba Cigar festival (AP)
<p>Pungent smoke filled the room, obscuring the lights and leaving clothing and skin reeking. There was applause, shouts and laughter, and above all plenty of H. Upmann Sir Winstons — formidable 7-inch (17.8-centimeter) Cuban cigars.</p>
<p>More than 450 stogie aficionados took part in an unusual contest on Thursday at Havana&#8217;s annual marquee Cigar Festival: competing to see who could create the longest unbroken ash.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love it,&#8221; Argentine sommelier Flavio Lanfredi said good-naturedly despite falling out of contention early on. &#8220;For me this is like going to Mecca, or a kid entering a toy store and they tell you to grab whatever you want, it&#8217;s yours. It&#8217;s really exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a cavernous room in Havana&#8217;s Palace of Conventions, contestants exhaled clouds of smoke and handled their cigars gingerly to keep the gray ash intact as long as possible. They lolled on luxurious leather chairs set amid tables holding dozens of ashtrays, lighters, chocolate-flavored hard candy and snifters of aged Cuban rum.</p>
<p>Many, like Lanfredi, lost their ashes before smoking even halfway through. Others managed to keep going until their cigars were little more than tiny stubs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a little bit stressful, and I&#8217;m somewhat dizzy,&#8221; said Cuban restaurateur Andres Espinosa, one of the better finishers with a 6.2-inch (15.8-cm) ash.</p>
<p>Just over a half-hour in, only a handful of finalists remained. Judges milled about the room handing out rulers to measure the results.</p>
<p>It would be hard to top Olivia Terri, also from Cuba, who smoked her Sir Winston down to a stub with an ash that grew to 6.6 inches (16.7 cm) before it crumbled.</p>
<p>The Sir Winston is a chubby cigar with a rich brown color and a hint of toasted gold. It&#8217;s hand-rolled with a selection of tobacco leaves from the western province of Pinar del Rio, the cradle of Cuba&#8217;s tobacco country.</p>
<p>The event was both a light-hearted competition and also an exhibition calculated to show off Cuba&#8217;s premium tobacco, which is among the most coveted in the world. Some 1,500 smokers from 80 countries are attending the weeklong festival.</p>
<p>&#8220;This (contest) in particular is aimed at people being able to appreciate the quality of our product,&#8221; said Ana Lopez, marketing director for Habanos SA, a Cuban-British joint company that produces and distributes Cuban cigars exclusively. &#8220;Only products of magnificent quality can make the ash take on a permanent consistency for a long time.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995426&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nk-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995442" alt="North Korea fired short-range missiles to protest against ongoing U.S.-South Korean military. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nk-med.jpg" /></a> North Korea fired short-range missiles to protest against ongoing U.S.-South Korean military. (Reuters)
<p>South Korea on Friday labelled North Korea&#8217;s test firing of four short-range missiles a calculated, provocative act timed to coincide with South-US joint military exercises.</p>
<p>North Korea test-fired the missiles into the Sea of Japan on Thursrday, three days after the joint drills kicked off in the face of vocal opposition from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the exercises underway, we see the firings as a calculated, provocative act,&#8221; defence ministry spokesman Kim Min-Seok told journalists.</p>
<p>He noted that the launches also came days after an incursion by a North Korean patrol boat across the disputed Yellow Sea border that has been the scene of brief but bloody naval clashes in the past.</p>
<p>Kim said the tests were of Scud-type missiles at the longer edge of the short-range spectrum, with an estimated reach of 300-800 kilometres &#8212; capable of striking any target in the South.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the North re-engineers Scuds or tests them, we always undertake a serious analysis to consider counter-measures,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kim stressed that the annual military drills with the United States would continue as planned.</p>
<p>North Korea fired short-range missiles to protest against ongoing U.S.-South Korean military.</p>
<p>In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki urged North Korea &#8220;to exercise restraint and take steps to improve its relations with its neighbours&#8221;.</p>
<p>But Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren acknowledged that such short-range tests did not put the North in breach of international resolutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We view this as an unannounced weapons test that we see somewhat regularly,&#8221; he told reporters in Washington.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for North Korea to carry out such tests and observers said they were unlikely to trigger a significant rise in military tensions.</p>
<p>Despite the start of the South Korea-US drills on Monday, which the North routinely condemns as rehearsals for invasion, relations between Seoul and Pyongyang are currently enjoying something of a thaw.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995422&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pope3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995424" alt="Bishop Elias Zaidan, left, ordains deacon Wissam Akiki, who is married, during a ceremony at St. Raymond’s Maronite Cathedral Thursday, Feb. 27, 2014, in St. Louis.

(AP photo)
<p>The Maronite Catholic Church in the United States has ordained a married priest for the first time in nearly a century, after Pope Francis gave his permission.</p>
<p>A ceremony at the ornate St. Raymond&#8217;s Maronite Cathedral in St. Louis ordained Deacon Wissam Akiki last night.</p>
<p>Maronites are among more than a dozen Eastern Catholic church groups in the United States. Eastern Catholics accept the authority of the pope, but have many of their own rituals and liturgy.</p>
<p>Eastern Catholic churches in the Middle East and Europe ordain married men. However, the Vatican banned the practice in America in the 1920s after Latin-rite bishops complained it was confusing for parishioners. But Pope John Paul II called for greater acceptance of Eastern Catholic traditions.</p>
<p>And over the years, popes have made exceptions on a case-by-case basis for married men to become Eastern Catholic priests in the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost half of our priests in Lebanon are married, so it&#8217;s not an unusual event in the life of the Maronite Church, though in the United States it is,&#8221; Deacon Louis Peters, chancellor at St. Raymond&#8217;s, said on Thrusday.</p>
<p>Peters said the pope&#8217;s action does not lift the ban on married priests in the US It is simply an exception.</p>
<p>Whether the decision would open the door for more married priests wasn&#8217;t clear. Experts cautioned against reading too much into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly not an automatic indication that the mandate of celibacy within Roman rite will be overturned,&#8221; said Randy Rosenberg, a theological studies professor at Saint Louis University.</p>
<p>Akiki, 41, completed seminary studies at Holy Spirit University in Lebanon, Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Seminary in Washington, D.C., and the Aquinas Institute of Theology in St. Louis. He has been a deacon at St. Raymond&#8217;s since 2009 and worked as the assistant to the bishop. He and his wife, Manal Kassab, have one daughter, Perla, 8.</p>
<p>Peters said that in the most recent Maronite Patriarchal Synod, the church reaffirmed its position in support of allowing married priests, a tradition that, worldwide, dates back centuries.</p>
<p>Peters said having married priests &#8220;does not in any way detract from the value that the church finds in the vocation to celibacy. The celibate priesthood continues to be highly esteemed.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995415&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a major crackdown on child traffickers, Chinese police smashed four online baby trafficking groups and saved 382 babies earlier this month, the Ministry of Public Security has said.</p>
<p>A total of 1,094 suspects were held across the country in a joint maneuver on February 19, the ministry said. These groups are accused of trading babies by establishing illegal online platforms and shops under the name of adoption or re-homing centers.</p>
<p>Criminals have turned to the Internet for illegal human trafficking in recent years, which brings difficulties for investigation.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukeaine.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995236" alt="Armed men seized the regional parliament in a mainly ethnic Russian region and raised the Russian flag." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukeaine.jpg" /></a> Armed men seized the regional parliament in a mainly ethnic Russian region and raised the Russian flag.
<p>The United States told Russia to demonstrate in coming days that it was sincere about its promise not to intervene in Ukraine, after Crimea, the only Ukrainian region with an ethnic Russian majority, is the last big bastion of opposition to the new leadership in Kiev since pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovich was ousted at the weekend.<br />
The region also provides a base for the Russian navy&#8217;s Black Sea Fleet. Kiev&#8217;s new rulers said any movement by Russian forces beyond the base&#8217;s territory would be tantamount to aggression.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had assured him by telephone that Moscow would not intervene militarily in its neighbour. &#8220;We believe that everybody now needs to take a step back and avoid any kind of provocations,&#8221; Kerry said at a joint news conference with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to see in the next days ahead that the choices Russia makes conform to this affirmation we received today.&#8221;<br />
Yanukovich, who fled Kiev after scores of demonstrators were killed last week, was expected to hold a news conference in Russia on Friday. He has declared he is still Ukraine&#8217;s president, but has lost support even in regions where the ethnic Ukrainian population mainly speaks Russian as he does.</p>
<p>Crimea, which was administered as part of Russia within the Soviet Union until it was transferred to Ukraine in 1954, is a more tendentious question. Separatism there has often flared up at times of tension between Moscow and Kiev.</p>
<p>The apparent armed siege of the crimean parliament by unidentified gunmen created a bizarre scene: there was no official explanation of who the gunmen were, and they issued no demands. Police hardly seemed to treat the event as a major security incident.</p>
<p>Instead, they casually guarded the building below its Russian flag while hundreds of pro-Russian demonstrators assembled, including elderly people who danced cheerfully to recordings of Soviet martial music.<br />
The regional parliament even managed to hold a session inside the building on Thursday despite the siege, where it voted to stage a referendum on &#8220;sovereignty&#8221; for Crimea.</p>
<p>By the early hours of Friday, police guarding the building would not say what had happened to the gunmen or whether they were even still there. Russia&#8217;s flag still flew from its roof and lights were on in the windows of its top floor. Oleksander Turchinov, Ukraine&#8217;s acting president, warned Russia not to move personnel beyond areas permitted by treaty for those using its naval base: &#8220;Any military movements, the more so if they are with weapons, beyond the boundaries of this territory will be seen by us as military aggression,&#8221; he said.<br />
Russia has repeatedly declared it will defend the interests of its citizens in Ukraine, and on Wednesday announced war games near the border involving 150,000 troops on high alert. Kerry said Lavrov told him the war games were pre-planned.</p>
<p>Although Moscow says it will not intervene by force, its rhetoric since the removal of its ally Yanukovich has echoed the runup to its invasion of Georgia in 2008, when it sent its troops to protect two self-declared independent regions and then recognised them as independent states.</p>
<p>Witness accounts suggest those who captured the Crimean parliament building in the early hours of Thursday were pro-Russian gunmen of some kind. &#8220;We were building barricades in the night to protect parliament. Then this young Russian guy came up with a pistol &#8230; we all lay down, some more ran up, there was some shooting and around 50 went in through the window,&#8221; Leonid Khazanov, an ethnic Russian.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked them what they wanted, and they said &#8216;To make our own decisions, not to have Kiev telling us what to do&#8217;.&#8221;<br />
Ukraine&#8217;s new interior minister, Arsen Avakov, said the attackers had automatic weapons and machine guns.<br />
The regional prime minister said on Thursday he had spoken to the people by telephone, but they had not made any demands or said why they were there. They had promised to call him back but had not done so, he said.<br />
With the siege apparently still under way, the regional parliament met in another part of the building and voted to hold its referendum on May 25, the day Ukraine plans to elect a new president to replace Yanukovich. The measure, if passed, would declare Crimea sovereign, with its relationship to the rest of Ukraine governed by treaty.</p>
<p>The pro-Russian crowd outside cheered the news. &#8220;In three months we will have a chance to choose our future,&#8221; said Yuri Lukashev, 58, a carpenter standing in a group of other ethnic Russian men outside the building late at night. &#8220;We&#8217;re celebrating our victory. It&#8217;s a chance for peace in Crimea, guaranteed by Russia.&#8221;<br />
However, elsewhere there was some anger at the invasion of the regional parliament and the flying of the Russian flag.</p>
<p>Alexander Vostruyev, 60, in a leather cap and white beard, said: &#8220;It&#8217;s disgrace that the flag of a foreign country is flying on our parliament &#8230; It&#8217;s like a man coming home to find his wife in bed with another man.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995197&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Armed men seized the parliament in Ukraine’s Crimea region Thursday and raised the Russian flag, alarming Kiev’s new rulers, who urged Moscow not move troops out of its navy base on the peninsula.</p>
<p>“Wanted” former president Viktor Yanukovych meanwhile surfaced in Russia Thursday, saying he was still president of Ukraine and warned its “illegitimate” rulers that people in the southeastern and southern regions would never accept mob rule. He was reported to have been granted protection by Russia.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to Russian news agencies, Yanukovych railed against the “extremists” who had stolen power in Ukraine, threatened violence against himself and his closest aides and passed “illegal” laws. Russian news agencies later said he planned to hold a news conference on Friday (1300 GMT) in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don Crimea, the only Ukrainian region with an ethnic Russian majority, is the last big bastion of opposition to the new leadership in Kiev since President Yanukovych was ousted at the weekend and provides a base for Russia’s Black Sea fleet.</p>
<p>“I am appealing to the military leadership of the Russian Black Sea fleet,” said Oleksander Turchinov, Ukraine’s acting president. “Any military movements, the more so if they are with weapons, beyond the boundaries of this territory (the base) will be seen by us as military aggression,” he said, a day after 150,000 troops in western Russia were put on high alert.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry summoned Russia’s acting ambassador in Kiev for consultations as the face-off between Moscow and the West revived memories of the Cold War. The United States has called on Moscow to avoid doing anything risky over Ukraine, which has been in crisis since November last year, when Yanukovych abandoned a proposed trade pact with the EU and turned instead towards Russia.</p>
<p>Russia said US Secretary of State John Kerry had proposed cooperation with Moscow to resolve the Ukraine crisis during a telephone call with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Thursday. The fresh turmoil sent the Ukrainian hryvnia  tumbling to a new record low of 11 to the dollar on Reuters dealing platform. Ukraine’s new rulers pressed ahead with efforts to restore stability to the divided country, approving formation of a national coalition government with former economy minister Arseny Yatseniuk as its proposed head. Yatseniuk told parliament that Yanukovych had driven the country to the brink of collapse. He accused the deposed president of stripping state coffers bare and said $70 billion had disappeared into offshore accounts. “The state treasury has been robbed and is empty,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994978&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three men have confessed in a Saudi Arabian court that they buried alive five Asian nationals — suspected to be Indians — on a farm in an eastern province of the kingdom four years ago, local media reported.</p>
<p>The crime, committed in 2010, came to light after skeletons were discovered during digging on the farm.</p>
<p>According to a report published on Friday in the English language Arab News, 25 people have been arrested in connection with the killings in Qatif four years ago. Three of the suspects had confessed in court on Wednesday to torturing the workers for hours before then burying them alive, Arab News said.</p>
<p>The suspects include both Saudi nationals and expatriates, the report said.</p>
<p>Government sources in New Delhi said it could not be confirmed immediately whether the victims were Indians. After the case was reported in the local media, the Indian deputy chief of mission in Riyadh, Sibi George, met with the local police chief to ascertain the identities of the victims, the sources said.</p>
<p>“It cannot be said with certainty that they were Indians because the local police have not confirmed their identities yet in writing. They have told our embassy officials that they would conduct DNA tests on the remains. Our embassy is in constant touch with their foreign office,” a senior official told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>According to the Arab News report, a tenant on the farm stumbled upon the decomposing remains while clearing the land. “Investigators then found an engraved gold ring and residence cards that helped them to identify some of the victims and several suspects. The bodies were found with ropes around their arms and legs, and the their mouths filled with cotton and covered with duct tape,” the report said.</p>
<p>An unidentified man, who had been asked by a “friend” to reach the farm, is said to have given graphic details of the incident in his confession.</p>
<p>“We saw five workers with their hands tied in the seating area. When the friend with me asked why they were tied, our host said that one of them had sexually harassed his sponsor’s daughter and other women&#8230; I saw that the five Indian workers were tied and unconscious, just before we went to another room to drink alcohol and smoke hashish. While we were drinking, I heard one of them screaming so I went out and slapped him in the face,” the report quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>“Later the friend who came with me left the room with a stick and hit the worker until he bled. We then took them all into another room&#8230; The three of us continued beating the workers on different parts of their bodies while continuing to drink and smoke&#8230; We kept drinking, smoking and beating them.</p>
<p>“Our host suggested we bury them alive in a hole behind the entrance gate of the farm&#8230; We tied them again with ropes and adhesive tape so they could not move,” he said, according to the report.</p>
<p>The man said the three men then put the workers in the host’s pickup truck and dumped them into a 2.5-metre hole. “We buried them alive with all their identity cards. At the time for the dawn prayer my friend and I left the farm, while our host remained there alone,” he was quoted as saying.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994954&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Britain, battered by powerful storms and heavy rain, has had the wettest winter since 1910, the Met Office said today.</p>
<p>Regional records have also been beaten, with the flood-hit South East of England getting well over double the rainfall expected in a normal winter, the BBC reported.</p>
<p>The continuous heavy rain is the reason for extensive flooding in most parts of Britain. About 6,500 homes have been affected by floods since December, with many people have been forced to evacuate their homes.</p>
<p>Provisional figures released by the Met Office said 517.6mm of rain fell in UK between December 1 and February<br />
24. The south-east and central southern England had already broken the winter record on February 11 with a total of 439.2mm. According to the England and Wales precipitation records, some 435mm of rain fell this winter, beating the previous highest total of 423mm in 1914-1915.</p>
<p>A Met Office statement said: &#8221; The main reason for the mild and wet winter weather is that we have seen predominance of west and south-west winds, bringing in mild air from the Atlantic &#8211; as well as the<br />
unsettled and at times stormy conditions.&#8221;, he added.</p>
<p>The average temperature over the past three months has been 5.2 centigrade, about 1.5 centigrade higher than the typical winter.</p>
<p>The latest UK-wide figures also show the heavy rain in February led to south-east and central southern England<br />
receiving 133.3mm, almost two-and-a-half times the monthly average.</p>
<p>The flooding caused widespread disruption to travel services, including damage to rail services in the west<br />
country, and has impacted on local business and tourism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mein-kemph1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994913" alt="mein-kemph1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mein-kemph1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>Two rare early editions of &#8220;Mein Kampf,&#8221; signed by Adolf Hitler could sell for more than USD 20,000 at an online auction, officials say.</p>
<p>Nate Sanders, owner of Nate D Sanders Auctions in Los Angeles, says he knows he will catch a lot of flack for putting rare 1925 and 1926 editions of the racist screed up for bid. &#8220;But it is a piece of history. It is a very rare item,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Hitler was arrested and jailed for the attempt to seize power. He dictated &#8220;Mein Kampf,&#8221; two volumes of autobiography and anti-Semitic manifesto, to Rudolf Hess while behind bars to raise money for his criminal defence.</p>
<p>Both volumes&#8217; fly-leaves feature Hitler&#8217;s signature. Sanders said volumes of &#8220;Mein Kampf&#8221; from the 1930s are common, but a copy signed by the author is rare. Sanders is also auctioning off a leather trench coat he said was worn by Albert Speer, a Nazi government minister who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the Nazi regime.</p>
<p>Selling Nazi memorabilia is prohibited in many European countries that saw the horrors of World War II.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994909&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least five persons were killed and 35 others injured when a fire engulfed a moving bus in southwest China today.</p>
<p>The fire broke out at 1 pm (local time) when the bus was passing by a primary school at Guiyang City of Guizhou Province, provincial information department said. The number of injured has risen to 35 from 30, it said. The injured were admitted to four different hospitals, state news agency Xinhua reported.</p>
<p>The driver of the bus said there were about 50 people on board the bus when the fire broke out. &#8220;I opened the door at once out of instinct, so that people could get off as soon as possible,&#8221; he said. Pictures posted on China&#8217;s Twitter-like microblogging site Sina Weibo showed the bus was engulfed in flames with thick black smoke surging toward the sky.</p>
<p>The information department said since January last year all 1,850 buses operating in the province had started using liquefied natural gas instead of gasoline for green purposes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994894&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p lang="en-US"> Morsi and 35 others are on trial on charges of conspiring with foreign groups, including the Palestinian militant organization Hamas, to undermine Egypt&#8217;s national security.</p>
<p lang="en-US"> The Cairo Criminal Court on Thursday decided to suspend the trial on Thursday as the defendants&#8217; lawyers demanded that the panel be changed. No date was set for the trial to start.</p>
<p lang="en-US"> Morsi was ousted by the military after just one year in power following protests by millions of Egyptians demanding that he resign. He faces a multitude of trials on a wide range of charges, some of which carry the death penalty.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994867&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amid concerns in India over enforcement of Nitaqat law following which 1.41 lakh Indians left Saudi Arabia, the Gulf nation on Thursday said the legislation was aimed at punishing illegal expatriates and no legal employee will face any hardship. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Deputy Minister of Foreign Information, Abdulaziz Binsalamah said Nitaqat has been implemented to ensure that millions of foreign workers, including Indians who have valid documents can enjoy their entitlements. </p>
<p>The Nitaqat law makes it mandatory for local companies to hire one Saudi national for every 10 migrant workers. There has been widespread perception that the policy would lead to denial of job opportunities for a large number of Indians working there. </p>
<p>Allaying apprehensions in India over the law, he assured that no legal worker will be harassed and Saudi government will do everything possible to protect their rights. </p>
<p>&#8220;The legislation has been brought to benefit millions of expatriates. In fact, the legal citizens are now relieved,&#8221; Binsalamah, who is part of the delegation accompanying Crown Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, told reporters during an interaction. </p>
<p>As per government estimate, around 1.41 lakh Indians left Saudi Arabia between April 6 and November 3, 2013, following the enforcement of Nitaqat law. </p>
<p>Binsalamah said Saudi Arabia decided to implement the law to come down hard on illegal immigration rackets and smuggling of drugs and arms into the country. </p>
<p>Indians form the largest expatriate community in Saudi Arabia and their contribution in the progress and development of there is well recognised. There are over 2.88 million Indian nationals currently working in Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>During the interaction with media, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Minister of Culture and Information Abdulaziz bin Mohieddin spoke about various aspects of the ties between the two countries and said the landmark visit of King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in January 2006 was a &#8220;turning point&#8221; in the relationship. </p>
<p>He also referred to the King then terming India as his &#8220;second home&#8221; and said Saudi Arabia would like to expand ties with India in diverse sectors. </p>
<p>In his speech, read out before a group of media persons from both the countries, the Minister mentioned about the visit by King Saud of Saudi Arabia to India in November 1955. </p>
<p>He also recalled the visit of first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to Saudi Arabia in 1956 during which he had delivered a speech at a football stadium. </p>
<p>&#8220;This was a privilege which was not given to any other foreign leader,&#8221; he said.</p>

(AP)
<p>Thousands of pilgrims from Nepal, India and South Asian countries on Thursday thronged the historic Pashupatinath temple here to offer prayers on Maha Shivratri.</p>
<p>Over 4,000 saints and 150 &#8216;Naga sadhus&#8217; arrived at the fifth-century temple to offer prayers.</p>
<p>President Ram Baran Yadav and Vice President Parmananda Jha also visited the temple for the festival. The temple was opened to the people at 3:30 am.</p>
<p>Situated on the banks of river Bagmati, the temple sparkled with colourful flags, lights and flowers.</p>
<p>About 3,000 security personnel, hundreds in plainclothes, and over 5,000 volunteers were deployed as part of tight security arrangements at the temple complex.</p>
<p>It is expected that 700,000 people, including 150,000 devotees from India, will visit the temple during the festival dedicated to Lord Shiva.</p>
<p>Pashupati Area Development Trust, one of the organisers, has arranged four courtyards — Swargadwari, Bairagi Akhada, Annapurna Bhandar and Nanak Math — at the complex to house the devotees.</p>
<p>Special arrangements have been made to ease the entry of devotees into the temple, said Trust chief Govinda Tandon. Entry tickets have been priced at Nepali Rs 1,000 (Indian Rs 625).</p>
<p>Several Indian artistes have been invited to perform devotional songs during the festivities.</p>
<p>A special prayer was also organised at the tallest Shiva statue in the world, situated in Kavrepalanhowk district, 22 km east of Kathmandu.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994803&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indonesian province at the heart of a Southeast Asian smog crisis last year has declared a state of emergency after being blanketed in thick haze from forest fires, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Thousands have fallen ill, transport has been disrupted and schools closed after days of fires in Riau province on Sumatra island, where blazes are deliberately lit every year to clear land for palm oil and wood pulp plantations.</p>
<p>More than two dozen people suspected of starting fires in rainforest and peatland have so far been arrested, said national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.</p>
<p>Haze from fires on Sumatra is an annual problem in Southeast Asia, but last June Singapore and Malaysia were cloaked in the worst smog for more than a decade.</p>
<p>While some haze was detected in the two neighbouring countries in recent days, the air quality was mostly good.</p>
<p>Declaring an emergency allows Riau to seek help in tackling the blazes from the central government, and Nugroho said aircraft were preparing to drop water on fires and carry out &#8220;cloud-seeding&#8221; to chemically induce rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;The disaster agency is preparing aeroplanes and helicopters to carry out water-bombing of the fires,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>More than 25,000 people have fallen ill in recent days due to high air pollution, with most suffering respiratory tract infections, said Riau disaster chief Said Saqlul Amri. The emergency status means health centres must see patients free of charge, he said.</p>
<p>Local media reported that some flights to Riau had been cancelled this week while others were diverted, and schools were closed in some parts of the province.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s fires strained ties between Indonesia and its neighbours, prompting an apology from Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to Malaysia and Singapore at the height of the crisis.</p>
<p>Indonesia is the world&#8217;s biggest producer of palm oil &#8211; which is found in everyday grocery items, such as shampoo and shaving gel &#8211; and Riau is the country&#8217;s main palm oil hub.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994705&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/us-exhibition-medium.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994658 alignnone" alt="us-exhibition-medium" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/us-exhibition-medium.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>A first-of-its-kind exhibition exploring the heritage, daily experience, diverse contributions that Indian immigrants and Indian Americans have made to shaping the US was  opened at Washington to the public.</p>
<p>The exhibition &#8211; Beyond Bollywood: Indian Americans Shape the Nation by the Smithsonian Institute &#8211; showing at the National Museum of Natural History from Thursday celebrates the history and achievements of the Indian-American community&#8217;s political, professional, and cultural contributions to the US.</p>
<p>&#8221;Indian-Americans have become integral to the fabric of American life, and I&#8217;m so glad that the Smithsonian is recognizing this remarkable community&#8217;s contributions to our country,&#8221; Congressman Ami Bera said.</p>
<p>Bera, the only Indian-American Congressman in the current Congress, presented the Smithsonian with a framed entry into the Congressional record recognizing them for their support of the Indian-American community.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a first-generation Indian-American born and raised in California, I am here today largely because of the Indian Americans of my parent&#8217;s generation who paved the way with their dedication to hard work, education and family,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The new exhibit examines the daily experiences of Indian Americans, and highlights the impacts they have had on the nation, from breakthroughs in medicine and technology to the election of Dalip Singh Saund, the first Asian-American member of Congress elected in 1956.</p>
<p>Highlighted artifacts include a dress worn by First Lady Michelle Obama designed by Indian-American Naeem Khan, the 1985 National Spelling Bee trophy awarded to the first Indian-American winner Balu Natarajan and Mohini Bhardwaj&#8217;s 2004 Olympic Silver Medal for gymnastics.</p>
<p>&#8216;Beyond Bollywood&#8217; is the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center&#8217;s largest exhibition and will be on display for at least one year.It will then travel around the country to libraries,museums, universities and community centers as a part of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service beginning May 2015 for up to five years.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994614&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>The United States on Wednesday expressed concern with increased violence in Thailand and called for restraint by all sides in a conflict that shows no immediate sign of ending.</p>
<p>Thailand has been dogged by nearly four months of around-the-clock violence between supporters of Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and protesters who want her out. While the crisis is a long way from the running battles of April and May 2010 when more than 90 people were killed, it has stoked uncertainty and spooked investors.</p>
<p>A bomb blast in a busy shopping district killed two children and a woman, and wounded at least 22 people near an anti-government protest site on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Violence is not an acceptable means of resolving political differences,&#8221; State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told a daily briefing condemning Sunday&#8217;s blast and calling it &#8220;inexcusable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We reiterate our call for all sides to exercise restraint and urge Thai authorities to investigate thoroughly and transparently all recent acts of violence,&#8221; Psaki added.</p>
<p>She said the United States was watching events closely. A State Department official said U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Kristie Kenney was actively engaged in efforts to encourage a peaceful and democratic resolution to the tensions.</p>
<p>Anti-government protests have blocked main Bangkok intersections for weeks with tents, tyres and sandbags calling for the resignation of Yingluck and decrying the influence of her billionaire brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, an ousted former premier regarded by many as the real power behind the government.</p>
<p>The European and UN also condemned the violence on Wednesday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994367&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patients in South Sudan have been shot to death in their hospital beds and medical facilities have been looted and burned to the ground, forcing the aid group Doctors Without Borders to examine its operations.</p>
<p>The extreme violence and lack of respect for health care workers shown by South Sudan&#8217;s warring sides has made Doctors Without Borders&#8217; work almost impossible, the international group said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>Members of the aid group discovered at least 14 dead bodies in a hospital in the contested city of Malakal over the weekend, said the statement. Several of the dead bodies had been shot while lying in their beds, the group said. Rebels have been fighting government forces for control of the city, the capital of an oil-producing state.</p>
<p>In addition, Doctors Without Borders&#8217; facilities in the towns of Leer and Bentiu have been looted and completely destroyed, said the group&#8217;s leader in South Sudan Raphael Gorgeu. He said Doctors Without Borders does not want to leave South Sudan but must look at the safety of its workers.</p>
<p>The men carrying out the fighting have shown &#8220;absolutely no respect for health care workers,&#8221; he said. He asked how the group could &#8220;stay to the very last moment with the guarantee that our staff and patients will not be targeted?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gorgeu said the group does not want to pull out of South Sudan, where 800,000 people are displaced and 3.2 million in immediate need of food due to fighting that broke out in mid-December. Thousands have died in the violence.</p>
<p>At the end of January thousands of residents fled as fighting broke out in Leer, the home town of rebel leader and former Vice President Riek Machar. Doctors Without Borders has worked in Leer for 25 years, evacuated staff while 240 others fled into the bush. They returned this week to find their hospital — a facility that served 300,000 people — destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to leave South Sudan, definitely not, but we have to look at things very carefully now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is not the investment we put in but the trust and the respect we put in that is actually put into question.&#8221;</p>
<p>The situation in South Sudan is to be discussed at a hearing by a U.S. House of Representatives committee later Wednesday. Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey said the hearing would examine the need for a more unified and proactive U.S. policy in the region.</p>
<p>John Prendergast, co-founder of the U.S. advocacy group the Enough Project, said a &#8220;nightmare&#8221; scenario is unfolding in the Sudan-South Sudan region.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the escalating crisis being faced by the two countries and the threat posed by a regionalization of the wars, a much more robust and proactive approach is needed,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994362&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/if-medium.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994360" alt="The report entitled &quot;Trigger-happy: Israel's use of excessive force in the West Bank&quot; documents the killing of 45 Palestinians and wounding of thousands. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/if-medium.jpg" /></a> The report entitled &#8220;Trigger-happy: Israel&#8217;s use of excessive force in the West Bank&#8221; documents the killing of 45 Palestinians and wounding of thousands. (Reuters)
<p>Israel has killed dozens of Palestinian civilians in the West Bank over the past three years showing a &#8220;callous disregard for human life,&#8221; a report by Amnesty International said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Israel responded by saying the London-based rights group did not take into account the increasing number of attacks on its forces in the past year or seek comment until the eve of publication.</p>
<p>The report entitled &#8220;Trigger-happy: Israel&#8217;s use of excessive force in the West Bank&#8221; documents the killing of 45 Palestinians and wounding of thousands &#8220;who did not appear to be posing a direct and immediate threat to life.&#8221;It &#8220;shows a harrowing pattern of unlawful killings and unwarranted injuries of Palestinian civilians by Israeli forces in the West Bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report accuses Israel of &#8220;war crimes and other serious violations of international law&#8221; against Palestinians.</p>
<p>Since occupying the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza in 1967, &#8220;Israeli authorities have signally failed to carry out<br />
independent investigations that meet international standards into alleged crimes,&#8221; Amnesty said.</p>
<p>The group calls on Israel &#8220;to open independent, impartial, transparent and prompt investigations into all reports of<br />
Palestinian civilians killed or seriously injured by the actions of Israeli forces.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also urges the United States, European Union and the rest of the international community to &#8220;suspend all transfers<br />
of munitions, weapons and other equipment to Israel&#8221; to pressure it to change.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said Amnesty failed to take into account &#8220;the substantial increase in Palestinian violence<br />
initiated over the past year,&#8221; which &#8220;saw a sharp increase in rock hurling incidents, gravely jeopardising the lives of<br />
civilians and military personnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;During that year alone, 132 Israelis were injured, almost double the previous year,&#8221; it added. &#8220;Over 5,000 incidents of<br />
rock hurling took place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2013 there were 66 further terror attacks which included shootings, the planting of IEDs (improvised explosive<br />
devices)&#8230; and the abduction and murder of a soldier.&#8221;Foreign ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Amnesty<br />
authored its report &#8220;without even bothering to ask for response and comment,&#8221; until the eve of publication.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their trick is to disable our capacity to respond,&#8221; he said in an email. &#8220;And that&#8217;s what this move is about:<br />
not to get responses, but to deprive Israel of its capacity toeven take part in the conversation.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994356&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/uk-med2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994317" alt=" The national currency, the hryvnia, a barometer of economic confidence, plunged to near a 2008 low of 10 cents." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/uk-med2.jpg" /></a> The national currency, the hryvnia, a barometer of economic confidence, plunged to near a 2008 low of 10 cents.
<p>President Vladimir V Putin ordered a surprise military exercise of ground forces on Ukraine’s doorstep Wednesday, intending to demonstrate his country’s military preparedness amid tensions with Europe and the United States over the turmoil gripping Russia’s western neighbour.</p>
<p>Putin’s order applied to forces in western Russia and air forces across the country, and a separate order issued by Defense Minister Sergei K Shoigu included unspecified measures to ensure the security of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet in southern Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula, a region that was a part of Russia until 1954 and is still heavily populated by ethnic Russians.</p>
<p>The Russian muscle flexing came as thousands of ethnic Russians demonstrated in Crimea’s regional capital of Simferopol, protesting the political upheavals in Kiev that felled the pro-Moscow government of President Viktor F Yanukovych over the weekend and turned him into a fugitive. “Crimea is Russian!” some screamed, as brawls erupted with rival demonstrators from Crimea’s ethnic Tatar population who support Kiev’s new interim authorities created by the Parliament.</p>
<p>Facing increased signs of an impending economic default in the former Soviet republic of 46 million, those interim authorities hastened on Wednesday to accelerate the formation of a new government that could reach agreements for more cash and loans.  The national currency, the hryvnia, a barometer of economic confidence, plunged to near a 2008 low of 10 cents.</p>
<p>The Russian military put scores of units on alert at 2 pm local time for an exercise that was scheduled to last until March 3, Shoigu announced, according to news agencies.  Shoigu’s statement cited the need to test the readiness of the armed forces to respond to a “crisis situation,” including that of a terrorist attack involving biological or chemical weapons. Neither Shoigu nor the Kremlin mentioned the events in Ukraine, which officials here have watched with growing alarm, but the geopolitical message of the snap drill was  unmistakable.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994313&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>President Vladimir Putin has reportedly ordered an immediate test of combat readiness of troops in central and western Russia.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s state news agencies are quoting Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu as saying that Putin ordered the test at 2 pm Moscow time on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The report did not mention Ukraine, one of Russia&#8217;s western neighbours, where months of protests have forced a pro-Russia president to go into hiding.</p>
<p>The Kremlin was unable to confirm the order. The defense ministry was unavailable for comment.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993963&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/obamam.jpg" /></a> Obama conveyed the terse message to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who has refused to sign a Bilateral Security Agreement with the US. (AP)
<p>President Barack Obama has threatened to pull all US troops out of war-ravaged Afghanistan by the year end if a crucial bilateral security agreement is not signed.</p>
<p>Obama conveyed the terse message to Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who has refused to sign a Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA) with the US that would allow presence of US troops in Afghanistan post-2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard to the Bilateral Security Agreement (BSA), in advance of the NATO Defence Ministerial, President Obama told President Karzai that because he has demonstrated that it is unlikely that he will sign the BSA, the US is moving forward with additional contingency planning,&#8221; the White House said in a statement after Obama spoke with Karzai over phone on Tuesday.</p>
<p>During the call, Obama said he has asked the Pentagon to ensure that it has &#8220;adequate plans in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the US not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014&#8243;.</p>
<p>However, the US has held out the possibility of leaving behind in Afghanistan as many as 8,000 troops after the formal drawdown at year&#8217;s end. These troops would conduct counter-terrorism operations against al Qaeda targets and train Afghan forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time, should we have a BSA and a willing and committed partner in the Afghan government, a limited post-2014 mission focused on training, advising, and assisting Afghan forces and going after the remnants of core Al-Qaeda could be in the interests of the US and Afghanistan,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, we will leave open the possibility of concluding a BSA with Afghanistan later this year. However, the longer we go without a BSA, the more challenging it will be to plan and execute any US mission. Furthermore, the longer we go without a BSA, the more likely it will be that any post-2014 US mission will be smaller in scale and ambition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The US has had troops in Afghanistan since 2001 following the 9/11 terror attacks.</p>
<p>Besides, Obama welcomed the beginning of Afghanistan&#8217;s Presidential campaign season and affirmed the US&#8217; support for a fair, credible, timely and Afghan-led process.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993902&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/popem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993899" alt="Benedict, however, had made clear from the start of his papacy that it might not end in his death.  (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/popem.jpg" /></a> Benedict, however, had made clear from the start of his papacy that it might not end in his death. (Reuters)
<p>Retired Pope Benedict XVI has denied speculation that he was pressured to leave office, saying his decision was freely made and his alone.</p>
<p>Benedict wrote to the Vatican correspondent for La Stampa newspaper, Andrea Tornielli, amid a new round of speculation about his reasons ahead of Friday&#8217;s first anniversary of the first resignation by a pope in 600 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t the slightest doubt about the validity of my resignation from the Petrine ministry,&#8221; La Stampa quoted Benedict as writing. &#8220;The only condition for the validity is the full freedom of the decision. Speculation about its invalidity is simply absurd.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benedict, 86, also defended his decision to continue wearing the white cassock of the papacy, saying that there were no other clothes available.</p>
<p>Media are again speculating about what drove Benedict from office. Italian journalist Antonio Socci suggested last week in the conservative daily Libero that the resignation may have been invalid, claiming Benedict was pressured by a group of cardinals opposed to him.</p>
<p>Benedict, however, had made clear from the start of his papacy that it might not end in his death. In the 2010 book &#8220;Light of the World,&#8221; Benedict wrote: &#8220;If a pope clearly realises that he is no longer physically, psychologically and spiritually capable of handling the duties of his office, then he has a right, and under some circumstances, also an obligation to resign.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benedict made a surprise cameo at this weekend&#8217;s ceremony to formally install 19 new cardinals. It was the first time he and Pope Francis had appeared together at a public liturgical ceremony and immediately raised questions about whether Benedict might occasionally be reintegrated back into the life of the church.</p>
<p>British Cardinal Vincent Nichols, one of the new cardinals, said Benedict&#8217;s presence didn&#8217;t represent a change.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says his vocation now is to pray for the church and to live that life of prayerful seclusion, and he would appear to be very peaceful doing that,&#8221; Nichols told reporters.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993894&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The minority Hindu community in Pakistan is struggling to protect its temples and the land around them from the land mafia, a media report said on Wednesday. Most of the Hindu inhabitants migrated to India at the time of partition, leaving behind a number of properties and places of worship.</p>
<p>&#8220;These properties have been up for grabs. Some allege that locals forged documents in order to occupy land around temples and construct markets. These temples are located in areas where the value of land is very high. This acts as a magnet for the land mafia,&#8221; the Express Tribune daily reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;No temple here exists that has been spared by land grabbers,&#8221;  claims Amarnath, a resident of Kirtarpura. The helpless community can do nothing to protect the dilapidated and plundered buildings, the report said.  For around 5,000 Hindus living in Rawalpindi, Krishna Mandir is the only place of worship left.</p>
<p>The temple is built on a small plot which is not enough to accommodate the community members during religious ceremonies. &#8220;But the fact that this temple remains is also nothing short of an achievement. There was a time when its future was also bleak and even today&#8217;s there are challenges to its daily existence,&#8221; the daily said.</p>
<p>The community members believe that the land mafia attacked temples around which Muslim families were living so that the families would vacate the land and the land grabbers could take over, considering the commercial value. Some local politicians led mobs and attacked temples, the report said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a perception that the Hindus (who migrated) had buried their wealth in these temples. Temples on the outskirts of the city were dug but when they found nothing, they destroyed the statues and defaced the statues,&#8221; a community member said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993874&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The INOC has complained to the Indian government about the functioning of the visa processing service provider at its diplomatic missions in the US and sought immediate intervention of External Affairs Minister in resolving the issue. An Indian National Overseas Congress (INOC) delegation recently met Ministers of State for External Affairs E Ahamed and Preneet Kaur in New Delhi to submit a memorandum.</p>
<p>In a statement, the INOC alleged that the Indian community and other travellers in the US, particularly in New York, are facing tremendous hardship due to the grossly inefficient and deplorable service relating to issuance and renewal of passports and visas for travel to India. &#8220;Unfortunately, the atmosphere has deteriorated so badly that travellers often cannot travel on due dates of travel, due to documents being lost or misplaced and most of the time no timely response is received from them,&#8221; the INOC-US said in its memorandum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chronic delays are the order of the day and the whole operation is so disorganised and in disarray that only some people seem to receive satisfactory services. There are widespread rumours that no work gets done unless a bribe is paid. In a situation like this, you can appreciate that there is no need to wait until a scandal breaks out,&#8221; the memorandum alleged.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been candid to the ministers of the damage the agency has done to the reputation and credibility of India,&#8221; said George Abraham, chairman of the INOC US.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993857&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an unusual move, the Japanese police has recruited a &#8216;Robocop&#8217; on public trains to protect women commuters from perverts. The Osaka Police Department has enlisted a robot to stop the perverts threatening women. &#8220;Robocop is a hammer of justice to molesters threatening women,&#8221; the police said on its official site.</p>
<p>Japanese police collaborated with West Japan Railway Company and developed the Robocop &#8211; a man posing as a cyborg crime-fighter. Interestingly, the Robocop has the right to arrest citizens who are found breaking the laws. The robot is also assigned the duty of warning travellers not to leave their belongings and luggage in the train carriages, the Mirror reported.</p>
<p>In addition, it will caution drivers not to leave possessions on view in cars.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993834&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>Two more Indian nationals in Singapore were jailed on Wednesday for 18 weeks each for their role in the country&#8217;s worst riot in 40 years in Decmeber last year. Thangaiya Selvakumar, 25, and Thiagarajan Sribalamurugan, 23, had originally faced rioting charges, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years in jail and caning, The Straits Times reported.</p>
<p>But they were sentenced under amended charge for disobeying dispersal commands, an offence which carries up to two years in jail and/or fine. Their sentences would be backdated to the date of their arrests on December 8, 2013, the night when some 400 migrant workers from South Asia rioted following a fatal accident involving an Indian national. The two are the fourth and fifth men to plead guilty under an amended charge out of the 25 who were originally charged for rioting.</p>
<p>Three others have been sentenced to serve between 15 and 18 weeks in jail under the amended charge. Twenty others were now facing the rioting charge. The riot in Singapore&#8217;s Little India precinct of Indian origin businesses left 49 police and Home Team officers injured. The rioters also damaged more than SGD 650,000 worth of properties including 23 emergency cars, five of which were set on fire.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993827&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/greenpeace-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993816" alt="Greenpeace is opposing Procter &amp; Gamble's move to cut forests in Indonesia. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/greenpeace-480.jpg" /></a> Greenpeace is opposing Procter &amp; Gamble&#8217;s move to cut forests in Indonesia for palm oil. (Reuters)
<p>Environmental group Greenpeace on Wednesday accused US consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble for the destruction of Indonesian rain forests and the habitat of endangered orangutans and tigers. In an extensive new report, Greenpeace said the company was using Indonesian palm oil from suppliers with links to the destruction of ancient rain-forest, haze-inducing forest fires and an orangutan &#8220;graveyard&#8221;.</p>
<p>The company uses Indonesian palm oil in its popular household products, including Head &amp; Shoulders and Pantene shampoos and Gillette shaving gel. &#8220;The maker of Head &amp; Shoulders needs to stop bringing rain-forest destruction into our showers. It must clean up its act and guarantee its customers that these products are forest-friendly,&#8221; said Greenpeace&#8217;s Indonesian forest campaign head Bustar Maitar.</p>
<p>Procter &amp; Gamble were not immediately available for comment. The company&#8217;s website says it is &#8220;committed to growing our business responsibly&#8221; and  has introduced sustainability scorecards for suppliers. P&amp;G is the latest company to be targeted by Greenpeace as the campaign group seeks to embarrass major firms it accuses of sourcing Indonesian palm oil and paper from suppliers that cause environmental destruction.</p>
<p>An AFP photographer accompanied by Greenpeace saw rampant forest destruction in the concessions of the company&#8217;s suppliers on the Indonesian part of Borneo island. Borneo, which is shared between Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei, has lost half its trees to logging and mining in recent decades but still has vast tracts of untouched forest.</p>
<p>The report urged P&amp;G to join other leading companies which have committed to implementing a no-deforestation policy. Greenpeace&#8217;s campaigns have caused several global companies, including Unilever, Nestle and L&#8217;Oreal, to commit to zero deforestation, though some plan to implement their policies in coming years. Many palm oil and paper companies, such as Asia Pulp &amp; Paper, have made such commitments after losing major clients because of Greenpeace&#8217;s campaigns.</p>
<p>In its report, Greenpeace linked a Malaysian palm oil supplier to Procter &amp; Gamble with forest fires on Indonesia&#8217;s island of Sumatra in June last year. The blazes cloaked Singapore and Malaysia with a choking haze in the region&#8217;s worst pollution for a decade. The report also accused the same supplier of destroying deep Portland forests, which are dense in carbon stocks, have some of the world&#8217;s most bio diverse ecosystems, and are prime habitat for critically endangered Sumatran orangutans and tigers.</p>
<p>The report said that on the island of Borneo a &#8220;graveyard&#8221; of orangutans, including a buried skull, had been found in November partly within the concession area of a supplier to Procter &amp; Gamble.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993812&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/uganda-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993806" alt="Gays in Uganda far a possible backlash after a newspaper published a list of top gays. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/uganda-480.jpg" /></a> Gays in Uganda far a possible backlash after a newspaper published a list of top gays. (AP)
<p>A Ugandan newspaper published a list Tuesday of what it called the country&#8217;s &#8220;200 top&#8221; gays, outing some Ugandans and raising fears of violence against those named just a day after the president enacted a severe anti-gay law.</p>
<p>Many on the list &#8220;are scared and they need help,&#8221; said Pepe Julian Onziema, a prominent Ugandan gay activist who was named in in the Red Pepper tabloid. &#8220;Some want to leave the country and they are asking to be helped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday&#8217;s signing of the bill by President Yoweri Museveni marked &#8220;a tragic day for Uganda and for all who care about the cause of human rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>He warned that Washington could cut aid to the East African nation over the new law, which punishes gay sex with up to life in prison.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are beginning an internal review of our relationship with the government of Uganda to ensure that all dimensions of our engagement, including assistance programs, uphold our anti-discrimination policies and principles and reflect our values,&#8221; Kerry said in a statement.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon demanded the revision or repeal of the law, warning on Tuesday that it could fuel prejudice and harassment against gays.</p>
<p>The Red Pepper ran its list of names — and some pictures — in a front-page story under the headline &#8220;EXPOSED!&#8221;</p>
<p>News editor Ben Byarabaha said the paper published the full names of only the well-known activists and tried to use nicknames for those not publicly gay. A popular Ugandan hip-hop star and a Catholic priest are among those on the list.</p>
<p>Byarabaha offered no details on how the names were compiled.</p>
<p>Onziema, who has repeatedly warned that Uganda&#8217;s new law could spark violence against gays, said the tabloid had provided enough information to identify many people who had not come out publicly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the employers have read the paper, and from the descriptions they can tell who these people are,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Few Ugandans identify themselves publicly as gay, and the tabloid&#8217;s actions recalled a similar list published in 2011 by a now-defunct tabloid that called for the execution of gays. A prominent Ugandan gay activist, David Kato, was killed after that list came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;The media witch hunt is back,&#8221; tweeted Jacqueline Kasha, a well-known Ugandan lesbian activist who is among those listed in the Red Pepper story.</p>
<p>Uganda&#8217;s new anti-gay law also creates the offenses of &#8220;conspiracy to commit homosexuality&#8221; and &#8220;aiding and abetting homosexuality,&#8221; both of which are punishable by seven years behind bars. Those convicted of &#8220;promoting homosexuality&#8221; face similar punishment.</p>
<p>In signing the bill, Museveni said the measure is needed because the West is promoting homosexuality in Africa, and he rejected international criticism of the law as interference in Uganda&#8217;s internal affairs.</p>
<p>Ugandan police spokesman Patrick Onyango said Tuesday that no gays have been arrested since Museveni signed the bill but that at least two had been taken into custody since lawmakers passed the measure in December.</p>
<p>Onziema said that he had counted up to six arrests and that more than a dozen gay Ugandans had fled the country since December.</p>
<p>Homosexuality has long been criminalized in Uganda under a colonial-era law that outlawed sex acts &#8220;against the order of nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some Ugandan lawyers and activists have said they will challenge the new law as unconstitutional and impossible to implement.</p>
<p>The Ugandan law came just over a month after Nigeria passed a similar measure.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993804&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A 13-year-old boy in UK hanged himself after he was upset over mistakenly buying computer games worth hundreds of pounds. Henry Tattersall was told he would not get any Christmas presents when he mistakenly downloaded Xbox games worth 420 pounds last November, an inquest was told.</p>
<p>Minutes before hanging himself, the boy spoke to his girlfriend on Facebook and said: &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill myself.&#8221; His mother, Eve, from Newchurch, Lancashire, told the inquest her son was &#8220;genuinely stunned&#8221; by the amount of money he had spent. He even suggested that his mother take the money out of his savings account.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was very upset that I was upset,&#8221; she was quoted as saying by &#8216;metro.co.uk&#8217;. Coroner Richard Taylor, sitting in Burnley, said Henry&#8217;s death was the &#8220;unexpected conclusion of an intended action,&#8221; with a verdict of death by misadventure recorded.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993742&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/boko-haram.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993706" alt="Islamic militants kill more dozens of students in Nigeria.

<p>Islamic militants set fire to a locked dormitory at a school in northern Nigeria, then shot and slit the throats of students who tried to escape through windows during a pre-dawn attack Tuesday. At least 58 students were killed, including many who were burned alive. They &#8220;slaughtered them like sheep&#8221; with machetes, and gunned down those who ran away, said one teacher, Adamu Garba.</p>
<p>Soldiers guarding a checkpoint near the co-ed government school were mysteriously withdrawn hours before it was targeted by the militants, said the spokesman for the governor of northeastern Yobe state. Female students were spared in the attack, said the spokesman, Abdullahi Bego, though girls and women have been abducted in the past by militants of the Boko Haram movement, whose name means &#8220;Western education is forbidden.&#8221;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/boko-1-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993735" alt="This phows the remains of the burned out Federal Government College in Buni Yadi, Nigeria.

<p>This time, the insurgents went to the female dormitories and told the young women to go home, get married and abandon the Western education they said is anathema to Islam, Bego said. All of the dead were teenage boys or young men. The militants, whose struggle for an Islamic state has killed thousands and made them the biggest threat to security in Africa&#8217;s top oil producer, have increasingly preyed on civilians, both Muslim and Christian. Some 300 people have died in attacks this month alone.</p>
<p>Local officials buried the bodies of 29 victims and another 29 were taken to Damaturu Specialist Hospital, according to the hospital records and an Associated Press reporter who went to the mortuary. Most of the victims appeared to be between 15 and 20 years old, Bego said. Eleven wounded survivors of the attack were being treated at the hospital.</p>

<p>Touring the smoldering ruins Tuesday at the Federal Government College of Buni Yadi, Gov. Ibrahim Gaidam decried the federal government&#8217;s failure to protect the population. &#8220;It is unfortunate that our children in schools are dying from lack of adequate protection from the federal government,&#8221; Gaidam told reporters. He called on President Goodluck Jonathan to deploy more troops to the region.</p>
<p>Jonathan, who rarely comments on individual attacks, said in a statement that he felt &#8220;immense sadness and anguish&#8221; by the loss of life at the school, and vowed that the military would &#8220;continue to prosecute the war against terror with full vigour, diligence and determination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garba said the militants locked the door of a dormitory where male students were sleeping, then set it on fire. Some students were burned alive in the attack that began around 2 a.m., he said. The governor said it took hours for troops to arrive, giving the assailants plenty of time to set the rest of the school campus ablaze— six dormitories, the administrative building, staff quarters, classrooms, a clinic and the kitchen.</p>

<p>Bego, the governor&#8217;s spokesman, said the governor will be looking into why the school was left unprotected. &#8220;The community complained to the governor that yesterday the military were withdrawn and then the attack happened,&#8221; he said. Soldiers from Damaturu, the state capital located some 45 miles (70 kilometers) away, did not arrive until noon, hours after the attackers had taken off, according to community leaders.</p>
<p>Military spokesman Eli Lazarus confirmed the attack, but could not give an exact death toll because soldiers were still gathering corpses. He had no immediate comment on the charge that soldiers withdrew before the attack. Nigeria&#8217;s military has reported arresting several soldiers accused of aiding and passing information to Boko Haram extremists; a senator has also been accused of similar charges.</p>

<p>On Monday, Jonathan dismissed suggestions the military was losing the war to halt the 4-year-old Islamic uprising in the northeast. Tens of thousands of Nigerians have lost family members, houses, businesses, their belongings and livelihoods to the rebellion and the fallout from a military state of emergency by soldiers accused of gross human rights violations, including setting ablaze entire villages and summary executions of suspects.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s attack is only the latest in a string of deadly assaults by Islamic militants. Entire towns and villages were under the sway of Boko Haram when Jonathan declared a state of emergency in May. The military quickly forced the insurgents out of urban areas, only to have them regroup in forests and mountain caves where it has proved difficult to flush them out.</p>
<p>The military said recent attacks are being perpetrated by militants escaping a sustained aerial bombardment and ground assaults on their forest hideouts along the border with Cameroon, an offensive begun after Jonathan fired and replaced his entire military command last month. On Saturday, the military announced it had closed hundreds of miles of the border with Cameroon to prevent militants using it as a launch pad for attacks.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday condemned the &#8220;unspeakable violence and acts of terror&#8221; and said the United States was helping Nigerian authorities &#8220;to combat the threat posed by Boko Haram, while protecting civilians and ensuring respect for human rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>But survivors and local officials charge they get no protection. &#8220;Everybody is living in fear,&#8221; local government chairman Maina Ularamu told the AP after Izghe village was attacked twice in a week this month — with militants killing 109 people and burning hundreds of thatched huts in neighboring Adamawa state.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no protection. We cannot predict where and when they are going to attack. People can&#8217;t sleep with their eyes closed,&#8221; Ularamu said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993694&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gay-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993707" alt="Russian newlyweds Alexander Emereev, left, and Dmitry Zaytsev pose with their marriage book in Buenos Aires, Argentina. (AP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gay-m.jpg" /></a> Russian newlyweds Alexander Emereev and Dmitry Zaytsev pose with their marriage book in Buenos Aires, Argentina. (AP)
<p>Two Russian homosexuals married Tuesday in Argentina and said they would seek asylum from the violence they fear back home in the Olympic city of Sochi, joining a growing number of other gays seeking marriage and refuge abroad.</p>
<p>Alexander Eremeev and Dmitry Zaytsev were wedded before a judge at a civil registry in Buenos Aires, where they were helped by rights activists who want Argentina to become a refuge for Russians and other nationalities who fear persecution at home because of their sexual orientation.</p>
<p>They plan to make their case before Argentina&#8217;s National Commission for Refugees within the next few days, saying their new status as a married couple makes them vulnerable to police persecution and mob violence in Sochi, which just hosted the Winter Games.</p>
<p>Citing gay marriage in asylum cases is a growing trend in the United States and Europe as well, said Aaron Morris, legal director of Immigration Equality, a New York-based group that helps immigrants file such claims. The group&#8217;s Russian case load grew from about 11 a year to 28 in 2013, and 33 gay Russians already asked for its help in January alone, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of our clients come out of the closet only after they arrive here. To be eligible for asylum, an LGBT person must prove a reasonable possibility of persecution in the future. There are many factors that might carry that burden, but of course having a same-sex spouse would be very dangerous in many parts of the world, including Russia,&#8221; Morris said.</p>
<p>Eremeev, 45, and Zaytsev, 37, were bare-chested below their vests and bow ties, but wore ribbons split between the color of the rainbow and the Argentine flag and pinned on flowers in the blue, white and red of Russia&#8217;s flag. They held hands throughout the ceremony, and then enjoyed a long kiss after the judge declared them spouse and spouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;We care for each other, we know each other, we have many things in common and we want this to be a legal union,&#8221; Eremeev said nervously in Russian. The two said they suffered hostility until leaving Sochi two months ago.</p>
<p>Judge Jose Luis Badur told them such &#8220;sentiment does not depend on any law; it depends on nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other gay Russians have married and obtained political asylum in Argentina, but this is the first couple to do so publicly, said Alex Freyre, whose marriage to Jose Maria Di Bello in December 2009 was Argentina&#8217;s first gay wedding. More than 7,000 other same-sex marriages have followed.</p>
<p>Russia does not recognize gay marriages or civil unions, and openly gay and lesbian Russians say they&#8217;ve been targeted by vigilantes, even more so since President Vladimir Putin approved a law last year banning what it calls gay &#8220;propaganda&#8221; from reaching minors.</p>
<p>An EU court ruled recently that laws criminalizing homosexuality could provide grounds for political asylum. And President Barack Obama&#8217;s administration clarified how gays, lesbians and transgender people seeking asylum could cite fears of persecution due to their sexuality. That change was reinforced by the federal appellate court in San Francisco in November.</p>
<p>The U.S. government hasn&#8217;t published asylum numbers since October 2012, and doesn&#8217;t release reasons for granting asylum, even in the aggregate. But Morris said having a same-sex spouse can help justify a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a country institutionalizes homophobia in laws that make it a crime to be gay, it&#8217;s reasonable to expect an increase in asylum seekers from that country. This has been our experience in recent months for gay Russians and in recent days for gay Ugandans,&#8221; Morris said in an emailed response to Associated Press questions.</p>
<p>On Monday, Uganda made gay sex between consenting adults punishable by prison terms of 14 years to life, and on Tuesday a target list of prominent purportedly gay men, some of them still closeted, was published. At least one gay Ugandan man has already sought protection in South Africa.</p>
<p>Some gays already have fled Nigeria because of intolerance, and more are considering leaving now that legislation further criminalizing homosexuality became law in January, human rights activist Olumide Makanjuola said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s expected to take 20 days for Argentina&#8217;s refugee commission to review the Russian couple&#8217;s case.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Argentina accepts us and gives us the possibility of living legally, with documents, we would like to dedicate ourselves to our businesses,&#8221; said Eremeev, who like his spouse has worked in the tourism industry.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re even thinking of adopting a child, he said. &#8220;We want to be good people, and form our family.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993675&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A diagnostic firm founded by an Indian-American physician, will pay over USD 15 million to the federal government to resolve allegations that it falsely billed for health tests that were never performed.</p>
<p>Diagnostic Imaging Group (DIG) has agreed to pay 13.65 million dollars to the government and an additional 1.85 million dollars to New York and New Jersey to resolve the allegations.</p>
<p>The allegations were raised in three lawsuits brought by private individuals in 2009 and 2010 in federal courts under the whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act, which allows private citizens with knowledge of fraud to bring civil actions on behalf of the government and to share in any recovery.</p>
<p>The three whistleblowers would receive a total of about 2.77 million dollars under the settlement.</p>
<p>The claims settled by the agreement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.</p>
<p>DIG was founded in 1985 by Mumbai-native Leena Doshi, who came to the US in 1973 and studied radiology at a city hospital. Doshi&#8217;s husband Nitin Doshi was a dentist before joining his wife to expand the radiology practice.</p>
<p>The couple has not been charged or accused of any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the husband-wife duo has in the past been awarded with the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, which is given to immigrants for their contributions to America.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fraud committed by medical practices costs New York taxpayers millions of dollars every year. My office will find those who cheat the system, cheat New York taxpayers and cheat our most vulnerable patients,&#8221; New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to other fraud, these companies were suspected of paying kickbacks. This illegal behaviour must and will stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>The settlement resolves allegations that DIG submitted claims to federal healthcare programme Medicare, as well as the New Jersey and New York Medicaid Programmes.</p>
<p>Between 1999 to 2010, the companies submitted false billings for expensive imaging services such as ultrasounds, doppler scans, ultrasounds and pelvic x-rays.</p>
<p>Additionally, DIG allegedly bundled certain tests on its order forms so that physicians could not order other tests without ordering the additional bundled tests, which were not medically necessary.</p>
<p>In all, more than 40,000 false claims were submitted to the New York Medicaid program for the various imaging services.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993652&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Due to the protests, Thai Imports fell by 15.5 per cent in January from a year earlier, the biggest tumble since October 2009. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993503&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bangkok-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992980" alt="bangkok-main" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bangkok-main.jpg" /></a> No one was wounded in the shootings in the central commercial area of Bangkok, although five people were killed in weekend violence in the city. 
<p>Shots fired by unknown gunmen on Wednesday rattled parts of the Thai capital where anti-government protesters have set up camp for weeks, with small but occasionally deadly bombs and because of it gunfire fast becoming the new norm in the city.</p>
<p>No one was wounded in the shootings in the central commercial area of Bangkok, although five people were killed in weekend violence in the city and the eastern province of Trat, four of them young children. National security chief Paradorn Pattanathabutr said there had been no reported deaths or injuries in the incidents in the early hours on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;As for the perpetrators, we still don&#8217;t know who they are,&#8221; he told Reuters. &#8220;Recently, we have been seeing more incidents like this happening more frequently. It is noticeable that there are incidents like this every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The protesters, whose disruption of a general election in the month of February left polarised Thailand in political paralysis, aim to topple Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and erase the influence of her brother, ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra, seen by many as the real power in the country.</p>
<p>The protesters want to set up an unelected &#8220;people&#8217;s council&#8221; of the good and worthy to oversee vaguely defined political reforms before new elections are held. Occasional contact between the two sides, amid calls for putting an end to the violence, have so far led to nothing.</p>
<p>Thailand announced a slump in trade figures on Tuesday with the biggest drop in imports in more than four years in January, the political crisis extending its economic toll beyond falling tourism numbers.</p>
<p>Imports fell 15.5 per cent in January from a year earlier, the biggest tumble since October 2009. Imports of computers and parts were down 19 per cent from a year earlier, auto parts were off 31.8 per cent and consumer goods down 5.3 per cent. Exports dropped by 2 per cent.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993503&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/us-iraq-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993596" alt="Our bottom-line proposal, our position is that Iran cannot have, cannot acquire a nuclear weapon, said  White House Press Secretary Jay Carney ." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/us-iraq-med.jpg" /></a> Our bottom-line proposal, our position is that Iran cannot have, cannot acquire a nuclear weapon, said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney .
<p>The US has raised its concern with Iraq at the highest levels over media reports that it had signed a contract to buy arms from Iran, a move forbidden under a United Nations embargo.</p>
<p>&#8220;We raised our concerns about this matter at the highest levels with the government of Iraq and reiterated that any transfer or sale of arms from Iran is in direct violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions,&#8221; White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government of Iraq assured us that it would look into the matter. Today we have seen the press release issued by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense denying that any contracts for military equipment were signed with Iran,&#8221; he said adding that the US will follow up with the overnment of Iraq on that matter.</p>
<p>Carney said the joint plan of action is an interim agreement reached by the P-5 plus one that commits Iran to freeze or rollback aspects of its programme, that allows over a six month period of the negotiations towards a comprehensive solution to take place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our bottom-line proposal, our position is that Iran cannot have, cannot acquire a nuclear weapon. So the best way to achieve that for the long term is for Iran itself to give up the effort,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the President takes no options off the table. He simply believes that given the commitments Iran has made and the enforcement mechanisms and verification mechanisms in place that we need to test whether or not a comprehensive solution is possible, because obviously, achieving a nuclear-weapon-free Iran through diplomatic agreement that is verifiable and transparent is a far better outcome than alternatives,&#8221; Carney said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993501&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/singapore-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1981918" alt="Singapore police watch as protestors burn a bus in Little India. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/singapore-480.jpg" /></a> Singapore police watch as protestors burn a bus in Little India.
<p>A committee constituted to probe Singapore&#8217;s worst riot in 40 years in the Little India precinct has recommended police here to carry a &#8220;lathi&#8221; in handling violent street protesters, according to a media report on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The chairman of the state-appointed Committee of Inquiry (COI) into the December riot has recommended police here to carry a &#8216;lathi&#8217; (baton) in handling such street protesters, The Straits Times reported. &#8220;Although you have a gun, you don&#8217;t use it (and) this (lathi) might be more useful,&#8221; the Singapore daily quoted, COI Chairman G Pannir Selvam, as saying during a public hearing on Tuesday on how police initially faced the Little India riots on the night of December 8 last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you go to a riot, you should not just have a defensive weapon,&#8221; Selvam told Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Jonathan Tang, who was explaining how the riot was handled by the police officers who were first to arrive at the scene at Little India. Giving evidence during the hearing, ASP Tang said gun was not fired on the rioters for safety reasons as well as considering the bystanders. Tang said discharging firearms would have reminded the crowd that the police was armed and they (rioters) would have attacked the officers and seized the arms.</p>
<p>But among the police weapons were T-baton, which was designed to be a defencive tool and effective against close range attacks, he said. At that point, Selvam asked Tang if he knew what a &#8220;lathi&#8221; was. And to show Tang what he meant, the retired Judge handed the officer a copy of an Indian newspaper showing pictures of the &#8220;lathi&#8221; being used by the Indian police to successfully put down a recent protest march outside its Parliament.</p>
<p>According to the report, Selvam has brought up the use of &#8220;lathi&#8221; to quell riot crowds at least on three occasions since the COI public hearing began last Wednesday. Last Friday, Selvam recommended to the Deputy Commissioner of Police T Raja Kumar that the Singapore police force should procure the instruments (lathis).</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the COI heard that police was outnumbered by the riot crowd and officers at the scene had tried to contain the violence in the Little India, a precinct of Indian-origin businesses, eateries and pubs. Tang said the crowd of 200 soon swelled to some 400 with 150 to 200 throwing projectiles, shouting and instigating others.</p>
<p>The rioters injured 49 police and security officers and damaged more than 650,000 Singaporean dollars worth of properties including 23 emergency cars, five of which were set on fire.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993524&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/palne-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993191" alt="The air strikes are part of military’s new strategy to launch intelligence-based limited operations." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/palne-med.jpg" /></a> The air strikes are part of military’s new strategy to launch intelligence-based limited operations.
<p>Atleast 30 terrorists were killed Tuesday when Pakistani fighter jets carried out air strikes on militant hideouts in Shawal valley, a mountainous area in North Waziristan sharing boundary with South Waziristan, and other areas of the restive northwest tribal region.</p>
<p>The security sources said a number of terrorists’ hideouts have been completely destroyed. “Some 30 terrorists were killed in early morning air strikes on terrorists’ hideouts in Pray ghar and Razan Nala areas of Pasht Ziarat in Shawal valley on the boundary of North and South Wazirastan agencies,” a security source said.</p>
<p>He added simultaneous strikes were also carried out in Ghariom village in North Waziristan. The air strikes mainly took place in Datta Khel and Shawal areas of North Waziristan where militant training facilities and compounds are said to be located. It is said militants had captured a stretch between South and North Waziristan and had established training centers where they were also preparing suicide bombers.</p>
<p>The air strikes are part of military’s new strategy to launch intelligence-based limited operations. The continuous air strikes in various parts of the tribal areas since last week have led to feeling that a full-fledged military operation against the militants could begin soon. Thousands of people have started fleeing the region. The government was forced to suspend peace dialogue with the Taliban and go in for air strikes following the beheading of 23 Frontier Corps personnel.</p>
<p>The government has maintained it is still for solution through talks and have demanded that the Taliban announce a ceasefire. Advisor to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs and National Security Sartaj Aziz has said consultation on military operation in North Waziristan was underway. However, he has stressed that dialogue option with the Taliban has not yet been discarded.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993185&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/beijing-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993183" alt="Chinese President Xi Jinping is surrounded by onlookers in Beijing Tuesday." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/beijing-med.jpg" /></a> Chinese President Xi Jinping is surrounded by onlookers in Beijing Tuesday.
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping braved Beijing’s choking smog Tuesday, making an unannounced visit to a trendy alley and sitting with residents in his latest public relations effort to be seen as a man of the people.</p>
<p>Xi wore a black jacket and pants and was followed by a posse of similarly plainly suited Beijing city officials for his short stroll through part of a traditional alleyway popular with tourists and fashionable youth. Guan Shiyue, a 69-year-old retiree who lives in a small, sparsely furnished home on a nearby alley, said Xi visited him and sat between him and his wife on their living room sofa. Guan said he was impressed by the president.</p>
<p>“He’s a good leader of the ordinary people&#8230; I think he does things in a particularly practical way,” Guan told The Associated Press. “The leaders of this new generation are capable.” Such visits are extremely rare for top Chinese leaders, who are not known for mingling with the public other than at scheduled events. Given Xi’s status and China’s conservative political culture, his appearance was likely stage-managed to some degree beforehand.</p>
<p>Photos apparently taken by onlookers of Xi’s visit ricocheted around Chinese social media sites, triggering a flurry of comments. Some Internet users expressed support for “Uncle Xi” while others mocked the public relations effort, saying he should prioritize fixing the city’s air pollution woes over visiting residents.</p>
<p>Though Xi was unaccompanied by most state media, reports conveyed his campaign’s likely message. “Xi Jinping visits Beijing’s Nanluoguxiang amid the smog: Breathing together, sharing the fate,’’ read the headline of a Xinhua News Agency report. It was the second time Xi has made an appearance in public in Beijing. He earlier went to a traditional Beijing bun shop where he got in line, ordered and paid for a simple lunch of buns stuffed with pork and onions, green vegetables.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993172&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a breakthrough, an Indian-American scientist at the prestigious MIT has developed a simple, cheap, paper test that could improve cancer diagnosis rates and help people get treated earlier.</p>
<p>The diagnostic, which works much like a pregnancy test, could reveal within minutes, based on a urine sample, whether a person has cancer, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced on Monday. This approach has helped detect infectious diseases, and the new technology allows non-communicable diseases to be detected using the same strategy, it said.</p>
<p>The technology, developed by MIT professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator 46-year-old Sangeeta Bhatia, relies on nanoparticles that interact with tumour proteins called proteases, each of which can trigger release of hundreds of biomarkers that are then easily detectable in a patient&#8217;s urine.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we invented this new class of synthetic biomarker, we used a highly specialised instrument to do the analysis,&#8221; says Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&#8221;For the developing world, we thought it would be exciting to adapt it instead to a paper test that could be performed on unprocessed samples in a rural setting, without the need for any specialized equipment.</p>
<p>The simple readout could even be transmitted to a remote caregiver by a picture on a mobile phone,&#8221; Bhatia said in a statement. Bhatia, a memberof MIT&#8217;s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, is the senior author of a paper describing the particles in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published this week. The paper&#8217;s lead authors are graduate student Andrew Warren, postdoc Gabriel Kwong, and former postdoc David Wood.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992837&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>Another anti-government protest site in Thailand&#8217;s capital was attacked Tuesday following a weekend of violence that left four people dead, including three children, security officials said.</p>
<p>Deputy National Police spokesman Anucha Romyanan said the attack occurred early Tuesday at a protest camp near Lumpini Park in downtown Bangkok. He said shots were fired from a car and a motorcycle at protest site guards there and at another protest site near the upscale Ratchaprasong shopping area.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a grenade attack at Ratchaprasong killed a 6-year-old girl and her 4-year-old brother. A 5-year-old girl died Saturday in another attack on a rally site in the eastern province of Trat.</p>
<p>Anucha said one man was injured in the leg in the Tuesday morning shootings. He did not say if the guards, some of whom are armed, returned fire. At least 20 people have been killed and more than 700 have been hurt since November in violence related to protests demanding that Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra resign.</p>
<p>On Monday night, a grenade was fired from an M79 launcher near the headquarters of the opposition Democrat Party, which is closely allied with the militant anti-government protest movement. There were no injuries but a car was damaged.</p>
<p>The attacks, for which no one has been arrested, are the latest in a spate of protest-related violence roiling Thailand over the past three months. The protesters want Yingluck to resign to make way for an appointed interim government to implement reforms aimed at ousting her powerful family from politics, but she has refused.</p>
<p>While the protesters have failed repeatedly to force Yingluck out by their self-declared deadlines, they have blocked her from working at her normal offices and sent roving mobs after her, making it difficult for her and Cabinet colleagues to make public appearances. The protesters have succeeded in delaying the completion of an election called by Yingluck, undermining efforts to restore political stability.</p>
<p>Thailand has seen sometimes-violent political conflict since 2006, when then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Yingluck&#8217;s billionaire brother, was removed by a military coup after being accused of corruption and abuse of power. Thaksin&#8217;s supporters and opponents have since taken to the streets for extended periods in a struggle for power.</p>
<p>In 2010, pro-Thaksin &#8220;Red Shirts&#8221; occupied part of Bangkok for two months and were backed by their own armed militia. More than 90 people were killed in violent confrontations, with the army finally sweeping away the demonstrators.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992977&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Parliament speaker says that a new government should be in place by Thursday, a delay reflecting intense ongoing consultations. Oleksandr Turchinov has previously said the new government could be formed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Turchinov was named Ukraine&#8217;s interim leader after President Viktor Yanukovych fled the capital after signing a peace deal with opposition leaders to end violent clashes between police and protesters and Kiev.</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies have issued an arrest warrant for Yanukovych over the killing of 82 people, mainly protesters. Yanukovych&#8217;s whereabouts are unknown. He was last reportedly seen in the Crimea, a pro-Russia area. The parliament sacked some of Yanukovych&#8217;s lieutenants and named their replacement, but it has yet to appoint the new premier and fill all posts.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992945&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Thailand&#8217;s powerful army chief on Tuesday asked all warring parties to hold talks after last week&#8217;s violence which claimed four lives, even as a blast near the main anti-government rally site injured two persons.</p>
<p>In a rare television address on military-run Channel 5, Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha asserted that the army had no intention of playing an active role in forcing a solution to the ongoing political strife plaguing the country for the last three months with anti-government protesters calling for Yingluck Shinawatra government to quit.</p>
<p>Caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck, in a separate interview, said there was nothing better than all sides coming<br />
together.</p>
<p>&#8220;When violence is used, the pain will eventually be felt by the nation,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Yingluck, however, refused to resign as demanded by anti-government protesters, saying it would create a political<br />
vacuum.</p>
<p>When asked what she would do if there was a coup and she was held, Yingluck said she would fight and do her job till the last minute, the Nation reported.</p>
<p>With her eyes brimming with tears and her voice trembling, she said: &#8220;I am staying on to protect democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two persons were injured in an explosion near the main anti-government rally site of Lumpini Park early this morning.</p>
<p>The weekend saw two attacks as on Saturday in eastern Trat province a child was killed and over 30 injured when<br />
unidentified men threw grenades and indiscriminately fired at people.</p>
<p>The next day a grenade was lobbed close to an anti- government rally site in downtown Bangkok killing two children<br />
and a woman while injuring more than 20 people.</p>
<p>The UNICEF has urged protesters not to take children to rally sites.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992936&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/south-china-sea-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992915" alt="Philippine Military Chief Emmanuel  Bautista says Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea are “nonsense” and vowed to defend fishermen if they face intimidation by Chinese naval forces in the waters. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/south-china-sea-480.jpg" /></a> Philippine Military Chief Emmanuel Bautista says Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea are “nonsense” and vowed to defend fishermen if they face intimidation. (AP)
<p>The Philippine government summoned China&#8217;s top envoy in Manila on Tuesday to protest for the firing of a water cannon by a Chinese government vessel to drive away Filipino fishermen in a disputed shoal in the South China Sea. Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman Raul Hernandez said a diplomatic protest was handed to Beijing&#8217;s charge d&#8217;affairs over the January 27 incident at Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing ground claimed by China and the Philippines.</p>
<p>The shoal came under Chinese control after Philippine vessels backed off from a tense standoff with Chinese ships in the area in 2012. Chinese coast guard and surveillance ships have since guarded the shoal, chasing Filipino fishermen away if they venture close. The Philippines has not deployed its ships to try to take back control of Scarborough, but asked an international tribunal last year to declare China&#8217;s seizure of the shoal and seven other South China Sea reefs illegal.</p>
<p>A Chinese coast guard vessel with bow No. 3063 used its water cannon for several minutes and sounded its horn to drive away two Filipino fishing boats near Scarborough, Hernandez told a news conference, adding it was the first time Chinese authorities had carried out such a hostile act against Filipino fishermen. &#8220;Bajo de Masinloc is an integral part of the Philippines and over which the Philippines exercises sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction,&#8221; Hernandez said, using the Filipino name for the vast shoal area.</p>
<p>Filipino fish trader Macario Forones said Chinese coast guard personnel used waste water laden with oil while blowing the horn and yelling &#8220;Go away, go away&#8221; at his fishermen. One or two other Philippine fishing boats were hit by the waste water, he said. &#8220;The water smelled of oil and smeared the side of my fishing boat,&#8221; Forones told The Associated Press by telephone. &#8220;But my fishermen did not really leave the area. We&#8217;ve spent so much money to travel there and they basically ignored the Chinese.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nine other instances of harassment were committed by Chinese government vessels on Filipino fishermen last year, including when Filipinos were prevented from taking shelter at the shoal during stormy weather, Hernandez said. President Benigno Aquino III said his government wanted an explanation from Beijing. Chinese Embassy officials did not immediately react to the Philippine protest. Hernandez said the Philippine government would take steps to protect its fishermen, but he did not specify how.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992904&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A 21-year-old woman in the UK has saved her mother&#8217;s life by donating her a kidney.</p>
<p>Milissa Hutchinson from Walsall went under the knife on Valentine&#8217;s Day to donate a kidney to her 49-year-old mother, Mandy, who had been suffering from kidney failure for more than a year.</p>
<p>Milissa immediately volunteered to help Mandy when she needed a life-saving operation after her body&#8217;s immune system began attacking both her kidneys, &#8216;The Express and Star&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>Mandy fell ill from the rare condition and was on dialysis for more than a year while waiting for the operation.</p>
<p>She suffers from a rare immune condition which is thought to occur after pregnancy.</p>
<p>It develops when some cells from the baby remain inside the mother and her body starts to attack them, the report said.</p>
<p>She was admitted to Walgrave University Hospital in Coventry, where her immune system was shut down to allow her to have the operation.</p>
<p>Milissa was back home just a week after the life-saving operation and is now recovering.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992817&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>An independent human rights group says it has obtained documents directly implicating the Myanmar government in abusive and discriminatory policies targeting the country&#8217;s minority Rohingya Muslim community.</p>
<p>Matthew Smith, executive director of Fortify Rights, said on Tuesday that his 79-page report detailing restrictions on family life, the right to travel freely and practice religion was based largely on leaked official documents and an analysis of public records. He said while most of the policies have long been known, seeing them spelled out in writing was chilling: &#8220;It represents a level of planning and knowledge among Myanmar authorities that raises the abuses to the threshold of crimes against humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist nation of 60 million, emerged from decades of military rule in 2011. The government had no immediate comment.</p>

(Reuters)
<p>Pakistan military on Tuesday carried out air strikes targeting militant hideouts in the country&#8217;s tribal region of North and South Waziristan. At least 30 terrorists were killed on Tuesday when Pakistani fighter jets carried out air strikes on militant hideouts in Shawal valley, a mountainous area in North Waziristan sharing boundary with South Waziristan, and other areas of the restive northwest tribal region. The security sources said a number of terrorists&#8217; hideouts have been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some 30 terrorists were killed in early morning air strikes on terrorists&#8217; hideouts in Pray ghar and Razan Nala areas of Pasht Ziarat in Shawal valley on the boundary of North and South Wazirastan agencies,&#8221; a security source said. He added that simultaneous strikes were also carried out in Ghariom village in North Waziristan. The air strikes mainly took place in Datta Khel and Shawal areas of North Waziristan where militant training facilities and compounds are said to be located.</p>
<p>It is said the militants had captured a stretch between South and North Waziristan and had established training centers where they were also preparing suicide bombers. The air strikes are part of military&#8217;s new strategy to launch intelligence based limited operations. The continuous air strikes in various parts of the tribal areas since last week have led to feeling that a full-fledged military operation against the militants could begin soon.</p>
<p>Thousands of people have started fleeing the region. The government was forced to suspend peace dialogue with the Taliban and go in for air strikes following the beheading of 23 Frontier Corps personnel. The government has maintained that it is still for solution through talks and have demanded that the Taliban announce a ceasefire. Advisor to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs and National Security Sartaj Aziz has said consultation on military operation in North Waziristan was underway.</p>
<p>However, he has stressed that dialogue option with the Taliban has not yet been discarded.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992777&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/turkey-pm-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992778" alt="Turkey PM has accused the influential Gulen group for eavesdropping into his conversation. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/turkey-pm-480.jpg" /></a> Turkey PM has accused the influential Gulen group for eavesdropping into his conversation. (Reuters)
<p>The Turkish government has accused associates of US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen in the police and the judiciary of eavesdropping on thousands of people including Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Erdogan has accused rivals in the influential Gulen group of acting as a &#8220;state within a state&#8221; seeking to topple his government by instigating a high-level corruption investigation against close allies.</p>
<p>On Monday, pro-government dailies Yenisafak and Star said classified documents revealing the surveillance were discovered by new prosecutors appointed after a mass purge of the police and prosecution service in the wake of the corruption probe launched in December. Cabinet ministers, the country&#8217;s spy chief and journalists were among the targets, government spokesman Bulent Arinc confirmed to journalists. &#8220;This a sad and shocking event. The public is following this closely,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Media sympathetic to Gulen quoted his lawyer Nurullah Albayrak as saying the allegations were &#8220;unfair&#8221;. &#8220;The only purpose of this situation is to incite hatred and division,&#8221; he said. One of the former prosecutors Adnan Cimen also denied that anything illegal had taken place. &#8220;These allegations are entirely without foundation. Not a single illegal operation was authorised,&#8221; Cimen told newspaper Milliyet.</p>
<p>The Star reported that so-called Gulenists had wiretapped more than 7,000 people, as well as the headquarters of the opposition Republic People&#8217;s Party (RPP), since 2011 on the pretext of trying to uncover terrorism plots. Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said he had been wiretapped, adding: &#8220;This is no longer a problem just for the (ruling) AK Party.&#8221;</p>
<p>Intelligence chief Hakan Fidan and one of his close allies were also among those targeted, along with many business people, activists and journalists, according to the newspaper reports. Faruk Logoglu, a vice-president of the RPP who was reportedly one of those targeted, dismissed the claims as an attempt by Erdogan to &#8220;support his rhetoric about a parallel state that he uses against the Gulen movement&#8221;.</p>
<p>The corruption scandal has thrown up one of the most serious challenges to Erdogan&#8217;s 11 years in power ahead of key local elections in March. The mass eavesdropping reports come as parliament began debating a new bill aimed at giving the intelligence agency a free hand in carrying out undercover missions and surveillance at home and abroad &#8211; without the need for a court order.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992702&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iraqm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1976736" alt="Under International Law, Iraq is not supposed to sign an arms deal. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iraqm.jpg" /></a> Under International Law, Iraq is not supposed to sign an arms deal.
<p>The United States has pressed Iraq to explain media reports that it had signed a contract to buy arms from Iran, a move forbidden under a United Nations embargo. &#8220;We&#8217;ve certainly seen those reports. If true, this would raise serious concerns,&#8221; State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Monday.</p>
<p>A deal signed in November, in which Iraq would buy USD 195 million in arms from Iran, was reported by Reuters in Baghdad on Monday. Psaki said that &#8220;any transfer of arms from Iran to a third country is in direct violation&#8221; of the UN embargo. &#8220;We are seeking clarification on this matter from the government of Iraq and to ensure that Iraqi officials understand the limits that international law places on arms trade with Iran,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The contract with Iran would have been signed just after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki visited Washington requesting American military aid in fighting al-Qaeda and other Sunni extremist groups. In early January, Iran&#8217;s deputy chief of staff General Mohammad Hejazi said that his country was ready to provide military equipment and advice to Iraq as it battles al-Qaeda. Maliki payed a visit to Iran one month later.</p>
<p>To help Iraq fight al-Qaeda and other Sunni extremist groups, such as the jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Washington has recently promised to speed up its delivery of Hellfire missiles and surveillance drones. The Pentagon is ready to sell more missiles and 24 Apache attack helicopters. &#8220;We certainly view the government of Iraq as a partner in the fight against terrorism and we&#8217;re committed to supporting them in this fight,&#8221; Psaki said.</p>
<p>She added that the United States has provided more than USD 15 billion in equipment, services and training to Iraqi armed services and security.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992685&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/renzi-new.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992577 " alt="Newly appointed Italian Premier Matteo Renzi  during his first cabinet meeting at Chigi Palace in Rome February 22, 2014" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/renzi-new.jpg" /></a> Renzi was sworn into office on Saturday along with an unusually young Cabinet. (Reuters)
<p>Italian Premier Matteo Renzi won a crucial confidence vote in Parliament on his brand new government early on Tuesday, managing at least for now to tamp down anger from among his own Democrats over his brash, quick rise to power.</p>
<p>The vote in the Senate came hours after he argued that he could get his country back to work, which his predecessors had failed to do. 39-year-old Renzi, Italy&#8217;s youngest premier, was sworn into office on Saturday along with an unusually young Cabinet, with many of the ministers newcomers to national government.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 169-139 to confirm Renzi&#8217;s broad coalition, which ranges from his centre-left Democrats to centre-right forces formerly loyal to ex-premier  Silvio Berlusconi. Renzi needed at least 155 votes to clinch the victory, one of two mandatory confidence votes. The second vote, in the Chamber of Deputies, was expected later Tuesday. Renzi&#8217;s coalition has a comfortable majority in the lower chamber. But he had a closer call in the Senate, where his coalition&#8217;s numbers  were tighter, especially after some of his own Democrats questioned on the eve of the vote if he deserved their backing.</p>
<p>There has been loud grumbling among his own Democrats over Renzi&#8217;s heavy-handed tactics to wrest the premiership from fellow Democrat Enrico Letta. His predecessor led a coalition with the same tense partners for 10 months, but Renzi engineered his ouster after industrialists and union leaders grew impatient with tentative efforts to energise the economy after years of  stagnation.</p>
<p>In the end, the potential defectors closed ranks, despite scepticism, after Renzi made a speech that was short on details on how he would quickly revive the economy. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that a government of this type can last four years,&#8221; said Felice Casson, a leading Democrat who said he voted for Renzi &#8220;despite indigestion&#8221; over the neophyte premier&#8217;s leadership.</p>
<p>Renzi insisted that debt-laden Italy must heal its public finances not because Germany&#8217;s Angela Merkel or the European Central Bank chief want that, but because &#8220;It&#8217;s our children&#8221; who seek a future. He promised new laws to slash payroll taxes to encourage hiring, but didn&#8217;t say how Italy would recoup the lower tax revenues.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992576&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sexual_assault.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1956942" alt="The doctor has been fighting to stay in Perth since he was released from jail after serving more than 18 months for sexually abusing a 19-year-old girl." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sexual_assault.jpg" /></a> The doctor has been fighting to stay in Perth since he was released from jail after serving more than 18 months for sexually abusing a 19-year-old girl.
<p>An India-born doctor, convicted of sexually assaulting a patient while working at an Australian hospital, has lost his bid to stay in the country.</p>
<p>A Federal Court judge dismissed Suhail Durani&#8217;s plea yesterday, but his defence lawyer Shahid Shakur said they intend to take the case to the full bench of the court.</p>
<p>Durani, 36, has been fighting to stay in Perth since he was released from jail after serving more than 18 months for sexually abusing a 19-year-old girl at Royal Perth Hospital in 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s utterly disappointed of course. He has been in detention now for nearly six months and at the time of the judgement obviously we expected a different decision,&#8221; Shakur was quoted as saying in an ABC report.</p>
<p>&#8220;We respect the decision. It&#8217;s obviously appealable but it will depend on the counsel&#8217;s advice,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His client who had a wife and young son, had an arguable case, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that the Minister has made the errors. While we respect the judgement of his Honour today, as soon as we have the counsel advice and we have read the reasoning for the decision, we will be in a decision to take further steps,&#8221; he said adding, &#8220;We have not been able to read the judgement as yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shakur said Durani was not yet facing deportation and would remain in detention until the appeal process is resolved.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he doesn&#8217;t appeal then he faces deportation under the law, but if he appeals against the decision he does not obviously,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we understand, appeals can take up to six months,&#8221; Shakur said.</p>
<p>Durani has 21 days to lodge an appeal. He had lost a bid to appeal against his conviction in 2012 and was fighting to stay back in the country. He had maintained his innocence and sought leave to appeal on seven grounds, including that his defence lawyer had acted incompetently.</p>
<p>The three Appeal Court judges dismissed his plea, refusing six of the seven grounds. His visa was also cancelled by the Federal Government last year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992628&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Mexican druglord Joaquín Guzmán Loera El Chapo, the world’s most wanted man, has been arrested in Mexico. But was it really him?<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992556&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">“It was too easy,” said a young woman, her eyes fixed on the 12-storey condominium where Mexican marines and US agents grabbed Joaquín Guzmán Loera El Chapo, drug kingpin to the world, early Saturday morning. “No shootout, no final stand?”</span></p>
<p>The takedown this weekend of the world’s most wanted man — the chief executive of what experts describe as the world’s most sophisticated narcotics enterprise, the Sinaloa cartel — upended long-held assumptions about the impunity of Mexican mobsters. Guzmán, after all, seemed untouchable, relying time and again on intimidation and bribery to keep his freedom.</p>
<p>But the giant known as Shorty fell with an odd humility, awakened shirtless by the authorities before 7 am on Saturday. He neither died in a blaze of glory nor managed another daring escape.</p>
<p>US agents and Mexican marines worked together for weeks, until the moment of capture, when they crashed through the door of a fourth-floor apartment overlooking the Pacific.</p>
<p>It began with a meeting a few weeks ago. The US Drug Enforcement Administration presented a body of intelligence information to Mexican navy officials. The Americans had worked closely before with the marines but were not certain their counterparts would take on the mission. President Enrique Peña Nieto had made clear that the economy was his priority.</p>
<p>Officials said there were local obstacles too. Many Sinaloans considered Guzmán as a kind of favourite rebel son. His cartel has deep roots across the state, with many arguing that his operation is relatively benign in comparison to some newer groups that rely more on extortion and kidnapping.</p>
<p>“It’s an old model of organised crime that’s not predatory on the local population,” said Alejandro Hope, a former Mexican intelligence officer. Still, he added, “For all the talk of Chapo as a good narco, this is the person who was responsible for the drug war in Tijuana and Juárez. That’s thousands of deaths.”</p>
<p>Roughly a month before Guzmán’s capture, the Mexican marines began to sweep methodically through Culiacán, the Sinaloa state capital. They knocked down doors and recovered weapons, armoured cars, drugs and cash.</p>
<p>The drug operators scurried. On February 13, three men were arrested on the road to Mazatlán, including a man called “19”, believed to be the new head assassin for one of Guzmán’s senior officers, Ismael (Mayo) Zambada. On February 17, another senior leader was captured with 4,000 hollowed-out cucumbers and bananas filled with cocaine. A half-dozen others followed.</p>
<p>Working on information from some of Guzmán’s bodyguards, Mexican marines and US agents raided the home of his ex-wife on Thursday. After struggling to batter down the steel-reinforced door, instead of finding their prey, they discovered a secret door beneath a bathtub that led to a network of tunnels and sewer canals that connected to six other houses.</p>
<p>The search continued, but the earlier arrests and intelligence were pointing south, to Mazatlán — one of Mexico’s first resorts. An intercepted call to Guzmán’s cellphone had already triggered the command to move on Friday. In the dark of night on Saturday, neighbours heard knocks on the doors. US officials said the teams did not know which apartment he was in. Then came a crash.</p>
<p>By the time retirees down the block heard helicopters — “I was waiting to hear the gunfire,” one Canadian woman said — it was over. Some reports said the authorities also found a woman in the apartment and photos of the room show two children’s suitcases on a bed, suggesting Guzmán was with his wife and twin 2-year-old daughters. But US officials said they were surprised by what was not there: a cache of weapons. Not a single shot was fired.</p>
<p>Local residents cast doubt on the operation for that reason. That it happened just a few days after President Barack Obama visited Mexico, during a week when official figures showed the economy grew by only 1.1 per cent.</p>
<p>“It’s a fantasy,” said Ofelia Aguilar, 52. “It has to be someone else. I just don’t believe it.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992556&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/putin.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992553" alt="Could Putin accept a defeat in a tussle he appeared until a few days ago to have won? Reuters" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/putin.jpg" /></a> Could Putin accept a defeat in a tussle he appeared until a few days ago to have won? Reuters
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">President Vladimir Putin faces a decision over Ukraine that is likely to shape his political legacy as well as the future of Russia’s western neighbour, trapped in an East-West battle that has echoes of the Cold War.</span></p>
<p>President Viktor Yanukovych’s loss of power deprives Putin of an ally vital to his hopes of keeping Ukraine, the cradle of Russian civilisation, in what he sees as Russia’s orbit.</p>
<p>His hopes of building a huge trading bloc, grouping as many former Soviet republics as possible to challenge the economic might of China and the United States, could be in tatters.</p>
<p>But making a stand over Ukraine, or getting drawn into a new bidding war with the European Union to win sway over the cash-strapped country, would be risky.</p>
<p>Moscow can ill-afford to improve the $15 billion financial bailout package it offered in December. But forceful measures, such as taking over mainly Russian-speaking areas of eastern Ukraine, would risk triggering a more serious conflict.</p>
<p>Putin is saying nothing for now in public, although he has spoken over the phone with US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He was especially keen to stay silent before the end of the Winter Olympics in Sochi.</p>
<p>But the protesters on Independence Square in central Kiev are waiting anxiously to see what he does.</p>
<p>“We all know Putin likes to meddle,” said Alexei Tsitulski, a 25-year-old protester from the Crimea. The region used to be Russian territory and was given to Ukraine in 1953. “We’re not going to let Ukraine be split.”</p>
<p>Such comments, echoed by other protesters, underline how high the stakes are as Putin looks for ways to save face in the geopolitical struggle that had appeared to be going his way until the past week.</p>
<p>Putin won what seemed a decisive victory last November when Yanukovych spurned deals that would have forged closer trade and political ties with the European Union. He opted to rebuild economic relations with former Soviet master Moscow instead.</p>
<p>Russia agreed to a $15 billion bailout package for heavily indebted Ukraine and promised a reduction in the price Kiev pays for Russian gas.</p>
<p>But Yanukovych was central to the deal and his fall from grace puts it in doubt. Opposition leaders and many of the Kiev protesters favour closer ties with Europe and fear getting sucked back towards Russia.</p>
<p>Moscow also sent a signal of intent by dispatching Alexei Pushkov, a Putin loyalist and senior member of parliament, to a meeting of regional leaders of eastern Ukraine on Saturday.</p>
<p>Withholding the money is a possible lever to keep Ukraine at Russia’s side. Another would be to raise new barriers to imports from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Sunday Moscow would release the $2 billion second tranche of the bailout only when a new government is formed in Kiev.</p>
<p>The EU responded in kind. Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Ollie Rehn promised “substantial aid” if the next Ukrainian government looks west instead of east.</p>
<p>Could Putin, however, accept such a humiliating defeat in a tussle he appeared until a few days ago to have won?</p>
<p>If Ukraine does another U-turn and moves towards the EU, Putin will be looking at a foreign policy setback that could go down badly at home.</p>
<p>The involvement of Ukraine, with its large market and mineral resources, is vital to the success of Putin’s planned Eurasian Union, intended to regroup like-minded states and recoup the potential lost when the Soviet empire collapsed.</p>
<p>Losing influence in Ukraine would be hard to accept for Russians who consider the country little more than a Russian vassal.</p>
<p><strong>The polarising Tymoshenko</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">As former prime minister Yulia V Tymoshenko was released after 930 days in prison and made a comeback to Ukraine’s political stage on Saturday under dramatic circumstances — appearing in a wheelchair on Independence Square — it was clear that she remains Ukraine’s most charismatic political figure. However, she is also deeply polarising, distrusted and even despised by some as a longtime player in the often corrupt corridors of power here. After three months of hard-fought unrest, protesters may now be reluctant to automatically accept as a leader someone who was not with them in the streets. Tymoshenko, 53, herself squelched speculation that she might take up her old duties as PM.</span></p>
<p>Over the years, Tymoshenko has proved to be one of Ukraine’s most beguiling political figures, manoeuvring through its alliances and enmities with charisma, flexibility and ambition. She has been a speaker of Russian from eastern Ukraine, at other points a champion of the Ukrainian language, which predominates in the west. She has long supported Ukraine’s integration with Europe but also maintained a strong relationship with Russia.In the post-Soviet 1990s, she became extremely rich in the energy industry and began her political career in 1996.Her allies say she will work to revive the agreements with the EU. “She will be pro-Western,” a lawmaker from Tymoshenko’s Fatherland Party said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992547&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/moon1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992271" alt="moon" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/moon1.jpg" /></a> A commercial airliner&#8217;s schlieren can be seen at it crosses the full moon, or Hunger Moon over Whittier, Calif., on its final approach to LAX on Friday, Feb. 14, 2014
<p>A Spanish astronomer today said he had witnessed a fridge-sized asteroid smash into the Moon, in the biggest lunar impact by a space rock ever recorded.</p>
<p>The rare episode was seen by Jose Maria Madiedo, a professor at the University of Huelva, Britain&#8217;s Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) said.</p>
<p>On September 11 last year, Madiedo was operating two lunar-observing telescopes when he spotted a flash in the Mare Nubium, an ancient, dark lava-filled basin.</p>
<p>The flare was briefly almost as bright as the northern hemisphere&#8217;s Pole Star, the RAS said.</p>
<p>It would have been visible to the naked eye to anyone who happened to be looking at the Moon at that moment in good viewing conditions, the RAS said.</p>
<p>There followed a long afterglow, lasting another eight seconds &#8211; the longest and brightest ever seen for a lunar impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;At that moment, I realised that I had seen a very rare and extraordinary event,&#8221; Madiedo told the society.</p>
<p>Madiedo and colleagues calculate that the rock had a mass of around 400 kilos, with a diameter of between 60 centimetres and 1.40 metres.</p>
<p>It hit Mare Nubium at around 61,000 kilometres per hour. The speed was so high that the rock turned molten on impact and vaporised, leaving a thermal glow visible from Earth as a flash, and bequeathing a 40-metre crater in the Moon&#8217;s pocked surface.</p>
<p>The impact energy was equivalent to an explosion of around 15 tonnes of TNT, more than triple the largest previously seen event, claimed by NASA in March 2013.</p>
<p>Madiedo&#8217;s team calculate that rocks of this size may strike Earth about 10 times more frequently than was generally thought.</p>
<p>Earth, though, is protected by its atmosphere and asteroids of this size burned up as dramatic &#8220;fireball&#8221; meteors.</p>
<p>By way of comparison, the rock that exploded above Chelyabinsk, Russia, on February 15 2014, is believed to have measured about 20 metres across and weighed some 13,000 tonnes. It is considered to have been at the lower end of medium-sized asteroids.</p>
<p>The Spanish observation is published in the RAS journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992269&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Egypt&#8217;s military-backed interim government led by Prime Minister Hazem El-Beblawi on Monday resigned, in a surprise move just weeks before presidential polls in which the country&#8217;s powerful army chief is expected to run.</p>
<p>Beblawi announced on state TV that his cabinet has submitted its resignation to Interim President Adly Mansour.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cabinet decided in light of the current situation that the country is going through&#8230; to submit its resignation to Adly Mansour, the interim president,&#8221; the cabinet said in a statement.</p>
<p>Beblawi gave no particular reason for the Cabinet&#8217;s resignation in his address, but it comes amid a series of strikes, including one by public sector workers and rubbish collectors.</p>
<p>The decision was made after the cabinet meeting attended by armed forces chief and Defence Minister Field Marshal Abdul Fattah al-Sisi.</p>
<p>Interim President Adly Mansour is expected to accept the cabinet&#8217;s resignation and commission Ibrahim Mahleb, minister of housing in Beblawi&#8217;s government, to form the new cabinet, Ahram Online quoted an official source as saying.</p>
<p>The move comes ahead of presidential polls in mid-April and Sisi is widely tipped to win the poll if he stands.</p>
<p>Sisi, who ousted Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in July, has to resign from the government and the army before he can officially announce his presidential bid.</p>
<p>After a 15-minute meeting with the cabinet, Beblawi said &#8220;reform cannot take place through the government alone&#8221; and all Egyptians should strive to achieve the change they aspire for.</p>
<p>Beblawi, in his televised address, praised his government&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the past six to seven months, the government assumed its responsibilities and duties&#8230; the government did not spare any efforts to get Egypt out of a bad phase,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the time for personal interests. The nation is above everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beblawi&#8217;s government was subjected to criticism over the past few weeks by all colours of the political spectrum in Egypt, particularly after the exclusion of crucial groups of public sector workers from qualifying for a newly passed minimum wage law leading to strikes in a number of crucial sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>A prominent economist and politician, Beblawi was named prime minister last July following the ouster of Morsi and his prime minister Hisham Qandil&#8217;s government amid massive protests.</p>
<p>In his statement, Beblawi said his government had accepted the responsibility at the time of its appointment because its ministers were among the few willing to face that challenge, and not because they were the most qualified.</p>
<p>Sisi is expected to announce soon that he will run for president.</p>
<p>Beblawi&#8217;s government was sworn in on July 16, less than two weeks after the army Morsi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992238&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Reuters
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ukraine&#8217;s new authorities issued an arrest warrant Monday for mass murder against ousted president Viktor Yanukovych, who is on the run after being toppled by bloody street protests in which police snipers killed demonstrators.</span></p>
<p>Russia, Yanukovych’s main backer, said it would not deal with Ukrainians who seized power from their elected leader in an “armed mutiny”. It declared that Russian citizens’ lives were under threat there, and contacted NATO to express concern.</p>
<p>With Ukraine’s neighbours raising the alarm about a break-up of Ukraine, Moscow said the concerns of local leaders in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, Russian-speaking bastions of electoral support for Yanukovich, must be taken into account.</p>
<p>European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton arrived in Kiev to discuss measures to shore up the ailing economy, which the finance ministry said needs urgent financial assistance to avoid default.</p>
<p>The EU has contacted the United States, Japan, China, Canada and Turkey to coordinate aid for Ukraine, a senior EU official said. France’s foreign minister said an international donors’ conference was being discussed.</p>
<p>US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and IMF chief Christine Lagarde agreed Ukraine would need bilateral and multilateral support for any reforms, a US Treasury official said. US Treasury officials will accompany Deputy Secretary of State William Burns on a trip to Kiev this week.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s parliament, exercising power as leaders try to form an interim government, replaced the head of the central bank, appointing lawmaker and former banker Stepan Kubiv.</p>
<p>Yanukovych, 63, who fled Kiev by helicopter on Friday, was still at large after heading first to his power base in the east, where he was prevented from flying out of the country, and then diverting south to the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea, acting interior minister Arsen Avakov said.</p>
<p>“An official case for the mass murder of peaceful citizens has been opened,” Avakov wrote on Facebook. “Yanukovych and other people responsible for this have been declared wanted.”</p>
<p>Yanukovych had left a private residence in Balaclava, near the home base of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol, for an unknown destination, Avakov said. He went by car with one of his aides and a handful of security guards.</p>
<p>It was an ignominious political end for Yanukovich who has been publicly deserted by some of his closest erstwhile allies, stripped of his luxury residence near Kiev and had to witness the release from prison of his arch-rival Yulia Tymoshenko.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992230&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a lighter vein, Pakistan Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan today invited the Taliban to play a cricket match, saying members of the banned group keenly follow the game.</p>
<p>Khan was talking to reporters in Rawalpindi after he hit a few shots during a cricket tournament in the garrison city. He was the chief guest at the event.</p>
<p>The Minister said if a cricket match with the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan does take place, the outcome will be positive.</p>
<p>&#8220;The inputs suggest that Taliban keenly follow cricket,&#8221; he said in comments aired live on news channels. Khan is one of the key ministers who was overseeing the government&#8217;s efforts to engage the TTP in peace talks.</p>
<p>The process was suspended last week after a Taliban faction executed 23 troops taken hostage in 2010.</p>
<p>Khan said Pakistan is a peaceful country but its enemies want to spread terrorism there. He said cricket was a sport that signifies peace, friendship and brotherhood.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992203&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>Beleaguered former military ruler Pervez Musharraf was on Monday directed by a Pakistani anti-terrorism court to appear personally on March 7 in connection with a case over the detention of judges in 2007.</p>
<p>The court exempted 70-year-old Musharraf from Monday&#8217;s hearing following a request from his lawyer Ilyas Siddiqui. Siddiqui claimed the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology, where Musharraf is admitted, was not providing his client&#8217;s medical reports. He said the court may seek these reports on its own. Public prosecutor Nadeem Tabish said neither Musharraf nor his guarantors were appearing in court and requested it to decide the matter on merit at the next hearing.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the court adjourned the case till March 7. The judges&#8217; detention case is based on an FIR registered against the former army chief in August 2009 on a complaint filed by lawyer Chaudhry Mohammad Aslam Ghumman. Ghumman asked police to initiate legal proceedings against Musharraf for detaining over 60 judges, including then Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, after imposing emergency in November 2007.</p>
<p>Musharraf is currently embroiled in several criminal and civil cases. The government last year formed a special court to try him on a charge of high treason for imposing emergency.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992100&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/maduro-480.jpg" /></a> Maduro, a former bus driver and union activist, is grappling with his biggest crisis since he was narrowly elected president in April 2013. (AP)
<p>Venezuela&#8217;s president has called for crisis talks in an attempt to defuse weeks of deadly anti-government protests that have brought the biggest challenge yet to his regime. At least 10 people have been killed and scores wounded in daily anti-government demonstrations that began on February 4. The leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro is still reeling from a massive protest march in Caracas on Saturday called for by opposition leader Henrique Capriles.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands met to vent their anger against the government, upset over the soaring crime rate, high inflation, a shortage of food and commodities, and alleged official involvement in thuggish pro-government armed gangs. At least 25 people were injured in late Saturday clashes with security forces that were some of the most serious till date.</p>
<p>Outside the presidential palace on Sunday, Maduro called for &#8220;a national peace conference&#8221; to be held on Wednesday &#8220;with all social, political, union and religious groups.&#8221; Maduro also said he would ask the National Assembly to form a Truth Commission to look into the protests, which he claims are an attempt to &#8220;justify foreign intervention in Venezuela,&#8221; in an interview on the Telesur TV network.</p>
<p>Maduro, a former bus driver and union activist, is grappling with his biggest crisis since he was narrowly elected president in April 2013. He became leader of Venezuela&#8217;s &#8220;Bolivarian Revolution&#8221; following the death early last year of leftist icon Hugo Chavez. The &#8216;Chavista&#8217; administration can still count on core support among the country&#8217;s working class, and Maduro held counter rallies both last Saturday and Sunday in the capital.</p>
<p>Groups of elderly people marched on Sunday to show their support for the socialist regime that has been in power since 1999. Pro-government demonstrators dressed in red, waved Venezuelan flags and pro-Maduro banners, and protested what they called &#8220;fascist violence&#8221; by student opposition. &#8220;That&#8217;s enough youth violence. This is a country of peace. We want a future of peace,&#8221; Cristina Marcos, 60, told reporters during a rally that began in the morning and headed to the Miraflores Palace, where the president spoke.</p>
<p>The daily anti-government protests, which began in the western city of San Cristobal led by students angry over the soaring crime rate, have increasingly been accompanied by violence.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992049&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The world&#8217;s oldest known Holocaust survivor, who inspired an Oscar-nominated documentary about her extraordinary life, has died aged 110. Born in a Jewish family in Prague in 1903, Alice Herz-Sommer, an accomplished pianist and music teacher, spent two years in a Nazi concentration camp in Terezin.</p>
<p>A film about the centenarian titled &#8216;The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life&#8217; has been nominated for best short documentary at next month&#8217;s Academy Awards. Herz-Sommer died in a hospital on Sunday, days after she was admitted with an infection. She taught at the Jerusalem Conservatory until 1986, when she moved to London, the BBC reported. &#8220;We all came to believe that she would just never die,&#8221; said Frederic Bohbot, producer of the documentary on her.</p>
<p>Herz-Sommer is believed to have continued playing Schubert and Beethoven until her final days. &#8220;I am Jewish, but Beethoven is my religion. I am no longer myself. The body cannot resist as it did in the past,&#8221; Herz-Sommer wrote on the film&#8217;s website. &#8220;I think I am in my last days, but it does not really matter because I have had such a beautiful life,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>Herz-Sommer recalled &#8220;always laughing&#8221; during her time in Terezin. She said the joy of making music had kept their spirits up. &#8220;These concerts, the people are sitting there, old people, desolate and ill, and they came to the concerts and this music was for them our food. Music was our food. Through making music we were kept alive,&#8221; she once recalled. Herz-Sommer and her son, Stephan, were among less than 20,000 people who were freed when Terezin was liberated by the<br />
Soviet army in May 1945.</p>
<p>Her husband, whom she married in 1931, died of typhus at Dachau, a Nazi concentration camp in southern Germany. Around 140,000 Jews were sent to Terezin and 33,430 died there, the report said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992023&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukraine-4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991291" alt="Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych was stopped at the airport to prevent him from flying out.

<p>Ukrainian law enforcement agencies said on Monday they have no information about the whereabouts of President Viktor Yanukovych, who reportedly was seen in Sevastopol, a port on Ukraine&#8217;s Crimean Peninsula that is home to Russia&#8217;s Black Sea Fleet. After signing an agreement with the opposition to end a conflict that turned deadly, Yanukovych fled the capital for eastern Ukraine. Ukraine&#8217;s border service said he tried to fly out of the country on Saturday from Donetsk, but was stopped by their officials.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the BBC has reported that Ukraine&#8217;s interim interior minister has issued an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26320004" target="_blank">arrest warrant</a> for the ousted President Viktor Yanukovych. Opposition lawmaker Volodym Kurennoy said on his Facebook page that he had unconfirmed information that the president had been arrested in Crimea. Ukrainain news portal Liga.net reports that Sevastopol residents saw Yanukovych in the company of Russian marines. The claim could not be independently verified. Spokespersons for the regional and national Interior Ministry and Security Service said today they had no such information.</p>
<p>Yanukovych set off a wave of protests by shelving an agreement with the EU in November and turning toward Russia, and the movement quickly expanded its grievances to corruption, human rights abuses and calls for Yanukovych&#8217;s resignation. The speaker of parliament assumed the president&#8217;s powers yesterday, but a presidential aide told the AP yesterday that Yanukovych plans to stay in power.</p>
<p>Tensions have been mounting in Crimea, where pro-Russian politicians are organising rallies and forming protest units and have been demanding autonomy from Kiev. Russia maintains a big naval base in Crimea that has tangled relations between the countries for two decades.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992017&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Senior Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan commander Asmatullah Shaheen Bhittani was today shot dead along with three others by unknown gunmen in the restive North Waziristan tribal area. According to security sources, unknown gunmen opened fire on their vehicle near Darga Mandi area of Ghulam Khan tehsil in the area.</p>
<p>A total of four militants were killed. The identity of rest of the three militants could not be confirmed yet. The attackers fled from the scene while panic gripped the area after the incident. The local residents shifted the bodies to the hospital. Bhittani had served as the acting TTP chief after Hakeemullah Mehsud&#8217;s death and also headed the Taliban supreme shura (council).</p>
<p>North Waziristan is one of seven regions in Pakistan&#8217;s Federally Administered Tribal Area governed by tribal laws. The area is a safe haven for TTP militants and Al-Qaeda operatives.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991970&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>A six-year-old Thai girl succumbed to her injuries on Monday, taking the number of children killed in attacks on anti-government rallies over the weekend to three. Premier Yingluck Shinawatra denounced the violence as &#8220;terrorist acts&#8221;. Two children and a woman were killed and over 60 others injured when a blast and a drive-by shooting attack rocked protest rallies in a central Bangkok shopping district, marking an escalation in political crisis that has gripped the country for four months now.</p>
<p>A six-year-old girl has died from bruising to the brain, the Ramathibodi Hospital said in a statement. Her brother died on Sunday from serious head wounds and internal bleeding. The premier, who was &#8220;undertaking official duties&#8221; outside Bangkok, called on all sides to shun violence and described the violent incidents as &#8220;terrorist acts&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The violent incidents are terrorist acts for political gain without any regard for human lives. The government will not tolerate terrorism and has ordered a full investigation by authorities to find the culprits and bring them to justice without exception,&#8221; she said. Satit Wongnongtoey, leader of the anti-government People&#8217;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), claimed that the state is &#8220;backing&#8221; armed forces who attacked the protesters.</p>
<p>Last evening&#8217;s bomb explosion took place near a big supermarket surrounded by bustling street stalls, hotels and one of the Bangkok&#8217;s biggest shopping malls. A five-year-old girl was gunned down in the drive-by shooting in eastern Trat province late Saturday while a 40-year-old woman was the fourth casualty who died from severe injuries inflicted by a bomb blast over the weekend.</p>
<p>Defiant protesters today moved from their rally sites to different government offices to cut the pipelines feeding businesses of the Shinawatra clan, prompting authorities to step up security measures, but the powerful army said it would not intervene this time round. &#8220;Somebody has to take responsibility, but that doesn&#8217;t mean soldiers can intervene without working under the framework (of the law),&#8221; army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha said in a rare televised address.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can we be sure that if we use soldiers, the situation will return to peace?&#8221; The attacks are the latest in political violence in Thailand, which is witnessing anti-government protests by opposition backed demonstrators who want Yingluck to quit.</p>
<p>Protest leader Phra Buddha Issara, a senior monk, and other PDRC activists gathered in front of a pro-government Voice TV station, which is owned by the son of Yingluck&#8217;s fugitive brother Thaksin Shinawatra. Issara is a leader of the protesters who occupied the Government Complex on Chang Wattana road. UN chief Ban Ki-moon has condemned the yesterday&#8217;s attacks.</p>
<p>Thailand has seen months of anti-government protests, often violent, aimed at ousting Yingluck and curbing the political dominance of the Shinawatra clan. The protesters accuse Yingluck of acting as a proxy for her fugitive brother, former premier Thaksin who was ousted in a coup in 2006. He lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai to escape a jail term on a corruption conviction.</p>
<p>Twenty people have been killed and over 700 injured in the political strife that began in November last year. The recent violence is the worst political bloodshed in Thailand since 2010 when protests by pro-Thaksin &#8220;Red Shirts&#8221; left more than 90 dead and nearly 1,900 injured in clashes and a military crackdown.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991986&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two Indian nationals and a Bangladeshi have been arrested in Singapore for moonlighting as barbers while on permit to work in the construction sector, according to a media report on Monday. The three accused had set up make-shift stalls on a pavement in the industrial estate of Tuas, earning 4 Singaporean dollars per haircut compared to average hair cut cost of 10 Singaporean dollars in a local barber shop.</p>
<p>Officers from both the Manpower Ministry and the National Environment Agency raided the area and arrested the three on Sunday, while others at the scene fled. The Ministry was questioning them for violating their work permit under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act. An offender in such cases faces a fine of up to 20,000 Singaporean dollars and two years in Jail. The Environment Agency was also investigating the three for offering barber services at an &#8220;inappropriate site&#8221;.</p>
<p>Under the Environmental Public Health regulations, it is an offence for an individual to act as a barber in areas such as roads, footways and back lanes. The three accused said they were moonlighting to earn extra money for themselves or their families. Indian national Das Palash Chandra, 29, said he needed the extra cash as his father fell from a coconut tree and could no longer work as a farmer back home. &#8220;I come to cut hair on Sunday to send money home to my family,&#8221; the Straits Times quoted Das as saying. &#8220;I do this job for my family.&#8221;</p>
<p>His compatriot Turuvala Viswanadham, 24, said, &#8220;I cut hair for extra money to makan (Malay for eating) and drink.&#8221; The Ministry had arrested 592 moonlighting foreign workers last year and 567 in 2012. They were either prosecuted, fined or warned.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991915&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Even as the 2014 general elections in the US are still more than eight months away, as many as 10 Indian-Americans have already announced their decision to enter the race for elected public offices, including the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Ami Bera, the only Indian-American Congressman and the third ever, is seeking re-election from the 7th Congressional District of California. Another Indian-American Kamala Harris too announced her decision to seek re-election for Attorney General of California. Republican Neel Kashkari has entered the fray for the top post of Governor of California. If elected, he would be the third ever Indian-American Governor after Bobby Jindal of Lousiana and Nikki Haley of South Carolina.</p>
<p>However, all eyes are expected to be on the 17th Congressional District of California from where Ro Khanna, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce in the Obama Administration, has thrown up a serious challenge to his own party colleague Mike Honda. Khanna has not only raised a record amount of fund, but has also taken services of the victory team of the Obama&#8217;s re-election campaign.</p>
<p>The 17th Congressional District has gained added attraction as another Indian-American Vanila Mathur Singh, an associate professor at Stanford University&#8217;s School of Medicine, has entered the fray from the Republican Party. While Singh has little chance of winning the seat, this would be for the first time that two Indian-Americans are contesting against each other from one Congressional seat. Upendra Chivukula, the first Indian-American lawmaker in the New Jersey State Assembly, this month announced his intention to try his luck for US House of Representatives from 12th Congressional District of New Jersey, which is being vacated by his own party colleague Rush Holt.</p>
<p>Chivukula would have to win the Democratic primary this summer to bag the party’s ticket for the November elections. He had lost the 2012 House elections from a different seat. Iraq war veteran Manan Trivedi has also announced to contest for the third consecutive House of Representatives election from sixth Congressional District of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Top Republican leader Paul Ryan, who was the vice presidential candidate in the 2012 elections, is receiving a serious challenge from Indian-American Amerdeep Kaleka, from the first Congressional district of Wisconsin. Kaleka is son of the president of Sikh Temple of Wisconsin Satwant Kaleka, who was shot dead by a white supremacist in a Gurdwara shootout in 2012. Swati Dandekar, the first Indian-American to be elected to Iowa House of Representatives in 2002, is seeking to enter the House of Representatives from the first Congressional District of Iowa. She has received quite a support from Indian Americans.</p>
<p>Indian-American Manju Goel is seeking election on a Republican ticket from eighth Congressional district of Illinois.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991910&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

His precise whereabouts were unknown Sunday.<br />AP
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ukraine’s new rulers, just 24 hours after ousting President Viktor Yanukovych, began speedily to unstitch his power structure on Sunday, appointing a provisional leader to replace him and sacking his key ministers.</span></p>
<p>At an emergency parliament session, they worked at breakneck pace to dismantle the coterie of ministers and cronies he had gathered around him since coming to power in 2010.</p>
<p>Yanukovych remained at an undisclosed location somewhere in eastern Ukraine, still protesting against the “bandits terrorising the country” and declaring himself a legitimate president who had fallen victim to a coup d’etat.</p>
<p>But with defections from his party now swelling opposition ranks in parliament, it found no difficulty in parliament in pushing through decisions that took to pieces the political house he had built.</p>
<p>Oleksander Turchinov was temporarily handed the role of president — a particularly bitter pill for the fugitive Yanukovych since Turchinov is a confidant of his arch-rival Yulia Tymoshenko.</p>
<p>No order was given for the detention of Yanukovych himself. His precise whereabouts were unknown Sunday.<br />
Border guards said he had tried to leave Donetsk on a chartered plane for an undisclosed destination, but he was refused permission.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991571&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A top Ukrainian opposition figure assumed presidential powers Sunday, plunging Ukraine into new uncertainty after a deadly political standoff _ and boosting long-jailed Yulia Tymoshenko&#8217;s chances at a return to power.</p>
<p>The whereabouts and legitimacy of President Viktor Yanukovych are unclear after he left the capital for his support base in eastern Ukraine. He maintains that parliament&#8217;s decisions in recent days are illegal, and a top presidential aide told The Associated Press on Sunday that he will continue to fulfill his presidential duties.</p>
<p>The newly emboldened parliament, now dominated by the opposition, struggled Sunday to work out who is in charge of the country. Fears percolated that some regions might try to break away, after three months of political crisis that has left scores of people dead in a country of strategic importance to the United States, European nations and Russia.</p>
<p>Ukraine is deeply divided between eastern regions that are largely pro-Russian and western areas that widely detest Yanukovych and long for closer ties with the European Union. Yanukovych&#8217;s shelving of an agreement with the EU in November set off the wave of protests, but they quickly expanded their grievances to corruption, human rights abuses and calls for Yanukovych&#8217;s resignation.</p>
<p>The Kiev protest camp at the center of the anti-Yanukovych movement filled with more and more dedicated demonstrators Sunday, setting up new tents after two days that saw a stunning reversal of fortune in Ukraine&#8217;s political crisis.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko, the blond-braided heroine of Ukraine&#8217;s 2004 Orange Revolution, increasingly appears to have the upper hand in the political battle, winning the backing Sunday of a leading Russian lawmaker and congratulations from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. senators on her release.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s position will be important for the future of this country, since Moscow has been providing financing to keep Ukraine&#8217;s economy afloat, and the two countries have deep but complicated ties.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s finance minister on Sunday urged Ukraine to seek a loan from the International Monetary Fund to avoid an imminent default. Russia in December offered Ukraine a $15 billion bailout, but so far has provided only $3 billion, freezing further disbursements pending the outcome of the ongoing political crisis.</p>
<p>Russian legislator Leonid Slutsky said Sunday that naming Tymoshenko prime minister &#8220;would be useful for stabilizing&#8221; the tensions in Ukraine, according to Russian news agencies.</p>
<p>Tensions mounted in Crimea, where pro-Russian politicians are organizing rallies and forming protest units and have been demanding autonomy from Kiev. Russia maintains a big naval base in Crimea that has tangled relations between the countries for two decades.</p>
<p>The political crisis in this nation of 46 million has changed with blinding speed repeatedly in the past week. First there were signs that tensions were easing, followed by horrifying violence and then a deal signed under pressure from European diplomats that aimed to resolve the conflict but left the unity of the country in question.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to catch and punish those with blood on their hands,&#8221; Artyom Zhilyansky, a 45-year-old engineer on Independence Square on Sunday, referring to those killed in clashes with police last week.</p>
<p>He and other protesters called for law enforcement chiefs to be held accountable and Yanukovych put on trial.</p>
<p>The parliament, in a special session Sunday, voted overwhelmingly to temporarily hand the president&#8217;s powers to speaker Oleksandr Turchinov, a top ally of Tymoshenko.</p>
<p>The legislators also voted to remove a string of government ministers and may name a prime minister later Sunday.  Tymoshenko&#8217;s name circulated as a strong possibility.</p>
<p>The legitimacy of the parliament&#8217;s flurry of decisions in recent days is under question. The votes are based on a decision Friday to return to a 10-year-old constitution that grants parliament greater powers. Yanukovych has not signed that decision into law, and he said Saturday that the parliament is now acting illegally.</p>
<p>However, legal experts said that de facto the parliament is now in charge.</p>
<p>Ihor Koliushko, head of the Center for Political and Legal reform, said that given the president&#8217;s absence from Kiev and the exceptional situation, &#8220;I think it would be right to say that we don&#8217;t have a head of the state, but the president&#8217;s duties are being carried out &#8230; by the head of the Verkhovna Rada,&#8221; or parliament.</p>
<p>Yanukovych, who spoke on television Saturday in Kharkiv, accused his opponents of trying to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>Presidential aide Hanna Herman told The Associated Press on Sunday that Yanukovych was in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv as of Saturday night and plans to stay in power. Still, Herman sought to distance herself from him somewhat Sunday, as did his party.</p>
<p>In Kiev&#8217;s protest camp, self-defense units that have taken control of the capital peacefully changed shifts Sunday. Helmeted and wearing makeshift shields, they have replaced police guarding the president&#8217;s administration and parliament, and have sought to stop radical forces from inflicting damage or unleashing violence.</p>
<p>Ukrainians&#8217; loyalties remain divided. Emotions mounted around statues of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin, after angry protesters took them down in several towns and cities. On Sunday, some pro-Russian protesters took up positions to defend Lenin statues in Donetsk and Kharkiv. Statues of Lenin still stand across the former U.S.S.R., and they are seen as a symbol of Moscow&#8217;s rule.</p>
<p>Parliament set new presidential elections for May 25, and Tymoshenko says she will run.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko, whose diadem of blond peasant braids and stirring rhetoric attracted world attention in the 2004 Orange Revolution, spoke late Saturday night to a crowd of about 50,000 on Kiev&#8217;s Independence Square, where a sprawling protest tent camp was set up in December. Sitting in a wheelchair because of a back problem aggravated during imprisonment, her voice cracked and her face was careworn.</p>
<p>But her words were vivid, praising the protesters who were killed this week in clashes with police that included sniper fire and entreating the living to keep the camp going.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are heroes, you are the best thing in Ukraine!&#8221; she said of the victims.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry said the death toll in clashes between protesters and police that included sniper attacks had reached 82 over the last week. The protesters put that figure at over 100.</p>
<p>European officials urged calm. Ukraine&#8217;s defense and military officials also called for Ukrainians to stay peaceful but did not clearly come on the side of the president or opposition.</p>
<p>The past week has seen the worst violence in Ukraine since the breakup of the Soviet Union a quarter-century ago. Orthodox priests held services Sunday to honor the dead.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991509&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Days after an Indian-origin father- son businessmen duo was arrested and questioned here on alleged bribery charges, a charity backed by Prince Charles seems to have distanced itself from a donation made by one of them.</p>
<p>Bhanu Choudhrie, whose family is one of the biggest donors to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg&#8217;s Liberal Democrat party, bid 75,000 pounds at a charity auction for the privilege of playing against Boris Becker and Novak Djokovic at the Buckingham Palace, The Sunday Times reported.</p>
<p>However, now Bhanu will not be invited to visit Buckingham Palace to claim the celebrity tennis match prize, the report said.</p>
<p>A week after the fundraiser organised by the British Asian Trust (BAT) at Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Choudhrie, 35, and his father, Sudhir, 64, were arrested in dawn raids in London carried out by the Serious Fraud Office.</p>
<p>They were questioned for several hours over allegations of bribery and corruption involving defence contracts won by Rolls-Royce in Asia. They both have denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The tennis prize was the most prestigious lot to go under the hammer at the high profile event attended by the Prince of Wales, who had announced the re-grouping of all his South Asian charitable efforts under the banner of the Prince&#8217;s Charities South Asia that evening.</p>
<p>The BAT is a charity set up at the Prince&#8217;s behest to raise money for causes in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Prince Charles and wife Camilla had visited some of the projects backed by the trust during an official trip to India last November.</p>
<p>A source close to the event was quoted by the daily as saying that no money had been received yet from Choudhrie and his gift would not be accepted.</p>
<p>It means the tycoon, whose business interests have included care homes, hospitals, luxury hotels and restaurants, will no longer be invited to Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>Indian-born Choudhrie, who lives in a 9 million pounds flat in Belgravia, central London, is understood to have been invited by another BAT supporter.</p>
<p>After Choudhrie had secured the prize, Becker went over to his table to congratulate him.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Choudhries said: &#8220;Both Bhanu and Sudhir deny any wrongdoing and full co-operation will be given to the authorities. As far as Bhanu is concerned, he is of course prepared to honour his donation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BAT said: &#8220;We have never accepted any donation from Bhanu Choudhrie. We did not accept a donation in connection with our recent dinner at the V&amp;A and neither have we accepted any other donation at any other time.&#8221;</p>
<p>This perceived snub is expected to put further pressure on Clegg to distance himself from the businessmen, who have given more than 1.5 million pounds to his party over the past decade.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991501&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Durrani said that according to initial reports, five kilograms of explosives were used in the blast which were planted in a wooden crate placed on the roadside. The explosives were detonated as a passenger vehicle reached Peshawar Chowk.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of the latest info tech revolution, an unprecedented number of Indian-Americans are gearing up for active participation in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.A few of the Indian-Americans have already started campaigning to get a Lok Sabha ticket from various political parties &#8211; the BJP, the Congress and the Aam Admi Party.</p>
<p>Given the initial response so far, there seems to be greater enthusiasm among the supporters of the BJP and AAP in the US. The American chapters of both the political parties have already created an army of volunteers.</p>
<p>While hundreds of them would travel to India during the election campaign period, several thousands of supporters  of both these parties would call their friends and relatives back home to vote in favor of their candidates.</p>
<p>In an effort to boost their party base, both the Overseas Friends of BJP-USA and AAP-USA over the past one month  have been holding a series of Google hangouts with their top leaders urging them expand their party base in the US, but also donate funds for election and launch phone campaigning.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a historic election. We Indian Americans need to actively participate in the general elections,&#8221; said Chandrakant Patel, president of OFBJP-USA.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian-Americans supporters of BJP and Narendra Modi would be campaigning through social media and phone calls, for which several thousands volunteers have come forward and their number is swelling every day,&#8221; he said, adding hundreds of BJP supporters are planning to travel to India for the campaign. &#8220;The voice of NRIs have a greater impact on the people,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>AAP-USA leader Pran Kurup said his party was doing frequent Google hangouts with NRIs. AAP has in fact launched a dedicated website for the Indian diaspora.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the success in Delhi assembly polls, the AAP supporters are planning to adopt Lok Sabha  constituencies.<br />
&#8220;Several volunteers&#8217; teams have been formed all across the world, including many cities in the US. These teams are self-running for the most part similar to AAP&#8217;s Swaraj concept while they are still sufficiently coordinated to share the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts from each other,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The party is also using Google hangouts for fund raising campaigns. For instance in one hangout last month, it generated donations of over Rs 20 lakhs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991403&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/afghan.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991393" alt="This Dec. 8, 2013 file-pool photo shows a solider standing guard near a military aircraft in Kandahar, Afghanistan." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/afghan.jpg" /></a> This Dec. 8, 2013 file photo shows a solider standing guard near a military aircraft in Kandahar, Afghanistan.
<p>Set to complete a decade in this run-down former power hub of the Taliban, Dr Shah Nawaz, the &#8217;lone Indian&#8217; here, is happy to serve the war-weary Afghan people in their medical needs.</p>
<p>Nawaz, 45, working at a private hospital, says he is happy to serve the people in Kandahar, the southern province of Afghanistan, also the birthplace of the Taliban movement.</p>
<p>Recalling his journey to Afghanistan, Nawaz said an Afghan businessman who was into dry fruit business had contacts with his family in India, and he often told him about the plight of people in Kandahar and their medical needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I then gave him a proposal to build a hospital. He (the businessman) was ready to invest and I expressed readiness to come to Afghanistan and serve the people,&#8221; Nawaz told PTI.</p>
<p>&#8220;People here are very simple, their needs are very limited. Actually, even basic treatment is not available,&#8221; said Nawaz, who hails from Maharashtra.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am here since August 2005. My family is not here. They are in Malaysia. I visit them twice or thrice in a year, and they come once in a year to India,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Officials said Nawaz was the only Indian working in the city apart from a handful of staff at the Indian Consulate in Kandahar city, which was the headquarters of the erstwhile Taliban regime during 1996-2001.</p>
<p>About life in Kandahar, Nawaz said though he was the only Indian working in the city, a number of his compatriots were employed in a huge US military base here.</p>
<p>Sources said the Indians working at the US base come through Dubai and are not registered with the Consulate.</p>
<p>India last week helped Afghanistan establish its first agriculture university here as part of a major capacity-building project to help the war-torn country to increase farm output and attain economic independence.</p>
<p>The Afghan National Agricultural Sciences and Technology University (ANASTU) coming up in the sprawling Tarnak farm, in the former Taliban stronghold of Kandahar, was an important activity of the India-Afghanistan strategic partnership.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Tarnak farm was slain Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden&#8217;s main Afghan residence during much of the late 1990s. From there he oversaw Al-Qaeda&#8217;s plot to fly hijacked airliners into the World Trade Centre in New York and Pentagon in Washington that killed nearly 3,000 people.</p>
<p>About city life, Nawaz said there was no night life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, there is no night life and day starts very early in morning, and he misses Indian food.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes I love Indian food very much and when I visit Delhi, I first rush to a good hotel,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any way, I have (local) cook, who can now make Indian-style food after a long training, he said.</p>
<p>Fortunately, all the satellite channels are available in Kandahar and even most of Hindi films are dubbed in Pashto.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, Sunny Deol are very popular here. But I think, all these are limited to city only, outside city there is no electricity, no TV or other forms of entertainment. The only mode of entertainment for most people is the radio,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I always interact with local people most of whom are from outside the city. They are very simple, gentle but confused. One thing peculiar about them is that they don&#8217;t trust anybody,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as you are not a party (to any side) I don&#8217;t think there is any problem. Rest is your luck,&#8221; Nawaz said when asked about the security situation in the city.</p>
<p>Afghanistan and Kandahar, in particular, has the potential of becoming an economic hub for the entire region. Kandahar city was once the hub of international cargo movements in mid 1950s and 1960s, local officials say.</p>
<p>Afghanistan is a resource-rich country. It has a unique geography that allows it to connect the markets of the Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia and China. It has one of the most hard working and enterprising people, they said.</p>
<p>Kandahar is one of the oldest cities of the world. It was the seat of power of Ahmad Shah Durrani the founder of modern Afghanistan.</p>
<p>During his recent visit here, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid emphasised that many in India believe that Kandahar is nothing but the ancient city of &#8216;Gandhara&#8217;, which figures prominently in the epic Mahabharata.</p>
<p>Indian historians have always spoken of Kandahar as the Western Gateway to the Great Mughal Empire in India.</p>
<p>Noor-jehan, the legendary wife of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, was born in Kandahar.</p>
<p>Kandahar is also one of the holiest sites in the Islamic world, housing the cloak of the Prophet at Dargah Kerqa Sharif.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991388&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/waziristan-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991389" alt="Pakistani Taliban patrol in their stronghold of Shawal in Pakistani tribal region of South Waziristan.

<p>Nearly 50,000 Pakistani tribesmen have fled the lawless North Waziristan Agency since last month as fears of a military operation in the area grew after air strikes on suspected militant hideouts, a media report said on Sunday. A large number of tribesmen have started migrating from Saidgi, Bangi Dar in North Waziristan and other areas besides villages in the agency headquarters of Miramshah.</p>
<p>However, Political Agent Siraj Ahmad Khan told journalists that he had directed administration officials to tell the tribesmen not to leave the agency as there was no fear of an operation. &#8220;A military operation is not imminent and there is no need for the tribesmen to flee,&#8221; Siraj claimed. The exact number of people evacuating could not be ascertained. Administration officials also declined to comment, as some remain in denial that there is a mass exodus taking place.</p>
<p>However, local tribesmen told The Express Tribune daily that nearly 50,000 tribesmen have fled the agency since last month. While some officials dismiss the evacuation as &#8216;routine&#8217; and say that the tribesmen will return after a month, the vehicle stands at Miramshah Bazaar, Ghulam Khan Tehsil and Mirali Bazaar reveal a contrary situation, the daily said.</p>
<p>North Waziristan is one of seven semi-autonomous regions in Pakistan&#8217;s Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) bordering Afghanistan and governed by tribal laws. The exodus of people comes in the backdrop of stalled peace dialogue and the military’s targeted air strikes against the militants in the tribal areas.</p>
<p>While the government seems to still hope for a peace dialogue with the Taliban, it was forced to sanction the limited air strikes following the beheading of 23 Frontier Corps personnel. Analysts see the air strikes as a morale booster move for the security forces, which has been targeted by the Taliban repeatedly in the recent past despite peace parleys between the banned group and the government.</p>
<p>Government sources have maintained that they are still in support of dialogue and the air strikes should not be seen as beginning of a full-fledged military operation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991385&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a horrific act of cruelty, a UK woman killed her pet cat by cooking it in a microwave because she thought it had eaten her goldfish. Twenty-three-year-old Laura Cunliffe pleaded guilty to putting her four-month-old pet Mowgli in the microwave for five minutes after it apparently attacked her goldfish.</p>
<p>Cunliffe, from Hoyland, northern England, then removed the kitten from the appliance where the suffering animal was still alive. The cat died about 90 minutes later after it was removed from the oven, &#8216;Metro&#8217; reported. The kitten had its internal organs cooked, a court heard. &#8220;The kitten was in a distressed state when Miss Cunliffe took it out of the oven,&#8221; said Brian Orsborn, prosecuting for The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA).</p>
<p>&#8220;(It) could not get its breath and died about 90 minutes later,&#8221; said Orsborn. The report said Cunliffe will be sentenced next month after pleading guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991365&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jay-carney-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988155" alt="The White House wants a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine protests. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jay-carney-480.jpg" /></a> The White House wants a peaceful resolution to the Ukraine protests.
<p>The White House has urged Ukraine to move swiftly to form a unity government and help restore order after a spate of deadly violence. Months of protests turned violent this week, with scores killed in clashes between demonstrators and police. Under a European-mediated plan, protest leaders and President Viktor Yanukovych agreed on Friday to form a new government and hold early elections. Parliament slashed the president&#8217;s powers and voted to release his chief rival, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, from prison.</p>
<p>By Saturday, protesters had taken over the capital of Kiev and seized the president&#8217;s office as parliament voted to remove him and hold new elections. Yanukovych called it a coup and insisted he would not step down. In urging calm, White House press secretary Jay Carney said the US urged the prompt formation of a broad, technocratic government of national unity. &#8220;We have consistently advocated a de-escalation of violence, constitutional change, a coalition government, and early elections, and today&#8217;s developments could move us closer to that goal,&#8221; Carney said in a statement. &#8220;The unshakeable principle guiding events must be that the people of Ukraine determine their own future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The US also welcomed Tymoshenko&#8217;s release from a prison hospital. &#8220;We continue to urge an end to violence by all sides and a focus on peaceful, democratic dialogue, working pursuant to Ukraine&#8217;s constitution and through its institutions of government,&#8221; Carney said, adding that the US will continue to work with its allies, Russia, and European and international organisations &#8220;to support a strong, prosperous, unified, and democratic Ukraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Protesters took to the streets of Kiev late last year after Yanukovych abandoned an agreement that would have strengthen his country&#8217;s ties with the European Union in favour of seeking closer cooperation with Moscow. Carney said the Ukrainian people should know that the US values its long-standing ties with their country and will support them as they pursue democracy and economic development.</p>
<p>Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed on the need to resolve the situation without violence when they spoke over the phone on Saturday afternoon, the State Department said in a statement. Kerry &#8220;expressed the importance of encouraging Ukraine to move forward on a path towards constitutional change, de-escalation, the creation of a coalition government, early elections and rejection of violence,&#8221; the State Department said in describing the call.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991345&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Taliban stormed an Afghan army outpost in the eastern Kunar province bordering Pakistan early today, killing 20 soldiers and kidnapping seven, an official said. The volatile border area is dominated by militants who often use improvised explosive devices to target soldiers, but today&#8217;s attack saw the highest casualty count in a single incident in recent months.</p>
<p>The attack occurred in the Ghaziabad district of Kunar province, provincial governor Shujah-Ul Mulk Jalala told AFP. The Taliban later issued a statement claiming responsibility. The governor said &#8220;some&#8221; of the soldiers in the post were thought to have aided the attackers, though this could not be verified by an independent source and the Taliban did not mention insider help in their statement.</p>
<p>A hunt was underway to release the kidnapped troopers, a defence ministry official in Kabul said. Casualties among Afghan soldiers and police have increased in recent years as they take more responsibility in the fight against insurgents before their Western allies, the US and NATO troops, leave under a US plan by the end of the year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991338&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/thailand-4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991334" alt="Thai policewomen march while guarding the Command Management for Peace and Order. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/thailand-4801.jpg" /></a> Thai policewomen march while guarding the Command Management for Peace and Order. (AP)
<p>Gunmen in a pickup truck attacked an anti-government protest in Thailand&#8217;s east, killing at least one, an 8-year-old girl, and wounding dozens, as violence in the country&#8217;s 3-month-old political crisis spread outside the capital, Bangkok, officials said Sunday. The attack took place on Saturday night in Trat province, about 300 kilometers (180 miles) east of Bangkok, where about 500 protesters demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra were holding a rally near food stalls.</p>
<p>Thai media reported that as many as three people were killed and several others are in critical condition, but National Security Council chief Lt. Gen. Paradorn Pattanathuabutr so far confirmed one fatality &#8211; an 8-year-old girl.  An employee of Trat Hospital, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to release information, said one victim brought there had died.</p>
<p>The attack was the latest in a string of protest-related violence roiling Thailand over the past three months, in which at least 16 people have been killed and hundreds hurt. The protesters want  Yingluck to quit to make way for an appointed interim government to implement anti-corruption reforms, but she has refused.  Police Lt. Thanabhum Newanit said unidentified assailants in a pickup shot into the crowd and two explosive devices went off. It was not clear if the protest group, which uses armed guards, fought back. He and other officials said that about three dozen people were hurt.</p>
<p>Both supporters and opponents of the protest group called the People&#8217;s Democratic Reform Committee, as well as police, have been victims of the political violence, which before Saturday was mostly confined to the Thai capital. On Friday night, six people were hurt when unknown attackers threw a grenade into a protest crowd in Bangkok. Both sides in the ongoing political dispute have blamed the other for instigating violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point we do not know who was behind the attack, but there are several factors to take into account in the investigation,&#8221; Paradorn said. He added that the protesters in Trat have been rallying for a long time, &#8220;so they might have caused disturbance to others. And that area is controlled by groups that are affiliated with the anti-government side,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Thailand has been engaged in a violent political conflict since 2006, when then-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Yingluck&#8217;s brother, was ousted by a military coup after being accused of corruption and abuse of power. Thaksin&#8217;s supporters and opponents have since then taken to the streets for extended periods in a power struggle. In 2010, pro-Thaksin &#8220;Red Shirts&#8221; occupied part of Bangkok for two months. When the army was called out to control them, more than 90 people were killed in violent confrontations.</p>
<p>The Red Shirts have mostly kept a low profile during the current political unrest, but as Yingluck faces what her supporters feel are unfair court rulings loosening her grip on power, there are fears they will take to the streets again. The courts are widely seen as being based against Thaksin&#8217;s political machine. Thaksin and his allies have won every national election since 2001, with his sister taking office in 2011 with a majority of parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>Yingluck called early elections to try to reaffirm her mandate, but the protesters disrupted February polling, which has yet to be completed, leaving Thailand with a caretaker government. She also faces several legal challenges that could oust her from office. Thaksin&#8217;s opponents claim he unfairly uses money politics and populist policies to dominate Thai politics. A spokesman for the opposition Democrat Party, which is closely allied with the protest group and boycotted the election, condemned the latest attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is something we have expected because the government has no way to go, so they have to resort to violence,&#8221; said Chavanond Intarakomalyasut. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say precisely that the government is behind the attack, but whoever did it was on the government&#8217;s side.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991333&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukraine-4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991291" alt="Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych was stopped at the airport to prevent him from flying out.

<p>Ukraine&#8217;s border control service have claimed that aides to President Viktor Yanukovych tried to bribe border guards to let him fly out of the country, but he was prevented from leaving. &#8220;A private plane due to fly out of Donetsk airport did not have the correct paperwork. When officials arrived to check the documentation they were met by armed people who offered them money to fly out urgently,&#8221; border service spokesman Serhiy Astahov told AFP on Saturday, adding that border guards refused the offer.</p>
<p>&#8220;After some time two armoured vehicles pulled up at the plane and the president emerged and left the airport,&#8221; Astahov said. He said officials did not know the planned destination of the plane. There was no independent confirmation of Astahov&#8217;s account. Yanukovych was seen in a televised interview said to be recorded in east Ukraine on Saturday stating: &#8220;I am not leaving the country for anywhere. I do not intend to resign. I am the legitimately elected president.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parliament yesterday voted to oust Yanukovych after scores of demonstrators were shot dead by policemen this week as three months of anti-government protests in Kiev spiralled into deadly conflict. Newly elected parliament speaker Oleksandr Turchyno claimed the embattled president had tried unsuccessfully to flee Russia and was &#8220;hiding&#8221; in Donetsk.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991290&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mexico-drug-lord-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991267" alt="Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by Mexican navy marines. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mexico-drug-lord-480.jpg" /></a> Joaquin &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzman is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by Mexican navy marines. (AP)
<p>Mexican authorities captured the world&#8217;s most powerful drug lord in a resort city on Saturday after a massive search through the home state of the legendary capo whose global organisation is the leading supplier of cocaine to the United States. Joaquin &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzman, 56, looked pudgy, bowed and much like his wanted photos when he arrived in Mexico City from Mazatlan in Sinaloa state. He was accompanied by masked marines across the airport tarmac to a helicopter waiting to whisk him to jail.</p>
<p>Mexican marines arrested Guzman at 6:40 a.m. in a high-rise condominium fronting the Pacific without firing a single shot. Mexican officials late on Saturday said he was apprehended with a man identified as Carlos Manuel Hoo Ramirez, contradicting earlier reports that he was arrested with a woman. An American official said that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Marshals Service were &#8220;heavily involved&#8221; in the capture.</p>
<p>Another federal law enforcement official said intelligence from a Homeland Security Department investigation also helped lead U.S. and Mexican authorities to his whereabouts. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to journalists. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called the capture a &#8220;victory for the citizens of both Mexico and the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mexican authorities, based on a series of arrests in recent months, got wind that Guzman was moving around Culiacan, capital of his home state for which the cartel is named. Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam described an operation that took place between Feb. 13 and 17 focused on seven homes connected by tunnels and to the city&#8217;s sewer system. He said they had Guzman in their sights several times during that period, but were unable to mount an operation earlier because of possible risks to the general public. The house doors were reinforced with steel, which delayed entry by law enforcement, presumably allowing Guzman to flee several attempts at his capture before Saturday.</p>
<p>A U.S. law enforcement official said members of Guzman&#8217;s security team helped Mexican and U.S. authorities find him after they were arrested earlier this month. The official was not authorised to discuss details of the case by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. Guzman faces multiple federal drug trafficking indictments in the U.S. and is on the DEA&#8217;s most-wanted list. His drug empire stretches throughout North America and reaches as far away as Europe and Australia. His cartel has been heavily involved in the bloody drug war that has torn through parts of Mexico for the last several years.</p>
<p>His arrest followed the takedown of several top Sinaloa operatives in the last few months and at least 10 mid-level cartel members in the last week. Michael S. Vigil, a former senior DEA official who was briefed on the operation, said the Mexican navy raided the Culiacan house of Guzman&#8217;s ex-wife, Griselda Lopez, earlier this week and found a cache of weapons and a tunnel in one of the rooms that led to the city&#8217;s sewer system, leading authorities to believe Guzman barely escaped, Vigil said.</p>
<p>As more people were arrested, more homes were raided. &#8220;It became like a nuclear explosion where the mushroom started to expand throughout the city of Culiacan,&#8221; Vigil said. Authorities learned that Guzman fled to nearby Mazatlan. He was arrested at the Miramar condominiums, a 10-story, pearl-coloured building with white balconies overlooking the Pacific and a small pool in front. The building is one of dozens of relatively modest, upper-middle-class developments on the Mazatlan coastal promenade.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got tired of living up in the mountains and not being able to enjoy the comforts of his wealth. He became complacent and starting coming into the city of Culiacan and Mazatlan. That was a fatal error,&#8221; said Vigil. Vigil said Mexico may decide to extradite Guzman to the U.S. to avoid any possibility that he escapes from prison again, as he did in 2001 in a laundry truck &#8211; a feat that fed his larger-than-life persona.</p>
<p>It would be a massive black eye on the (Mexican) government if he is able to escape again. That&#8217;s the only reason they would turn him over,&#8221; Vigil said. Because insiders aided his escape, rumours circulated for years that he was helped and protected by former President Felipe Calderon&#8217;s government, which vanquished some of his top rivals. In the bilateral assault on organised crime and Mexican drug cartels, Sinaloa had not only been relatively unscathed, but has seen its enemies go down at the hands of the government.</p>
<p>Aggressive assaults by the Mexican military and federal police have all but dismantled the leadership of the Beltran Leyva and Zetas cartels, both huge rivals of Sinaloa, as well as the La Linea gang fighting Sinaloa for control of the border city of Ciudad Juarez. Calderon congratulated Pena Nieto on the capture on Saturday via his Twitter account. Many also noted the huge boost that capture gave to the credibility of the Pena Nieto government, whose commitment to fighting organised crime has been questioned since he took office in late 2012.</p>
<p>But there were rumours circulating for months that a major operation was underway to take down the Sinaloa cartel. Zambada&#8217;s son was arrested in November after entering Arizona, where he had an appointment with U.S. immigration authorities to arrange legal status for his wife. The following month, Zambada&#8217;s main lieutenant was killed as Mexican helicopter gunships sprayed bullets at his mansion in the Gulf of California resort of Puerto Penasco in a four-hour gunbattle. Days later, police in the Netherlands arrested a flamboyant top enforcer for Zambada as he arrived in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>But experts predict that as long as Guzman&#8217;s partner, Ismael &#8220;El Mayo&#8221; Zambada is at large, the cartel will continue business as usual. &#8220;The take-down of Joaquin &#8216;El Chapo&#8217; Guzman Loera is a thorn in the side of the Sinaloa Cartel, but not a dagger in its heart,&#8221; said College of William and Mary government professor George Grayson, who studies Mexico&#8217;s cartels. &#8220;Zambada &#8230; will step into El Chapo&#8217;s boots. He is also allied with Juan Jose &#8216;El Azul&#8217; Esparragoza Moreno, one of most astute lords in Mexico&#8217;s underworld and, by far, its best negotiator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rumours had long circulated that Guzman was hiding everywhere from Argentina and Guatemala to almost every corner of Mexico, especially its &#8220;Golden Triangle,&#8221; a mountainous, marijuana-growing region straddling the northern states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua. In more than a decade on the run, Guzman transformed himself from a middling Mexican capo into arguably the most powerful drug trafficker in the world. His fortune has grown to more than $1 billion, according to Forbes magazine, which listed him among the &#8220;World&#8217;s Most Powerful People&#8221; and ranked him above the presidents of France and Venezuela.</p>
<p>His Sinaloa Cartel grew bloodier and more powerful, taking over much of the lucrative trafficking routes along the U.S. border, including such prized cities as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Guzman&#8217;s play for power against local cartels caused a bloodbath in Tijuana and made Juarez one of the deadliest cities in the world. In little more than a year, Mexico&#8217;s biggest marijuana bust, 134 tons, and its biggest cultivation were tied to Sinaloa, as were a giant underground methamphetamine lab in western Mexico and hundreds of tons of precursor chemicals seized in Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>His cartel&#8217;s tentacles now extend as far as Australia thanks to a sophisticated, international distribution system for cocaine and methamphetamine. Guzman did all that with a $7 million bounty on his head and while evading thousands of law enforcement agents from the U.S. and other countries devoted to his capture. A US federal indictment unsealed in San Diego in 1995 charges Guzman and 22 members of his organization with conspiracy to import over eight tons of cocaine and money laundering. A provisional arrest warrant was issued as a result of the indictment, according to the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>He also has been indicted by federal authorities in the United States several times since 1996. The charges include allegations that he and others conspired to smuggle &#8220;multi-ton quantities&#8221; of cocaine into the U.S. and used violence, including murder, kidnapping and torture to keep the smuggling operation running.

<p>Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was freed Saturday during the dramatic ouster of her arch enemy Viktor Yanukovich, setting up a possible run for the presidency in May.</p>
<p>Sporting her distinctive blonde braid, the 53-year-old former prime minister was driven out of the hospital in the northeastern city of Kharkiv where she had spent much of her confinement since 2011.</p>
<p>She waved to supporters, who chanted “Yulia, Yulia!”</p>
<p>“Our homeland will from today on be able to see the sun and sky as a dictatorship has ended,” she told reporters.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko’s Fatherland party said she would go to Kiev’s Independence Square, scene of nearly three months of protests against Yanukovich after he spurned a deal on closer ties with the European Union in favour of former Soviet master Moscow.</p>
<p>Seventy-seven people were killed in two days of carnage on and around the square this week.</p>
<p>Regretting the deaths of anti-Yanukovich protesters in gun battles and clashes with police, Tymoshenko said everything must be done so that “each drop of blood was not spilled in vain.”</p>
<p>Tymoshenko was jailed in 2011 for abuse of office over a gas deal with Russia but her supporters and Western leaders regarded her as a political prisoner.</p>
<p>A fiery orator, Tymoshenko shot to fame during the 2004-05 Orange Revolution that overturned a rigged election won by Yanukovich. She became prime minister, but was forced out after Yanukovich beat her to the presidency in 2010.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991143&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukrainem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991141" alt="Opposition members celebrate Yanukovych’s removal. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukrainem.jpg" /></a> Opposition members celebrate Yanukovych’s removal. (AP)
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s parliament voted on Saturday to remove President Viktor Yanukovich, who abandoned his Kiev office to protesters and denounced what he described as a coup after a week of fighting in the streets of the capital.</p>
<p>Parliament also freed his arch-nemesis, former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who walked free from the hospital where she had been jailed, completing a radical transformation in the former Soviet republic of 46 million people.</p>
<p>The apparent toppling of the pro-Russian leader, after bloodshed in Kiev that saw 82 people killed and the centre of the capital transformed into an inferno, looks likely to pull Ukraine away from Moscow&#8217;s orbit and closer to Europe.</p>
<p>It is also a stark reversal for Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s dream of recreating as much as possible of the Soviet Union in a new Eurasian Union, in which Moscow had counted on Yanukovich to deliver Ukraine as a central member.</p>
<p>Members of the Ukrainian parliament, which abandoned Yanukovich after this week&#8217;s bloodshed, stood, applauded and sang the national anthem after it declared the president constitutionally unable to carry out his duties and set an early election for May 25.</p>
<p><strong>POLITICAL KNOCKOUT</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;This is a political knockout,&#8221; opposition leader and retired world boxing champion Vitaly Klitschko told reporters.<br />
Moments later, opposition leader Tymoshenko waved to supporters from a car as she was driven out of the hospital in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, where she has been treated for a bad back while serving a seven-year sentence since 2011.<br />
In a television interview which the station said was also conducted in Kharkiv, Yanukovich said he would not resign or leave the country, and called decisions by parliament &#8220;illegal&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The events witnessed by our country and the whole world  are an example of a coup d&#8217;etat,&#8221; he said, comparing it to the rise of the Nazis to power in Germany in the 1930s. He said he had also come under fire. &#8220;My car was shot at. I am not afraid. I feel sorrow for my country,&#8221; he told UBR television.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said Yanukovich was refused exit from the country by border guards when he tried to fly out from the city of Donetsk.</p>
<p>At Yanukovich&#8217;s abandoned secret estate near Kiev, people flocked to take photographs of his private zoo with ostriches and deer, replica ancient Greek ruins, and lavish waterways and follies.</p>
<p>Despite Yanukovich&#8217;s defiance, the dismantling of his authority seemed all but complete, with his cabinet promising a transition to a new government, the police declaring themselves behind the protesters and his arch-rival Tymoshenko going free.</p>
<p>Setting herself immediately on a collision course with Moscow, Tymoshenko said she was sure her country would join the European Union in the near future. Her release was welcomed by Washington.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said &#8220;illegal extremist groups are refusing to disarm and in fact are taking Kiev under their control with the connivance of opposition leaders&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;DON&#8217;T STOP YET&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>As night fell, 30,000 opposition supporters on Kiev&#8217;s Independence Square, scene of nearly three months of protests, were in buoyant mood. &#8220;People can taste freedom and take off their flak jackets,&#8221; said Vasily, 40, a builder.</p>
<p>There was sadness too as coffins were displayed in front of the crowd and priests said prayers. People crossed themselves in front of makeshift shrines with candles and pictures of the dead. Two captured water cannon trucks were parked in the square like trophies of war.</p>
<p>In an emotional speech after she was carried on to a stage in a wheelchair, Tymoshenko told the protesters on the square, known as the Maidan: &#8220;You have no right to leave the Maidan &#8230; Don&#8217;t stop yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ukrainian cabinet said it was committed to a responsible transfer of power.</p>
<p>Ukrainian military and police leaders said they would not get involved in any internal conflict. The interior ministry responsible for the police said it served &#8220;exclusively the Ukrainian people and fully shares their strong desire for speedy change&#8221;.</p>
<p>Yanukovich, who enraged much of the population by turning away from the European Union to cultivate closer relations with Russia three months ago, made sweeping concessions in a deal brokered by European diplomats on Friday after days of street battles that saw police snipers gun down protesters.</p>
<p>But the deal, which called for early elections by the end of the year, was not enough to satisfy pro-Europe demonstrators on Independence Square, who wanted Yanukovich out immediately in the wake of the bloodletting.<br />
On Saturday, the speaker of parliament, a Yanukovich loyalist, resigned and parliament elected Oleksander Turchynov, a close ally of Tymoshenko, as his replacement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today he left the capital,&#8221; Klitschko said of Yanukovich at an emergency session of parliament. &#8220;Millions of Ukrainians see only one choice &#8211; early presidential and parliamentary elections.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991139&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Abandoned by his own guards and reviled across the Ukrainian capital but still determined to recover his shredded authority, President Viktor F Yanukovych fled Kiev Saturday to denounce what he called a violent coup, as his official residence, his vast, colonnaded office complex and other once impregnable centres of power fell without a fight to throngs of joyous citizens stunned by their triumph.</p>
<p>As President Yanukovych’s nemesis, former Prime Minister Yulia V Tymoshenko, was released from a penitentiary hospital, Parliament found the president unable to fulfil his duties and exercised its constitutional powers to set an election for May 25 to select his replacement.</p>
<p>In the capital, protesters carrying clubs and some wearing masks were in control of the entryways to the presidential palace Saturday morning.</p>
<p>“This commences a new life for Ukraine,” said Roman Dakus, a protester-turned-guard. “This is only a start,” he added.<br />
A pugnacious Yanukovych surfaced on television Saturday afternoon, apparently from the eastern city of Kharkiv, near Ukraine’s eastern border with Russia, saying he had been forced to leave the capital because of a “coup,” and that he had not resigned, and had no plans to. He said his car had been fired upon as he drove away.</p>
<p>“I don’t plan to leave the country. I don’t plan to resign,” he said. “I am a legitimately elected president.” He added: “What is happening today, mostly, it is vandalism, banditism and a coup d’état.”</p>
<p>With security officers having disappeared from the streets, protesters claimed to have established control over Kiev. By Saturday morning, they had secured key intersections of the city and the government district of the capital, which riot police officers had fled, leaving behind burned military trucks, mattresses and heaps of garbage at the positions they had occupied for months.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991137&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[In a country with not too many entrepreneurs, the show finds takers<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991092&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was the final episode, broadcast live from Khartoum’s 18-storey Corinthia Hotel tower, built by Moammar Gadhafi of Libya. On stage, the five contestants, three men and two women, waited anxiously.</p>
<p>The show, Mashrouy, is Sudan’s version of The Apprentice, and at a time of national economic hardship, it has kindled the imagination of Sudanese youths. Friends gathered at homes to watch the evening episodes and rooted for their favourite contestants. For many viewers of Arab satellite programmes or the unengaging, monotone shows that local television stations often broadcast, it was a welcome change.</p>
<p>“I followed the show from the beginning,” said Khalid Muhammad Khalid, 22, a university student. “It was an inspiration.”<br />
Sudan’s economy has been suffering since South Sudan split off and became an independent nation in 2011, taking with it nearly 75 per cent of Sudan’s oil revenues. The country’s economy has shrunk, the value of the Sudanese pound has deteriorated, unemployment is on the rise and thousands of professionals have left for opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate among Sudan’s youth is one of the reasons behind the anti-government protests in September.</p>
<p>But some see an option that might help improve the economic fortunes of Sudanese youths by changing long-held presumptions about work and promoting the idea of entrepreneurship. “It is not culturally given a high status,” said Ahmed Amin Abdelatif, 40, head of a family-owned company and chairman of the Sudanese Young Businessmen Association. “Many would say, ‘Why not get a proper job?’.”</p>
<p>Challenging that mindset is what Abdelatif and several local businessmen sought out to do. Hence, the birth last year of Mashrouy. Arabic for “my project”, it was promoted through a campaign that focused on Sudanese youths. The campaign brought in an initial 2,500 applicants for the show. A panel of experts whittled them down to 12.</p>
<p>Samah al-Gadi, 32, said she was not too enthusiastic about appearing on the show at first but submitted her Mashrouy application on the last possible day, at her mother’s insistence. She was also dissatisfied with her routine and limiting office work, so with her academic background in social development and agriculture, she proposed a project to help communities living along riverbanks solve a nasty problem and profit from it.</p>
<p>Water hyacinth is a weedlike aquatic plant that grows in the White Nile River south of Khartoum. The plant can multiply quickly and cover large water surfaces. It obstructs river transport and attracts mosquitoes and parasites that cause bilharzia.</p>
<p>Al-Gadi offered a new approach: “Local communities can remove it manually, let it dry, braid it, and make ropes, bags and furniture.” Mazin Merghani, 24, a university graduate, put forward another agricultural idea.</p>
<p>Back at the hotel, guests, including diplomats, businessmen, sat eagerly around dinner tables for the finale a few weeks ago. Al-Gadi was finally chosen the winner by a television audience that submitted votes online.</p>
<p>The contest’s top three winners each won money — first place was about $25,000 — and were flown to London, where they will get to meet British entrepreneurs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991092&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[McGuire’s music evolved from punk to a mix that draws deeply on New Age. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991090&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A sign on the door of Body Actualised Centre in Bushwick, Brooklyn, promised ‘Cosmic Yoga’, but on a recent snowy night, a crowd had gathered for a concert. Slushy boots were confiscated in the lobby, and about 75 patrons in their 20s and 30s sat cross-legged on pillows or reclined on blankets on the floor. The space was lit, just barely, by botanica candles, placed amid potted trees and colourful crystals. The aroma of incense permeated the room.</p>
<p>In front of them, Mark McGuire, the former guitarist of Emeralds, stood behind two synthesisers, summoning a pleasant drone. While some closed their eyes and rocked gently, McGuire added a crackly recording of a lecture on The Universe According to Esoteric Philosophy by the mystic Manly P Hall. Eventually, McGuire began to loop a phrase of Hall’s — “The only reason for existence is this perpetual growth” — until the words were distorted beyond recognition. Then he began to play guitar over it, first fluid and crystalline, then fiery and molten.</p>
<p>McGuire, 27, began his career in the Midwestern hardcore punk scenes. He’s one of several musicians whose music reflects a confluence of psychedelia, electronic music and the eccentric cousin of those genres — New Age. A generation of younger musicians with an affinity for analogue electronics has re-examined this long-derided category , borrowing liberally from New Age’s sonic palette: hypnotic repetition, spacey guitar noodling and soft synths.</p>
<p>Elements of New Age can be found among a diverse range of artists, including Julianna Barwick, Sun Araw, Bitchin Bajas, Matthewdavid and Greyghost. “New-age music now has the contemporary electronic underground and the noise underground infused in it,” McGuire said.</p>
<p>At the same time, New Age pioneers from the late 1970s are being rediscovered through a series of reissues, including Celestial Soul Portrait, a collection showcasing the electric flute improviser Iasos, and several volumes by the zither player Laraaji, including Essence/Universe and Celestial Music: 1978-2011.</p>
<p>Perhaps most audacious is the compilation I Am the Centre:1950-1990, which posits the genre as “great American folk art”. It was overseen by Douglas Mcgowan, a 37-year-old label proprietor who made proselytising for New Age a personal crusade.<br />
“I saw in New Age this way to help people re-establish a sense of wonder,” Mcgowan said. “That’s so pretentious sounding, but that’s how I honestly feel.”</p>
<p>Mcgowan defines New Age as “the sound of contentment and peace”. On the other hand, Stephen Hill, the host of Hearts of Space (a long-running nationally syndicated public radio show devoted to “Slow music for fast times”), is more circumspect. “Originally, it was every kind of unclassifiable music, just because it filled a categorical need in a record store,” he said. Hill prefers the term “spacemusic”.</p>
<p>It’s difficult today to separate new age music from the culture that nurtured it, a post-hippie hodgepodge of Western self-help and Eastern mysticism. The serene recordings, often intended as meditation tracks, are the opposite of the beat-heavy tracks of today’s producers of electronic dance music.</p>
<p>According to McGuire, the theme of his new album Along the Way (released this month), is “self-exploration and exploration of the world around you”.</p>
<p>Hill sees New Age’s appeal as timeless. “It’s been really essential in religious, sacred and contemplative music for thousands of years, so I think the value of it is in the psychological payoff that people who are receptive to it experience,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991090&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Sheryl Sandberg’s LeanIn.org is partnering with Getty Images to represent women in more empowering ways and to overcome stereotypes<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991089&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THERE is the businesswoman, wearing a suit and glasses and holding a briefcase. There is the mother, smiling as she pours milk into her children’s cereal bowls at the breakfast table. There is the multitasker, holding a laptop in one hand and a baby in the other.</p>
<p>These stock images are familiar to anyone who has seen an advertisement or flipped through a magazine or brochure illustrating working women and families. And their ubiquity is hurting girls and women by feeding into old-fashioned stereotypes, says Sheryl Sandberg, a Facebook executive who has become an advocate for women achieving leadership roles.</p>
<p>To try to remedy the problem, Sandberg’s non-profit organisation, LeanIn.org, has partnered with Getty Images, one of the biggest providers of stock photography, to offer a special collection of images that it says represent women and families in more empowering ways. “Images of women and girls and men often fall into the stereotypes that we’re trying to overcome, and you can’t be what you can’t see,” Sandberg said.</p>
<p>The new library of photos shows professional women as surgeons, painters, bakers, soldiers and hunters. There are girls riding skateboards, women lifting weights and fathers changing babies’ diapers. Women in offices wear contemporary clothes and hairstyles and hold tablets or smartphones — a far cry from the typical stock photos of women in 1980s power suits with a briefcase.</p>
<p>The partnership comes during a renewed conversation about women and work, spurred in part by Sandberg’s book, Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead. Its message has the potential to reach a wide area of society, through Getty’s 2.4 million customers who pull from its library of 150 million images. The three most-searched terms in Getty’s image database, incidentally, are “women”, “business” and “family”.</p>
<p>“One of the quickest ways to make people think differently about something is to change the visuals around it,” said Cindy Gallop, who started the US branch of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, the advertising agency. “These images work on an unconscious level to reinforce what people think people should be like.”</p>
<p>The partnership is a way for Lean In to broaden its reach after criticism that Sandberg’s advice is relevant only to women in corporate America and that she places the burden of breaking through stereotypes on women, instead of on workplaces and society.</p>
<p>People at Getty and Lean In, led by Pam Grossman, Getty’s director of research, chose 2,500 images, a quarter of which are new to the photo agency. They plan to continue to add photos to the library.</p>
<p>The initiative is particularly important right now, said Jonathan Klein, co-founder and chief executive of Getty, because of the surge of image-based communication that has arisen from smartphone cameras and sites and apps such as Pinterest and Instagram. “Imagery has become the communication medium of this generation, and that really means how people are portrayed visually is going to have more influence,” Klein said.</p>
<p>Getty has previously added new types of photos to reflect changes in society — adding, for example, more pictures of older people doing physical activities. This is the first time Getty has jointly created a collection with a non-profit. Ten per cent of the revenue from the photos will go to LeanIn.org.</p>
<p>The issue of how the media visually depicts women in leadership has bubbled up periodically in recent years. Last month, for instance, a Time magazine cover piece about Hillary Clinton showed an enormous high heel stepping on a tiny man. The much-discussed 2012 Atlantic cover article about working mothers was illustrated by a woman carrying a briefcase with a baby crawling out. The stereotypical women in stock photos have also become an Internet meme, inspiring parodies such as “Feminism, According to Stock Photography (women in suits climbing ladders and wearing red boxing gloves)” and “Women Laughing Alone With Salad”.</p>
<p>“At Facebook, I think about the role marketing plays in all this, because marketing is both reflective of our stereotypes and reinforces stereotypes,” Sandberg said. “Do we partner into sexism or do we partner against sexism?”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991089&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych denied today that he planned to resign in response to violence that left nearly 100 people dead in anti-government unrest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not leaving the country for anywhere. I do not intend to resign. I am the legitimately elected president,&#8221; Yanukovych told a local television station in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.</p>
<p>The embattled leader said he felt that his own security and the safety &#8220;of people close to me&#8221; was being threatened by protesters who had taken control of large parts of central Kiev.</p>
<p>He added that he had been given &#8220;security guarantees&#8221; by international mediators who helped him and the opposition sign a political pact on Friday aimed at ending the country&#8217;s three-month crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;My car was shot at. But I have no fear,&#8221; Yanukovych said. He added that &#8220;everything happening today can primarily be described as vandalism, banditry and a coup d&#8217;etat. That is my assessment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not an opposition,&#8221; Yanukovych added. &#8220;These are bandits.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991002&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Afghan Taliban on Friday called for an end to violence against Muslims in the Central African Republic in a rare statement on conflicts outside their region.</p>
<p>Central African Republic has been wracked by sectarian violence, with Christian armed fighters hunting down and killing Muslim civilians in recent weeks despite the presence of thousands of peacekeepers.</p>
<p>The violence has displaced tens of thousands of Muslims in what the United Nations human rights body has called &#8220;ethnic-religious cleansing.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement on Saturday, the Taliban condemned the &#8220;merciless killings&#8221; of Muslims at the hands of &#8220;bloodthirsty militias&#8221; as the world sits &#8220;idly by.&#8221;</p>
<p>It warned the situation threatens the peaceful coexistence of Muslims and Christians throughout Africa and urged the international community including the pope to stop the bloodshed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990997&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/yulia.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990979" alt="In this Monday July 11, 2011 file photo former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko during a trial hearing at the Pecherskiy District Court in Kiev." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/yulia.jpg" /></a> In this Monday July 11, 2011 file photo former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko during a trial hearing at the Pecherskiy District Court in Kiev.
<p>The regime of Ukraine&#8217;s president appeared close to collapse today as the emboldened opposition took control of central Kiev and key government and parliament positions and voted to immediately free its jailed leader Yulia Tymoshenko.</p>
<p>An emerging power vacuum gripped the charred heart of the capital a day after Viktor Yanukovych and his political rivals signed a Western-brokered peace deal to end the ex-Soviet nation&#8217;s worst crisis since independence from Moscow in 1991.</p>
<p>Key government buildings were without police protection and baton-armed protesters dressed in military fatigues wandered freely across the president&#8217;s once-fortified compound.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have taken the perimeter of the president&#8217;s residence under our control for security reasons,&#8221; Mykola Velichkovich of the opposition&#8217;s self-declared Independence Square defence unit told AFP.</p>
<p>Thousands of mourners meanwhile brought carnations and roses to dozens of spots across Kiev&#8217;s iconic Independence Square on which protesters were shot dead by police in a week of carnage that claimed nearly 100 lives.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian police appeared to retreat today from their entrenched defence of the pro-Russian government by releasing a statement in support of &#8220;the people&#8221; and &#8220;rapid change&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The police is at the service of the people and completely shares its aspirations for rapid changes,&#8221; the interior ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We pay homage to the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next test for the police will come tomorrow when a deadline expires for protesters to relinquish public spaces such as Independence Square &#8212; the focal point of unrest that Yanukovych sparked in November by ditching an historic EU agreement in favour of closer ties with old master Moscow.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian protests have escalated into a Cold War-style confrontation pitting attempts by the Kremlin to keep reins on its historic fiefdom and Western efforts to bring the economically struggling nation of 46 million into their fold.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s deal calls for holding of early presidential elections by December and forming of a unity government.</p>
<p>But signs of the authorities&#8217; slipping grip on power were heightened by a bold push by parliament leaders to force Yanukovych to stand down immediately and to immediately free the jailed Tymoshenko.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990978&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/thail-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990955" alt="Sehgal has been accused of harming national security by leading protesters to besiege government offices. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/thail-m.jpg" /></a> Sehgal has been accused of harming national security by leading protesters to besiege government offices. (Reuters)
<p>Bangkok-based Indian businessman Satish Sehgal may face deportation with an immigration panel recommending the revocation of his permanent residency status for allegedly defying an emergency decree and leading anti- government protests. The decision was made at the second round of meetings of the Interior Ministry&#8217;s immigration committee on Friday, newspapers quoted sources as saying on Saturday.</p>
<p>A secret ballot was held on the issue of revoking Seghal&#8217;s permanent residency status and five members of the committee voted for it while two others opposed it and two more abstained, the media reports said. The committee had decided on February 11 that there was not enough evidence to deport 70-year-old Sehgal, who has lived in Thailand for 65 years but still holds an Indian passport. The committee&#8217;s decision has been submitted to Chalerm Yubamrung, director of the Centre for Maintaining Peace and Order (CMPO) that is overseeing the government&#8217;s response to the protests.</p>
<p>If the move is approved by CMPO, Sehgal can approach the court to oppose the decision. However, Seghal said he had not yet received anything in writing or been informed of any allegation of wrongdoing. &#8220;I am innocent, I did not do anything wrong. I have not been investigated by police or any officials,&#8221; said Sehgal, who has a publishing business. He said he only knew what the media had reported, adding the matter was now being handled by his lawyers.</p>
<p>The move for Seghal&#8217;s deportation came following his participation in anti-government protests after the emergency was imposed last month in Bangkok and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Sehgal has been accused of harming national security by leading protesters to besiege government offices, including the Department of Civil Aviation.</p>
<p>The businessman earlier served as an advisor to several ministers, including those in the administration run by former premier Thaksin Shinawatra.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990952&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin consultant surgeon in the UK is being investigated for the deaths of at least three patients under his care. Sudip Sarker, a consultant surgeon at Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, is under the lens after West Mercia Police received a letter in December last year raising concerns about him.</p>
<p>The police said the deaths of three patients, whose joint inquest was adjourned last year, formed part of the inquiry, the BBC reported. Sarker, 44, worked at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch in northeast Worcestershire from August 2011, but was suspended in October 2012. &#8220;We were made aware that there were a number of concerns in relation to the deaths of patients in 2012 who had been under Sarker&#8217;s care,&#8221; said superintendent Kevin Purcell of West Mercia Police. &#8220;We are in the early stages of obtaining the relevant information from hospitals and other health organisations in order to conduct our investigation.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time of Sarker&#8217;s suspension &#8220;a number of concerns&#8221; had been raised about him, the trust said. &#8220;This is a complex matter, which will undoubtedly take a considerable amount of time to investigate thoroughly,&#8221; Purcell added. The General Medical Council said it had obtained an interim order restricting where Sarker could practise, but did not stop him working altogether. A spokesman said they could not confirm where, or if, he is currently employed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990887&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dalai-lama-and-obama-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989942" alt="Obama played 'dumb' at his meeting with the Dalai Lama at the White House on Thursday. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dalai-lama-and-obama-med.jpg" /></a> Obama played &#8216;dumb&#8217; at his meeting with the Dalai Lama at the White House on Thursday. (AP)
<p>As China made strong diplomatic protest over US President Barack Obama&#8217;s meeting with the Dalai Lama, the Chinese media on Saturday said the event turned out to be an embarrassment for Beijing with its warning making little difference.</p>
<p>While Obama played &#8220;dumb&#8221; at his meeting with the Dalai Lama at the White House on Thursday, so far &#8220;China has found no effective way to counter such acts, said state-run Global Times which is also an official publication of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC).</p>
<p>&#8220;With China growing stronger, old practices such as US presidents meeting the Dalai Lama or selling arms to Taiwan are having less impact. But still, Friday&#8217;s meeting embarrassed China. Beijing had to protest, but the protest did not make much difference,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>As Obama went ahead with his third meeting with the Dalai Lama, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui summoned US envoy to lodge strong protest over it. Observers say the US move could cast a shadow on Obama&#8217;s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jingping at the next month&#8217;s nuclear security summit in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>According to Zhang, such a wrong move gravely interfered in China&#8217;s internal affairs, seriously violated the US commitment of not supporting the &#8220;Tibet independence&#8221;, gravely violated basic norms governing the international relations, and seriously undermined the China-US relations. &#8220;Such a move will gravely sabotage China-US cooperationand relations, and will definitely undermine its own interests,&#8221; he warned.</p>
<p>In its editorial, Global Times said that for the US, the Dalai Lama is an easy card to play &#8211; not as powerful as before &#8211; still, it is acard to deal with China. &#8220;The instant effect of the meeting between Obama and the Dalai Lama is nothing but some loss of face for China. It only serves as a reminder for the Chinese people to get a better understanding of what the US is,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Dalai clique has been on the decline and is seeing an increasingly unclear future,&#8221; it said. &#8220;They are grasping at the West for support. The clique has been living in an out-of-date self-deceiving fantasy. Western leaders have met with the Dalai Lama one after another, but the influence of the Dalai clique continues to dwindle. Except some funding, Western countries have nothing to give them,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The state-run China Daily said, America&#8217;s &#8220;idea of using the Dalai Lama to assume a moral high ground is fundamentally flawed. The Dalai Lama is essentially a political fugitive whose supporters instigate separatist activities, fuelling them by committing self-immolation&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990872&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukraine.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989631" alt="Anti-government protestors took control of the capital as the President fled to Kharkiv. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukraine.jpg" /></a> Anti-government protesters took control of the capital as the President fled to Kharkiv.
<p>Protesters in the Ukrainian capital claimed full control of the city on Saturday following the signing of a Western-brokered peace deal aimed at ending the nation&#8217;s three-month political crisis. The nation&#8217;s embattled president reportedly fled the capital for his support base in Ukraine&#8217;s Russia-leaning east.</p>
<p>Media outlets reported that President Viktor Yanukovych left Kiev for his native eastern Ukraine after surrendering much of his powers and agreeing to early elections this fall. The changes came as part of yesterday&#8217;s deal intended to end violence that killed scores and left hundreds wounded in Kiev this week as snipers opened fire on protesters. Andriy Parubiy, a leader of the protest camp on Independence Square, known as the Maidan, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Yanukovych fled for Kharkiv, the center of Ukraine&#8217;s industrial heartland.</p>
<p>The claims of the president&#8217;s departure could not be immediately confirmed. Parubiy also said today that protesters are now in full control of the capital. Police yesterday retreated from their positions in Kiev&#8217;s government district, and the night passed quietly. Despite significant concessions made by Yanukovych, many of the protesters have remained dissatisfied with the deal and pushed for his immediate ouster.</p>
<p>They booed opposition figures who took to a stage on Friday evening to present the deal, which cuts Yanukovych&#8217;s powers and calls for early elections but falls short of demands for his immediate resignation. &#8220;Death to the criminal!&#8221; some chanted, referring to Yanukovych. The leader of a major radical group that spearheaded clashes with police, Pravy Sektor, declared on Friday that &#8220;the national revolution will continue.&#8221;</p>
<p>A motion seeking the president&#8217;s impeachment was submitted late yesterday to the Ukrainian parliament, where members of Yanukovych&#8217;s faction defected in droves to the opposition side, quickly passing constitutional amendments that trimmed Yanukovych&#8217;s powers. It wasn&#8217;t clear if and when the impeachment motion would be put to vote.</p>
<p>Neither side won all the points it sought in Friday&#8217;s deal, and some vague conditions could ignite strong disputes down the road. The agreement signed on Friday calls for presidential elections to be moved up from March 2015 to no later than December, but many protesters said that is far too late.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990871&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>US Secretary of State John Kerry has condemned Venezuela&#8217;s &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; use of force against anti-government protesters, and declined to respond to a call from Caracas for bilateral talks. &#8220;The government&#8217;s use of force and judicial intimidation against citizens and political figures, who are exercising a legitimate right to protest, is unacceptable and will only increase the likelihood of violence,&#8221; Kerry said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>Despite calls from Venezuela&#8217;s democratic opposition and the international community, the government of Nicolas Maduro &#8220;has confronted peaceful protesters with force and in some cases with armed vigilantes claiming to support the government,&#8221; the top US diplomat added. &#8220;It has imprisoned students and a key opposition figure. It has limited the freedoms of expression and assembly necessary for legitimate political debate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed to Maduro&#8217;s moves to tighten media restrictions, after CNN said several of its journalists working in Venezuela, on both Spanish-language and English-language programs, had seen their press credentials revoked or refused. In a move filled with anti-US sentiment, Maduro has threatened to block the American broadcaster, accusing the network of inciting a &#8220;civil war.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not how democracies behave,&#8221; Kerry said. The US secretary of state urged the Venezuelan government to release jailed dissidents and initiate a process of genuine dialogue with the democratic opposition. &#8220;The solution to Venezuela&#8217;s problems can only be found through dialogue with all Venezuelans, engaging in a free exchange of opinions in a climate of mutual respect,&#8221; said Kerry, who also called on the opposition to refrain from violence.</p>
<p>The top US diplomat had nothing to say about Maduro&#8217;s challenge to US President Barack Obama for direct talks on the Venezuelan crisis. Maduro has accused Washington of fomenting the anti-government unrest. US officials have denied the charges.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990864&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Protesters in the Ukrainian capital claimed full control of the city on Saturday following the signing of a Western-brokered peace deal aimed at ending the nation&#8217;s three-month political crisis.</p>

<p>Andriy Parubiy, a leader of the protest camp on Independence Square, known as the Maidan, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Yanukovych fled for Kharkiv, the center of Ukraine&#8217;s industrial heartland.</p>
<p>Ukrainian protesters said they had taken control of the presidential administration building in central Kiev, as opposition leaders pressed for the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovich on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not here, none of his officials or anyone linked directly to the administration are here,&#8221; Ostap Kryvdyk, a protest leader, told a Reuters reporter inside the grounds of the administration building. He said protesters had not used force to enter the compound.</p>
<p>The claims of the president&#8217;s departure could not be immediately confirmed, however. Parubiy also said that protesters are now in full control of the capital. Police Friday&#8217;s retreated from their positions in Kiev&#8217;s government district, and the night passed quietly.</p>
<p>However, a security source claimed that President Viktor Yanukovich is still in Ukraine, following reports his residence was empty and unguarded and his offices were in the hands of protesters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s ok with him,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;He is in Ukraine.&#8221; Asked whether the embattled leader was in the capital, the source replied: &#8220;I cannot say.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UNIAN news agency cited Anna Herman, a lawmaker close to Yanukovich, as saying the president was in the northeastern city of Kharkiv.</p>
<p>Despite significant concessions made by Yanukovych, many of the protesters have remained dissatisfied with the deal and pushed for his immediate ouster.</p>
<p>They booed opposition figures who took to a stage Friday evening to present the deal, which cuts Yanukovych&#8217;s powers and calls for early elections but falls short of demands for his immediate resignation.</p>

(AP)
<p>Supporters of Thailand Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra denounced opposition threats against businesses linked to her family on Saturday ahead of a gathering of their leaders. Anti-government protesters have blocked key Bangkok intersections with tents, tyres and sandbags, seeking to unseat Yingluck and halt the influence of her billionaire brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, an ousted former premier regarded by many as the real power behind the government.</p>
<p>This week they targeted businesses linked, or once linked, to the Shinawatra family, sending stock prices tumbling. &#8220;What we don&#8217;t like right now is their involvement in threatening companies on the stock exchange that is not involved with government,&#8221; Tida Tawornseth, chairwoman of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), told Reuters. &#8220;It&#8217;s a move away from government into business.&#8221; The protests have already taken a toll on the economy, on tourism in particular, with arrivals in Bangkok sharply down.</p>
<p>The UDD, a &#8220;red-shirted&#8221; protest movement based largely in Thailand&#8217;s populous north and northeast, is holding a meeting of its leaders from across the country on Sunday in Nakhon Ratchasima, north of the capital. Generous subsidies for farmers in the north and northeast were a centrepiece of the platform that swept Yingluck to power in 2011, but they have left Thailand with vast stockpiles of rice and a bill it is struggling to fund.</p>
<p>About 500 anti-Thaksin protesters gathered this week outside the Bangkok offices of SC Asset Corp, a property developer controlled by the Shinawatra family, waving Thai flags and blowing whistles. Yingluck was executive chairwoman of the company before being swept to power in a landslide election victory in 2011. SC Asset&#8217;s share price has lost almost 10 per cent since Wednesday and mobile handset distributor M-Link Asia Corp, also with links to the family, lost 12 per cent.</p>
<p>Other stocks affected include telecoms group Shin Corp , founded by Thaksin before he entered politics, and its mobile affiliate Advanced Info Service Pcl (AIS)  which on Saturday sent an SMS to clients saying it no longer has any connection with the Shinawatra family. &#8220;AIS is not involved in politics and is not a pipeline for any side,&#8221; it said. &#8220;Dr. Thaksin and family have already sold all shares in the company since 23 January, 2006, and from then are no longer connected with the company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tawornseth said Sunday&#8217;s rally would consolidate plans to restore democracy after the opposition boycotted and disrupted elections this month, leaving the country paralysed under a caretaker government. She ruled out any plans for violence. &#8220;If we wanted to clash, we would have done so a long time ago,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have to wait for this long.&#8221; Four protesters and a police officer were killed on Tuesday when police attempted to reclaim protest sites near government buildings. Six people were wounded by a grenade on Friday.</p>
<p>The protests are the latest instalment of an eight-year political battle broadly pitting the Bangkok middle class and royalist establishment against the mostly rural supporters of Yingluck and Thaksin. Demonstrators accuse Thaksin of nepotism and corruption and say that, prior to being toppled by the army in 2006, he used taxpayers&#8217; money for populist subsidies such as the rice scheme and easy loans that bought him the loyalty of millions.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990830&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dalai-new-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990823" alt="China expressed strong resentment when the US hosted the Dalai Lama at the White House. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dalai-new-480.jpg" /></a> China expressed strong resentment when the US hosted the Dalai Lama at the White House. (AP)
<p>China summoned US Charge d&#8217;Affaires to Beijing and lodged a strong diplomatic protest after President Barack Obama met the Dalai Lama at the White House despite warnings from Beijing that the meeting would damage ties. Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui summoned Daniel Kritenbrink, Charge d&#8217;Affaires of the US embassy in China, on Friday night to lodge solemn representations for Obama&#8217;s meeting with the Dalai Lama disregarding China&#8217;s strong opposition, the Foreign Ministry here said in a statement.</p>
<p>Zhang said such a wrong move gravely interfered in China&#8217;s internal affairs, seriously violated the US commitment of not supporting the &#8220;Tibet independence&#8221;, gravely violated basic norms governing the international relations and seriously undermined the China-US relations. &#8220;China expresses strong indignation and firm opposition,&#8221; Zhang said.</p>
<p>The meeting is a serious violation of the basic norms of international relations and caused serious damage to the US-China relations, the statement was quoted by the state-run Xinhua news agency as saying. Obama offered &#8220;strong support&#8221; for Tibetans&#8217; human rights as he met the Dalai Lama. Obama, during the meeting, extended support to the Dalai Lama&#8217;s &#8220;Middle Way&#8221; approach of neither assimilation nor independence for Tibetans in China.</p>
<p>The US announcement of Obama&#8217;s third meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader drew a sharp reaction from China, which has long opposed foreign dignitaries meeting the Dalai Lama who fled to India in 1959. Earlier, China lodged diplomatic protest soon after the White House announced the meeting and later the Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying sought its cancellation saying it would seriously impair bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Hua told a media briefing that &#8220;we are deeply concerned and have lodged solemn representations with the US side.&#8221; &#8220;We must point out that Tibet-related affairs fall entirely within the internal affairs of China, which allow no foreign interference. The Dalai Lama is a political exile who has long been engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion&#8221;, she said. &#8220;By arranging a meeting between the President and the Dalai Lama, the US side will grossly interfere in the internal affairs of China, seriously violate norms governing international relations and severely impair China-US relations,&#8221; Hua had said ahead of the meeting.</p>
<p>Obama and the Dalai Lama &#8211; both Nobel Peace Prize laureates &#8211; have met twice before in 2010 and 2011, drawing similar protests from China.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990819&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pentagon480.jpg" /></a> An NRI at the Pentagon has joined a prominent US-based think-tank. (Reuters)
<p>Vikram Singh, the highest-ranking Indian-American at the Pentagon, is joining an eminent US think-tank after serving the Obama Administration in various positions for over five years. Singh, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia, is joining the Center for American Progress (CAP) as its vice president for National Security and International Policy and will oversee its work on national security around the globe, while continuing his focus on Asia.</p>
<p>He will officially join CAP in March. &#8220;Vikram is a leading foreign policy thinker of his generation and has tackled the country’s greatest foreign policy challenges during his time at the State Department and the Pentagon,&#8221; CAP president Neera Tanden said in a statement. &#8220;As we continue to shape a pragmatic foreign policy strategy over the next decade, Vikram&#8217;s insights, sharp strategic mind and experience will guide our work,&#8221; Tanden said.</p>
<p>Before his current appointment at the Pentagon, Singh was the Deputy Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan at the Department of State, during which he played a key role in shaping the Af-Pak policy of the Obama Administration. Singh has also served in the Department of Defense as a senior advisor, representing the department in National Security Council policy reviews of Pakistan and the war in Afghanistan and later leading the development of the department&#8217;s post-2014 strategic approach to South and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Prior to his most recent assignments at the Pentagon, Singh served in the Department of Defense from 2003 through 2007 on a number of defense policy issues, including programs to train and equip foreign military forces, US military counter-insurgency and irregular warfare capabilities, stability operations, disaster response and humanitarian assistance, and the 2005 Quadrennial Defense Review.</p>
<p>As a fellow at the Center for a New American Security from 2007 to 2009, Singh published widely on defense strategy, national security policy, and Asia. Singh lived and worked in Sri Lanka while running a Ford Foundation programme on minority rights and conflict in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Lanka. He also reported on the Lankan civil war for the Voice of America.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990797&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Smog continued to blanket China&#8217;s north and central regions for the third day on Saturday, prompting the National Meteorological Centre (NMC) to issue a yellow alert for air pollution. Beijing, Tianjin and parts of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces expect heavy air pollution from Saturday morning to Sunday morning, according to the NMC forecast.</p>
<p>Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province have been suffering heavy smog since Thursday, Xinhua news agency reported. On Friday, PM 2.5 readings in these regions kept rising and exceeded 200 micrograms per cubic meter, far above the 25 micrograms level considered safe by the World Health Organization. The NMC on Thursday forecast the smog would last for a week as no cold front is in sight to help disperse.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990791&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gunship-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990783" alt="Pakistani gunships have successfully raided terrorist hideouts and killed some terrorists. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gunship-480.jpg" /></a> Pakistani gunships have successfully raided terrorist hideouts and killed some terrorists. (Reuters)
<p>At least six terrorists were killed on Saturday when army&#8217;s helicopter gunships pounded their hideouts in Hangu district in northwest Pakistan. Security sources said they had confirmed inputs about presence of terrorists in a compound near Thall, a city in Hangu district, who were planning attacks. &#8220;Helicopter gunships hit the hideouts early this morning, killing some terrorists,&#8221; an official source said.</p>
<p>Local media reports put the toll at six. The fresh strikes came a day after Army chief Gen Raheel Sharif said the armed forces are &#8220;battle hardened&#8221; and fully capable of countering any internal or external threat. During a visit to the FC headquarters in Peshawar on Friday, he recounted security forces&#8217; successes in various operations against terrorists and lauded the efforts and determination of all troops and law enforcement agencies &#8220;who cleared affected areas, with the help of local population and support of the entire nation&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are fully prepared to confront any challenge in future as well,&#8221; the COAS reaffirmed, a statement released by the military&#8217;s media wing said. The military has gone on an offensive and has carried out air strikes in North Waziristan and Khyber Agency killing at least 40 suspected terrorists this week. The air strikes were carried out following a joint decision taken by the military and civilian leadership. The precision bombardment was part of surgical strikes, which sources said should not be taken as a full-fledged military operation.</p>
<p>The government has been trying to engage the banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan in peace talks to end the decade-long insurgency that has claimed about 40,000 lives. However, the peace process suffered a setback after a Taliban faction beheaded 23 paramilitary personnel abducted in 2010. The military leadership took the civilian government into confidence, citing potential threats from terrorists holed up in their safe havens in the tribal belt. The sources said the air strikes were aimed at protecting the people as militants were making plans to carry out attacks.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990779&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An 82-year-old Sikh has been honoured for his outstanding volunteer service in Singapore. Surjan Singh on Friday received the Ministry of Social and Family Development Volunteers Awards for helping some 60 boys, mostly involved in petty crimes such as theft.<br />    <br />Singh, a retired teacher, had one of the longest serving volunteer probation career. He served for 42 years. &#8220;Trust is crucial. You cannot succeed as a probation officer if they (the boys) or their parents don&#8217;t trust you,&#8221; Singh was quoted as saying by The Straits Times. &#8220;I stuck on with this (volunteering work) because I believe that human beings are basically good. This is one way I can help in society,&#8221; said the Malaysia-born Singh, whose parents arrived in Malaya in the early 1930s.<br />    <br />Singh has also authored two books on &#8220;Saluting Sikh Soldiers of World War I &amp; II&#8221;, and &#8220;Mythological and other references in Gurbani&#8221;. Singapore is rated 64 out of the 135 countries in charitable giving, according to the Singapore daily.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990731&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/diwali.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990730" alt="The Diwali Coalition highlighted importance of the festival for the city's Hindu, Jain and Sikh communities." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/diwali.jpg" /></a> The Diwali Coalition highlighted importance of the festival for the city&#8217;s Hindu, Jain and Sikh communities.
<p>A broad-based coalition of about 40 organisations and temples from New York City has asked the Mayor Bill de Blasio to include Diwali alongside the new proposed public holidays for Eid and Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>In a letter to the New York City Mayor, the Diwali Coalition highlighted importance of the festival for the city&#8217;s Hindu, Jain and Sikh communities and urged him to take into consideration the significant number of the city&#8217;s public school children who celebrate this festival.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diwali is one of the most widely celebrated holidays in our community,&#8221; said Diwali Coalition of NYC member Dr. Uma Mysorekar, president of the renown Ganesh temple in Flushing, Queens.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Hindus, Diwali celebrates the victory of good over evil and is a time for families to come together to pray for the well-being of all. We hope the Mayor will take our community&#8217;s request to heart and include Diwali among the new public school holidays,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>This week, Congressman Joe Crowley, co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans, along with lawmakers Charles Rangel, Grace Meng, Carolyn Maloney, Yvette Clarke and Gregory Meeks also come out in support of the move.</p>
<p>In a letter to Carmen Farina, Chancellor of Education, spearheaded by Crowley, they noted the &#8220;increased recognition&#8221; Diwali has gained on the national stage.</p>
<p>Crowley and other members hosted the first-ever Congressional Diwali celebration in 2013, and the White House has recognised Diwali under successive administrations.</p>
<p>Both letters also drew attention to the huge number of temples and gurdwaras in the five boroughs as well as the plethora of Diwali celebrations in the city that draw thousands each year.</p>
<p>The Diwali Coalition also noted that last year the City Council of New York urged the Department of Education to &#8220;establish Diwali as an official school holiday for NYC public students&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990728&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>North and South Korean families held a final farewell on Saturday after they were reunited for the first time since the Korean war divided them 60 years ago, knowing they will almost certainly never be together again.</p>
<p>On the third and last day of their brief, emotionally-charged reunions, 80 elderly South Koreans were allowed to meet their Northern relatives for an hour before parting ways. The families, the first of two batches who are being allowed to meet with each other, have spent a total of 11 hours on six occasions together since Thursday, including mass meetings over meals and a private reunion without media TV cameras.</p>
<p>Southerner Kim Yong-Ja carried the portrait of her mother Seo Jeong-Suk, who died at the age of 90 just two weeks before the reunions, to a meeting with her sister from the North. &#8220;Mother, this is Young-Sil whom you wanted to see so much,&#8221; she said as she held the portrait close to the face of her sister. Kim Dong-Bin, 80, met his sisters and a brother from the North.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very happy to see you all. Stay healthy and see you again after reunification,&#8221; he said. He gave them thick winter coats, pairs of boots and his own wristwatch. Two other South Koreans had to cut their reunions short due to health issues, returning home Friday via ambulances, a media pool report said.</p>
<p>One of the two was Kim Sung-Kyeong, 91. &#8220;Thank you for surviving and living well,&#8221; he told his children from the North, before he was wheeled away on a gurney into an ambulance. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any regrets now. Please bury my remains in the hills at my hometown (in the North) when reunification comes,&#8221; he told his other son, whom he fathered in the South. Tens of millions of people were displaced by the sweep of the 1950-53 Korean War, which saw the frontline yo-yo from the south of the peninsula to the northern border with China and back again.</p>
<p>The chaos and devastation separated brothers and sisters, parents and children, husbands and wives. Because the conflict concluded with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, the two Koreas technically remain at war. Direct exchanges of letters or telephone calls are prohibited. This week&#8217;s reunions, the first of their kind in three years, are widely being seen as a possible first step towards thawing cross-border ties.</p>
<p>Held at Mount Kumgang resort in North Korea near the heavily fortified inter-Korean border, they were only secured after intense negotiations.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990723&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope Francis will create his first batch of cardinals today, with nine of the 19 coming from South America, Africa and Asia. The new &#8220;princes of the Church&#8221; will be presented with scarlet-red birettas and gold rings at a grandiose ceremony in St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica that Vatican observers say should help correct a perceived bias towards European cardinals.</p>
<p>Sixteen of the 19 cardinals are under the age of 80 and can therefore take part in the secretive conclave that elects new popes from among their ranks.</p>
<p>In an indication of the importance of the developing world for the Argentine pope &#8211; a fierce critic of economic inequality &#8211; half are non-Europeans, including five cardinals from South America, two Africans and two Asians. &#8220;Becoming a cardinal is not a promotion, nor an honour or a decoration; it is simply a service which requires a broadening of the gaze and a widening of the heart,&#8221; Francis said in a letter to each new cardinal-to-be, according to La Stampa daily.</p>
<p>Francis is keen to nourish faith in developing countries, to combat the decline of practicing believers in Europe, the Church&#8217;s traditional power base. The first non-European pope in nearly 1,300 years will bestow the honour of the red cap on the archbishops of Buenos Aires in Argentina, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Santiago in Chile, Managua in Nicaragua and Les Cayes in Haiti.</p>
<p>Aurelio Poli, 66, took over the post of Buenos Aires archbishop from Francis, who was a regular visitor to the city&#8217;s slums before he became pope almost a year ago.</p>
<p>Chibly Langlois, 55, will be the Church&#8217;s first cardinal from Haiti, one of the poorest countries of the world.</p>
<p>According to Vatican watcher John Allen, Francis is taking the idea of privileging the periphery even further, by choosing Haiti over the region&#8217;s three Catholic powerhouses – Cuba, Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>For Africa, the new electors will be the archbishops of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso and Abidjan in Ivory Coast, while Asia will be represented by the archbishops of Cotabato in the Philippines and Seoul in South Korea.</p>
<p>The pope&#8217;s choices echo his desire to emphasis the pastoral side of the Church &#8211; choosing for the most part leaders engaged with the problems affecting their local communities rather than favouring administrative heads.</p>
<p>Only four are members of the Curia &#8211; the Vatican&#8217;s government &#8211; including Italian Pietro Parolin, 58, the new secretary of state, as well as German Gerhard Mueller, 66, who heads the Vatican&#8217;s doctrinal congregation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990722&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pirates-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990719" alt="Hopkins said at present about 1,430 Somali pirates either suspected and being tried or convicted and in prison in 21 countries. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pirates-med.jpg" /></a> Hopkins said at present about 1,430 Somali pirates either suspected and being tried or convicted and in prison in 21 countries. (Reuters)
<p>India, which has the largest number of pirates in its custody, is a very important member of the piracy contact group, a senior US official has said.</p>
<p>US Coordinator for Counter Piracy and Maritime Security Donna Hopkins said &#8220;India is a very important member of the Contact Group and, in fact, chaired a plenary&#8221; and has more pirates under its custody than any other country. &#8220;There is almost no littoral country, no naval country, and no major shipping country that has not contributed actively to the contact group. And the two that you&#8217;ve mentioned have been very important partners,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Hopkins said at present about 1,430 Somali pirates – either suspected and being tried or convicted and in prison in 21 countries. Somalia, after India, has the largest number of pirates under its custody.</p>
<p>Hopkins said there has been no piracy hijacking off the coast of Somalia since May 2012. &#8220;This is the lowest rate of attempted hijackings in over six years, and certainly since the peak of the crisis in 2011. No ships are currently held hostage by Somali pirates, although there remain at least 49 hostages whom the international community are working to free,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She said the remarkable drop in piracy was primarily due to two things: proactive counter-piracy operations by the many national navies and missions that are preventing and disrupting pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia and in the eastern Indian Ocean, and better self-protection by commercial ships, including the use of embarked armed security teams. The CGPCS is a group of countries and organisations with a common interest in eliminating piracy from the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. It was constituted in 2009 to facilitate the discussion and coordination of actions among states and organizations to suppress piracy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990706&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>US President Barack Obama spoke with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over telephone about the deal reached between Ukrainian government and opposition and agreed that it should be implemented quickly. During the conversation, the two leaders said that it was very important to encourage all sides to refrain from violence. Putin affirmed that Russia wants to remain part of the implementation process.</p>
<p>They also talked about the need to stabilise the Ukrainian economy and to get Ukraine back on a peaceful path. And on both sides, there was a pledge to stay engaged along with the Europeans, a senior US official said. The White House said the two leaders besides exchanging views on Ukraine also spoke about the situation in Syria, concerns over the humanitarian crisis and the necessity of a strong UN Security Council resolution on the issue.</p>
<p>In addition, they discussed US-Russian cooperation in the P5+1 process on Iran. The President also congratulated Russia on its hosting of the Olympic games, the White House said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990705&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The embattled president of Ukraine and leaders of the opposition signed a political deal Friday aimed at ending a spiral of lethal violence with early elections and a reduction in presidential powers, but Russia declined to endorse the accord, and many protesters said nothing short of the president’s resignation would get them off the street.</p>
<p>In a further sign of President Viktor F Yanukovych’s diminished influence, the Ukrainian Parliament voted to allow the release<br />
of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who has been imprisoned for more than two years. In a 310-to-54 vote, lawmakers<br />
decriminalized the actions for which she was incarcerated.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear when Tymoshenko might be released from a penitentiary in the eastern city of Kharkiv where she<br />
has been serving her sentence. But she is still considered one of Yanukovych’s most potent adversaries. The vote aimed at releasing her came hours after word of the political deal reached between Yanukovych and the main opposition leaders.<br />
Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister and part of a European team that has been pushing for a settlement, said a council<br />
representing some protesters in Independence Square in Kiev, the focal point of months of protests, had endorsed the hard-fought<br />
deal in a vote, with 34 voting in favour and only two against.</p>
<p>Arseniy Yatsenyuk, one of three opposition members of Parliament who signed the accord with Yanukovych, acknowledged<br />
that it might not go down well with protesters who want Yanukovych gone, but said they could be persuaded.<br />
“We need to explain, and we need to not only explain, we need to act,” he said after marathon negotiations at the presidential<br />
administration building mediated by European and Russian diplomats.</p>
<p>“People will never trust any kind of signature. People<br />
will trust real action.” A bigger problem could be a refusal by Russia’s representative to join the Europeans in signing<br />
the accord, which suggested Moscow might work to undo the deal through economic or other pressure.</p>
<p>“I am upset that the Russians are not signatories,” Yatsenyuk said. “I am really upset.” Previous settlements and truces have broken down several times, engulfed by wild bursts of violence on the streets of Kiev, the capital, and in other parts of<br />
the country, particularly western regions where anti-government sentiment has always been strong. A statement from Yanukovych’s office, issued before the signing, said the talks had been “very difficult”.</p>
<p>The pressure for a political settlement has been intense, coming not only from foreign governments but also from a widespread fear among the population that this former Soviet republic of 46 million people was hurtling toward a possible civil war, particularly after frenzied violence on Thursday that the opposition says killed more than 70 protesters.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990677&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pakistan Army chief Gen Raheel Sharif on Friday said the nuclear programme occupies a &#8220;central place&#8221; in the defence of the country. Sharif made the remarks during a visit to the army&#8217;s Strategic Force Command headquarters in Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>He was received by Strategic Force Command chief Lt Gen Obaidullah Khan, who gave him a detailed briefing about the<br />
preparedness of the strategic forces.</p>
<p>Sharif lauded the higher standard of training‚ professional abilities and morale of the armed forces personnel. The exact number and location of Pakistan&#8217;s nculear weapons are not known.</p>
<p>There have been a slew of reports in the international media about the vulnerability of Pakistan&#8217;s nuclear arsenal and possibility of it falling into hands of the Taliban and Al Qaeda.</p>
<p>Pakistan says its strictly follows international standards to guard the nuclear stockpile and has always rejected such reports as part of a &#8220;campaign&#8221; to malign its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>Islamabad does not follow a &#8220;no first use&#8221; policy for its nuclear weapons but under its nuclear doctrine, the arsenal is meant to maintain a minimum credible deterrence.</p>
<p>Most of Pakistan&#8217;s missiles are India-specific.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990326&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The presidential palace in Somalia&#8217;s capital Mogadishu, home to the country&#8217;s internationally-backed government, was hit today by a  massive car bomb followed by a raid by gunmen, police and witnesses said.</p>
<p>The UN&#8217;s special envoy to Somalia said the country&#8217;s president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, had telephoned to say he was unharmed in the attack against the Villa Somalia, one of the most heavily fortified places in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a large attack on the presidential palace. Initial reports are that a suicide car bomber hit the gate and exploded, then men with guns followed,&#8221; police officer Mohamed Ali told AFP.</p>
<p>The attack appeared to bear all the hallmarks of Somalia&#8217;s Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab rebels, and comes just a week after the militants carried out a suicide car bomb attack at the gates of Mogadishu&#8217;s heavily-fortified international airport.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security forces are dealing with terrorists who blew up a car&#8230; and there is exchange of fire. We have no details of the casualties but of course there are casualties,&#8221; said Ahmed Moalim Adan, a security official near the scene of the attack.</p>
<p>Witness Hussein Isa said the attackers were fighting inside the presidential compound.</p>
<p>&#8220;A suicide bomber rammed a car full of explosives into the perimeter wall of the presidential palace and another one with  heavily armed men penetrated the area where the first one hit.</p>
<p>There is heavy exchange of gunfire continuing inside the building but we cannot tell what is happening,&#8221; said the witness.</p>
<p>The sound of intense gunfire and sporadic explosions could be heard coming from the presidential complex, AFP reporters<br />
said.</p>
<p>In a message on Twitter, UN special envoy Nick Kay said the president &#8220;just called me to say he&#8217;s unharmed&#8221; and that the &#8220;attack on Villa Somalia had failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sadly some lives lost. I condemn strongly this terrorism,&#8221; Kay&#8217;s message said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990319&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>There was no immediate comment from opposition leaders, who were meeting among themselves.</p>
<p>In a statement on his website, Yanukovych said he would start the process for early elections but gave no date. He also promised constitutional reforms trimming presidential powers, a key demand of protesters.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/musharaff.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990304 " alt="musharaff" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/musharaff.jpg" /></a> If convicted, Musharraf could face life imprisonment or the death penalty.
<p>Pervez Musharraf&#8217;s efforts to stymie his trial on treason charges suffered a setback today when a Pakistani special court dismissed the former military ruler&#8217;s petition to transfer his case to a military court and summoned him to appear on March 11.</p>
<p>Musharraf&#8217;s lawyers had objected to the formation of the three-judge special court, saying the 70-year-old former army chief could only be tried by a military court under the Army Act.</p>
<p>The special court asserted it has the mandate to try Musharraf and set the next hearing for March 4. It also summoned Musharraf to appear before it on March 11.</p>
<p>&#8220;This application is dismissed,&#8221; said Justice Faisal Arab, the head of the three-judge bench.</p>
<p>The bench ruled Musharraf was no longer in the army and can be tried by the special court. Musharraf had filed three applications that challenged the appointment of the government prosecutor as well as the establishment and jurisdiction of the special court.</p>
<p>He is the first military ruler to be charged with high treason charges for suspending the Constitution, imposing an emergency and detaining judges of superior courts in 2007.</p>
<p>If convicted, he could face life imprisonment or the death penalty. Ahmed Raza Kasuri, a key member of Musharraf&#8217;s legal team, claimed the court&#8217;s order was factually wrong because he was the army chief when he signed the proclamation declaring emergency.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had signed the order as the army chief and not as President. The judges should have recused themselves as they are biased against Musharraf. They were dismissed by Musharraf and held agitations against him,&#8221; Kasuri told reporters outside the special court.</p>
<p>He claimed that facts and laws were &#8220;twisted&#8221; in this case.</p>
<p>Rana Ijaz Ahmed, another lawyer representing Musharraf, accused the judges of acting like &#8220;rented killers&#8221; when the judgement was read out.</p>
<p>Though Musharraf appeared in court during the last hearing, it could not carry forward the proceedings as his lawyers had asked the court to first decide on their petitions challenging its mandate.</p>
<p>After skipping all previous hearings of the treason trial, Musharraf appeared for the first time in the special court on February 18.</p>
<p>Musharraf admitted to a military hospital in Rawalpindi on January 2 after he developed heart problems. He is at the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology since then.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990299&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/el-nino.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990254" alt="el-nino" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/el-nino.jpg" /></a> The &#8220;Bad Boy&#8221; could cause flooding and drought in some parts of the world.
<p>The El Nino weather pattern that can trigger drought in some parts of the world while causing flooding in others is increasingly likely to return this year, hitting production of key foods such as rice, wheat and sugar.</p>
<p>El Nino &#8211; the Spanish word for boy &#8211; is a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific that occurs every four to 12 years. The worst on record in the late 1990s killed more than 2,000 people and caused billions of dollars in damage.</p>
<p>A strong El Nino can wither crops in Australia, Southeast Asia, India and Africa when other parts of the globe such as the U.S. Midwest and Brazil are drenched in rains. While scientists are still debating the intensity of a potential El Nino, Australia&#8217;s Bureau of Meteorology and the U.S. Climate Prediction Center have warned of increased chances one will strike this year.</p>
<p>Last month, the United Nations&#8217; World Meteorological Organization said there was an &#8220;enhanced possibility&#8221; of a weak El Nino by the middle of 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world is bracing for El Nino, which if confirmed, could wreak havoc on supply and cause prices of some commodities to shoot up,&#8221; said Vanessa Tan, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.</p>
<p>Any disruption to supply would come as many crops have already been hit by adverse weather, with the northern hemisphere in the grip of a savage winter.</p>
<p>The spectre of El Nino has driven global cocoa prices to 2-1/2 year peaks this month on fears that dry weather in the key growing regions of Africa and Asia would stoke a global deficit. Other agricultural commodities could follow that lead higher if El Nino conditions are confirmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Production estimates for several crops which are already under stress will have to be revised downwards,&#8221; said Phillip Futures&#8217; Tan. &#8221;Wheat in Australia may be affected by El Nino and also sugar in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>In India, the world&#8217;s No.2 producer of sugar, rice and wheat, a strong El Nino could reduce the monsoon rains that are key to its agriculture, curbing production.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a strong El Nino occurs during the second half of the monsoon season, then it could adversely impact the production size of summer crops,&#8221; said Sudhir Panwar, president of farmers&#8217; lobby group Kishan Jagriti Manch.</p>
<p>El Nino in 2009 turned India&#8217;s monsoon patchy, leading to the worst drought in nearly four decades and helping push global sugar prices to their highest in nearly 30 years.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia, which grows more than 90 percent of the world&#8217;s rice and is its main producer of coffee and corn, a drought-inducing El Nino could hit crops in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and China. And it could deal another blow to wheat production in Australia, the world&#8217;s second-largest exporter of the grain, which has already been grappling with drought in the last few months.</p>
<p>El Nino could also crimp supply of minerals such as gold, nickel, tin, copper and coal if mines flood or logistics are disrupted. In North America, crops in the U.S. Pacific Northwest could suffer as El Nino tends to cause rain to the area, with the major white wheat region already abnormally dry. But El Nino doesn&#8217;t spell bad news for all farmers. It could bring rain to drought-hit California&#8217;s dairy farms and vineyards.</p>
<p>&#8220;El Nino has a bad connotation, undeservedly so in the U.S.,&#8221; said Harry Hillaker, state climatologist in Iowa. &#8220;Given the water supply issues they are having in California, more rain would be helpful.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in Central America, while dryness associated with El Nino would curb coffee production, it would also help drive back the leaf rust that has blighted crops in the region.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990227&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukraine-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990188" alt="The crisis erupted in November when President Viktor Yanukovych decided unexpectedly to reject a EU integration deal years in making in favour of closer ties with Russia. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukraine-m.jpg" /></a> The crisis erupted in November when President Viktor Yanukovych decided unexpectedly to reject a EU integration deal years in making in favour of closer ties with Russia. (Reuters)
<p>Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s ratings agency on Friday lowered Ukraine&#8217;s long-term rating from &#8216;CCC+&#8217; to &#8216;CCC&#8217; saying the raging political crisis has put the government&#8217;s ability to service its debt at risk and raised uncertainty over Russia providing promised aid.</p>
<p>&#8220;The downgrade reflects our view that the political situation in Ukraine has deteriorated substantially,&#8221; the agency said in a note a day after the deadliest day in the ex-Soviet country&#8217;s three-month-old political crisis left more than 60 anti-government protesters shot dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that this raises uncertainty regarding the continued provision of Russian financial support over the course of 2014, and puts the government&#8217;s capability to meet debt service at increasing risk,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The crisis in economically-struggling Ukraine erupted in November when President Viktor Yanukovych decided unexpectedly to reject a European Union integration deal years in the making in favour of closer ties with Russia.</p>
<p>Moscow then promised to provide a 15 billion dollar bailout to its former satellite and to slash prices that Kiev paid for energy supplies.</p>
<p>The Kremlin provided the first USD 3 billion tranche of the promised aid at the end of January and had promised to release the second tranche this week.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990180&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Usually, levels above 300 is considered to be hazardous<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990177&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/beijing.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990179" alt="Beijing" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/beijing.jpg" /></a> A women is seen wearing a protective mask in Beijing.
<p>China&#8217;s capital Beijing, under fire to take effective measures against air pollution, raised its four-tiered alert system to &#8220;orange&#8221; for the first time on Friday, as heavy smog was forecast to roll into the city over the next three days.</p>
<p>The orange level, the second highest, advises schools and kindergartens to cancel outside sports classes, but falls short of ordering school to close and keeping government vehicles off the road, provisions which come into force with the &#8220;red&#8221; level.</p>
<p>The alert was raised after the Beijing government faced criticism from state media and on the Internet for failing to act against high pollution levels last weekend.</p>
<p>The capital was already shrouded in smoky, white smog by Friday afternoon. Data from the U.S. embassy put levels of PM2.5 particles, those measuring less than 2.5 micrometres across and the most noxious form of air pollution, at 378.</p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers levels above 300 to be hazardous. Last weekend, the index topped 500.<br />
Forecasters said the smog would persist for three days and authorities urged residents to leave cars at home. Some residents welcomed the announcement. Others asked why more was not being done.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, but do the PM2.5 measurements have to explode off the charts before we see a red alert?&#8221; said a user of weibo, China&#8217;s twitter-like microblogging service.</p>
<p>The stability-obsessed government is keen to be seen as tough on pollution as affluent city dwellers grow weary of a growth-at-all-costs economic model that has tainted much of China&#8217;s air, water and soil.</p>
<p>Authorities have issued innumerable orders and policies to try and clean up the environment, investing in projects to fight pollution and empowering courts to mete out stiff penalties, including the death penalty in serious cases. But enforcement has been patchy at the local level, where authorities often rely on taxes paid by polluting industries.</p>
<p>The Beijing government introduced the tiered system last October. But despite several periods of thick smog since then, the plan&#8217;s stronger measures have never before been introduced.</p>
<p>Public discontent about Beijing&#8217;s dirty air was highlighted on Friday when a Chinese military expert became the object of scorn online after suggesting smog in the city could be a useful defence against a U.S. military laser attack.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990177&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pervez-4802.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1982540" alt="Musharraf faces treason charges for suspending, subverting and abrogating the Constitution, imposing an emergency and detaining judges of the superior courts." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pervez-4802.jpg" /></a> Musharraf faces treason charges for suspending, subverting and abrogating the Constitution, imposing an emergency and detaining judges of the superior courts.
<p>In a setback to embattled former Pakistani military ruler Pervez Musharraf, a special court on Friday dismissed his petition seeking treason trial under the Army Act and summoned him to appear before it on March 11.</p>
<p>The defence had objected to the formation of the three- member special court saying that being the former army chief, 70-year-old Musharraf can only be tried by a military court. The special court, headed by Justice Faisal Arab, had reserved its verdict for today on February 18.</p>
<p>The court dismissed Musharraf&#8217;s petition saying it has the mandate to try him and adjourned the matter till March 4. It also summoned Musharraf to appear before it on March 11. Musharraf faces treason charges for suspending, subverting and abrogating the Constitution, imposing an emergency and detaining judges of the superior courts.</p>
<p>If convicted, he could face life imprisonment or the death penalty. &#8220;He had signed the order (imposition of emergency) as the Army chief and not as President. The judges should have recused themselves as they are biased against Musharraf. They were dismissed by Musharraf and held agitations against him,&#8221; one of Musharraf&#8217;s lawyers Ahmed Raza Kasuri told reporters.</p>
<p>He alleged that facts and laws were &#8220;twisted&#8221;. Earlier, Rana Ijaz Ahmed, another lawyer of Musharraf,  accused the judges of acting like &#8220;rented killers&#8221; when the judgement was read out. Asked if this is how a lawyer should behave, Kasuri said, &#8220;Every person reacts in a different way to a situation. We were also there but didn&#8217;t react in such a manner&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is the first time in Pakistan&#8217;s history that a former military chief is facing trial for treason. Even though Musharraf had appeared before the court during the last hearing, it could not carry forward the proceedings as his lawyers had asked the court to decide on their applications against its mandate first. After skipping numerous hearings, Musharraf was driven to the court in a motorcade from the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology, Rawalpindi amidst tight security on February 18.</p>
<p>His 17-vehicle cavalcade included a bullet-proof car, pilot vehicles and an ambulance. Over 400 personnel were also deployed at the court premises. Musharraf had taken ill and was rushed to the AFIC on January 2 when he was being transported under heavy guard to the special court. He has since been admitted in the hospital.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990178&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three male suicide attackers wearing burqas attacked a police headquarters close to the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday, officials said, killing one policeman as concerns rise over security ahead of the presidential polls.</p>
<p>The militants were shot dead when they stormed the police base in Sarobi district, 50 kilometres east of Kabul, after another suicide attacker died when he exploded a vehicle bomb outside the entrance.</p>
<p>Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the two-hour attack, which occurred in the same district where presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah&#8217;s convoy briefly came under gunfire on Wednesday. &#8220;Today at about 6:20 am, a suicide bomber driving a minivan detonated himself at the entrance gate of the Sarobi police headquarters,&#8221; General Mohammad Zahir, Kabul province&#8217;s police chief, told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;Three other terrorists clad in women&#8217;s burqas entered the courtyard of the building and started firing and resisting the police and army forces. &#8220;As a result of the attack, one officer was killed and three others were wounded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Male militants have previously used the all-enveloping burqa to disguise themselves and evade security checks in Afghanistan, including in a 2012 attack when four French troops were killed. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the insurgents, who were ousted from power in 2001, were behind Friday&#8217;s attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mujahideen fighters were equipped with heavy and light weapons and suicide vests, and caused heavy casualties to the enemy,&#8221; he said in an emailed statement. Sarobi, on the main road between Kabul and Jalalabad city, is a volatile district in a region seen as key to protecting the capital. Afghanistan goes to the polls on April 5 to select a successor to President Hamid Karzai, as some 55,000 US-led combat troops pull out of the country after 13 years of battling the fierce Taliban insurgency.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990072&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>China on Friday lodged a diplomatic protest with the US and asked it to immediately cancel President Barack Obama&#8217;s proposed meeting with the Dalai Lama, saying it will cause &#8220;great damage&#8221; to bilateral ties.</p>
<p>&#8220;We urge the United States to take China&#8217;s concerns seriously and not to facilitate or offer occasion for the Dalai Lama to conduct anti-China secessionist moves,&#8221; Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a press release. Her comments came in response to the scheduled informal Obama-Dalai Lama meeting today in the White House Map Room, a historically important room but of less significance than the Oval Office.&#8221;China is greatly concerned about the meeting, and has lodged solemn representations to the US side,&#8221; Hua said.</p>
<p>The Tibetan issue is a domestic affair for China, she said, adding that there is no other country which bears the right to interfere. The Dalai Lama is a political figure in exile who is undertaking anti-China separatist activities in the name of religion, she said.The arranged meeting between Obama and the Dalai Lama is an unjustified interference with China&#8217;s domestic affairs and a serious violation of the principles of international relations, and will cause great damage to China-US relations, she said.</p>
<p>China has long opposed foreign dignitaries meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959. Obama has met with the Dalai Lama twice before, in 2010 and 2011 which drew similar protests from China. White House on Thursday announced Obama would meet the Dalai Lama on Friday but it was closed to press. &#8220;The President will meet the Dalai Lama in his capacity as an internationally respected religious and cultural leader,&#8221; US National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990031&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police say four people are dead and two are wounded in a shooting at an American Indian tribal headquarters in California.</p>
<p>Alturas Police Chief Ken Barnes says 44-year-old Sherrie Rhoades is in custody after allegedly opening fire yesterday at the Cedarville Rancheria Tribal Office and Community Center.</p>
<p>Barnes says in a report carried by KRCR-TV that the four dead include a 19-year-old woman, a 30-year-old man, a 45-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man. The police chief says one victim is the tribe&#8217;s leader.</p>
<p>Barnes says members were meeting about evicting Rhoades and her son from the Rancheria which, according to its website, is a federally recognized tribe with 35 members. The station says that after running out of ammunition, Rhoades grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed another person.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990011&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>US Vice President Joe Biden has warned the Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych that America was prepared to impose sanctions on officials responsible for violence in Kiev.</p>
<p>Biden spoked to the Ukrainian leader over telephone and &#8220;made clear that the US is prepared to sanction those officials responsible for the violence&#8221;, the White House said in a statement. He called upon President Yanukovych to immediately pull back all security forces – police, snipers, military and paramilitary units, and irregular forces, it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Vice President urged President Yanukovych to take immediate and tangible steps to work with the opposition on a path forward that addresses the legitimate aspirations of the Ukrainian people.&#8221; Biden underscored that the US supports an independent, democratic Ukraine that pursues the future its people choose. The US leader also called the Polish Prime Minister to consult on the situation in Ukraine.</p>
<p>They discussed steps the United States, Poland, and the European Union are taking to support an end to the violence and a political solution that is in the best interests of the Ukrainian people, the statement said. In a late night statement, Secretary of State John Kerry asked the Ukrainian Government to stop violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The violence must stop. We unequivocally condemn the use of force against civilians by security forces, and urge that those forces be withdrawn immediately,&#8221; Kerry said as he expressed his anger and anguish having watched renewed violence on the streets of Kiev. &#8220;The people of Ukraine deserve far better than senseless death and suffering on the streets of one of Europe&#8217;s great cities,&#8221; he said adding that the people of Ukraine and the international community will hold to account those who are responsible for what has occurred.</p>
<p>The US has already begun implementing sanctions through travel bans on Ukrainians responsible for the violence, he said. Noting that protesters should exercise their rights peacefully, he urged the Ukrainian military to remain true to its non-political heritage and its professional traditions. &#8220;There is no time for brinksmanship or gamesmanship. President Yanukovich must undertake serious negotiations with opposition leaders immediately to establish a new interim government that will have broad support,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989987&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The Indian American, accused of medical billing fraud, has said he and his company committed no crime.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989984&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian American owner of a billing firm, who agreed to pay fine of USD 3.3 million along with three others to settle alleged medical overbilling fraud, has said he and his company committed no crime.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of the settlement, Engage denied any liability to the government. Specifically, Engage Medical committed no fraud, admitted no fraud and fought the government for more than two years in an effort to get the truth out,&#8221; Puri said.</p>
<p>He said the government&#8217;s original claim sought many millions of dollars in recovery and in order &#8220;to avoid an expensive and time-consuming defence, Engage determined to agree to a settlement that was only a small per centage of the original claim&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that the case has been settled, it is unfair and irresponsible for the government to make such non-factual, derogatory comments to the public when it, too, decided to settle out of court, when the cost of litigation is so high, and when there is no evidence of fraudulent intent,&#8221; Puri said.</p>
<p>Early this week, the US Attorney&#8217;s Office for District of Maryland said the medical firm and its owner Sanjay Puri, and three medical practices that were its clients have agreed to pay a total of USD 3.3 million to resolve claims that the company overbilled for nuclear stress tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;When medical providers can enrich themselves at taxpayers&#8217; expense by falsely representing that they provided expensive procedures, the government must be vigilant in pursuing fraudulent claims,&#8221; said US Attorney Rod Rosenstein.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who knowingly reports false medical billing codes to induce the government to pay more money is lying, cheating and stealing,&#8221; he had said.</p>
<p>Puri is also the chairman of the US India Political Action Committee, which has been lobbying for BJP.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989984&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/prison-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989955" alt="US Attorney said the defendant supplied addictive drugs, including oxycontin and heroin, to other drug traffickers in America and around the world." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/prison-med.jpg" /></a> US Attorney said the defendant supplied addictive drugs, including oxycontin and heroin, to other drug traffickers in America and around the world.
<p>A Pakistani drug dealer, who operated through internet, has been sentenced to 15 years in jail by a US court on the charges of drug trafficking and money laundering.</p>
<p>36-year-old Shiraz Malik pleaded guilty in October last year of selling pharmaceuticals and highly regulated chemicals to customers in the US, Europe, Mexico, and other countries and conspiring to launder the profits of that activity. According to court documents, Malik operated out of Warsaw, Poland from June 2008 to September 2011.</p>
<p>He was arrested at the Prague International Airport in September 2011, and was extradited from the Czech Republic to the US in June 2012. Malik took orders from customers via internet and coordinated with people in Pakistan to fill the orders, the Justice Department said. It alleged that the drugs were sent from Pakistan to the customers, and the Malik emailed the tracking numbers to buyers that his accomplices gave him. Malik sold large quantities of ephedrine to customers in Mexico, the country of origin for most of the methamphetamine sold in the US, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Malik operated an international supermarket for illegal drugs,&#8221; said US Attorney Benjamin Wagner. &#8220;As the Internet allows everyone access to international markets, federal law enforcement officials will be vigilant in protecting this country from overseas predators who profit off the addiction of others,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The US Attorney said the defendant supplied addictive drugs, including oxycontin and heroin, to other drug traffickers in America and around the world, and supplied materials needed to make methamphetamine to clandestine producers in Mexico and Africa. &#8220;Malik had never set foot in this country before he was arrested and extradited here on these charges,&#8221; the US Attorney said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989947&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>US President Barack Obama will meet Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, a fellow Nobel peace laureate, at the White House on Friday. &#8220;The President will meet the Dalai Lama in his capacity as an internationally respected religious and cultural,&#8221; National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said.</p>
<p>Obama met the Dalai Lama in February 2010 and July 2011, she said adding that the US Presidents of both parties over the past three decades have met with the Dalai Lama in the White House.</p>
<p>Hayden said the United States supported the Dalai Lama&#8217;s &#8220;middle way&#8221; approach of neither assimilation nor independence for Tibetans but recognised Tibet to be &#8220;a part of China&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not support Tibetan independence,&#8221; she said. Hayden said the US strongly supports human rights and religious freedom in China.<br />&#8220;We are concerned about continuing tensions and the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas of China. We will continue to urge the Chinese government to resume dialogue with the Dalai Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, as a means to reduce tensions,&#8221; Hayden said. The Nobel peace prize winner, who is here for a two-week tour of the US west coast, on Thursday told a Washington audience that he is warming to capitalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now after listening to the presenters, I developed more respect about capitalism. Otherwise, my impression is capitalism only take the money, then exploitation,&#8221; the Dalai Lama said at a panel discussion at the American Enterprise Institute.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989936&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/obamam1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1965304" alt="The White House has urged Yanukovych to withdraw forces from downtown Kiev immediately." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/obamam1.jpg" /></a> The White House has urged Yanukovych to withdraw forces from downtown Kiev immediately.
<p>The White House expressed renewed outrage over the continuing deadly violence in Ukraine, and Secretary of State John Kerry late Thursday said the U.S. has started “implementing sanctions through travel bans on Ukrainians responsible for the violence.”</p>
<p>The White House said Vice President Joe Biden, the Obama administration&#8217;s prime contact with President Viktor Yanukovych in recent days, spoke to the Ukrainian leader by telephone Thursday afternoon and made clear that the U.S. is prepared to sanction officials responsible for the violence.<br />
In Brussels, the 28-nation European Union decided Thursday in an emergency meeting to impose sanctions against those behind the violence, including a travel ban and an asset freeze against some Ukrainian officials.</p>
<p>Ukrainian government snipers fired upon advancing protesters in the capital, Kiev, on Thursday, killing at least 70 people and wounding hundreds of others. At least 101 people have died this week in the clashes, according to protesters and Ukrainian authorities, a sharp and deadly turn in three months of mostly peaceful activity.</p>
<p>The White House has urged Yanukovych to withdraw forces from downtown Kiev immediately. Military action by the U.S. is not among the options being considered, deputy spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had tried to reach the Ukrainian defense ministry to discuss the violence, but &#8220;they have been unresponsive to our requests.&#8221; Kirby said the lack of responsiveness was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Kerry condemned the violence in a statement, saying he felt &#8220;anger and anguish.&#8221; He called on Yanukovych to undertake serious negotiations with opposition leaders immediately. “The violence must stop,&#8221; Kerry said. &#8220;We unequivocally condemn the use of force against civilians by security forces, and urge that those forces be withdrawn immediately. The people of Ukraine and the international community will hold to account those who are responsible for what has occurred, and the United States has already begun implementing sanctions through travel bans on Ukrainians responsible for the violence.”</p>
<p>President Barack Obama discussed the situation by telephone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the White House said. Earnest said the Ukrainian government has the primary responsibility for keeping the peace but that the Ukrainian people must also respect their right to peaceful protest. He said &#8220;having those rights trampled&#8221; is a source of some concern to the U.S., and again called on the government and the opposition to negotiate a political solution to restore order. “Basic human rights that we hold so dear in this country are not being respected in that country,” Earnest said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989922&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukraine-med1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989823" alt="Fierce clashes between police and protesters, some including gunfire, shattered a brief truce in Ukraine's besieged capital Thursday, killing numerous people. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ukraine-med1.jpg" /></a> Fierce clashes between police and protesters, some including gunfire, shattered a brief truce in Ukraine&#8217;s besieged capital Thursday, killing numerous people. (AP)
<p>Fearing that a call for truce was a ruse, protesters tossed firebombs and advanced upon police lines Thursday in Ukraine’s embattled capital. Government snipers shot back and the almost-medieval melee that ensued left at least 70 dead and hundreds injured, according to a protest doctor.</p>
<p>Video footage on Ukrainian television showed shocking scenes Thursday of protesters being cut down by gunfire, lying on the pavement as comrades rushed to their aid. Trying to protect themselves with shields, teams of protesters carried bodies away on sheets of plastic or on planks of wood.</p>
<p>Protesters were also seen leading policemen with their hands held high around the sprawling protest camp in central Kiev. Ukraine’s Interior ministry says 67 police were captured in all.  It was not clear how they were taken. An opposition lawmaker said they were being held in Kiev’s occupied city hall.</p>
<p>At least 99 people have died this week in the clashes in Kiev, a sharp reversal in three months of mostly peaceful protests. Now neither side appears willing to compromise, with the opposition insisting on Yanukovych’s resignation and an early election and the president apparently prepared to fight until the end.</p>
<p>Thursday was the deadliest day yet at the sprawling protest camp on Kiev’s Independence Square, also called the Maidan. An AP cameraman saw snipers shooting at protesters in Kiev and video footage showed at least one sniper wearing a Ukraine riot police uniform.</p>
<p>Dr Oleh Musiy, the top medical coordinator for the protesters, told the AP that at least 70 protesters were killed Thursday and over 500 injured. He said the death toll from the day’s clashes could well rise further.  There was no way to immediately verify his statement.<br />
The Interior Ministry warned Kiev residents to stay indoors Thursday due to the “armed, aggressive mood of people”.</p>
<p>Yanukovych claimed Thursday that police were not armed and “all measures to stop bloodshed and confrontation are being taken”. But the Interior Ministry later contradicted that, saying law enforcers would get weapons as part of an “anti-terrorist” operation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989817&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/canada.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1989658" alt="canada" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/canada.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper have put both national pride and cases of beer on the line in a friendly wager on the Canada-U.S. Olympic hockey matches.</p>
<p>In what has become an Olympic tradition between the leaders, Obama and Harper announced on Twitter that they have staked a case of cold ones on the outcome of each of the women&#8217;s&#8217; and men&#8217;s&#8217; matchups.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a very brief period of time, I may not feel as warm towards Canadians as I normally do, at least until those matches are over,&#8221; Obama quipped to Harper during a leaders&#8217; summit in Toluca, Mexico on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The women&#8217;s teams play for the gold medal on Thursday. Canada has won the gold three times in a row.</p>
<p>The Canada and U.S. men&#8217;s teams face off in a semi-finals match on Friday.</p>
<p>In 2010, Obama delivered a case of Molson Canadian beer to Harper after Team Canada won the men&#8217;s&#8217; gold in overtime in the Vancouver Olympics.</p>
<p>Their press secretaries bet on the women&#8217;s game, and Obama&#8217;s then-spokesman Robert Gibbs had to wear a Team Canada jersey to his daily briefing when he lost the wager to Harper&#8217;s then-spokesman Dimitri Soudas.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989656&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Earlier the ministry said &#8220;Berkut&#8221; riot policemen had been armed with combat weapons, an attempt to regain control of violent protests in which at least 50 people have died since Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;To free the hostages police have the right to use their weapons,&#8221; the ministry said in a statement posted to its website.

(Reuters)
<p>Defending a proposed Economic Corridor through the disputed Kashmir region, China on Thursday said the multi-billion dollar project will have &#8220;no detriment&#8221; to the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>The 2,000-km corridor connecting China&#8217;s Xinjiang region with Gwadar Port in southwestern Pakistan is aimed at improving the well-being of people and is &#8220;not directed against the third party and (will) have no detriment to the relevant parties&#8217; position on this issue&#8221;, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chuying said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will press ahead with the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and construction of Gwadar Port as well as construction of industrial parks and other infrastructure construction,&#8221; she told a media briefing here.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kashmir issue is one left over from history. Pakistan and India should resolve it through dialogue and consultations between the two countries,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>China and Pakistan have reached &#8220;important consensus&#8221; on deepening cooperation in various fields, Hua said, elaborating on talks yesterday between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his visiting Pakistani counterpart Mamnoon Hussain.</p>
<p>The proposed corridor was discussed by the two leaders.</p>
<p>Hua evaded a query on the route for the proposed corridor and said, &#8220;With regard to whether the economic corridor passes through the Kashmir area, as far as I have learnt, a joint commission for its construction has been established by the two sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>The commission&#8217;s second meeting in Beijing coincided with Hussain&#8217;s visit, his first foreign trip since he assumed office last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This meeting had in-depth exchange of views on planning and construction of the corridor as well as cooperation in energy and technical field,&#8221; Hua said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know if they talked about whether this corridor passes through this region but I can tell you we hope that the Kashmir issue can be resolved through consultations and negotiations between India and Pakistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>A joint statement issued after the talks between Xi and Hussain yesterday said China would continue to stand firmly behind Pakistan&#8217;s efforts to uphold its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. China also praised Pakistan&#8217;s fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>Besides Xi, Hussain held talks with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989579&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every dog has his day! A dog filed to run for mayor of a US city but the campaign was cut short as the canine&#8217;s paper work was not in order.</p>
<p>Dylan Westie, a West Highland White Terrier, filed to run for mayor of Irving, Texas, saying in a prepared statement that &#8220;a significant portion of council leadership has gone to the dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mike Howard, the dog&#8217;s owner, agent and attorney, on Tuesday, filed a petition on the Terrier&#8217;s behalf to be on the ballot for the May 5 election, CBS News reported.</p>
<p>But the campaign quickly collapsed as Westie&#8217;s candidate forms were so riddled with technical errors that the city rejected them even before considering his species.</p>
<p>Howard filed the petition, complete with valid signatures to put Dylan&#8217;s name on the ballot. The paperwork explained, Dylan is a registered &#8220;son of a&#8230; female Westie.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the city said Dylan&#8217;s not a registered voter and therefore, does not qualify. Howard said Dylan has some serious thoughts about the problems plaguing Irving and has even taken to Twitter to have his bark heard.<br />
&#8220;He does not do a great job at typing. But&#8230;you&#8217;ll find some really good tweets out there, Howard was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Howard has been writing political satire since 1984. On being asked by The Dallas Morning News that why he failed to notarise either his signature as Dylan&#8217;s affiant or Dylan’s signature, he said &#8220;It would be a paw print, had I let him sign. I did not want to get ink on his paws.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He (Dylan) knew it would be an uphill battle. He realised at the onset he would never be able to be qualified. For one, he needs to be a registered voter in Dallas County. Dylan is registered with the American Kennel Club,&#8221; Howard said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989522&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ban.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989452" alt="In the previous upazila elections in 2009, the Awam League-backed candidates won most of the seats." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ban.jpg" /></a> In the previous upazila elections in 2009, the Awam League-backed candidates won most of the seats.
<p>Opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former prime minister Khaleda Zia led the first phase of a crucial local government election triumphing in 43 out of 97 sub-districts, as the polls came six weeks after the general elections in Bangladesh which the party had boycotted.</p>
<p>According to unofficial results, the BNP candidates won in the 43 sub-districts or upazila councils giving the party an unbeatable lead while the ruling Awami League won in 34 councils as the first round of voting for the local body polls was held Wednesday.</p>
<p>Several newspapers dubbed it a &#8220;high-voltage election&#8221; held in a peaceful manner, a month after Bangladesh witnessed its worst political violence during the general elections.</p>
<p>Candidates backed by BNP&#8217;s key ally fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami secured 13 upazilas, though the party was stripped off its registration with the election commission under a High Court judgement that disqualified it for polls.</p>
<p>Under the law, the elections in local government bodies including the upazilas are non-party polls but major parties field their candidates to test their popularity giving it a political colour.</p>
<p>Reports and witnesses said some stray incidents of violence marred the polls atmosphere at places but in most areas the polls were held peacefully while troops were deployed to handle any law and order situation.</p>
<p>In a dramatic shift, BNP, which had boycotted the general elections, fielded its candidates in the local body polls.</p>
<p>According to analysts, the results of the first phase upazila polls would give a boost to the winning camp in the next phases of the local body polls as elections in 117 upazilas would be held in the second phase on February 27, 83 upazilas in the third phase on March 15, and 92 upazilas in the fourth.</p>
<p>In the previous upazila elections in 2009, the Awam League-backed candidates won most of the seats.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989433&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A local beauty queen died of a gunshot wound on Wednesday, the fifth fatality from Venezuela&#8217;s political unrest, as imprisoned protest leader Leopoldo Lopez urged supporters to keep fighting for the departure of the socialist government.</p>
<p>Tensions have risen in Venezuela since Lopez, a 42-year-old Harvard-educated economist, turned himself in to troops on Tuesday after spearheading three weeks of often rowdy protests against President Nicolas Maduro&#8217;s government. The latest victims of the unrest included college student and model Genesis Carmona, 22, who was shot in the head at a protest on Tuesday in the central city of Valencia. She died later in a clinic.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long are we going to live like this? How long do we have to tolerate this pressure, with them killing us?&#8221; a relative, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. &#8220;She only needed one more semester to graduate,&#8221; he added of Carmona, who had been studying tourism and had won the 2013 Miss Tourism competition in her state.</p>
<p>Three people were shot dead in Caracas after an opposition rally a week ago, and a fourth person died after being run over by a car during a demonstration in the coastal town of Carupano. Scores of people have been arrested or injured.</p>
<p>State television channel VTV said the mother of one its employees died while being rushed to hospital in Caracas. VTV said she suffered a heart attack while the ambulance carrying her was stuck in gridlock due to opposition supporters blocking roads. &#8220;We cannot underestimate those fascist groups whose boss is behind bars,&#8221; Maduro said in a nationally televised speech late on Wednesday. &#8220;I&#8217;m not playing with democracy. I do not accept that they challenge the Venezuelan people and our Constitution.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989289&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1989194" alt="The latest warning was focused on flights headed to the United States from abroad. AP photo" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/shoebombap480.jpg" /> The latest warning was focused on flights headed to the United States from abroad. AP photo
<p>The U.S Department of Homeland Security has warned airlines that terrorists could try to hide explosives in shoes. It&#8217;s the second time in less than three weeks that the government has issued a warning about possible attempts to smuggle explosives on a commercial jetliner.</p>
<p>Homeland Security said Wednesday it regularly shares relevant information with domestic and international partners, but it declined to discuss specifics of a warning sent to airlines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our security apparatus includes a number of measures, both seen and unseen, informed by the latest intelligence and as always DHS continues to adjust security measures to fit an ever evolving threat environment,&#8221; the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>A U.S. intelligence official told The Associated Press that DHS released a notice to airlines reiterating that liquids, shoes and certain cosmetics were of concern, all of which are covered under existing Transportation Security Administration security policies.</p>
<p>The latest warning was focused on flights headed to the United States from abroad.</p>
<p>The official said &#8220;something caused DHS concern, but it&#8217;s a very low threshold to trigger a warning like this.&#8221; The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Homeland Security warned airlines with flights to Russia to be on the lookout for explosive devices possibly hidden inside toothpaste. The Transportation Security Administration then banned passengers from bringing any liquids in their carry-on luggage on nonstop flights from the U.S. to Russia. That warning became public just days before the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Sochi.</p>
<p>It is unclear if the latest warning, first reported Wednesday by NBC News, is related to the earlier threats to Russia-bound flights.</p>
<p>Air passengers in the United States have had to take off their shoes at airport security checkpoints since shortly after Richard Reid tried to ignite explosives hidden in his shoes on a Miami-bound flight in late 2001. Reid pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and is serving a life sentence.</p>
<p>The traveling public has grown increasingly impatient with expanding security checks at airports.</p>
<p>TSA in recent years has changed some security procedures to allow young children and passengers 75 and older to keep their shoes on. The security agency has also launched a fee-based program that allows willing flyers to submit to background checks and avoid having to remove their shoes, jackets and small amounts of liquids packed in carry-on luggage.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989191&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The U.S Department of Homeland Security has warned airlines that terrorists could try to hide explosives in shoes. It&#8217;s the second time in less than three weeks that the government has issued a warning about possible attempts to smuggle explosives on a commercial jetliner.</p>
<p>Homeland Security said on Wednesday it regularly shares relevant information with domestic and international partners, but it declined to discuss specifics of a warning sent to airlines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our security apparatus includes a number of measures, both seen and unseen, informed by the latest intelligence and as always DHS continues to adjust security measures to fit an ever evolving threat environment,&#8221; the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>A U.S. intelligence official told The Associated Press that DHS released a notice to airlines reiterating that liquids, shoes and certain cosmetics were of concern, all of which are covered under existing Transportation Security Administration security policies.</p>
<p>The latest warning was focused on flights headed to the United States from abroad.</p>
<p>The official said &#8220;something caused DHS concern, but it&#8217;s a very low threshold to trigger a warning like this.&#8221; The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Homeland Security warned airlines with flights to Russia to be on the lookout for explosive devices possibly hidden inside toothpaste. The Transportation Security Administration then banned passengers from bringing any liquids in their carry-on luggage on nonstop flights from the U.S. to Russia. That warning became public just days before the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Sochi.</p>
<p>It is unclear if the latest warning, first reported Wednesday by NBC News, is related to the earlier threats to Russia-bound flights.</p>
<p>Air passengers in the United States have had to take off their shoes at airport security checkpoints since shortly after Richard Reid tried to ignite explosives hidden in his shoes on a Miami-bound flight in late 2001. Reid pleaded guilty to terrorism charges and is serving a life sentence.</p>
<p>The traveling public has grown increasingly impatient with expanding security checks at airports.</p>
<p>TSA in recent years has changed some security procedures to allow young children and passengers 75 and older to keep their shoes on.<br /> The security agency has also launched a fee-based program that allows willing flyers to submit to background checks and avoid having to remove their shoes, jackets and small amounts of liquids packed in carry-on luggage.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989155&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/taliban-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989131" alt=" The sources said that the attacks were aimed at protecting people of Pakistan as the militants were making plans to carry out terrorist attacks.  (File photo: Reuters)  " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/taliban-m.jpg" /></a> <br />The sources said that the attacks were aimed at protecting people of Pakistan as the militants were making plans to carry out terrorist attacks. (File photo: Reuters)
<p>Pakistani fighter jets bombed suspected militant hideouts in an ethnic Pashtun area on the Afghan border on Thursday, killing at least 40, security officials said, after attempts to engage insurgents in peace talks collapsed this week.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif authorised the air strikes, a source in his office said &#8211; a possible sign he was finally giving in to pressure from the military for tougher military action against Pakistani Taliban strongholds.</p>
<p>“After restraining the army for three days, the prime minister himself authorised the strikes last night,” the government official said. “It was the only option to teach the Taliban a lesson.”<br />
Sharif, who came to power last year promising to find a negotiated peace with the Taliban, has been trying to engage the militants in negotiations.</p>
<p>But talks broke down this week when a Taliban wing operating in the Mohmand Pashtun tribal region said it had executed 23 soldiers in revenge for the killing of their fighters by the security forces.</p>
<p>“At least 40 militants were killed in the precision strikes in the Mir Ali area,” one Pakistani intelligence official told Reuters. “Six different locations were bombed.”<br />
Another official said among the army’s targets were training camps run by Uzbek and Turkmen fighters.</p>
<p>Earlier, security officials had said fifteen militants were killed.</p>
<p>The air strikes could herald a broader military offensive in North Waziristan, a region where many al Qaeda-linked militants are based.</p>
<p>The morning air attacks came just hours after the army said more than 100 soldiers had been killed by Taliban militants in the last five months, a rare admission of relatively heavy casualties.</p>
<p>In an unusually tough statement, Sharif’s spokesman said in televised remarks late on Wednesday that the army was capable of crushing all enemies.</p>
<p>“The prime minister wants to resolve these issues without bloodshed but if the Taliban continue killing people then we will be left with no choice but to keep our citizens safe from terrorism through any means possible,” spokesman Pervez Rashid said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989125&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s embattled president and leaders of the protests roiling the country agreed on a truce, following a flareup of violence that left at least 26 people dead in the capital.</p>
<p>A brief statement on the presidential website on Wednesday said President Viktor Yanukovych met with opposition leaders and they called for a truce and for negotiations on ending bloodshed to begin.</p>
<p>The statement did not give details of what a truce would entail or how it would be implemented.</p>
<p>The statement also did not specify how the negotiations would be conducted or give an indication of how they could be different from previous meetings of the president and the opposition leaders.</p>
<p>But one of the protest leaders, Vitali Klitschko, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying after the meeting that Yanukovych had ensured them there would be no attempt to storm the protesters&#8217; encampment on the main square of downtown Kiev.</p>
<p>There, flames from burning barricades of tires and refuse leapt into the air for a second night, as protesters demanding Yanukovych&#8217;s resignation showed no sign of yielding.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989083&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Gunmen from Nigeria&#8217;s Boko Haram Islamist group attacked the northeastern town of Bama on Wednesday, opening fire on a  school, shooting or burning to death 47 people and trashing the palace of a traditional ruler, officials and witnesses said.</p>
<p>The death toll was confirmed by Lawal Tanko, the police commissioner for Borno state, which lies at the epicentre of an Islamist insurgency that has killed thousands in the past four and half years. Many more were wounded, he said.</p>
<p>He added that the assailants had also partly burned down the palace of the traditional ruler of Borno, whose kingdom was one of West Africa&#8217;s oldest medieval Islamic caliphates.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boko Haram came in at about 4.00 a.m. (0300 GMT), just when we were getting ready for the morning prayers,&#8221; said Bama resident Abba Masta, who lives near the palace.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was shooting everywhere and they set the palace on fire. Many died. Students had to run for their lives as they attacked the government girls college as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was one of several deadly attacks this week.</p>
<p>On Sunday the Islamists killed 106 people in Igze village, according to official figures, making it one of their deadliest assaults so far. That prompted the Borno state governor to say the rebels were better armed and motivated than government forces.</p>
<p>&#8220;The senseless targeting of innocent civilians is unacceptable,&#8221; U.S. State Department spokesman for Africa Will Stevens said in Washington on Wednesday, referring to the Igze attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We encourage Nigerian authorities to investigate this heinous act and to hold accountable &#8230; those responsible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The military denied Boko Haram were better armed or motivated and said it was making progress, but that no country facing terrorism had defeated it completely.</p>
<p>President Goodluck Jonathan ordered extra troops into northeast Nigeria in May to crush Boko Haram, which wants to create a breakaway Islamic state in the largely Muslim north, but the offensive, backed by air power, has so far failed.</p>
<p>The militants have retreated into the remote, hilly Gwoza area bordering Cameroon, from where they mount deadly attacks against civilians they accuse of being pro-government, and are abducting scores of girls &#8211; a new tactic eerily reminiscent of Uganda&#8217;s cult-like Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army in decades past.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Boko Haram fighters attacked the house of an army general in the village of Buratai in Borno state, killing a soldier guarding it, Tanko said.</p>
<p>He said General Umar Tukur Buratai, who is stationed in the southern Niger Delta, was not there at the time of the assault, which had inflicted &#8220;minimal damage&#8221;.</p>
<p>Jonathan faces an election in a year, with Boko Haram&#8217;s persistence as the number one threat to Africa&#8217;s top oil producer fuelling criticism that he has failed on security.   (Additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton in Washington; Writing by Tim Cocks)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989060&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

</dl>
<p>Western powers threatened sanctions on Wednesday over the death of 26 people in the worst violence since Ukraine’s independence from the Soviet Union, pressuring President Viktor Yanukovich to compromise with his pro-European opponents.</p>
<p>In the evening, Yanukovich replaced Colonel-General Volodymyr Zamana with Admiral Yury Ilyin as the new head of the armed forces general staff.</p>
<p>The president, who is backed by Russia, had earlier denounced the overnight bloodshed in central Kiev as an attempted coup, and his security service said it had launched a nationwide “anti-terrorist operation” after arms and ammunition dumps were looted.</p>
<p>In the western bastion of Ukrainian nationalism, a regional assembly declared self-rule and crowds seized public buildings.</p>
<p>European Union leaders condemned “the unjustified use of excessive force by the Ukrainian authorities” and said they were urgently preparing targeted sanctions against officials responsible for the crackdown. The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland will visit Yanukovich on Thursday, hours before an emergency EU meeting to decide on the sanctions.</p>
<p>Protesters have been occupying central Kiev for almost three months since Yanukovich spurned a far-reaching trade deal with the EU and accepted a $15-billion Russian bailout instead. Their struggle with government forces was played out at close quarters, hand to hand, in fighting through the night on Kiev’s Independence Square, or Maidan.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, fires blazed along the barricaded frontline between protesters and riot police but there was no immediate sign of a repetition of Tuesday’s violence. A trade union building that protest organisers had used as a headquarters stood blackened and gutted by fire.</p>
<p>Security forces occupied about a third of the square, while protesters reinforced defences on the remainder of the Maidan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988794&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian male house nurse was stabbed to death by an Ethiopian co-maid in the Saudi Arabia city of Dammam, local media reported wednesday.</p>
<p>Hussain Sayeed, who was killed on Monday, hails from Hyderabad and was working with a Saudi family living in the Mubarakia area of the Corniche in Dammam, capital of Eastern Province.</p>
<p>Hussain was working as a male nurse to the family for nearly two years and the Ethiopian housemaid who stabbed Sayeed to death was also working in the same house.</p>

<p>Nepal&#8217;s Prime Minister Sushil Koirala Wednesday said his government is committed to create a conducive atmosphere to reach a consensus with all political parties to promulgate the new constitution within a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government is committed to creating an atmosphere for giving a federal democratic constitution to the Nepali people within a year on the basis of consensus among all political parties within and outside the Constituent Assembly,&#8221; he said addressing a function here to mark the Democracy Day.</p>
<p>The new government led by the Nepali Congress was formed with the completion of the second Constituent Assembly polls in November which has been shouldered with the responsibility of drafting a new constitution on the basis of consensus, cooperation and unity at the political level, said Koirala.</p>
<p>Koirala said commitments to civil rights and democratic norms and values will create a basis of mutual trust among the political parties.</p>
<p>He observed that the Nepali society, which is rich with diversity of language, ethnicity, religion and culture, can only be united through the democratic rule.</p>
<p>Koirala, president of Nepal&#8217;s biggest political party, was elected as Prime Minister on February 11 with 405 votes in favour in the 601-member Constituent Assembly, ending months of political crisis in the country.</p>
<p>The six-decade-long struggles launched for democracy in Nepal has witnessed many ups and downs, Koirala said, adding democracy achieved through sacrifices of Nepali people was suppressed many times and one has to learn lessons from such tragic moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Democracy would be itself consolidated if the problems related to poverty and unemployment of the people could be resolved through economic prosperity and development,&#8221; said Koirala.</p>
<p>Koirala appealed to all &#8220;political parties to extend cooperation, participation and collaboration in fulfilling this great responsibility&#8221;.</p>
<p>Notably, Koirala could not expand his two-member cabinet for the past one week after key ally CPN-UML decided not to provide the list of its nominees for the council of ministers after he rejected its demand for Home portfolio.</p>
<p>The Democracy Day is being organised every year to commemorate the day when democracy was ushered in Nepal through untiring struggle and sacrifice. Nepal became a republic nation in 2008, ending the 240-year rule of the monarchy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988637&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-year-old US girl has entered the genius club Mensa after scoring an incredible 160 in the IQ test, making her as intelligent as Albert Einstein.</p>
<p>Alexis Martin from Arizona, who can label all the continents and countries on a map, is the youngest person from the state to enter Mensa.</p>
<p>The elite club only accepts people with Intelligence quotient (IQ) in the top two per cent of the world.</p>
<p>Martin&#8217;s parents first noticed her abilities when she was able to exactly recite the bedtime story from the night before, KABC-TV reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;So then dad would try to pitch in, &#8216;Oh, yeah, and then the elephant was the one that was sharing.&#8217; And she would correct me and say, &#8216;No dad, it was the kangaroo that was sharing,&#8217;&#8221; said her father, Ian.</p>
<p>The average person has an IQ of about 100, the report said.</p>
<p>Alexis is also fluent in Spanish, which she learnt using an application on a tablet.</p>
<p>Although, Einstein never took an IQ test as none of the modern intelligence tests existed during the course of his life, but experts believe he had an IQ of around 160.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988547&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/somalia-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988493" alt="The food security unit said about 75 per cent of the 857,000 Somalis who urgently need food are displaced from their homes, largely as a result of fighting. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/somalia-m.jpg" /></a> The food security unit said about 75 per cent of the 857,000 Somalis who urgently need food are displaced from their homes, largely as a result of fighting. (Reuters)
<p>More than 850,000 people in Somalia are in desperate need of food and &#8220;in crisis and emergency conditions,&#8221; the director of UN humanitarian operations said today.</p>
<p>John Ging, who just returned from a three-day visit to Somalia, said another two million Somalis are considered to be &#8220;food insecure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These figures are very, very large,&#8221; he told a news conference. &#8220;They tell us a simple message which is that the situation in Somalia for Somalis on the humanitarian side is very grave. It&#8217;s also very fragile.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ging said the UN World Food Program&#8217;s Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit reported this month that 8,57,000 Somalis are in acute crisis conditions and require urgent humanitarian assistance. This is &#8220;a modest improvement&#8221; from the previous six months when 870,000 Somalis desperately needed food, he said.</p>
<p>Somalia has long been a rudderless nation plagued by cyclical drought and famine and decades of armed conflict. Its population is estimated to be about 10 million.</p>
<p>In recent years it has made some strides in security and governance, particularly since August 2011, when al-Shabab militants were forced out of the capital, Mogadishu. But the al-Qaida linked rebels have not been defeated and the government controls only small parts of the country and is struggling to provide security and battle corruption.</p>
<p>The food security unit said about 75 per cent of the 857,000 Somalis who urgently need food are displaced from their homes, largely as a result of fighting, insecurity and lack of food. Ging said others are in rural areas that are very hard to access.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2011, we had a global tragedy where 2,60,000 people died of famine in Somalia,&#8221; Ging said. &#8220;We are working very hard to help the people recover in circumstances which are extremely difficult the climate is very harsh and the security situation equally so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The United Nations appealed for USD 933 million for the humanitarian crisis in Somalia this year, but Ging said so far it has received only USD 36 million which is &#8220;very ominous.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2011, the UN appeal for Somalia was 86 per cent funded, but in 2013 it was just 50 per cent funded, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somalis have suffered endlessly for almost 25 years. We cannot be distracted now from our task to stay with them, to help to consolidate these fragile gains &#8230; and this requires funding,&#8221; Ging said. &#8220;We need to keep our attention on Somalia. It&#8217;s incredibly fragile and we don&#8217;t want a repeat of what happened in 2011.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988474&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lebanon-480.jpg" /></a> Blast in Shiite area of beirut claimed two lives. (AP)
<p>A blast in a Shiite district in southern Beirut killed at least two people on Wednesday, security officials said — the latest apparent attack linked to the civil war in neighbouring Syria.</p>
<p>An Associated Press photographer in the area said he heard two explosions near the Kuwaiti Embassy and Iran&#8217;s cultural center. Fire engines and ambulances rushed to the area and were seen evacuating some of the wounded in stretchers. Soldiers also deployed and cordoned the area.</p>
<p>Officials said another six people were wounded. They spoke anonymously as they were not authorised to talk to the press. A wave of bombings linked to the war in neighbouring Syria has struck Lebanon over the past few months, killing and wounding scores of people. Many have hit Shiite areas.</p>
<p>One of the deadliest attacks occurred in November, when two suicide attackers blew themselves outside the Iranian Embassy in Beirut, killing 23 people and wounded dozens.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s explosion in the Beir Hassan area was few hundred meters (yards) from the Iranian embassy. Iran is a major backer of Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite militia. Both are allies with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Syrian rebels have vowed to strike against Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon in retaliation for its participation in the war.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988470&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>An Australian man working as a Christian missionary was arrested in Pyongyang on Sunday, the wife of 75 year-old John Short told Reuters on Wednesday. Short, who was on his second trip to North Korea, was in possession of religious materials that had been translated into Korean, a press release by the family said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit traumatic, it&#8217;s been 48 hours and my husband is still there,&#8221; Short&#8217;s wife, Karen said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong. &#8220;I&#8217;m not upset, we&#8217;re Christian missionaries and we have tremendous support for what we do.&#8221; She said the Australian government, which does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, was using its consulate in Seoul and the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang to handle the case.</p>
<p>Short said that on his first trip to North Korea, her husband had been transparent about his faith and had openly read his bible in front of North Korean government guides when in Pyongyang. &#8220;He&#8217;s courageous, this is my husband&#8217;s character,&#8221; said Short. &#8220;I hope things get better &#8212; he&#8217;s in God&#8217;s hands, we both totally believe that. He won&#8217;t be intimidated by the communists.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988323&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Ukrainian president is blaming opposition leaders for the deadly violence that has erupted in central Kiev.</p>
<p>In a statement published online early Wednesday, President Viktor Yanukovych said that he had already made several attempts to compromise, but that opposition leaders &#8220;crossed a line when they called people to arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yanukovych said opposition leaders had to &#8220;draw a boundary between themselves and radical forces,&#8221; or else &#8220;acknowledge that they are supporting radicals. Then the conversation &#8230; will already be of a different kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The defiant tone of the statement left little hope of a compromise to resolve the crisis, which erupted three months ago when Yanukovych shelved an association deal with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia.</p>
<p>At least 16 people have been killed in fierce clashes in Kiev between protesters and riot police, the bloodiest outburst of violence in nearly three months of demonstrations.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s political crisis escalated sharply early on Tuesday between anti-government demonstrators and police in Kiev. The clashes outside parliament erupted after the opposition accused the government of ignoring its demands even after nearly three months of protests that have paralysed the capital. It was the worst violence since the protests began in late November.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988299&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>The top UN human rights official has asked global leaders to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court following a report documenting crimes against humanity in the country. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said the international community has paid &#8220;insufficient attention&#8221; to human rights violations of an &#8220;unimaginable scale&#8221; which have been ongoing in North Korea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Insufficient attention was being paid to the kind of horrific and sustained human rights violations that are reported to be taking place on an ongoing basis&#8221; in North Korea, Pillay said. &#8220;&#8230;call on the international community, in line with the report’s recommendations, to use all the mechanisms at its disposal to ensure accountability, including referral to the International Criminal Court,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The report released on Tuesday will be formally presented to the Human Rights Council in Geneva on March 17. It documents crimes such as &#8220;extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, forcible transfer of populations, enforced disappearance and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pillay said there is a need for strong international leadership to follow up on the grave findings of the report. The Indian-origin UN official said there can no longer be any excuses for inaction regarding rights abuses in North Korea. She said the commission has published a &#8220;historic report&#8221;, which sheds light on violations of a &#8220;terrifying scale&#8221;, the gravity and nature of which do not have any &#8220;parallel in the contemporary world.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 400-pages, the Commission found that North Korea &#8220;displays many attributes of a totalitarian State&#8221; and reports that the cited crimes against humanity are ongoing due to the &#8220;policies, institutions and patterns of impunity that lie at their heart remain in place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pillay said it is vitally important to maintain the momentum on addressing the serious violations that the report documents in a comprehensive manner.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988286&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thai protesters seeking to oust Thailand Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra on Wednesday threatened to storm her temporary office, a day after street clashes left five people dead and 70 others injured. People&#8217;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) led by opposition leader Suthep Thaugsuban announced that it would mobilise protesters from all rally sites in the capital to evict Yingluck from her temporary office at Muang Thong Thani.</p>
<p>Suthep said that demonstrators would follow Yingluck wherever she goes. The PDRC&#8217;s move came after the caretaker government<br />
mobilised thousands of policemen to disperse anti-government protesters at several sites across the city. Yesterday, hundreds of riot police carrying shields began operations across Bangkok to reclaim buildings seized by protesters resulting in the clashes that left five people dead.</p>
<p>The dead included one policeman. The PDRC said it will also seek a Civil Court injunction to protect right to demonstrate, which it says were abused on Tuesday by the police attempts to reclaim rally sites. The protesters backed by the main opposition Democrat Party have been rallying in Bangkok since November to try to oust Yingluck, whom they view as a proxy for her elder brother Thaksin Shinawatra, a former premier who was toppled in a military coup in 2006.</p>
<p>They want the government to hand over power to an unelected people&#8217;s council to implement reforms they say are needed to end corruption. The premier called for a snap polls on February 2 to defuse crisis but the Democrats decided to boycott it. The protesters blocked polling stations in Bangkok and southern provinces.</p>
<p>Yingluck ran into further trouble yesterday the National Anti-Corruption Commission said it has found grounds to press charges and initiate impeachment proceedings against her for alleged negligence and dereliction of duty in the rice scheme which has cost the country dearly.</p>
<p>A large number of rice farmers who entered the programme have not yet received payment and are now in serious financial difficulty.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988279&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/edathy-480.jpg" /></a> Indian-origin ex german MP Sebastian Edathy has been accused of child pornography. (AP)
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel held an emergency meeting with the leaders of coalition partners to defuse a widening crisis in her two-month-old government sparked by the opening of a child pornography probe against Indian-origin former lawmaker Sebastian Edathy.</p>
<p>Merkel met Horst Seehofer, chairman of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and Sigmar Gabriel, chairman of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), for about three hours yesterday in the backdrop of the rising tension within the coalition following the resignation of Food and Agriculture Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich.</p>
<p>Friedrich quit last week over suspicions he leaked confidential information about the probe against Sebastian Edathy while serving as interior minister. Edathy, son of a migrant from Kerala, has denied wrongdoing but has left parliament. The three leaders left the meeting without making any statement. The state prosecutor&#8217;s office in Hannover, which is conducting the investigation, said their raids on the houses and offices of Edathy provided very little evidence relevant for a criminal prosecution against Edathy and they believed that he had received advanced information about the raids.</p>
<p>Edathy was the SPD&#8217;s home affairs spokesman until August and a member of the party&#8217;s managing board. He unexpectedly laid down his seat in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, on February 7, few days before the prosecutor&#8217;s office opened its probe. Ahead of yesterday&#8217;s meeting, Merkel called for a thorough clarification of the child pornography affair involving Edathy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988242&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>The US has dismissed the accusation of the Venezuelan government as &#8220;baseless and false&#8221; that its diplomats were allegedly organising anti-government protests in the country. The US reaction came after Venezuela on Monday ordered expulsion of three of its diplomats &#8211; Breann Marie McCusker, Jeffrey Gordon Elsen and Kristopher Lee Clark &#8211; accusing them of plotting with anti-government protesters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The allegations against our diplomats by the Venezuelan government are baseless and false. And as we&#8217;ve long said, Venezuela&#8217;s political future is for the Venezuelan people to decide,&#8221; White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. He said the Venezuelan government tries to distract from its own actions by blaming the US or other countries for events inside.</p>
<p>The US values its strong, historic and cultural ties with the Venezuelan people and remains committed to the relationship with them, Carney said adding that Washington is deeply concerned about the violence there. &#8220;We are alarmed by the Venezuelan government&#8217;s use of security forces and armed gangs affiliated with the government to disrupt peaceful protests, which is disproportionate and threatens further escalation of the violence,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Venezuelan authorities have arrested and detained scores of anti-government protesters. We call on the government to release them immediately and to provide the political space necessary for meaningful dialogue with the Venezuelan people,&#8221; Carney said. State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki said the Venezuelan government notified the US on February 17 that they have declared three consular officers personae non gratae and gave them 48 hours to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;In accordance with Article 9 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and Article 23 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the United States is considering what actions to take,&#8221; she said. Psaki said US Consular Officers were conducting normal outreach activities at universities on student visas, which is something they do around the world as a way to improve the accessibility and transparency of the visa process.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988202&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kerry.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1977298" alt="Both the State Department and the White House denied that Kerry had favoured arming the Syrian rebels." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kerry.jpg" /></a> Both the State Department and the White House denied that Kerry had favoured arming the Syrian rebels.
<p>The US has said that there is &#8220;no military solution&#8221; to the current Syrian crisis, but it is considering renewed options to resolve the conflict. &#8220;It is still our view, absolutely, that there is not a military solution to this conflict and that a negotiated political settlement is the only path forward for Syria. The Geneva process is the only way by which that is persuadable and achievable at this time,&#8221; White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters at his daily news conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important that the two sides sit down across from each other, but the international community needs to focus on how we can move this process forward,&#8221; he said when asked about the breakdown of the talks between the ruling Assad regime and the opposition coalition in Geneva. &#8220;We, as a rule, are always looking at all of our options and reviewing old and new options when it comes to a situation in Syria. It should not be forgotten that the obstacle to progress here has been the regime. The opposition attended the Geneva talks and conducted themselves appropriately.</p>
<p>&#8220;The regime, however, has made clear that it&#8217;s throwing up obstacles to moving forward and making progress,&#8221; he said. Noting that there&#8217;s not a new review of policy underway, Carney said the fact of the matter is that the situation in Syria is horrendous. He said the only resolution to conflict was through negotiation and the US would continue to work with international partners to try to push the process forward. &#8220;We absolutely recognise that the situation on the ground is terrible and that the Syrian people are still under constant assault from the Assad regime. We provide significant assistance to the opposition, including to the military opposition,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Carney also said the US was enormously frustrated by the obstructionism that the Syrian regime participates in, the unhelpful approach that Russia has adopted on the Security Council when it comes to the resolution regarding humanitarian aid access. &#8220;What remains the case is that we are looking for ways to advance a policy that is in the national interest security interest of the United States and that helps Syria progress towards a negotiated political settlement,&#8221; the official said.</p>
<p>The US policy and position is that Syria&#8217;s future cannot include Bashar al-Assad because their people have so clearly shown that he cannot be a part of future or transitional government there, he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988181&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Expressing concern over the alleged suicide of an Indian student at a detention centre in Melbourne last week, the community members have sought more information from the government over the tragic incident.</p>
<p>Dalvir Singh, 27, died at the Maribyrnong Immigration detention centre here on February 13 allegedly by hanging himself.</p>
<p>Indian Consulate in Melbourne is in contact with his brother Harpal Singh, who wishes to repatriate dead body to India.</p>
<p>The Indian community has sought details from the federal government as to what and how the tragic incident happened.</p>
<p>Sydney-based cardiologist and prominent community member Yadu Singh said, &#8220;Full facts are not out at this stage, but we ask Department of Immigration and Border Protection and Minister Morrison&#8217;s office to put Indian community in the loop with full information and take them in confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local Indian-origin councillors have raised their voices against the government&#8217;s handing into the incident.</p>
<p>Councillors &#8211; Tim Singh, Oscar Lobo and Gautum Gupta &#8211; have written individually in a locally published daily &#8216;The Indian Sun&#8217; expressing their frustration and demanding more details.</p>
<p>Lashing out at Immigration Minister, Tim Singh, former mayor of City of Darebin, said, &#8220;We need to take a humanitarian approach. Australia needs to be sympathetic towards the plight of students to rebuild confidence in our education industry and build Australia&#8217;s reputation. Such a cold response from the government will not help build bridges.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The family and the Indian community needs answers about what happened. Why was he detained in this manner and why was he not given support? We need straight answers not secrecy and half-truths. If the government wants to expand Indian student numbers then it needs to show more humanity. Clearly it has failed in its duty of care with this student,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988174&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>The US has said it is not involved in active negotiations with the Taliban, but would want to discuss the fate of its soldier held hostage by insurgents since 2009 if the talks were to resume. &#8220;We are not involved in active negotiations with the Taliban. Clearly, if negotiations do resume, at some point then we will want to talk with the Taliban about the safe return of Sergeant Bergdahl,&#8221; White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been gone far too long, and we continue to call for and work towards his safe and immediate release. We have long supported an Afghan-led peace process, and we&#8217;ll continue to do so. When it comes to Sergeant Bergdahl our hearts go out to his family. We have great sympathy for them,&#8221; Carney said. He said he could not discuss the details of US efforts, but &#8220;there should be no doubt that we work every day, using our military, our intelligence and our diplomatic tools, to see Sergeant Bergdahl returned home safely&#8221;.</p>
<p>Without divulging much about the efforts being pursued by the United States in this regard, Carney said all efforts are being made by the administration. &#8220;In the meantime, we are actively engaged in an effort to see his return. I can&#8217;t document every effort, but that includes our military, our intelligence and our diplomatic tools,&#8221; Carney said.</p>
<p>However, he did not refute reports that the US is considering a prisoners swap to free Sergeant Robert Bergdahl in exchange for Guantanamo Bay prisoners. &#8220;With respect to Guantanamo, the President reiterated when he signed the fiscal year 2014 Defence Authorisation Act that this administration will not transfer a detainee unless the threat the detainee may pose can be sufficiently mitigated and only when consistent with our humane treatment policy,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988147&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/ukraine2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1965891" alt="A protester is engulfed in flames during clashes with riot police in Kiev Tuesday. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/ukraine2.jpg" /></a> A protester is engulfed in flames during clashes with riot police in Kiev Tuesday. (AP)
<p>As thick black smoke rose from the barricades encircling the protest camp in central Kiev on Wednesday, the Ukrainian president blamed opposition leaders for the deadly violence in which at least 25 people died and 241 were injured. The <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/ukraine-president-defiant-after-violence-erupts/" target="_blank">violence</a> on Tuesday was the worst in nearly three months of anti-government protests that have paralysed Ukraine&#8217;s capital in a struggle over the identity of a nation divided in loyalties between Russia and the West, and the worst in the country&#8217;s post-Soviet history.</p>
<p>Amid cries of &#8220;Glory to Ukraine!&#8221; and with flaming tires lighting up the night sky, thousands of riot police armed with stun grenades and water cannons attacked the sprawling protest camp in the centre of Kiev. With the boom of exploding stun grenades and fireworks nearly drowning out his words at times, opposition leader Vitali Klitschko urged overnight the 20,000 protesters to defend the camp on Independence Square that has been the heart of the protests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not go anywhere from here,&#8221; Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, told the crowd, speaking from a stage in the square as tents and tires burned around him, releasing huge plumes of smoke. &#8220;This is an island of freedom and we will defend it,&#8221; he said. Early on Wednesday, many were still heeding his call. &#8220;I am not going to sit and wait while they kill me,&#8221; said 32-year-old Anton Rybkovich. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to attack. The more force the government uses, the more harsh our response will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>About 10,000 people remained on the square as piles of rubber tires continued to burn. A large building that the protesters had used as a headquarters caught fire and had been abandoned during the night, as police used loudspeakers to urge women and children to leave the square because an &#8220;anti-terrorist&#8221; operation was under way. President Viktor Yanukovych said that opposition leaders &#8220;crossed a line when they called people to arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I again call on the leaders of the opposition &#8230; to draw a boundary between themselves and radical forces which are provoking bloodshed and clashes with the security services,&#8221; the president said in a statement. &#8220;If they don&#8217;t want to leave (the square) they should acknowledge that they are supporting radicals. Then the conversation with them will already be of a different kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>His defiant tone left few with hope of compromise after a night of violence, the worst in the country&#8217;s post-Soviet history.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988104&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/musharaf-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1957174" alt="This is the first time in Pakistan’s 66-year history that a former military ruler is facing trial for treason. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/musharaf-med.jpg" /></a> This is the first time in Pakistan’s 66-year history that a former military ruler is facing trial for treason. (PTI)
<p>Embattled former dictator Pervez Musharraf Tuesday appeared for the first time in a Pakistani special court conducting his treason trial but was not charged as the judges said they would decide his petition challenging their mandate.</p>
<p>This is the first time in Pakistan’s 66-year history that a former military ruler is facing trial for treason. If convicted, 70-year-old Musharraf could face life imprisonment or the death penalty.</p>
<p>Musharraf appeared in the special court, formed last year to try him on charges of high treason for imposing emergency in 2007, after skipping all previous hearings.</p>
<p>The court has held 22 hearings so far and Musharraf was in the courtroom for hardly 15 minutes Tuesday. The three-judge court will announce on Friday it decision on petitions filed by Musharraf seeking his trial by a military court under the Army Act.</p>
<p>If it decides that it has the mandate to hear the treason case, the special court will summon Musharraf again.<br />
Musharraf was driven to the court, set up in Islamabad’s heavily guarded “Red Zone”, from a hospital in Rawalpindi in a long motorcade. Authorities put in place tight security, with over 1,200 security personnel deployed along his route.</p>
<p>His 17-vehicle cavalcade included a bulletproof car, pilot vehicles and an ambulance. Over 400 personnel were deployed in and around the court alone.</p>
<p>Since January 2, Musharraf has been admitted to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology. He was taken to the hospital after developing heart problems while being driven to court.</p>
<p>“We have proved our respect for the courts today. We have been maintaining that Musharraf is neither shy nor afraid to appear before the court. We had said he will appear as and when required,” Ahmed Raza Kasuri, a key member of Musharraf’s legal team, told reporters outside the special court.</p>
<p>He said Musharraf came to the court “even though he was not well”.</p>
<p>“We have argued that further proceedings should take place only after the court decides whether it is competent or an army court (to hear the treason case). You have to decide on the petitions filed against this court,” Kasuri said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987990&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/terrorist-480.jpg" /></a> Pakistan-linked terror groups top UK sanction list. (Reuters)
<p>India&#8217;s most wanted man Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar and Pakistan-linked terrorists and terror groups figure prominently in an updated list of financial sanctions imposed by the British government. Dawood Ibrahim features under his various aliases and with his last known address given as White House, near the Saudi Mosque in the Pakistani port city of Karachi.</p>
<p>The alleged mastermind of the 1993 serial bombings in Mumbai has been on a consolidated list of asset freeze targets designated by the United Nations, European Union and United Kingdom since November 2003. &#8220;International arrest warrant issued by the Government of India, also referred to as Hizrat,&#8221; reads the latest document released by the Treasury Department.</p>
<p>Jaish-e-Mohammed or the Army of Mohammed, blamed for the 2001 attack on India&#8217;s parliament, featured on the freeze list as a key outfit &#8220;based in Peshawar and Muzaffarabad, Pakistan&#8221;. It is linked with other banned groups like Harkat-ul-Mujahidin, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Al-Akhtar Trust International and Harkat-ul Jihad Islami.</p>
<p>Among the individuals on the banned list for years are Haji Muhammad Ashraf, described as chief of finance of the outlawed LeT, and India-born Mohammed Bahaziq, referred to as a Saudi Arabia-based leader of LeT, which carried out the 2008 attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people.</p>
<p>&#8220;HM Treasury is responsible for the implementation and administration of international financial sanctions in effect in the UK, for domestic designations under the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;Our aim is to reduce the terrorist threat to the UK and its interests overseas by preventing terrorists from using common methods to raise funds, or using the financial system to move money and targeting the raising and movement of money in and out of the UK by terrorists and disrupting the funding of bodies such as Al-Qaida,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Under the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010, the Treasury is required to publish a quarterly report to parliament on its operation of the UK’s asset-freezing regime.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987729&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Seven miners were killed and nine injured when a gas explosion ripped through a state-owned coal mine in eastern Ukraine, officials said today. The blast occurred yesterday at a depth of around 800 metres (2,600 feet) while some 90 workers were on shift at the mine in Makiyivka in Ukraine&#8217;s mineral-rich Donetsk region.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven miners were killed and nine hospitalised,&#8221; the emergency situations service said in a statement. The bodies of all the victims had been recovered by early on Tuesday and work at the mine has been suspended, the statement said. Fatal accidents are a regular feature at Ukrainian mines, most of which are located in the country&#8217;s industrial eastern region. Many of the mines are underfunded and poorly equipped, and safety violations are rife.</p>
<p>In the worst accident of its kind in the country&#8217;s post-Soviet history, more than 100 miners were killed in an explosion in 2007 at the Zasyadko mine, one of the three biggest in Ukraine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987712&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian-origin man in the US has been accused of brutally bludgeoning his 66-year-old father with a sledgehammer over a comment made while playing puzzles.</p>
<p>Vinayak Shanbhag, 33, has been charged with attempted first degree murder after his father was found grievously injured and bleeding in the family&#8217;s Holly Hill home in Florida on Saturday morning, according to an arrest report.</p>
<p>Vinayak confessed to beating his sleeping father with a sledgehammer because of a comment he made after a night of &#8220;playing puzzles&#8221;, police said.</p>
<p>The victim&#8217;s wife told police she went to check on her husband Pandurang Shanbhag, whom she has a separate room from because of her arthritis, at 6 am when she heard him coughing in bed.</p>
<p>There she found him vomiting blood and extremely bloody. Her son, soon after, came into the room and said, &#8220;I did it,&#8221; according to the police report.</p>
<p>The wife told police he did not say anything else and she called 911, the New York Daily News reported.</p>
<p>When officers&#8217; arrived, Vinayak told police that the night before they were &#8220;playing puzzles&#8221; when his father stated something to upset him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He thought about the statement his father said to him all night and that is when he decided to beat his father,&#8221; police said.</p>
<p>Pandurang was listed in critical but stable condition yesterday at Halifax Health Medical Center, Holly Hill Police Chief Mark Barker said.</p>
<p>He is listed in the Daytona Beach university&#8217;s website as a chemistry professor in the School of Science, Engineering and Math, The Daytona Beach News Journal reported.</p>
<p>Vinayak majored in chemistry at Bethune-Cookman and graduated in 2000.</p>
<p>The arrest report described officers seeing blood on a car&#8217;s front headlight and the ground surrounding it. Vinayak was found sitting on a couch next to his mother.</p>
<p>Scanning the home&#8217;s rooms, an officer reported seeing blood &#8220;all over every wall in the bedroom&#8221; where the victim had been lying.</p>
<p>A bloody sledgehammer was left on the floor of the bedroom.</p>
<p>Vinayak told police he had been violent with other family members in the past.</p>
<p>He is being held at the Volusia County branch jail on USD 50,000 bond.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987690&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iran-new-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987665" alt="Iran's supreme leader said he's not against resolving Iran's nuclear issue but expresses doubts that talks will yield any result. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iran-new-480.jpg" /></a> Iran&#8217;s supreme leader said he&#8217;s not against resolving Iran&#8217;s nuclear issue but expresses doubts that talks will yield any result. (AP)
<p>Iran has the &#8220;political will&#8221; to seek a comprehensive agreement with world powers over its disputed nuclear drive, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said as talks are to resume on Tuesday. &#8220;We believe we can reach an agreement and we have come here with the political will to reach a final agreement,&#8221; Zarif said late on Monday after meeting EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton in Vienna.</p>
<p>&#8220;If all sides enter the talks with the political will to resolve the issue, we will be able to reach positive results, but it will take time,&#8221; he added in statements carried by state news agency IRNA. Three days of talks open today in Vienna between Iran and the P5+1 group of nations &#8211; Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Germany.</p>
<p>Building on an interim deal reached in November, the negotiations will seek a comprehensive accord that will once and for all allay Western suspicions that Iran&#8217;s nuclear programme masks military objectives, a claim denied by Iran. &#8220;Our objective is to provide the guarantee in the negotiations that Iran&#8217;s nuclear programme will remain peaceful,&#8221; Zarif said after a working dinner with Ashton, who represents the P5+1.</p>
<p>His remarks came a day after supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the nuclear talks with world powers would &#8220;lead nowhere&#8221;, but that he did not oppose them. &#8220;I repeat it again that I am not optimistic about the negotiations and they will lead nowhere, but I am not against them,&#8221; said Khamenei, who has final say on all key state matters.</p>
<p>Iran began implementing in January the landmark November deal under which it agreed to freeze some nuclear activities for six months in exchange for modest sanctions relief. Under the &#8220;comprehensive&#8221; deal now being sought, which the parties aim to conclude and begin implementing by November, the powers will want Iran to scale back its activities permanently.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987662&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

He appeared before a special court on Tuesday.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987645&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pervez-4802.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1982540" alt="Pakistan's former military general PErvez Musharraf is facing a court trial for treason. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pervez-4802.jpg" /></a> Pakistan&#8217;s former military general PErvez Musharraf is facing a court trial for treason.
<p>Former Pakistan military ruler General Pervez Musharraf today appeared before a special court here conducting his treason trial, having skipped numerous hearings earlier. Musharraf, 70, was driven to the court in a long motorcade from the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC) Rawalpindi amidst tight security of over 1,200 security personnel deployed along the route.</p>
<p>His 17-vehicle cavalcade included a bullet-proof car, pilot vehicles and an ambulance. Over 400 personnel were also deployed at the court premises. A three-judge bench, headed by Justice Faisal Arab, has been formed by the government to try the former dictator on charges of high treason for imposing emergency in 2007.</p>
<p>This is the first time in Pakistan&#8217;s history that a former military dictator is facing trial for treason. If convicted, Musharraf could face life imprisonment or death penalty. The former president faces treason charges under Article 6 for suspending, subverting and abrogating the Constitution, imposing an emergency in the country and detaining judges of the superior courts.</p>
<p>Musharraf had taken ill and was rushed to the AFIC on January 2 when he was being transported under heavy guard to the special court. He has since been admitted in the hospital. His trial is taking place at the National Library here, which is a heavily secured &#8216;Red Zone&#8217; in Pakistan that houses all important institutions like the Prime Minister&#8217;s House, Supreme Court and the Diplomatic Enclave.</p>
<p>Prior to Musharraf&#8217;s arrival, the Bomb Disposal Squad had carried out a thorough check inside the court premises and jammers were installed. Earlier in the day, the special court had reserved its verdict for conducting his treason trial under the Army Act. The court had summoned him today warning that a non-bailable arrest warrant would be issued if he fails to turn up.</p>
<p>Justice Arab had asked Musharraf&#8217;s counsel when his client would appear before the court. On this, counsel Anwar Mansoor replied his client would appear whenever the security officials give him clearance. He said security officials would decide the time of his appearance, therefore, he (counsel) could not inform the court about the exact time.</p>
<p>Confusion had prevailed prior to his appearance. Musharraf&#8217;s lawyer said the former army chief was sitting inside his vehicle, but SSP Islamabad is not taking over. Court then summoned a representative of Interior Ministry and asked him to ensure that police brings him.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987645&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/thailand-480.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1987625" alt="Thailand-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/thailand-480.jpg?w=600" /></a> Violent clashes in Thailand against the government have claimed many lives. (AP)
<p>A Thai policeman was shot dead and 58 people injured today as police raided an opposition rally site to reclaim areas taken over by demonstrators seeking to overthrow Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Violence erupted as the police tried to take back the protest site at Phan Fah Bridge hours after arresting 100 protesters in front of state-owned oil and gas company PTT Plc for violating a state of emergency declared in January.</p>
<p>Several police officers were involved the operation called the &#8220;Peace for Bangkok Mission&#8221;. The Centre for Maintaining Peace and Order (CPMO) said it plans to retake Government House, Prime Minister&#8217;s office, as the first target of its operation to reclaim five areas occupied by the People&#8217;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC).</p>
<p>&#8220;One policeman was shot dead and 58 injured,&#8221; city&#8217;s Erawan emergency medical centre said. Six policemen and a foreign journalist were also among the injured. Labour Minister Chalerm Yoobamrung, the CMPO director, said Prime Minister Yingluck had instructed him not to resort to violence.</p>
<p>The protesters backed by the main opposition Democrat Party have been rallying in Bangkok since November to try to oust Yingluck, whom they view as a proxy for her elder brother Thaksin Shinawatra, a former premier who was toppled in a military coup in 2006. They want the government to hand over power to an unelected people&#8217;s council to implement reforms they say are needed to end corruption.</p>
<p>Paradorn Pattanatabut, secretary-general of the Internal Security Operations Command, said negotiations would be the main medium to reclaim Government House. He admitted that Yingluck&#8217;s plan to return to Government House had to be delayed. Demonstrators poured cement into the barrier moulds at the gates of the compound yesterday.</p>
<p>Eleven people have died and hundreds of others injured in political violence linked to the latest round of anti-government rallies. Demonstrators have blocked major intersections and entrances to government offices. Yingluck&#8217;s government held a snap election on February 2, which was boycotted by the Democrat Party. Demonstrators prevented 10,000 polling stations from opening on election day.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987620&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/egypt-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987594" alt="A jihadist group has come forward and taken responsibility of the tour bus blast in Egypt. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/egypt-480.jpg" /></a> A jihadist group has come forward and taken responsibility of the tour bus blast in Egypt. (AP)
<p>Jihadist group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis on Tuesday claimed the suicide bombing in Egypt of a tour bus that killed three South Koreans and their local driver. The bombing on Sunday, near the Taba border crossing with Israel, was the first targeting tourists since the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July, sparking a militant campaign that has killed scores of police and soldiers.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the heroes of Ansar Beit al-Maqdis carried out the attack on a tourist bus heading towards the Zionist entity (Israel),&#8221; said a statement attributed to the group and posted on jihadist forums. It added that the suicide attack was &#8220;part of our economic war against this regime of traitors &#8230; which kills the innocent, destroys houses, ransacks properties and lays waste to land on the border with the Zionist enemy&#8221;.</p>
<p>The group warned Egypt&#8217;s government of new attacks aimed at its &#8220;economic interests everywhere to force it to stop its actions against Muslims&#8221;. The tourists were all members of the same church group from the central South Korean county of Jincheon, and were on a 12-day trip through Turkey, Egypt and Israel. They had been about to cross into Israel when the blast occurred.</p>
<p>Fourteen South Koreans were also wounded in the bombing and were receiving treatment at a hospital in the popular Sinai resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Two Egyptians were also wounded in the blast. The head of Egypt&#8217;s Chamber of Tourism said the attack could have been aimed at hitting the tourism industry, one of Egypt&#8217;s top revenue generators.</p>
<p>&#8220;The attack aimed at harming tourism in general,&#8221; said Elhami al-Zayat. The Sinai-based Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Partisans of Jerusalem) has claimed responsibility for several high-profile attacks, including a car bombing at police headquarters in Cairo and the shooting down of a military helicopter. The Al-Qaeda-inspired group also tried but failed to assassinate interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim last year.</p>
<p>The military has sent tanks and troops to combat the militants in the Sinai, amid fears the group is now changing<br />
its tactics. &#8220;A continuation in attacks on tourists would mean a shift in strategy by jihadist groups that until now targeted the military and police,&#8221; said Issandr El Amrani of the International Crisis Group.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that cannot be judged after one attack,&#8221; he added. Islamist militants have killed dozens of tourists in sporadic attacks over the past several decades, most recently in a 2009 bombing that killed a French tourist in Cairo. Police under now deposed president Hosni Mubarak had all but stamped out Islamist militancy after a spate of Sinai resort bombings between 2004 and 2006.</p>
<p>But the three-year period of unrest after Mubarak&#8217;s overthrow in 2011 has allowed the militants to regroup in the<br />
restive Sinai peninsula and to branch out to the Nile Delta.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987589&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sebastianedathy-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986684" alt="Sebastian Edathy-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sebastianedathy-480.jpg" /></a> Ex German Minister Sebastian Edathy was accused for ordering pornography videos.
<p>Indian-origin former German lawmaker has challenged the child pornography allegations levelled against him by state prosecutors, accusing them of lying about the probe against him. Sebastian Edathy, 44, who is facing probe for allegedly possessing child pornography, has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In a formal complaint filed with justice minister of Lower Saxony yesterday, Edathy&#8217;s lawyer Christian Noll claimed that the chief prosecutor Joerg Froehlich was not telling the truth when he told a news conference last Friday that the videos and photos of naked boys acquired by the ex-MP from a Canadian firm were &#8220;in the border areas&#8221; of child pornography. &#8220;Froehlich did not mention that specialists of the Federal Criminal Office (BKA) in Wiesbaden, the Federal Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in Frankfurt and the Centre for Combating Internet and Computer Criminality in Giessen have evaluated the videos and photos some months earlier and they came to the conclusion that the materials were not relevant for a criminal prosecution against Edathy,&#8221; the 11-page complaint said.</p>
<p>Froehlich also &#8220;massively violated&#8221; the personal rights of Edathy and ruined his professional, social and private life, it claimed. The letter described as &#8220;simply disgusting&#8221; the chief prosecutor&#8217;s assumption that Edathy had acted conspiratorially in ordering the videos and photos by using credit cards issued for hidden accounts and by downloading these materials with the computers in the Bundestag.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Edathy had ordered the videos and photos under his name, used credit cards issued to him and gave his own address, the letter said. Edathy&#8217;s &#8220;fully open handling&#8221; is exactly the opposite of a conspiratorial behaviour, his lawyer said. Therefore the chief prosecutor&#8217;s assumption is &#8220;defaming&#8221; and it is a &#8220;proof for his prejudice&#8221;, the letter argued.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Edathy has reported to the Bundestag that his official laptop used in the house was stolen. Last week, prosecutors raided his houses and office, but found very little evidences to incriminate him.  Edathy, son of a migrant from Kerala, charged that the prosecutor&#8217;s office opened an investigation against him without any concrete charges.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987513&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jk-rowling-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987476" alt="JK Rowling pens her second novel called 'The Silkworm'. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jk-rowling-480.jpg" /></a> JK Rowling pens her second novel called &#8216;The Silkworm&#8217;. (AP)
<p>JK Rowling, celebrated British author of the popular Harry Potter series, has penned her second crime novel under a pseudonym to be published in June. The Silkworm, to be published on June 19, will again feature Cormoran Strike, the private detective Rowling introduced in 2013&#8242;s &#8216;The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling&#8217;.</p>
<p>The author&#8217;s pseudonym Robert Galbraith was unmasked last year after the information was leaked by a member of her legal team. Rowling, 48, has penned a new story about her private detective Strike and his assistant Robin Ellacott. This time, the crime-solving duo will be on the trail of a killer who murders a writer called Owen Quine, The Independent reported. &#8220;At first, Mrs Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days (as he has done before) and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home,&#8221; a synopsis from publishers Little, Brown Book Group reads.</p>
<p>&#8220;But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine&#8217;s disappearance than his wife realises,&#8221; it<br />
says. Quine has just finished work on a manuscript that sees him draw on &#8220;almost everyone&#8221; for poisonous character assassinations that could ruin lives. &#8220;When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before,&#8221; the teaser states.</p>
<p>Rowling was unmasked on Twitter as the author of thriller The Cuckoo&#8217;s Calling. She had hidden behind a fake name to avoid readers forming preconceptions based on her Harry Potter success. &#8220;I was yearning to go back to the beginning of a writing career in this new genre to work without hype or expectation to receive totally unvarnished feedback,&#8221; Rowling wrote on her Robert Galbraith website.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a fantastic experience and I only wish it could have gone on a little longer.&#8221; Rowling successfully took legal action against the solicitors who had leaked the information and donated both the damages and the novel&#8217;s royalties to the Soldier&#8217;s Charity. A partner at the solicitors told his wife&#8217;s best friend about Robert Galbraith&#8217;s real identity, who in turn disclosed it to The Sunday Times.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987475&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An amateur video purportedly shot inside a hijacked Ethiopian Airlines jetliner flight shows harrowed passengers and their ordeal during the incident. The flight number 702 bound for Rome was hijacked by its co-pilot who wanted asylum in Switzerland.<br />
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/MHXzYkNuQVs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>Passengers are seen trying to make sense of what was happening inside the aircraft. Apparently, the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit when he went to the restroom. The hijacker then maneuvered the plane towards Geneva and threatened to crash the plane if the pilot did not stop pounding on the cockpit door.</p>
<p>Some passengers pulled out their phones and filmed the entire hijack fiasco. When the plane was due to land in Geneva, an inflight passenger announcement box said, &#8220;Your attention please! It is a police operation. Please don&#8217;t move, stay relaxed and keep your hands behind your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ethiopian Airlines flight number 702 was forced to land early on Monday in Geneva, where authorities apprehended the hijacker and arrested him. The Swiss Police said the hijacker asked for asylum in Switzerland upon surrendering. The airline&#8217;s website announced on Monday that the flight landed safely and all passengers and crew were safe. No further details were provided. The police then escorted all passengers one by one with their hands behind their heads from the plane to waiting vehicles.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>KYLE SPENCER</strong></p>
<p>Shortly before sunrise, a dozen or so students at the University of California, San Diego, stumbled dutifully out of bed. They ironed their shirts, knotted their ties and piled into their cars. Their destination was the Islamic Center of San Diego, where they were to be initiated into the country’s first Muslim fraternity, Alpha Lambda Mu, named for three letters that start several chapters of the Quran: Alif Laam Meem.</p>
<p>After the morning prayer, the 13 pledges recited a passage from the Quran, then listened as their adviser applied the Islamic values of loyalty and sincerity to daily life on campus.</p>
<p>Finally, the young men pronounced their goals for the coming semester: Rumzi Khan, a computer science major who founded the chapter, vowed to pray more. Several science majors promised to double down on their studying. Samer Abusaleh, a junior in economics, pledged to be more consistent with his Quran reading. He also wanted to work on his six-pack.</p>
<p>There was nothing typical about this initiation, which ended over plates of carrot cake pancakes and huevos rancheros. No beer pong. No hazing. None of the raucousness that characterises frat life.</p>
<p>Alpha Lambda Mu was founded a year ago by Ali Mahmoud, a junior biology and sociology major at the University of Texas, Dallas, as a national fraternity for Muslim college students. Mahmoud, who is seeking university recognition and a house for his chapter, hosted the first formal rush this autumn: 40 students showed up, and half were offered bids. A total of 24 members now make up the Texas chapter.</p>
<p>Mahmoud, whose parents emigrated from Egypt before he was born, says he founded the frat to offer Muslim students the chance to express both sides of their identity, the American and the Muslim, at a time when “more and more of us identify strongly with both”.</p>
<p>The directive is for spiritual students to have more fun, and convivial ones to incorporate more spirituality in their lives. Mahmoud’s guidebook stipulates that chapters organise events every semester. Some are to be purely social, others to teach life skills and enrich members with Islamic culture.</p>
<p>So the Texas chapter set off in November on a wilderness retreat, with canoeing and campfires on which to roast halal marshmallows, and an imam for lectures and prayers. The new Cornell chapter, which has eight members, threw an all-night, alcohol-free, men-only party in November. They prayed together, downed pizza, played games and crashed in sleeping bags.</p>
<p>The members meet twice a month in one another’s apartments to<br />
discuss spiritual texts, and they try to gather for at least one of the day’s five calls to prayer.</p>
<p>With young Muslims demanding support, acceptance and greater understanding of a culture that many Americans seem to know little about, the arrival of Alpha Lambda Mu may be less an anomaly than a sign of the times. Researchers who study immigrant assimilation say that interest in a fraternal identity makes sense. “I’m surprised it took this long,” said Brian Calfano, an associate professor of political science at Missouri State University who has researched Islamic and American identities.</p>
<p>Sometimes referred to as the post-9/11 generation, Muslim-American students have long struggled with the prejudices that have come with the West’s unsettled relationship with the Arab world. This has led them to explore their dual identity, and to strive to show the world who they are, said Dr Lori Peek, the author of Behind the Backlash: Muslim Americans After 9/11. “The formation of a fraternity,” Peek said, “moves these students out of the private sphere and into a more public space where they are effectively spanning two cultures.”</p>
<p>Two reports by the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies indicate that an evolution has indeed occurred. In 2009, 40 per cent of Muslim Americans ages 18 to 29 said they were thriving, the lowest perc entage in that age group. By 2011, 10 years after the terrorist attacks, that number had risen to 65 per cent.</p>
<p>Only 1.4 per cent of American college freshmen are Muslim, according to a Higher Education Research Institute survey in 2012, up from 0.9 per cent in 2005. With growing interest in Islam, more campuses are providing prayer spaces and cultural centres. In 1999, Georgetown became the first university to hire a full-time imam. In recent years, Yale, Princeton and Northwestern have brought in Muslim chaplains.</p>
<p>The Muslim Student Association, founded in 1963, is the voice of this movement and now has more than 200 affiliated chapters in the United States. It helps members procure scholarships and internships.</p>
<p>The group has generated controversy too. The chapter at the University of California, Irvine, was suspended for the 2010 autumn semester after members protested a campus speech by the ambassador to Israel. And in 2012 the organisation made headlines amid reports that the New York City Police Department had surreptitiously monitored chapters at Yale, Columbia and other East Coast campuses.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987218&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Dayton Accords led to hydra-headed presidency and multiple layers of govt to appease all sides. The system of governance that was to follow never came<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987215&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>ALISON SMALE</strong><br />
The local government headquarters here is a shell, its 12 stories charred by fire.</p>
<p>But while the destruction evokes the Balkans turmoil of the 1990s, when more than 1,00,000 people died, it is not a result of war. Rather, Bosnians, diplomats and analysts say, it is an unintended consequence of what ended the conflict: the 1995 Dayton Accords, which were negotiated under muscular diplomacy by the US and bought nearly 20 years of peace but imposed what turned out to be a dysfunctional government structure that has impeded economic progress and left citizens increasingly angry and frustrated.</p>
<p>The long-simmering frustrations of Bosnians erupted a week ago not only in Tuzla but also in a dozen other towns and cities across the country, including the capital, Sarajevo — resulting in the largest social unrest in nearly 20 years in the country.<br />
Ethnic divisions fuelled almost four years of war in the 1990s. Today, if there is one thing that unites many of Bosnia’s 3.8 million people — Bosniaks (or Muslims), Serbs and Croats — it is their disgust with the hydra-headed presidency and multiple layers of government that developed to appease the nationalist sentiments of all sides.</p>
<p>Tuzla, an impoverished industrial city of 200,000, has the highest unemployment rate in the country — around 55 per cent — and it was the fount of the anger that erupted last week.</p>
<p>The system established under the Dayton Accords has only helped cement “corrupt, nepotistic and completely complacent elites”, said Damir Arsenijevic, 36, a psychoanalyst  who is now a prime mover in nightly Tuzla discussions about the way forward.</p>
<p>Workers in Tuzla had protested for months against the botched privatisation of four factories, once part of a proud array of industry stretching back to pre-Communist days. Pictures showing police officers beating protesters drew more crowds into the streets in Tuzla, Sarajevo and two other towns where government buildings were burned.</p>
<p>“Our leaders do not even take it as alarming that 63 per cent of young people here are jobless,” said Edin Plevljakovic, 23, a student in Sarajevo. “We have neither strong politics, nor a very potent elite,” he added.</p>
<p>John C Kornblum, a retired US ambassador who drafted the Dayton Accords as diplomat Richard C Holbrooke negotiated them, noted that the complex mechanisms they put in place were intended primarily to secure peace, but they were also supposed to be replaced in three years with a streamlined governmental structure.</p>
<p>A serious attempt at change in 2005, he said, was hindered in part by non-governmental organisations, reinforcing the Bosniak leaders’ desire for a unified state, which the Serbs and Croats will not allow.</p>
<p>Diplomats have tried in vain to get Bosnians to heed a 2009 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights, which in effect challenged the three-way set-up of the national presidency, made up of a Bosniak, a Serb and a Croat, as discriminatory. In addition to the presidency, the country consists of a Muslim-Croat Federation, a Serbian Republic, 10 cantons in the federation and the separate city of Brcko.</p>
<p>Until the 2009 ruling is observed, Bosnia’s structure means it cannot advance towards the European Union, which neighbouring Croatia joined last year and Montenegro and even Serbia are waiting to do.</p>
<p>“I’m a Croat Catholic, but that is what I am at home,” said Sonja Kladnik, 78. “I’m also a citizen. I am sick and tired of this Serb, Croat, Bosniak. We have seven or 10 or however many levels of government and three presidents. Enough with this nationalism!”</p>
<p>The protesters are demanding governance by technocrats outside Bosnia’s parties. They have prompted the resignations of four cantonal governments, but so far no broader change.</p>
<p>Emina Bursuladzic, 58, seems an unlikely rebel. Like many others in this largely rural country, with little tradition of street protest and an abiding horror of bloodshed after the war, she disavows the violence. But over the past seven months, she has fought to preserve the remnants of Dita, once the provider of detergent for all of Yugoslavia. She and her co-workers stood vigil outside the local government offices, trying in vain to sue the owner they say came in 2008-09 and stripped their chemical plant almost bare.</p>
<p>It was not just the months of unpaid wages, or the plundering of the workplace Bursuladzic has served for 38 years that stirred her ire, she said. It was the humiliation. “People inside this building used to look out the window and laugh at us,” she said.<br />
Her co-worker Snjezana Ostrakovic, 29, bitterly recalled standing in temperatures well below freezing and accosting a local government worker, who she said simply ridiculed her pleas for help in feeding her two sons, 5 and 2.</p>
<p>Tuzla’s industry was built on coal and salt mines. The factories, now dilapidated shells, almost certainly had no future anyway. But locals are furious that they seem to have been sold off cheaply to the well connected, who then reaped profit by hawking scrap or land. As elsewhere in Eastern Europe, privatisation has enriched a few. In Bosnia, what’s worse is that it followed a war.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987215&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bomber.jpg"><img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bomber.jpg" alt="Governor of South Sinai, Major General Khaled Foda, left, and Egyptian Minister of Tourism Hesham Zazou, second right, visit an unidentified Egyptian who was wounded in the bus explosion. " class="size-full wp-image-1987109" /></a> Governor of South Sinai, Major General Khaled Foda, left, and Egyptian Minister of Tourism Hesham Zazou, second right, visit an unidentified Egyptian who was wounded in the bus explosion. 
<p>A suicide bomber was behind a deadly blast that tore through a bus carrying South Korean tourists, killing at least four people, as it waited near an Egypt-Israel border crossing in Sinai, Egyptian security  officials said.</p>
<p>The bombing yesterday was the first targeting foreign tourists in the Sinai in nearly a decade, raising fears that Islamic militants who have been waging a campaign of violence against security forces in the peninsula are now turning to attack tourism, a pillar of Egypt&#8217;s economy.</p>
<p>No one has claimed responsibility for the blast. But suicide bombings have been a hallmark of the al-Qaeda-inspired militant groups behind the nascent insurgency of the past six months, which has been focused in northern Sinai along the Mediterranean coast, away from the tourist centers on Sinai&#8217;s southern and eastern Red Sea coast.</p>
<p>The bus, carrying 33 South Korean tourists and two Egyptians, a guide and the driver, was waiting to cross into Israel at the border area of Taba when the blast took place.</p>
<p>The Egyptian driver and two South Koreans stepped out of the parked bus and went to the cargo hold. As they reboarded the bus, the bomber pushed in through the open bus door and detonated his explosives, Interior Ministry spokesman Hani Abdel-Latif said.</p>
<p>A badly burnt body at the site of the blast is now thought to belong to the bomber, he said. Egyptian forensic experts were at the site today to inspect the badly damaged yellow bus, but there was no word on their initial findings.</p>
<p>The blast killed the driver and three South Koreans and wounded at least a dozen other tourists on the bus, Egyptian security officals said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the press.</p>
<p>The Koreans were two guides and a tourist, the Korean news agency Yonhap reported, citing the Foreign Ministry in Seoul.</p>
<p>The tourists were Christians from the Jincheon Jungang Presbyterian Church who had saved for years to visit Biblical sites on the 60th anniversary of their church, Choe Gyu-seob, a curate at the church, told reporters. He said the bus was about to cross into Israel when the blast took place.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987108&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-year-old Indian-origin student of the Southern Illinois University has gone missing with his family offering a reward of USD 15,000 for information leading to his recovery.</p>
<p>Pravin Varughese, originally from Morton Grove, was last seen about 11 pm on Wednesday in Carbondale, Illinois, police said.</p>
<p>The family is now offering a reward of USD 15,000 for information leading to the recovery of Varughese, a statement from the Carbondale Police Department said.</p>
<p>His sister, Priya Varughese, said Pravin, his cousin and a roommate had all gone to a house party in that area that night.</p>
<p>His most recent post on Twitter, sent Wednesday night, reads, &#8220;Bloody knuckles&#8230;guess I was in a fight #backdown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really sure what it means,&#8221; Priya was quoted by Chicago Sun-Times as saying.</p>
<p>Pravin called a friend later that night and sounded like he was running or arguing during the phone call.</p>
<p>Pravin is a second-year student  at SIU studying criminal justice, his sister said. He lives in an off-campus apartment with his cousin and another roommate.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very social. He&#8217;s just very easy to talk to. He&#8217;s very easy at lighting up a conversation, and very funny,&#8221; Priya said.</p>
<p>Friends and police handed out flyers and talked to residents about Pravin yesterday, Sergeant Rich Brunner said.</p>
<p>Search efforts are on, he said.</p>
<p>Police are following investigative leads and have conducted visual searches of the area by airplane and helicopter.</p>
<p>Relatives, friends and members of his church have travelled to Carbondale to help search for him. They have also set up a Facebook page called &#8220;Missing: Pravin Varughese&#8221; to share updates.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987095&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/samiul-haq-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987405" alt="Samiul Haq, chief of Taliban panel, had a ‘sleepless night’ after news of the attack." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/samiul-haq-med.jpg" /></a> Samiul Haq, chief of Taliban panel, had a ‘sleepless night’ after news of the attack.
<p>Pakistani negotiators on Monday cancelled a scheduled meeting with the Taliban after the insurgents claimed they had killed 23 soldiers kidnapped by them in 2010, dealing a severe blow to the fledgling peace process.</p>
<p>State negotiators withdrew itself from the meeting that was supposed to be held on Monday 17th February, saying circumstances relating to negotiations with the Pakistani Taliban were not heading in the right direction. Irfan Siddiqui, coordinator of the government committee formed to hold peace talks with negotiators representing the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), said after the killing of 23 Frontier Corps (FC) soldiers, holding talks with the group was a futile enterprise.</p>
<p>In a statement, Siddiqui said an emergency meeting of government dialogue committee has been summoned tomorrow. He said the meeting will discuss the current situation and future course of action. Siddiqui said the committee has deplored and condemned the killing of FC personnel saying such incidents will hamper the process of serious and result-oriented negotiations.</p>
<p>In a video statement sent to media last night, Mohmand Agency Taliban chief Umar Khalid Khurasani said that they killed the FC soldiers on Sunday to avenge what he said was the custodial killing of Taliban fighters in Pakistan. The soldiers were kidnapped in 2010 from Shongari checkpost in Mohmand Agency.</p>
<p>The TTP statement lamented that on the one hand the government has initiated the process of talks, on the other it continues to target TTP members. &#8220;The killing of FC personnel is the revenge for the blood of our associates,&#8221; it said. &#8220;We want to make it clear to the government that we know very well how to avenge the killings of our members,&#8221; the statement said, warning &#8220;if the government did not change its trend, our reaction will be more severe in future&#8221;.</p>
<p>The group also stressed that they will soon release another video showing the killing. The video emerged hours after local media reports said the TTP was ready for a ceasefire, which they said would be announced within 24 hours. The Pakistan government and the Taliban are engaged in peace talks in a bid to end the decade-long insurgency that has gripped the country.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Maulana Yousuf Shah, who acts as contact person for the TTP, said news of the attack on FC personnel had given Maulana Samiul Haq, chief of the Taliban negotiating team, a &#8220;sleepless night&#8221;. He deplored the incident and said the sentiments of the TTP committee over the issue were no different from those of the government committee.</p>
<p>Shah added that Haq would soon hold a meeting with the top leadership of the TTP and that the Taliban negotiating committee would soon issue a statement over the attack. Shah expressed his disappointment over the government committee&#8217;s decision to postpone today&#8217;s meeting with Taliban negotiators.</p>
<p><strong>Bhagat Singh’s home, school get Rs 80 million for restoration in Pak</strong></p>
<p>Legendary freedom fighter Bhagat Singh’s ancestral house, school and his village in Punjab province in Pakistan will be restored under a Rs 80-million project.</p>
<p>“We have allocated Rs 80 million for restoration of the house and school of Independence war hero Bhagat Singh. The amount will also be spent for the uplift of Singh’s village where clean drinking water is not available and drainage system is in bad shape,” Faisalabad District Coordination Officer Noorul Amin Mengal told PTI.</p>
<p>Mengal said the people living in Faisalabad “take pride in the fact that Bhagat Singh was the son of their soil” and want the place to be known as “the town of Bhagat Singh”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986970&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>US Secretary of State John Kerry slammed Russia on Monday for &#8220;enabling&#8221; Syria&#8217;s President Bashar al-Assad to stay in power in the war-torn country, after Geneva peace talks broke down without any result last weekend. &#8220;The regime stonewalled, they did nothing except continue to drop barrel bombs on their own people and continue to destroy their own country. And I regret to say they&#8217;re doing so with increased support from Iran, from Hezbollah and from Russia,&#8221; Kerry told reporters in the Indonesian capital Jakarta.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia needs to be a part of the solution and not be distributing so much more weapons and so much more aid that they&#8217;re in fact enabling Assad to double-down. Which is creating an enormous problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>The so-called Geneva II process was initiated by the United States, which backs the Syrian opposition coalition, and Moscow, which supports the government in Damascus. But the second round of the talks ended in acrimony on Saturday, throwing the future of the negotiations to end the three-year conflict into doubt.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986920&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>An Ethiopian Airlines plane destined for Rome was forced to land early Monday in Geneva, where the hijacker was arrested, authorities said.</p>
<p>The airline said one of its planes had been &#8220;forced to proceed to Geneva.&#8221; Its website said the flight landed safely and &#8220;all passengers and crew are safe.&#8221; It gave no further details. Police escorted passengers one by one, their hands over their heads, from the taxied plane to waiting vehicles.</p>
<p>Swiss police said the plane made an unscheduled landing in the Swiss city at 6 a.m. (0500 GMT) and the hijacker was arrested. Police spokesman Jean-Philippe Brandt told The Associated Press that &#8220;the situation is under control&#8221; and nobody on the flight was injured.</p>
<p>Further details of the incident were to be released at a news conference in Geneva at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT). Cairo airport officials said the pilot of the plane, flight 702, informed the control tower at Abu Simbel in southern Egypt that his plane had been hijacked.</p>
<p>The pilot did not ask to land in Egypt, and the plane headed for Libyan airspace, they said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to brief the media. Geneva airport said departures would resume at 8.15 a.m. (0715 GMT) and arrivals at 8.45 a.m. (0745 GMT).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986884&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sebastian-edathy-480.jpg" /></a> Indian-origin ex MP Sebastian Edathy, 42, has been accused of possessing child pornography. (Reuters)
<p>Indian-origin former German lawmaker facing probe for allegedly possessing child pornography has denied any wrongdoing and said he intends to initiate legal proceedings against the state prosecutor&#8217;s office for spreading &#8220;false information&#8221; and &#8220;unjustly harassing&#8221; him.</p>
<p>Sebastian Edathy, 44, said that he received no warnings about an impending investigation against him. Allegations that Food and Agriculture minister Hans-Peter Friedrich had leaked confidential intelligence information on the Social Democrat (SPD) politician&#8217;s link to the child pornography ring when he was the interior minister in October, forced him to step down from chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s new cabinet on Friday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that during their raids on Edathy&#8217;s houses and offices on Monday and on Wednesday, they found hardly any evidences needed to raise formal charges against him and they suspected he may have received a tip-off. Edathy in an interview published in the latest edition of the news weekly Der Spiegel denied that he removed any evidences or destroyed them.</p>
<p>Asked why his lawyer contacted the state prosecutor in Hannover long before an investigation against him was launched on February 10, Edathy said he only reacted to the press reports in the middle of last year about Canadian authorities investigating a company as part of an operation to combat child pornography.</p>
<p>When he saw those reports, he remembered that &#8220;many years ago&#8221; he had received materials from that company, which he considered quite legal, Edathy said. Subsequently, he engaged a lawyer, who took up contacts with several investigating authorities. He denied that his decision on February 7 to leave the Bundestag was because of the investigation against him.</p>
<p>In another interview, Edathy strongly rejected allegations that he possessed child pornography and accused the authorities of &#8220;attempting to tarnish&#8221; him by publicly linking his name to child pornography without any concrete evidence. He said he intends to initiate legal proceedings against the state prosecutor&#8217;s office in Hannover for &#8220;spreading false information&#8221; and &#8220;unjustly harassing&#8221; him. &#8220;I never possessed in the past nor I am currently in possession of child pornography,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The state prosecutor&#8217;s office in Hannover, which on Monday opened an investigation against Edathy, said he had received videos and photos of naked boys between 9 and 14 years from the Canadian firm on several occasions during the period between 2005 and 2010.</p>
<p>Edathy, son of a migrant from Kerala, charged that the prosecutor&#8217;s office opened an investigation against him without any concrete charges, carrying out raids on his houses and offices last week and publishing photos on the raids.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986864&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The wreckage of a missing Nepal Airlines plane carrying 18 people was found on Monday in the country&#8217;s mountainous west and rescuers are trying to ascertain if there is any survivor.  The Twin Otter was found crashed at Masine Lek in Arghakhanchi district.  &#8220;We have found the aircraft crashed in the site, but it is yet to be confirmed, whether the passengers and crew members survived or not,&#8221; Nepal Police spokesman Ganesh KC said.</p>
<p>According to media reports, no one is believed to have survived in the crash. Security personnel located the crash site after tracking the mobile phone carried by Captain Shanker Shrestha. The 19-seater plane carrying 15 passengers including an infant and three crew members lost contact with air traffic controllers shortly after taking off from the popular tourist town of Pokhara yesterday.</p>
<p>The aircraft from the state-run carrier was travelling to the town of Jumla. Heavy rain hampered yesterday&#8217;s efforts to locate the plane with two helicopters forced to turn back because of bad weather. One of the passengers was from Denmark and the rest were from Nepal, said airline spokesman Ram Hari Sharma.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986742&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/renzi-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986737" alt="Leftist leader Matteo Renzi became Italy's Youngest Prime Minister. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/renzi-480.jpg" /></a> Leftist leader Matteo Renzi became Italy&#8217;s Youngest Prime Minister. (Reuters)
<p>Italian leftist leader Matteo Renzi is to be nominated Italy&#8217;s youngest-ever prime minister today after a daring power grab that has been welcomed by investors, but has left many Italians sceptical.  As head of the Democratic Party, Renzi engineered the ouster of his predecessor Enrico Letta &#8211; a member of his own party &#8211; accusing him of failing to live up to reform pledges in his stormy 10 months in the government.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old will have to move quickly to form a new government once he gets the mandate from President Giorgio Napolitano as expected at 0930 GMT, and then deliver his promise to lead Italy &#8220;out of the quagmire&#8221;. The previous coalition of the Democratic Party, the centrists and the New Centre-Right party is expected to remain intact even though the leader of the latter, Angelino Alfano, has warned this is &#8220;not a given&#8221;.</p>
<p>The New Centre-Right is a minor partner in the coalition but its votes would be critical for Renzi as all other parties say they are staying in opposition and he does not have a majority in parliament. If he succeeds in forming the government, Renzi would then have to return to Napolitano for his nomination to be confirmed and would then be sworn into office.</p>
<p>Analysts say the whole process could take a few days. The energetic and web-savvy Renzi, who is also mayor of Florence, has no previous experience in national government or parliament and is seen by many as having the right kind of outsider credentials for the job. But his critics warn he risks burning out rapidly.</p>
<p>Many people seem willing to give him the benefit of the doubt even though they would have preferred early elections, as long as Renzi delivers on his promises to combat rampant unemployment and boost growth. His on-the-ground local achievements like lowering some taxes, boosting recycling and encouraging innovation are seen as positive signs but analysts say he will really now have to prove himself on a much bigger scale.</p>
<p>Renzi is little known internationally but sees himself in the mould of former British prime minister Tony Blair and his &#8220;New Labour&#8221; programme and his rise is being closely-watched by centre-left parties in Europe. He would be the youngest serving government leader in the European Union.</p>
<p>His informal style is unusual in Italy&#8217;s political world and his prolific use of social media and knack for catchphrases have endeared him to many younger Italians turned off by an ageing political elite.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986734&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SDP) has defended its stand on its Indian-origin former MP’s alleged involvement in child pornography, dismissing claims that he was informed about plans to open an investigation against him.</span></p>
<p>Sebastian Edathy, 44, is suspected of involvement in child pornography.</p>
<p>Sigmar Gabriel, chairman of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), has indicated that the party’s leadership was considering its long-time spokesman on home affairs and managing board member for a government post during the coalition negotiations with chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) last October.</p>
<p>“We were in the midst of taking crucial decisions on personnel when former interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich informed him about intelligence information that Mr Edathy’s name emerged during investigations into a globally-operating child pornography ring,” Gabriel said.</p>
<p>“The information given by Friedrich was very helpful for the SPD and therefore his decision on Friday to resign from his post as the minister for food and agriculture in the new cabinet is especially bitter for the SPD,” Gabriel said in a television interview.</p>
<p>Friedrich tendered his resignation following allegations that he had leaked confidential intelligence information on Edathy and about plans to open an investigation against him, enabling him to remove or destroy crucial evidence.</p>
<p>The SPD leadership insisted that it kept this information secret and it was not passed on to Edathy.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Bosbach, home affairs spokesman of the CDU, said Edathy could have become a parliamentary secretary or even the justice minister in the new government. But, it would have been catastrophic if the probe against him on suspicion of possessing or attempting to acquire child pornography were launched only after he assumed a new government office.</p>
<p>Therefore, Friedrich did the right thing by informing Gabriel about the intelligence information concerning the SPD politician’s alleged attempts to acquire child pornography and plans to open an investigation against him, Bosbach said.</p>
<p>Edathy, son of a migrant from Kerala, unexpectedly laid down his parliamentary seat last Friday after more than 15 years on health grounds.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986515&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/morsi-m.jpg" /></a> Former Egypt president Mohammed Morsi. (Reuters)
<p>Egypt&#8217;s deposed president Mohamed Morsi charged he was being muzzled in a soundproof dock at the start of his trial on espionage charges today, as his defence lawyers staged a protest walk-out.</p>
<p>The court adjourned the trial, the third for the Islamist since his July 3 ouster, to February 23 to allow the lawyers&#8217;syndicate to appoint new lawyers. Morsi, who has shouted that he was Egypt&#8217;s legitimate and elected president in hearings of other trials against him, said the court was trying to silence him. &#8220;We are in a farce, all this because you are afraid of me. You are afraid that the president speaks,&#8221; Morsi cried out.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this farce continues, don&#8217;t come to the court,&#8221; Morsi told his defence. Mohamed Selim al-Awa, a member of the defence team, told AFP: &#8220;We have withdrawn until the court removes the glass cage, we will not get in the room today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The soundproof dock is designed to stop Morsi and the other defendants from interrupting the proceedings with outbursts. On Sunday, 20 defendants were brought to court, including Morsi, who was placed in a separate dock with a former aide, and the brotherhood&#8217;s supreme guide Mohamed Badie and his deputy Khairat al-Shater.</p>
<p>The accused include former presidential aides and renowned political scientist Emad Shahin, who is being tried in absentia. The latest court case is part of a relentless government crackdown targeting Morsi and his Islamist supporters since he was ousted by the military after a single year in power.</p>
<p>Morsi and 35 others, including leaders of his Muslim Brotherhood, are accused of espionage &#8220;for the international organisation of the Muslim Brotherhood, its military wing and (Palestinian) Hamas movement.&#8221; If found guilty, the defendants could face the death penalty.</p>
<p>Morsi, who was Egypt&#8217;s first democratically elected and civilian president, is already on trial for alleged involvement in the killing of opposition protesters in December 2012. Along with 130 others, including dozens of members of Hamas and Lebanon&#8217;s Shiite militant group Hezbollah, he is separately being tried on charges linked to a jailbreak during the 2011 uprising that toppled strongman Hosni Mubarak. The ousted leader also faces trial for &#8220;insulting the judiciary&#8221;. A date for that has yet to be set.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986423&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/zz1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986383" alt="Anti-government opposition set an impossible condition for dialogue by saying he would only talk with former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who is in self-exile." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/zz1.jpg" /></a> Anti-government opposition set an impossible condition for dialogue by saying he would only talk with former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who is in self-exile.
<p>Thailand&#8217;s political crisis deepened Sunday after the main protest leader said the door for talks had &#8220;shut&#8221; even as the government threatened to use force to reclaim key state buildings besieged for months by opposition activists bent on toppling premier Yingluck Shinawatra.</p>
<p>Suthep Thaugsuban, who heads the anti-government People&#8217;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), set an impossible condition for dialogue by saying he would only talk with former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who is in self-exile.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the door for talks should be considered shut. I won&#8217;t have talks with Yingluck, either in secret or in public. Also, I won&#8217;t negotiate with any representative from the government because they have no real power,&#8221; said Suthep, a former deputy premier and opposition Democrat Party leader.</p>
<p>He was of the view that Thaksin, the brother of Yingluck who is in self-exile to avoid a jail term, would not return to Thailand and risk being arrested as he had been convicted for abuse of power. He claimed Thaksin was the de-facto leader of the current caretaker government.</p>
<p>Thaksin was ousted in a coup in 2006 and lives in Dubai.</p>
<p>Chalerm Yubamrung, director of the Centre for Maintaining Peace and Order (CMPO) that is overseeing the response to the protests, said rally sites in the vicinity of the premier&#8217;s office, known as Government House, will be seized back from protesters and there will be no more talks since previous attempts had failed.</p>
<p>Police forces would be used to retake these sites. If met with resistance by protesters, who are said to be armed, police might have to use guns to protect themselves, Chalerm, also the caretaker Labour Minister, was quoted as saying by Bangkok Post.</p>
<p>Saturday, he directed authorities to ensure that the premier&#8217;s office compound is reopened by Wednesday as Yingluck intends to return to the building.</p>
<p>The premier and her cabinet have been working from an undisclosed location after protesters occupied key buildings as part of their three-month-old campaign to oust Yingluck and install an unelected &#8220;People&#8217;s Council&#8221; to carry out reforms.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986378&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>A severe snowstorm sweeping across Japan has killed 12 people and left more than 1,650 injured, Japanese media reported on Sunday, as the extreme weather sparked widespread transport chaos. At least a dozen people have died in snow-related incidents in seven prefectures after the storm broke records, with Tokyo blanketed in 27 centimetres of snow, according to Kyodo news agency.</p>
<p>A further 2,150 people have been evacuated from their homes over fears the weight of the snow would cause their houses to collapse, public broadcaster NHK said. At least 800 cars are stuck on a hillside trunk road in Japan and other roads nearby after they were hit by the snowstorm, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>More than 100 flights were grounded on Friday and Saturday besides disrupting several major rail services. The storm is now moving northward and is expected to strengthen by tomorrow, Japan&#8217;s meteorological agency said, warning of heavy snow, blizzards and avalanches as well as high waves in eastern and northern Japan.</p>
<p>National Route 18 that runs through Gunma and Nagano prefectures north of Tokyo is partly closed as hundreds of cars are stuck due to heavy snow, a local official told AFP. The congestion extends for several kilometres, said the official in the ski resort of Karuizawa in Nagano prefecture. &#8220;We have opened up three community halls nearby for people who were inside the stuck cars, and are now preparing to offer hot meals,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986376&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/taliban-480.jpg" /></a> The Taliban is using social media to spread propaganda. (AP)
<p>Terrorist organisations in Pakistan like the Taliban are increasingly using social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook to spread their propaganda and as a means of intimidation. A number of Twitter accounts allegedly managed by members of the banned Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan have emerged, on which they post messages and engage in dialogue with their followers. Facebook pages are used to upload statements and videos.</p>
<p>&#8220;The TTP is dominating the media. I feel they are savvier at spreading their message in a subtle way. Tackling them is not just about dialogue or military operations. We need comprehensive and broad policy to neutralise them,&#8221; Lt Gen (retired) Talat Masood, a leading security analyst, told PTI.</p>
<p>Some media houses in Pakistan have introduced &#8220;self-censorship&#8221; when it comes to articles against the TTP, which is a dangerous trend, he said. In the recent past, the TTP attacked the Karachi-based Express media group here thrice, creating fear in journalistic circles. Analysts said social media had been used in the past, but it now plays a bigger role.</p>
<p>Last year, the TTP posted a message on Facebook seeking writers for their magazine, but the page was eventually shut down by the social media network. The Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), declared a front for the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba by the UN Security Council after the 2008 Mumbai attacks, has a dedicated media-wing that posts updates on its activities on social media networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sophisticated terrorist organisations like the TTP and Al-Qaeda realise that, in addition to violence, propaganda is needed for the successful orchestration of their activities,&#8221; a recent article by writer Fawad Rehman said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986368&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hamid-480.jpg" /></a> Afghan President Hamid Karzai says he wants limited NATO troops. (AP)
<p>Amid his standoff with the Obama administration on a Bilateral Security Agreement, embattled President Hamid Karzai has asked the US and its allies not to &#8220;interfere&#8221; in Afghanistan&#8217;s crucial presidential polls.<br />
Presidential candidates in the war-ravaged country began two months of campaigning on February 2 for an election that Washington and its allies hope will bring much-needed stability before the US-led troops exit after 13 years of inconclusive war.</p>
<p>Karzai, 56, said his government will ensure &#8220;transparent and fair&#8221; elections to be held on April 5. &#8220;Surely, from our side, it will be transparent and fair and that&#8217;s what Afghanistan needs and I hope also that the United States and its Western allies will make sure that they refrain from interference and that they allow Afghans to cast their vote and to elect their president,&#8221; he said on Saturday in Afghanistan&#8217;s second largest city.</p>
<p>He was speaking after he jointly inaugurated Afghanistan&#8217;s first agriculture university, built with Indian aid, with External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid. Karzai is ineligible to seek a third term and among the front-runners in the polls are his elder brother, Qayum Karzai, former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah and former Islamist warlord Abdul Rassoul Sayyaf.</p>
<p>The Afghan President&#8217;s refusal to sign the security pact has strained relations with the US. Karzai further escalated tensions last Thursday by releasing 65 Taliban militants from a former US prison at Bagram near Kabul. If the security pact is not signed, the Pentagon&#8217;s biggest challenge will be closing huge military facilities like those in Bagram and Kandahar. US-led combat operations in Afghanistan are set to end by the end of this year, but the Obama administration is seeking to keep up to 10,000 troops on the ground for counter-terrorism and training missions.</p>
<p>Karzai explained his stance on the delay in signing the Bilateral Security Agreement with the US. &#8220;I am not against a limited presence of NATO troops in Afghanistan after 2014. What we are seeking is that their presence must become a source of support for Afghanistan, a stable Afghanistan without incidents of the type we have had in the past 10 years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He emphasised Afghanistan needs the support of both the US and Pakistan to move forward with its peace process. Reacting to reports that he had clandestinely opened his own channels of communication with the Taliban, Karzai said it was important to find &#8220;all opportunities&#8221; for engagement. &#8220;The Afghan High Peace Council&#8217;s job is to engage in peace talks with the Taliban and to find all avenues, all opportunities of such engagements and that should be of happiness to the US and NATO. It should be a positive news for them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you read in the media is a different story of course,&#8221; he said as the Taliban yesterday marked the 25th anniversary of the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. Karzai stressed that the West &#8220;must look towards the defeat of terrorism in Afghanistan in trying to address the sanctuaries, the training grounds, the motivational factors, the financial sources of terrorism and not in continuing or turning a blind eye to the continuation of conflict&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Afghan President also commented on the Pakistan government&#8217;s efforts to hold talks with the Pakistani Taliban. &#8220;Peace talks between the government of Pakistan and the Pakistani Taliban is something that we welcome and we hope that Pakistan also recognises that it is in its interest to help the Afghan Taliban also begin talks with the Afghan government,&#8221; Karzai said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986354&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Sunday it would be nearly impossible for the European Union to agree on granting membership to newly-formed states that elect to break away from an existing member country.</p>
<p>Barroso&#8217;s comments were made after he was asked if an independent Scotland would be welcome to join the EU, although he said he did not want to comment specifically on that scenario. Scotland is due to hold a referendum on independence in September. &#8220;It would be extremely difficult to get approval of all the other member states to have a new member coming from one member state,&#8221; Barroso said in a BBC television interview. &#8220;I believe it&#8217;s going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barroso, whose mandate as head of the EU executive ends in October, has previously said that any newly independent state would have to re-apply to join the EU.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986339&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Twin Otter aircraft with 18 people on board is missing, including a foreigner, went missing on Sunday while on its way from a popular tourist resort to a town in western Nepal. It is feared that the missing aircraft might have crashed.</p>
<p>Airport sources said the 42-year old aircraft 9N ABB that was bound for western Nepal&#8217;s Jumla district, when it reportedly went missing.</p>
<p>The crew last contacted the ATC tower around 1.13 a m informing about bad weather condition, and its inability to proceed towards the destination.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost all contact after that,&#8221; the authorities said , adding that a rescue team of the Nepal army has been pressed into service to trace the aircraft.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mosquito-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986284" alt="Reinhardt considers this a clear indicator that the insects were to be used as an offensive biological weapon." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mosquito-main.jpg" /></a> Reinhardt considers this a clear indicator that the insects were to be used as an offensive biological weapon.
<p>Nazi German scientists secretly planned to breed &#8216;super-mosquitoes&#8217; infested with malaria that could be air-dropped into enemy territory during World War II, a researcher has claimed.</p>
<p>Dr Klaus Reinhardt from Tubingen University has found historical evidence of biological weapons research in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>While studying documents from the Waffen-SS Entomological Institute, an annex of Dachau concentration camp, Reinhardt wondered why the armed wing of the Nazi party needed to study insects.</p>
<p>It made no sense – during World War II, Germany already had several respected entomological research centers; nor did the SS institute study insects which presented a potential threat to Germany&#8217;s important food supplies, Klaus said.</p>
<p>After combing the archives, and building upon postwar studies, Reinhardt came to the conclusion that, although the institute was intended to combat insect-borne diseases such as typhoid, it also carried out research into whether mosquitoes &#8211; which host malaria &#8211; could be used in biological warfare.</p>
<p>It has been debated for many years whether Nazi Germany sought to produce biological weapons despite Hitler&#8217;s ban on them. Reinhardt&#8217;s findings are likely to re-ignite that discussion, researchers said.</p>
<p>Heinrich Himmler, head of the Schutzstaffel (SS), commissioned the Entomological Institute in Dachau in January 1942, presumably after reports of lice infestation among SS troops, and following an outbreak of typhoid fever at Neuengamme concentration camp.</p>
<p>The instructions Himmler issued in 1942 were for basic research required to combat germ-carrying insects &#8211; involving the life cycles, diseases, predators and preferred hosts of beetles, lice, fleas and flies.</p>
<p>Reinhardt said that in 1944, the SS Entomological Institute was also tasked with testing various species of mosquito for their ability to survive without food or water &#8211; and thus, their suitability to be infected with malaria and air-dropped into enemy territory.</p>
<p>Reinhardt examined notes by the institute&#8217;s director, Eduard May.</p>
<p>He found lab reports which detailed experiments with anopheles mosquitoes, which can host malaria during part of its development.</p>
<p>May recommended the use of one particular anopheles mosquito species which could survive for more than four days.</p>
<p>Reinhardt considers this a clear indicator that the insects were to be used as an offensive biological weapon.</p>
<p>Reinhardt said one reason why Dachau was chosen as the location for the insect study facility was one of the infamous experimentation programmes carried out there – the inoculation of prisoners with malaria by Professor Claus Schilling, who was later executed at Nuremberg.</p>
<p>However, Reinhardt found no evidence that May collaborated with Schilling.</p>
<p>The research is published in the journal Endeavour.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986281&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Heavy snow hit Tokyo and other parts of eastern Japan over the weekend, leaving 12 people dead, hundreds of thousands of households without electricity, and causing major disruptions to air and ground traffic.</p>
<p>Tokyo saw as much as 27 cm (10.6 inches) of snow, on par with last weekend&#8217;s snowstorms, which were the heaviest in 45 years.<br />
ANA Holdings, Japan&#8217;s largest carrier, said 338 domestic flights and 12 international flights were cancelled on Saturday due to the heavy snow.</p>
<p>In Kawasaki, west of Tokyo, a train crashed into another after the snow rendered its brakes ineffective, leaving 19 passengers injured. It also snarled traffic on some of Tokyo&#8217;s most heavily travelled roads.</p>
<p>The heavy snow also caused wide-spread power outages.</p>
<p>Tokyo Electric Power Co Inc, which serves the nation&#8217;s capital and surrounding regions, said up to 246,000 households were without electricity at one point on Saturday.</p>
<p>As of 12:30 p.m. (0330 GMT) on Sunday, about 18,000 homes were still without power, the utility said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986237&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sodden communities along the River Thames braced for more floods on Sunday, as Britain counted the cost of a storm that claimed several lives and left tens of thousands of homes without power.</p>
<p>At least three people were killed in separate incidents in Ireland, Britain and the English Channel after violent winds and heavy rain swept in from the Atlantic on Friday.</p>
<p>Pulling down power lines and disrupting transport networks across the region, the storm brought fresh misery to flood-hit communities in Britain, parts of which are suffering their wettest start to the year for 250 years.</p>
<p>Prime Minister David Cameron warned yesterday that the worst was not yet over as he visited the Thames-side village of Chertsey, west of London, to see how the military were helping bolster flood defences.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do in the next 24 hours is vital because tragically the river levels will rise again. So every sand bag delivered, every house helped, every flood barrier put in place can make a big difference,&#8221; Cameron said.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 members of the military are involved in the flood relief effort, according to the defence ministry, as the government seeks to counter criticism that it was too slow to respond to the crisis.</p>
<p>Fourteen severe flood alerts warning of a risk to life were in place along the River Thames yesterday night, with another two issued for the southwest of England, which has borne the brunt of two months of heavy rain.</p>
<p>In a newspaper interview published today, opposition Labour leader Ed Miliband blamed climate change for the run of bad weather and urged government ministers to treat global warming as a &#8220;national security issue&#8221;.</p>
<p>Cameron said last month that &#8220;I very much suspect&#8221; there is a link but said that either way, there should be more investment in flood defences.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986216&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Fans of the reality show The Biggest Loser are outraged and concerned over the latest champion, who lost 60 per cent of her original body weight.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985937&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It is the moment The Biggest Loser viewers anticipate all season. That episode when the finalists emerge to bare all — or rather less — to millions. But when Rachel Frederickson, 24, walked onto the studio stage 155 pounds lighter than at the start of Season 15, the reaction was not one of awe, but shock.</span></p>
<p>In the few months since Frederickson, 5 feet 4 inches tall, had left the ranch for her home, her body had radically changed from the 260 pounds she had weighed upon her departure to a gaunt sliver, obvious despite her shimmering silver dress, strappy sandals and big grin. Frederickson now weighed 105 pounds and, having lost 59.62 per cent of her body weight, would also be the competition’s winner, making her $250,000 richer.</p>
<p>But few were celebrating on Twitter. “I feel like Rachel lost too much,” one woman wrote. Another posted, “There needs to be a red line that disqualifies finalists for too much weight loss.”</p>
<p>Kai Hibbard, a finalist on Season 3, was at her home in Alaska when another former contestant sent her a message. “Have you seen tonight’s winner?” it read. “NBC is about to have a public-relations nightmare.” When Hibbard pulled up Frederickson’s photo, she burst into tears.</p>
<p>“Rachel doesn’t know what damage she has done to her body and her mind, and sadly she won’t until the spotlight goes away,” said Hibbard, 35, who seven years ago lost 118 pounds during her competition but has since spoken out publicly against the show’s extreme dieting and exercise regimen. “I feel I did a disservice by not saying on television the night of my finale, ‘I’m sad, and I’m sick from being on this show’,” she said, recalling that her hair had begun falling out from a vitamin deficiency. “I should have walked off the set. The only difference between Rachel and me is she looked on the outside the way I was feeling on the inside, totally unhealthy.”</p>
<p>Two days after the finale, NBC and the production company, Shine America, issued a statement saying: “We support Rachel and all of The Biggest Loser contestants. We remain committed to helping contestants achieve healthy weight loss and healthier lifestyles, and to inspiring viewers.”</p>
<p>In a conference call, Frederickson attributed her weight loss to workouts, saying “she takes maybe three, four classes a day.”</p>
<p>Since the show aired, two of the trainers addressed Frederickson’s drastic weight loss. Dolvett Quince, who worked with her, wrote in part on his Facebook page, “Rachel’s health is and always has been my main concern, and her journey to good health has not yet ended.” Bob Harper said, “What people don’t understand is when contestants leave home&#8230; they are in charge of themselves.”</p>
<p>But Hibbard recorded in detail in a daily journal the unhealthy behaviour she and others practised on the ranch, particularly 24 hours before a weigh-in. Contestants, she says, dehydrated themselves through excessive workouts in warm clothing, drank only coffee because it acts as a diuretic and ate little to nothing.</p>
<p>Jennifer J Thomas, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and co-director of the Eating Disorders Clinical and Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, believes The Biggest Loser is teaching wrong dieting behaviours. “If a person you knew was working out six hours a day and eating a very restricted calorie diet, you would be worried they had an eating disorder,” said Thomas, who is also co-author of the book Almost Anorexic.</p>
<p>For her part, Frederickson said, “I’ve never felt this great.” But most of the hundreds of comments on her Facebook page echoed this post: “Rachel, I love you, but please, for us, get medical help.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985937&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[After Golden Globe win and a new love, the reticent Robin Wright is now a director.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985936&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">At a production house in Los Angeles last month, a director and editor worked on an episode of the second season of Netflix’s House of Cards. They toggled back and forth over a scene in which Representative Francis Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey, and his wife, Claire, played by Robin Wright, are in their bedroom with a laptop, looking at clips from his political career and talking about the road they have chosen.</span></p>
<p>House of Cards is about many things — the absolutes of power, the contagious nature of scandal, how politics is personal — but it is fundamentally about a marriage. It is an unusual one, a business partnership between intimate accomplices. In this scene, the Underwoods are bathed in warm indirect light that is a trademark of the series, conceived by the film director David Fincher (The Social Network).</p>
<p>“Would it be too many cuts, to go back to Kevin’s face one more time?” the director asked. That would be fine, the editor said. Satisfied, the director spun in her chair, ready for a break.</p>
<p>The director of the episode is, in fact, Wright. On camera since she was a teenager, she is for the first time calling the shots. Two nights later, she would accept the Golden Globe for best actress in a dramatic series, a shimmering silver gown draped over her lithe, elegant frame, her classic features beaming in surprise. But in the editing suite, she was barefoot in jeans, with glasses under a newsboy’s cap.</p>
<p>The dazzling looks that first surfaced in the soap opera Santa Barbara and then were on wide display in The Princess Bride, Forrest Gump (1994), She’s So Lovely (1997) and Unbreakable (2000) were tough to spot.</p>
<p>Wright, 47, is a bit of a legend for passing on dozens of lucrative roles — in Batman Forever for example — and for fleeing the spotlight. As an actress, mother, wife — she was married to Sean Penn — she has lived a life of remove, with a reputation for reticence that some read as imperiousness.</p>
<p>Wright was clearly in a very good mood. She is in love, newly engaged to the actor Ben Foster (Lone Survivor). She is happy to be in the middle of House of Card’s grand tale of political intrigue, and animated by working on the other side of the camera. “It feels like a second coming,” she said. “I didn’t work a lot because I wanted to raise my kids. I have no regret about that. But this is a very different chapter.”</p>
<p>At the end of the first season, when Spacey mentioned he might direct in the second season, she was surprised. “I said, ‘I want to, too’,” she said. “As an actor, I had noticed very vividly that very few directors know how to direct actors. I’m not at all sure I know what I am doing, but I know what brings good work out of actors.”</p>
<p>She is eager to direct more, is working on a screenplay with Foster, and, given her performance in House of Cards, is very much back in the mix as an actress. The Globe will add luster, as will her role in A Most Wanted Man, with the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.</p>
<p>“She literally turned her back on the business, raised her family and didn’t chase roles,” Fincher said. “When I worked with her on Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, she was there, extremely present. We already had Kevin Spacey in mind, and we needed a formidable Lady Macbeth. I have always been gobsmacked by her. Let’s just say it involved a lot of grovelling.”</p>
<p>Part of what convinced him that the animated, impish Wright could play the imperious, inscrutable Claire Underwood was some flashes he saw on the set.</p>
<p>“She is so charming, but she can be utterly withering if she thinks the people around her are not being serious,” he said.</p>
<p>Eric Roth, a writer-producer on House of Cards, watched her play Jenny, the lifelong love of the title character in Forrest Gump, a movie he wrote. He said that her on-screen alchemy is rare. “There is the broken angel part of her,” he said, “but there is also something fundamentally unattainable about her. There is a distancing quality she uses to very good effect.”</p>
<p>Her children are now grown, but as Wright’s profile rises, don’t look for her on a lot of red carpets. “I don’t get the awards ceremony theory, or rather I don’t understand the religion of it,” she said. “There’s a gratitude in hearing my name, but I don’t understand anybody deciding what is good and not good work.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985936&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[In a play on one of America’s greatest legislative presidents, and how he wrought political change, Bryan Cranston moves from illegal chemistry to hardball politics.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985935&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">With his rich baritone hinting of the American West and craggy handsome looks, Bryan Cranston seems custom built to play outsize heartland characters. Where was he, you wonder, when Sam Shepard was writing Buried Child and True West? </span></p>
<p>Cranston did star in Shepard’s The God of Hell in 2006 — just before his career-defining transformation into Walter White, the chemistry teacher turned drug lord and high executioner on the hit series Breaking Bad. But he’s done relatively little theatre, which raises the stakes for his Broadway debut in All The Way, a three-hour production in which he’s onstage as Lyndon Baines Johnson almost every minute.</p>
<p>Filled with arcane talk about “procedural votes”, All the Way is not standard Broadway fare. But beyond Cranston’s star power, the producers are also counting on timing: The story of a ruthless president who got things done —without blinking at the costs and compromises — reminds us that partisan gridlock doesn’t have to be a permanent condition.</p>
<p>“I think audiences are hungry for a play of this size and ambition,” said Robert Schenkkan, the playwright. “There’s something about 20 bodies on the stage wrestling in this muscular visceral way with the political issues that still haunt us.”</p>
<p>At its centre is Cranston, 57. “Bryan has the two things you want in the actor who plays LBJ,” Schenkkan said. “He’s incredibly charismatic and charming and funny. And he’s also terrifying.” All the Way, which originated at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival with another actor in the lead, covers the first 12 months of Johnson’s presidency, beginning with the assassination of John F Kennedy and ending with his own victory in the next election.</p>
<p>But what it’s really about is the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the landmark Bill that officially ended almost a century of Jim Crow. It is at once moral drama and historical pageant, with players that include Martin Luther King Jr and Stokely Carmichael; Senate giants Hubert Humphrey and Richard Russell; FBI despot J Edgar Hoover and Alabama segregationist George C Wallace.</p>
<p>And it is almost insolently long for a Broadway show.</p>
<p>For all but 15 or 20 minutes, Cranston is enthroned in the Oval Office, prowling the stage in two-inch lifts to bring him closer to Johnson’s towering 6-foot-3, attached to a telephone that seems an extra limb — cajoling, wheedling, bullying, threatening, lying and bleating at the 19 other actors who play some 60 parts.</p>
<p>Dubious conduct in a person, but useful in a political animal, even if Johnson would in the end defeat himself. “I wanted to play LBJ,” Cranston said, “because he is the King Lear of modern theatre in this play.”</p>
<p>Prosthetic nose, earlobes and chin help, but “I do the voice and his body movements”, Cranston said. He listened to White House tapes and made research trips to the Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, Texas, where he met, among others, Johnson’s younger daughter, Luci.</p>
<p>What he can’t mimic is Johnson’s slovenliness, the sagging frame and feed-sack belly. “I need to do eight shows for five months, I need to be slimmer,” he said. “I need to have my body support me. I need my vocal strength.” That means a carb-free diet as well as a vow of silence on Mondays, when the theatre is dark.</p>
<p>In Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream, which is as much psychological portrait as biography, Doris Kearns Goodwin described Johnson’s political skills as “a surrogate for love and acceptance”. Cranston read it closely and discussed Johnson with her — his neediness, his insecurity, his fear of being alone. “He was a morass of self-loathing,” Cranston said.</p>
<p>But in 2014, the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act and the War on Poverty, with anniversaries of the Voting Rights Act and Medicare, a year away, Johnson endures as something far more interesting and even inspiring: the last and perhaps greatest of all legislative presidents, with his wizardly grip on the levers of governance at a time when it was still possible for deals to be brokered and favours swapped and for combatants to clash in an atmosphere of respect, if not concord.</p>
<p>Through a wealth of facts, All The Way depicts the means by which political change comes in a nation so large and diverse.</p>
<p>But the true theme is deeper: the rootedness of the present in the past, the blurring of history and memory. The shifting battle lines drawn onstage — between blacks and whites, Northerners and Southerners, liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans — feel at once distant and familiar.</p>
<p>Put most simply, All the Way is a metaphor about democracy, each of us a political creature craving to be heard above the collective din. “The power makers deciding, and the disenfranchised watching it, until they demand their place,” Schenkkan said.</p>
<p>“We embrace the chaotic aspect of democracy. It’s a fluid thing. Groups form and coalesce, drift apart.”<br />
Or as Cranston put it: “You’re in a political arena, and there’s a lot of people. The scope of it needs to feel presidential and big.”</p>
<p>And though Schenkkan has already written a follow-up to All the Way, called The Great Society, which follows Johnson through the crushing finish of his presidency, Cranston isn’t ready to think about continuing with the role.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985935&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A winter storm that brought snow and ice to the US East Coast moved off-shore Friday, leaving at least 25 dead and hundreds of thousands without power and causing a large pileup in Pennsylvania that injured 30 people.</span></p>
<p>Across the US, this is shaping up as one of the snowiest winters. As of early this month, Washington, Detroit, Boston, Chicago, New York and St Louis had gotten roughly two or three times as much snow as they normally receive at this point in the season.</p>
<p>The latest go-round of bad weather came just in time to delay tens of thousands of deliveries of Valentine’s Day flowers, dropping snow, sleet and rain on roads already covered with deep puddles and icy patches.</p>
<p>The snow, sleet and ice that bombarded the Southeast on Wednesday brought its ferocity into the Northeast on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Numerous traffic accidents involving multiple tractor-trailers and dozens of cars completely blocked one side of the Pennsylvania Turnpike outside Philadelphia on Friday morning and injured 30 people, none seriously. The crashes were reported about five hours after snowing stopped. Speed restrictions enacted during the storm had been lifted, but motorists say the roadway was coated with ice.</p>
<p>By the time it stopped falling, 22.5 inches of snow was reported in one Pennsylvania County. Parts of upstate New York got up to 27 inches. Washington DC received 9 inches of snow, while New York City got nearly 10 inches.</p>
<p>The sloppy mix of snow and face-stinging sleet grounded more than 6,500 flights nationwide on Thursday and about 2,100 more on Friday.</p>
<p>About 1.2 million utility customers lost power as the storm moved from the South through the Northeast, dropping to about 450,000 outages by Friday morning, mostly in South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>The treacherous weather was blamed for more than two dozen deaths, many of them in motor vehicle accidents.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985946&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>Amidst calls by the Taliban for implementing Sharia in Pakistan, PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Saturday said efforts are being made to drag the country back to the &#8220;stone age&#8221; in the name of Islam.</p>
<p>Addressing a gathering during the closing ceremony of the two-week Sindh Festival, Bilawal also raised questions about the PML-N government&#8217;s peace talks with the banned Taliban.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Taliban want to impose the law of terror in the country but I want to tell them, if you have to live in Pakistan you will have to follow its Constitution,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t accept the law of terrorists,&#8221; said the 25-year-old scion of the Bhutto family. &#8220;Some people are trying to bring back the stone age era in the country in the name of Islam.</p>
<p>&#8220;The terrorists should think of the time when the whole nation will stand against them,&#8221; he said in Makli, around 100 km north of Karachi.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are Muslims and the terrorist groups should not try to teach us Islam,&#8221; said Bilawal, whose mother Benazir Bhutto&#8217;s assassination in 2007 was blamed on the Taliban.</p>
<p>Bilawal recalled the operation against the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan in Swat Valley in 2009 while criticising the current peace process. He said the nation was fully aware of what the Taliban had done in Swat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our country, our culture is in danger, our rulers didn’t tell us the truth, they tried to suppress us, they wanted to break us but we didn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say, &#8216;let&#8217;s talk&#8217;, please do, but ask me what will happen after talks because I know the consequences,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Pakistan government and the Taliban are engaged in preliminary talks to end militancy but many doubt the process will produce a lasting solution.</p>
<p>Bilawal, whose Pakistan People&#8217;s Party was routed in last year&#8217;s general elections but remains in power in southern Sindh province, has lashed against the Taliban and the peace talks in recent weeks.</p>
<p>He has spoken in support of military action against the Taliban across Pakistan though the PPP joined an All Parties Conference last year that endorsed the PML-N&#8217;s plans to hold dialogue with the Taliban.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985898&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>Beleaguered former military dictator Pervez Musharraf on Saturday was summoned by a Pakistani court to appear on March 1 in a case related to the killing of Lal Masjid cleric Abdul Rasheed Ghazi in a 2007 military raid.</p>
<p>The case is being heard by an additional sessions court in Islamabad. Musharraf&#8217;s lawyers submitted an application requesting that the 70-year-old former president be exempted from attending today&#8217;s proceedings.</p>
<p>The court accepted the application and ordered Musharraf to appear at the next hearing on March 1.</p>
<p>The judge directed authorities to submit a new supplementary chargesheet in the case before the next hearing.</p>
<p>The radical cleric died when the army stormed the pro-Taliban Lal Masjid in the heart of Islamabad in 2007 to flush out militants holed up in the mosque. About 100 people died in the assault.</p>
<p>The operation, ordered by Musharraf, followed a week-long standoff between extremists and security forces.</p>
<p>Musharraf is also scheduled to appear in a special court conducting his treason trial on February 18 and in another case over the detention of judges on February 24.</p>
<p>The former army chief was admitted to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology in Rawalpindi on January 2 after he developed heart problems while being taken to the special court. He has skipped all hearings in the treason trial, prompting the judges to issue a bailable arrest warrant for him.</p>
<p>Musharraf returned to Pakistan from self-exile last year to contest the general elections but was barred from polls for life by a High Court.</p>
<p>He was entangled in a web of cases that resulted in him being put under house arrest for over six months.</p>
<p>Though he secured bail in four major cases against him, the government formed the special court to try him on charges of high treason for imposing emergency in 2007.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985828&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/internetm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985786" alt="The number of Chinese bloggers in recent years touched 300 million with Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/internetm.jpg" /></a> The number of Chinese bloggers in recent years touched 300 million with Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. (Reuters)
<p>The US on Saturday asked Chinese leaders to support Internet freedom, saying it will help the world&#8217;s second largest economy grow stronger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, we think that the Chinese economy will be stronger with greater freedom of the Internet,&#8221; US Secretary of State John Kerry said at a meeting with Chinese bloggers after holding intensive talks with top Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.</p>
<p>Kerry held in-depth discussions with Xi on issues arising from US plans to rebalance its military strategy and deploy a majority of its military assets in the Asia-Pacific, something that has created disquiet in China.</p>
<p>He urged the Chinese leaders to open up more on the Internet and agreed to look into whether American companies help Beijing to curb access to online material.</p>
<p>During the 40-minute meeting with Kerry, the bloggers appealed to him to support Chinese human rights activists and help &#8220;tear down the great Internet firewall&#8221;.</p>
<p>The bloggers complained that while China has opened up Internet for education and business, it has built up an extensive system of monitoring and filters to block access to material deemed subversive or obscene.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese bloggers in recent years touched 300 million with Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, emerging as an alternate media challenging the monopoly of state media.</p>
<p>The US and China, the world&#8217;s two largest emitters of greenhouse gases, also agreed to cooperate more closely in combating climate change.</p>
<p>A joint statement after Kerry’s two-day visit concluded today said the two governments had agreed on steps to curb output of greenhouse gases that trap solar heat in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The two sides agreed on steps to reduce vehicle emissions, improve energy efficiency of buildings and other measures. The two governments will &#8220;contribute significantly to successful 2015 global efforts to meet this challenge,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>It cited the &#8220;overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change and its worsening impacts, and the related issue of air pollution from burning fossil fuels&#8221;, and said the two countries recognise the urgent need for action.</p>
<p>The two countries launched the US-China Climate Change Working Group last year, promising progress in five areas, including the reduction of vehicle emissions, advanced electric power grids, capturing and storing carbon emissions, gathering greenhouse gas data and building efficiency.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985777&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Syria&#8217;s warring sides are due to meet on Saturday in Geneva in a last-ditch effort to save deadlocked peace talks as fears grow the entire process could collapse.</p>
<p>UN mediator Lakhdar Brahimi will hold a final meeting with both sides as the second round of the UN-brokered peace talks wraps up with the rivals further apart than ever.</p>
<p>They appeared to only agree on one thing: that the negotiations were going nowhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;We deeply regret that this round did not make any progress,&#8221; said Syria&#8217;s deputy foreign minister, Faisal Muqdad, after meeting Brahimi yesterday.</p>
<p>Separately, opposition spokesman Louay Safi complained about the regime&#8217;s failure to budge, acknowledging that &#8220;the negotiations have reached an impasse.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the parties in Geneva failed to agree even on an agenda for their talks, the bodies piled up in Syria.</p>
<p>A monitoring group said on Thursday that more than 5,000 people had been killed since a first round of talks began on January 22.</p>
<p>At least 47 people were killed yesterday in a car bombing in front of the mosque in the southern rebel-held village of Yaduda, while the extremist ISIL group executed 27 people as rival rebels chased it from villages in the northern province of Aleppo.</p>
<p>The United Nations warned that more than 2,700 refugees had poured across the Lebanese border as the Syrian army carries out an offensive in the Qalamun mountains and heads towards the opposition-held town of Yabrud.</p>
<p>Thousands had already fled the town, but as many as 50,000 people were believed to still be inside.</p>
<p>Washington expressed outrage at the aerial bombings and siege of the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;We again call on all members of the international community, including Assad&#8217;s allies, to make clear to the regime that it must immediately cease these unwarranted attacks that undermine the Geneva process and the prospects of peace in Syria,&#8221; State Department spokesman Edgar Vasquez said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985761&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/thai-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985731" alt="The protesters want an appointed &quot;people's council&quot; to run the country. (AP Photo) " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/thai-med.jpg" /></a> The protesters want an appointed &#8220;people&#8217;s council&#8221; to run the country. (AP Photo)
<p>Anti-government protesters in Thailand on Saturday refused to end their rallies and vowed to fight &#8220;to the end&#8221;, even as embattled premier Yingluck Shinawatra&#8217;s government planned to step up its operation to clear demonstration sites.</p>
<p>The police on Friday launched &#8220;Operation Valentine&#8221; to clear public areas, marking a shift from earlier government policy as so far Yingluck had not taken any action, allowing protesters to take over state buildings, major intersections and set up tents on the road.</p>
<p>There were no violent clashes even after more than 1,500 police officers, donning helmets and carrying protective shields, dismantled a sprawling protest camp near the Government House on Friday.</p>
<p>Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban said he will not negotiate with Yingluck&#8217;s government and declared the ongoing protests will end when she quits and a People&#8217;s Council is set up.</p>
<p>Suthep said there have been several proposals from parties to mediate talks to solve the stalemate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to make it clear, there is nothing to negotiate. Our stance is clear. We will fight to the end, just win or lose,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His remarks came in the wake of operations by the Centre for Maintaining Peace and Order (CMPO) to reclaim areas occupied by anti-government protesters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have noting to negotiate. It&#8217;s easy to end our protests, Yingluck (Shinawatra), the prime minister, just quits and the people&#8217;s government and people&#8217;s legislative council are established to push for the country&#8217;s reform,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There was high drama on Friday as thousands of police personnel with riot shields fanned out to reclaim areas.</p>
<p>Almost a 1,000 policemen had to retreat from a rally site in the capital after a stand-off with demonstrators as protest leader Luang Pu Buddha Issara, a monk, refused to move from the area and vowed to get more supporters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Caretaker Labour Minister and chief of CMPO Chalerm Yoobamrung vowed to step up the operation to evict anti-government protesters.</p>
<p>Anti-government demonstrators have occupied major intersections in Bangkok and blocked several government ministries to pressure Yingluck to make way for an unelected &#8220;People&#8217;s Council&#8221; to carry out reforms aimed at curbing the dominance of the Shinawatra clan.</p>
<p>The protesters accuse Yingluck of acting as a puppet for her brother Thaksin Shinawatra who was ousted in a coup in 2006. He lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai to escape a jail term for graft.</p>
<p>Chalerm said yesterday&#8217;s &#8220;Operation Valentine&#8221; to &#8220;reclaim&#8221; the areas occupied by protesters had shown that the police were well prepared to raid protest sites at any time.</p>
<p>&#8220;After this, we will do it non-stop until everything is finished. We will reclaim the areas outside Government House. Whether it&#8217;s three days or seven days, we will have to enter the compound,&#8221; he was quoted by the Nation as saying.</p>
<p>However, Chalerm said protesters would not be dispersed, although the police would be ready to arrest the main protest leader Suthep if they had a chance to do so.</p>
<p>It was the authorities&#8217; first attempt to reclaim the protest sites since demonstrators began their &#8220;Bangkok shutdown&#8221; rally on January 13.</p>
<p>Thailand&#8217;s Election Commission has said it will talk with caretaker premier Yingluck&#8217;s party to try to resolve voting issues and find a solution to the current political impasse.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will resort to political science and legal principles to try to find a practical way out of this deadlock. If we fail to reach a conclusion, it will be impossible for us to complete the election process,&#8221; Election Commissioner Somchai Srisuthiyakorn said.</p>
<p>He said the Election Commission was yet to announce election results for constituencies that had not had any issues because advance voting had not been completed and it feared a &#8220;rival&#8221; political camp might take the agency to court to contest the results.</p>
<p>Somchai said the poll panel would take the results of the meeting on Monday into consideration before deciding whether to propose that the government to issue a royal decree to schedule a new election date for 28 constituencies that have no candidates for the House of Representatives.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985709&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Attacks and clashes in Iraq killed 16 soldiers and police overnight, as the country struggles to contain its worst violence in years, officials and doctors said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Five soldiers were killed during clashes with militants in the Jurf al-Sakhr area south of Baghdad.</p>
<p>Gunmen also killed a police colonel in his home in the city of Tikrit, north of Baghdad, and shot dead four soldiers on the area&#8217;s main highway, while a bomb killed five police farther north.</p>
<p>And militants killed a police captain who was attempting to evacuate his family from the town of Sulaiman Bek, part of which has been seized by gunmen.</p>
<p>Security forces are frequently targeted with bombings and shootings by militants opposed to the government.</p>
<p>Another 22 people died in attacks and clashes earlier Friday.</p>
<p>Violence has reached a level not seen since 2008, when Iraq was just emerging from a period of brutal sectarian killings.</p>
<p>Foreign leaders have urged the Shiite-led government to do more to reach out to the disaffected Sunni Arab minority to undercut support for militants.</p>
<p>But Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has taken a hard line ahead of a general election scheduled for April.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985707&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fifteen people, including 11 alleged terrorists, were killed in a suicide attack Friday by Islamic militants in China’s volatile Xinjiang province that coincided with a visit here by US Secretary of State John Kerry.</p>
<p>The alleged terrorists, on motorbikes and in cars carrying gas cylinders, attacked a police team near the gate of a park around 4 pm (local time) in Wushi County in the Aksu Prefecture of the province.</p>
<p>Eight men were killed by police and three others died in suicide blasts during the attack Friday afternoon in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
<p>The Tianshan web portal, run by the Xinjiang government, said besides the 11 attackers, two policemen and two passersby were killed while one assailant was detained. Photos posted on the site showed a charred police van and jeep.</p>
<p>Police said the “terrorists” had an unknown number of liquefied natural gas (LNG) cylinders in their car which they had attempted to use as bombs.</p>
<p>The attack coincided with Kerry’s visit to Beijing to hold talks with top Chinese leaders on a range of issues including human rights.</p>
<p>The province bordering Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Afghanistan has witnessed increasing confrontation between police and activists of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a Qaeda-backed group fighting for the separation of Xinjiang from China.</p>
<p>Six alleged terrorists were shot dead by police during an attack on a police station on January 24 in the county seat of Xinhe in the Aksu Prefecture. Last year, Beijing too for the first time witnessed a “suicide attack” at the Forbidden City here.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985329&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>An explosive volcanic eruption on Indonesia&#8217;s most populous island blasted ash and debris 18 kilometers into the air, killing three people while forcing authorities to evacuate more than 100,000 and close seven airports.</p>
<p>The overnight eruption of Java island&#8217;s Mount Kelud could be heard up to 200 kilometers away, Indonesia&#8217;s disaster agency said.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/inn-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985238" alt="Villagers evacuate from their homes on the slope of Mount Kelud which erupted in Blitar, Indonesia, Friday, Feb 14, 2014." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/inn-med.jpg" /></a> Villagers evacuate from their homes on the slope of Mount Kelud which erupted in Blitar, Indonesia, Friday, Feb 14, 2014.
<p>&#8220;The eruption sounded like thousands of bombs exploding,&#8221; Ratno Pramono, a 35-year-old farmer, said after returning from an evacuation center to check on his property in the village of Sugihwaras, around five kilometers (three miles) from the crater. &#8220;I thought doomsday was upon us. Women and children were screaming and crying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ash and grit fell to earth in towns and cities across the region, including Surabaya, Indonesia&#8217;s second-largest city after Jakarta, with a population of about 3 million. It also fell even farther afield in Yogyakarta, where motorists switched on headlights in daylight.</p>
<p>A 60-year-old woman and an 80-year-old man were killed in the village of Pandansari, about seven kilometers from the mountain, when the roofs of their homes collapsed under the weight of the ash and volcanic debris unleashed during the eruption, the disaster agency said. A 70-year-old man died after being hit by a collapsed wall while waiting to be evacuated from Pandansari, where the volcanic ash lay up to eight inches deep in some places.</p>

<p>The large international airport in Surabaya and airports in the cities of Malang, Yogyakarta, Solo, Bandung, Semarang and Cilacap were closed due to reduced visibility and the dangers posed to aircraft engines by ash, Transport Ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan said.</p>
<p>Virgin Australia said it had cancelled its today&#8217;s flights from Australia to several locations due to the eruption, including the resort islands of Bali in Indonesia and Phuket in Thailand.</p>

<p>The disaster agency said tremors were still wracking the volcano, but that scientists didn&#8217;t expect another major eruption. It said all villages within 10 kilometers of Kelud more than 100,000 people had been evacuated to temporary shelters, but that some villagers were returning to their homes to begin cleaning up.</p>
<p>The 1,731-meter-high Mount Kelud in eastern Java Indonesia&#8217;s most densely populated island and home to more than half of the country&#8217;s 240 million people has been rumbling for several weeks and was under close observation. The mountain is about 600 kilometres east of Jakarta, the capital.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985236&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>American photographer John Stanmeyer won the World Press Photo of the Year award for 2013 on Friday with a moonlit shot of African migrants in Djibouti holding their cellphones to the sky, seeking a better reception signal.</p>
<p>The 19-person jury chose 53 winning photographers in 18 categories out of nearly 100,000 submissions from around the globe for one of photojournalism&#8217;s most prestigious awards.</p>
<p>The Associated Press won two awards, including first place in single-shot “Observed Portraits” for Markus Schreiber&#8217;s picture of a disappointed woman in Pretoria, South Africa who had just learned she would not be able to view Nelson Mandela&#8217;s casket.</p>
<p>Stanmeyer, of the VII photo agency, was working for National Geographic. The photo has a mysterious, eerie quality as the phones held by the men in the picture glow the same color as the moon. The signal from neighboring Somalia is cheaper, and they are hoping to send and receive messages from relatives abroad.</p>
<p>Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, is a common stopping point for migrants attempting to reach Europe or the Middle East.</p>
<p>One jury member, Jillian Edelstein, said the photo raised issues of “technology, globalization, migration, poverty, desperation, alienation, (and) humanity.&#8221; Another, Susan Linfield, said it stood out for its humantic portrayal of migrants. “So many pictures of migrants show them as bedraggled and pathetic.but this photo is not so much romantic, as dignified,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Among other standouts were a series by photographer Goran Tomasevic of Reuters of a rebel attack on a government checkpoint in Damascus, Syria on Jan. 30 that won first place in the &#8220;Spot News Stories&#8221; category. One black-and-white image captures the instant after a shell has landed and a fleeing man is engulfed by dust and rubble.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985179&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number of people affected by the powerful 7.3 magnitude quake that jolted northwest China&#8217;s Xinjiang region on Wednesday has risen to over 58,000, nearly eight times the initial estimate.</p>
<p>The quake has affected 58,127 residents in six counties of Hotan Prefecture, with 19,905 relocated to safety, according to figures released by the regional civil affairs department on Friday.</p>
<p>The tremor toppled 3,281 houses, damaged 30,322 other properties and killed 2,163 heads of livestock, causing direct economic losses of about 271.6 million yuan (USD 44.5 million), state-run Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
<p>Local authorities said losses inflicted by the disaster have surged as more relief teams reached the remote areas. Relief work is progressing and no casualties have been reported, the report said.</p>
<p>The quake was followed by a series of high-intensity aftershocks. The initial estimate suggested that the number of affected could be around 7,800. The epicentre, in a sparsely populated area with an average altitude of 5,000 metres, is more than 50 km from the nearest settlement, Aqqan Township in Yutian County, Hotan Prefecture.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985155&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A 27-year-old Indian student, who had overstayed his visa in Australia, died at an immigration detention centre in Melbourne.</p>
<p>The student hung himself in his cell at the Maribyrnong immigration detention centre on Thursday night, Fairfax Media reported quoting its sources.</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s immigration minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed that the man was found unconscious by the centre staff. Police, however, said the death was not being treated as suspicious.</p>
<p>The man had been detained in January after overstaying his visa, police said.</p>
<p>The provincial government in a statement expressed its &#8220;sympathy to the family and friends of the deceased man, and will provide support to the police and other authorities as appropriate to assist with their investigations&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985145&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pakistani police on Friday claimed they had uncovered an Al Qaeda network in the University of Karachi by arresting three persons involved in terrorist activities and distributing jihadi propaganda and literature.</p>
<p>CID official Raja Umar Khatab said all the arrested persons were students of the university. The network was responsible for targeted killings, bomb attacks and other terrorist activities, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an Al Qaeda network operating in the university which includes students and some professors. Laboratories were being used to create explosive materials,&#8221; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have recovered plenty of Al Qaeda literature, emails, weapons and explosive materials from their possession,&#8221; Khatab said. The network operated under the codename &#8220;Ahsab&#8221;.</p>
<p>Police and paramilitary personnel also busted a weapons and bomb-making factory at Orangi Town in Karachi late last night. Police had earlier displayed a large cache of weapons, ammunition, explosive devices and materials, suicide jackets and rocket launchers seized from the factory. &#8220;Explosive devices used in recent attacks in Karachi were prepared and provided from this factory,&#8221; Khatab said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985108&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/indonesiavolcanom1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1984853" alt="The last major eruption at Kelud was in 1990, when it kicked out searing fumes and lava that killed more than 30 people and injured hundreds. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/indonesiavolcanom1.jpg" /></a> The last major eruption at Kelud was in 1990, when it kicked out searing fumes and lava that killed more than 30 people and injured hundreds. (AP)
<p>A volcano erupted on the heavily populated Indonesian island of Java, sending a huge plume of ash and sand 17 km (10 miles) into the air and forcing the evacuation on Friday of more than 100,000 people and closure of five airports.</p>
<p>Indonesia&#8217;s national disaster agency ordered the evacuation of all the families living within a 10-km (6-mile) radius of Mount Kelud. The volcano is 90 km (54 miles) south of Indonesia&#8217;s second biggest city Surabaya, a major industrial centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over 1,00,000 people have been evacuated,&#8221; National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Nugroho said by telephone.</p>
<p>He said the eruptions had ceased, but the ash had spread as far as 500km (312 miles) to the west and northwest, causing more problems, especially for airlines.<br />
Mount Kelud is one of 130 active volcanoes in the the world&#8217;s fourth most populous country. And the agency estimated that up to 200,000 people living in its vicinity had been affected by the eruption, and some families were still being brought out of the evacuation zone.</p>
<p>The cloud from the eruption forced the shutdown of airports at Surabaya and the  cities of Yogyakarta, Solo, Malang and Semarang in East Java and Central Java provinces, stranding thousands of passengers.</p>
<p>Local television networks showed images of cities and grounded airplanes blanketed in a layer of ash.</p>
<p>Other airports, including Denpasar on the resort island of Bali, were unaffected, so far, according to Garuda Indonesia , the national flag carrier.</p>
<p>Visibility in some affected areas dropped below 10 metres and schools were closed, while volunteers distributed masks and food to evacuees pouring into shelters.<br />
As ash fell on the world&#8217;s largest Buddhist temple Borobudur in Yogyakarta nearly 135 km away, authorities began covering  stupas and statues of Buddha with plastic sheets, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;Areas to the west of Mount Kelud, including central Java, Yogyakarta, Cilacap, Magelang, Temanggung and Boyolali are still experiencing showers of ash, because last night the biggest eruption &#8230; threw sand and ash 17 km into the air,&#8221;  Nugroho said.</p>
<p><strong>OIL REFINERY UNAFFECTED</strong></p>
<p>Operations were unaffected at a major oil refinery in Cilacap run by state-owned energy company Pertamina, officials said. The refinery, with a capacity of 348,000 barrels per day, accounting for a little more than a third of Indonesia&#8217;s total output of refined products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully, Cilacap operations are normal, although ash has indeed reached the Cilacap area,&#8221; said Pertamina spokesman Ali Mundakir. &#8220;As a preventative measure, we have immediately prepared air filters for equipment there.&#8221;</p>
<p>East Java is the main area in Indonesia for sugarcane plantations, but officials expected limited damage to crops.</p>
<p>&#8220;The eruption will affect sugarcane plantations, but the impact is relatively small,&#8221; Soemitro Samadikoen, chairman of Indonesian Sugarcane Farmers Association told Reuters. &#8220;With this very small impact and high stock (in the domestic market) we do not need to import white sugar from other countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The disaster mitigation agency later said the cloud was dissipating and that the volcano was no longer erupting.</p>
<p>Nugroho said the disaster mitigation agency had confirmed two people were killed by the collapse of roofs due to the weight of the fallen ash.</p>
<p>The eruption otherwise caused minimal damage to buildings, Nugroho said, but had left 3 to 5 cm (1 1/2 to 2 inches) of ash and sand on roads.<br />
Mt Kelud is just one of nearly 130 active volcanoes in the world&#8217;s fourth most populous country.</p>
<p>At least 11 people were killied earler this month in the north of the island of Sumatra when Mount Sinabung erupted. The volcano has been spewing lava and ash for months, forcing thousands to flee the area and destroying crops.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1984843&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ussnowm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1984824" alt="The sloppy mix of snow and face-stinging sleet closed schools and businesses. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ussnowm.jpg" /></a> The sloppy mix of snow and face-stinging sleet closed schools and businesses. (AP)
<p>Yet another storm paralyzed the Northeast with heavy snow and sleet on Thursday, while hundreds of thousands across the ice-encrusted South waited in the cold for the electricity to come back on.</p>
<p>At least 21 deaths were blamed on the treacherous weather, including that of a pregnant woman struck by a mini-snowplow in a New York City parking lot as she loaded groceries into her car.</p>
<p>The sloppy mix of snow and face-stinging sleet grounded more than 6,500 flights and closed schools and businesses as it made its way up the heavily populated Interstate 95 corridor, where shoveling out has become a weekly &#8211; sometimes twice-weekly &#8211; chore.</p>
<p>About 1.2 million homes and businesses lost power as the storm moved from the South through the Northeast. By Thursday evening, about 5,50,000 customers remained in the dark, mostly in South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>In some places, the snow and freezing rain eased up during the day, but a second wave was expected overnight into Friday.</p>
<p>Washington, DC, residents received 9 inches (23 centimeters) of snow, New York City received nearly 10 inches (25 centimeters), and parts of New Jersey had more than 11 inches (28 centimeters).</p>
<p>In New York, Min Lin died after she was struck by a utility vehicle with a snowplow attached to it as it backed up outside a shopping center in Brooklyn. Her nearly full-term baby was delivered in critical condition via cesarean section.</p>
<p>No charges were brought against the snowplow operator in what appears to have been an accident, police said.</p>
<p>Across the South, the storm left in its wake a world of ice-encrusted trees and driveways and snapped branches and power lines.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, where the storm caused huge traffic jams in the Raleigh area on Wednesday as people left work and rushed to get home in the middle of the day, National Guardsmen patrolled the snowy roads, looking for any stranded motorists.</p>
<p>Some roads around Raleigh remained clogged with abandoned vehicles Thursday morning. City crews worked to tow them to safe areas where their owners could recover them.</p>
<p>Around the country, this is shaping up as one of the snowiest winters on record. As of early this month, Washington, Detroit, Boston, Chicago, New York and St. Louis had gotten roughly two or three times as much snow as they normally receive at this point in the season.</p>
<p>The procession of storms and cold blasts  &#8211; blamed in part on a kink in the jet stream, the high-altitude air currents that dictate weather  &#8211; has cut into retail sales across the US, the Department of Commerce said. Sales dipped 0.4 percent in January.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1984816&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
