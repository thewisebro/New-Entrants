				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-m1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009084" alt="There are more then two dozen countries searching for the MH370. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-m1.jpg" /></a> There are more then two dozen countries searching for the MH370.
<p>Search planes scoured a remote patch of the Indian Ocean but came back empty-handed Friday after a 10-hour mission looking for any sign of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, another disappointing day in one of the world&#8217;s biggest aviation mysteries.</p>
<p>Australian officials pledged to continue the search for two large objects spotted by a satellite earlier this week, which had raised hopes that the two-week hunt for the Boeing 777 that disappeared March 8 with 239 people on board was nearing a breakthrough. But Australia&#8217;s acting prime minister, Warren Truss, tamped down expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something that was floating on the sea that long ago may no longer be floating it may have slipped to the bottom,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s also certain that any debris or other material would have moved a significant distance over that time, potentially hundreds of kilometers.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aus-map-mh370.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2015616" alt="Aus-map-mh370" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aus-map-mh370.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480" width="480" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>In Kuala Lumpur, where the plane took off for Beijing, the country&#8217;s defense minister thanked more than two dozen countries involved in the search that is stretching from Kazakhstan in Central Asia to the southern Indian Ocean, and said the focus remains on finding the airplane.</p>
<p>&#8220;This going to be a long haul,&#8221; Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference.</p>
<p>The search area indicated by the satellite images some 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth is so remote it takes aircraft four hours to fly there and four hours back, leaving them with only enough fuel to search for about two hours.</p>
<p>On Friday, five planes, including three P-3 Orions, made the trip. While search conditions had improved from Thursday, with much better visibility, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said there were no sightings of plane debris.</p>
<p>Searchers relied mostly on trained spotters aboard the planes scanning the ocean rather than radar because the use of radar found nothing during the first day of the search on Thursday, Australian officials said.</p>
<p>Going forward, the search will focus more on visual sightings because civilian aircraft are being brought in to participate. The military planes will continue to use both radar and spotters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Noting that we got no radar detections yesterday, we have replanned the search to be visual. So aircraft flying relatively low, very highly skilled and trained observers looking out of the aircraft windows and looking to see objects,&#8221; said John Young, manager of the maritime safety authority&#8217;s emergency response division.</p>
<p>Two Chinese aircraft are expected to arrive in Perth on Saturday to join the search, and two Japanese aircraft will be arriving Sunday, Truss said. A small flotilla of ships coming to Australia from China was still several days away.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing all that we can, devoting all the resources we can and we will not give up until all of the options have been exhausted,&#8221;  said Truss, who is acting prime minister while Tony Abbott is in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Experts say it is impossible to tell if the grainy satellite images of the two objects one 24 meters (almost 80 feet) long and the other measuring 5 meters (15 feet) were debris from the plane. But officials have called this the best lead so far in the search that began March 8 after the plane vanished over the Gulf of Thailand on an overnight flight to Beijing.</p>
<p>For relatives of the people aboard the plane _ 154 of the 227 passengers are Chinese _ hope was slipping away, said Nan Jinyan, sister-in-law of passenger Yan Ling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m psychologically prepared for the worst and I know the chances of them coming back alive are extremely small,&#8221; said Nan, one of dozens of relatives gathered at a Beijing hotel awaiting any word about their loved ones. Abbott spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he described as &#8220;devastated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the most inaccessible spot that you could imagine on the face of the Earth, but if there is anything down there we will find it. We owe it to the families of those people to do no less,&#8221; Abbott said.</p>
<p>The Norwegian cargo vessel Hoegh St. Petersburg is also in the area helping with the search. The ship, which transports cars, was on its way from South Africa to Australia.</p>
<p>Haakon Svane, a spokesman for the Norwegian Shipowners&#8217; Association, said the ship and its crew of 20 Filipinos had searched a strip of ocean stretching about 100 nautical miles (115 miles; 185 kilometers) using binoculars and unaided eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The visual observations are the most important. The fact that they are there and have the capacity to move in a specific pattern is the most important contribution,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said another commercial ship was also in the area and an Australian navy vessel was en route, and AMSA officials also were checking to see if there was any new satellite imagery that could provide searchers with more information.</p>
<p>Pieces of an aircraft have been found floating for days after a crash into the ocean. Peter Marosszeky, an aviation expert at the University of New South Wales, said the plane&#8217;s wing could remain buoyant for weeks if the fuel tanks inside were empty and had not filled up with water.</p>
<p>Other experts said that if the aircraft breaks into pieces, normally only items such as seats and luggage would remain floating.</p>
<p>&#8220;We seldom see big metal (pieces) floating. You need a lot of (buoyant) material underneath the metal to keep it up,&#8221; said Lau Kin-tak, an expert in aircraft maintenance and accidents at Hong Kong Polytechnic University.</p>
<p>The anguished relatives of passengers met Friday with Malaysian officials at the Beijing hotel.  Attendees said they had a two-hour briefing about the search but that nothing new was said.</p>
<p>Wang Zhen, son of missing artist Wang Linshi, said there were questions about why Malaysian authorities had provided so much seemingly contradictory information.</p>
<p>Wang said he still has hopes his father can be found alive and is praying that the satellite sightings turn out to be false. He said he and other relatives are suspicious about what they are being told by the Malaysian side, but are at a loss as to what to do next.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel they&#8217;re hiding something from us,&#8221; said Wang, who is filling his days attending briefings and watching the news for updates.</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation for what happened to the jet, but have said the evidence so far suggests it was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.</p>
<p>Police are considering the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board.</p>

<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s government criticised Turkey on Friday for blocking access to social media platform Twitter, saying it did not fit with Germany&#8217;s view of freedom of expression. &#8220;What we are hearing from Turkey does not comply with what we in Germany understand as free communication,&#8221; said Merkel&#8217;s spokeswoman Christiane Wirtz. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t fit with our idea of freedom of expression to forbid or block any form of communication.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turkey&#8217;s courts blocked access to Twitter following Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan&#8217;s vow, on the campaign trail ahead of March 30 local elections, to &#8220;wipe out&#8221; the service. He says he does not care what the international community says about it, though President Abdullah Gul has objected to his actions.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015509&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>India on Monday said none of its nationals were killed in a Taliban attack on a heavily fortified luxury hotel in Afghanistan&#8217;s capital.</p>
<p>Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi had said that four foreigners &#8212; one each from New Zealand, Canada,</p>
<p>Pakistan and India &#8212; were killed in the attack on Serena Hotel which is used by UN staff and foreign diplomats.</p>
<p>But in New Delhi, Ministry of External Affairs officials said no Indian was killed in the attack.The attackers entered the hotel at 8:30 p.m. yesterday in traditional Afghan clothing and started shooting.</p>
<p>Sediqqi said five Afghans were among those killed, including two children who were shot in the head.</p>
<p>Two of the attackers were gunned down inside the restaurant in Serena, third inside the bathroom and forth in a close by area, he added.</p>
<p>Sediqqi said the attack was planned outside Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope the ceasefire between the Taliban and Pakistani government has nothing to do with the elections,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The Serena Hotel has been a frequent target of insurgent attacks in the past.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015465&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>An Indian was among four foreigners killed along with five Afghans in a brazen Taliban attack on a heavily fortified luxury hotel here in Afghanistan&#8217;s capital.</p>

(Reuters)
<p>The international team hunting for Malaysia Airlines  Flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean has not turned up anything so far, and Australia&#8217;s deputy prime minister said the suspected debris may have sunk.</p>
<p>Aircraft and ships have renewed a search in the Andaman Sea between India and Thailand, going over areas that have already been exhaustively swept to find some clue to unlock one of the most inexplicable mysteries in modern aviation.</p>
<p>The Boeing 777 went missing almost two weeks ago off the Malaysian coast with 239 people aboard. There has been no confirmed sign of wreckage but two objects seen floating deep south in the Indian Ocean were considered a credible lead and set off a huge hunt on Thursday.</p>
<p>Australian authorities said the first aircraft to sweep treacherous seas on Friday in an area about 2,500 km (1,500 miles) southwest of Perth was on its way back to base without spotting the objects picked out by satellite images five days ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something that was floating on the sea that long ago may no longer be floating,&#8221; Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said in Perth. &#8220;It may have slipped to the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the search is continuing and and Australian, New Zealand and U.S. aircraft would be joined by Chinese and Japanese planes over the weekend.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the most inaccessible spot that you can imagine on the face of the Earth, but if there is anything down there, we will find it,&#8221; Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters in Papua New Guineau, where he is on a visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it could just be a container that&#8217;s fallen off a ship. We just don&#8217;t know, but we owe it to the families, and the friends and the loved ones to do everything we can to try to resolve what is as yet an extraordinary riddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>India said it was sending two aircraft, a Poseidon P-8I maritime surveillance aircraft and a C-130 Hercules transporter, to join the hunt in the southern Indian Ocean. It is also sending another P-8I and four warships to search in the Andaman Sea, where the plane was last seen on military radar on March 8.</p>
<p>In New Delhi, officials said the search in areas around the Andaman island chain was not at the request of Malaysian authorities coordinating the global search for the airliner.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the navies of the world have SAR regions,&#8221; said Capt. D.K. Sharma, an Indian navy spokesman, referring to search and rescue regions. &#8220;So we&#8217;re doing it at our own behest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing it on our own because the Malaysian plane is still missing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investigators suspect Flight MH370, which took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing shortly after midnight on March 8, was deliberately diverted thousands of miles from its scheduled path. They say they are focusing on hijacking or sabotage but have not ruled out technical problems.</p>
<p>The search for the plane also continues in other regions, including a wide arc sweeping northward from Laos to Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>In the Indian Ocean, three Australian P-3 Orions joined a high-tech U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon and a civilian Bombardier Global Express jet to search the 23,000 squone, are km (8,900 sq mile) the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said.<br />
A Norwegian merchant ship, the Hoegh St. Petersburg, was diverted to the area on Thursday and was still searching there and another vessel would arrive later on Friday.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s icebreaker for Antarctic research, Xuelong, or Snow Dragon, will set off from Perth to search the area, Chinese state news agency Xinhua cited maritime authorities as saying. Up to five more Chinese ships were steaming towards the search zone from across the Indian Ocean, Xinhua reported.</p>
<p>Australian authorities said they had not asked for the ships to search the area. About two-thirds of the missing plane&#8217;s passengers were Chinese.</p>
<p>STUDYING SATELLITES<br />
There have been many false leads and no confirmed wreckage found from Flight MH370 since it vanished off Malaysia&#8217;s east coast less than an hour after taking off.</p>
<p>There has also been criticism of the search operation and investigation, as more than two dozen countries scramble to overcome logistical and diplomatic hurdles.</p>
<p>Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that, minutes after its identifying transponder was switched off as it crossed the Gulf of Thailand, the plane turned sharply west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following an established route towards India.</p>
<p>What happened next is unclear, but faint electronic &#8220;pings&#8221; picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours.</p>
<p>A source with direct knowledge of the situation said that information gleaned from the pings had been passed to investigators within a few days, but it took Malaysia more than a week to narrow the search area to two large arcs &#8211; one reaching south to near where the potential debris was spotted, and a second crossing to the north into China and central Asia.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015326&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The upper house of the Russian parliament has approved Moscow&#8217;s annexation of Crimea.</p>
<p>The Federation Council voted unanimously to incorporate Crimea after Sunday&#8217;s hastily called Crimean referendum, in which residents of the Black Sea peninsula overwhelmingly backed breaking off from Ukraine and joining Russia. Ukraine and the West have rejected the vote, held two weeks after Russian troops had taken over Crimea.</p>
<p>The move, already approved by the lower house, is set to be completed later Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s signature.</p>
<p>The US and the European Union have responded by slapping sanctions on Russia. US President Barack Obama ordered a second round of sanctions Thursday targeting members of Putin&#8217;s inner circle and a major bank supporting them.</p>
<p>International agencies downgraded Russia&#8217;s outlook, and Russian stock plummeted Friday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015327&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/thailand-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015322" alt="Government protesters had stopped voting in about a fifth of constituencies, and in 28 of them voting was not possible at all because candidates were unable to register. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/thailand-med.jpg" /></a> Government protesters had stopped voting in about a fifth of constituencies, and in 28 of them voting was not possible at all because candidates were unable to register. (Reuters)
<p>Thailand&#8217;s Constitutional Court on Friday annulled last month&#8217;s general election, leaving the country in political limbo without a full government and further undermining a prime minister faced with impeachment over a failed rice subsidy scheme.</p>
<p>The court judges ruled in a 6 to 3 vote that the Feb. 2 election was unconstitutional because voting failed to take place on the same day around the country.</p>
<p>Government protesters had stopped voting in about a fifth of constituencies, and in 28 of them voting was not possible at all because candidates were unable to register.</p>
<p>The protests are the latest chapter in an eight-year crisis that pits Bangkok&#8217;s middle class and royalist establishment against supporters of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and her brother, ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was toppled by the army in 2006 and lives in exile to avoid a jail term for graft.</p>
<p>Over the past five months, the protesters have shut government offices and at times blocked major thoroughfares in Bangkok to try to force Yingluck out. Twenty-three people have died and hundreds have been injured in the violence.</p>
<p>The number of protesters has dwindled in recent weeks and the streets have been relatively calm since several big protest camps were shut at the start of March, allowing the government to lift a state of emergency on Wednesday.<br />
But the focus has shifted to the courts, in particular to the prospect of Yingluck being impeached over a rice scheme that has gone disastrously wrong, with hundreds of thousands of farmers not getting paid for grain sold to the state since October.</p>
<p>&#8220;Independent agencies are being quite obvious that they want to remove her and her entire cabinet to create a power vacuum, claim that elections can&#8217;t be held and then nominate a prime minister of their choice,&#8221; said Kan Yuenyong, a political analyst at the Siam Intelligence Unit, referring to the courts and the anti-corruption commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they run with this plan, then the government&#8217;s supporters will fight back and the next half of the year will be much worse than what we saw in the first half,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Militant noises</strong></p>
<p>Thaksin&#8217;s &#8220;red shirt&#8221; supporters, who are strong in the north and northeast, are beginning to sound more militant, raising the prospect of more violence if Yingluck is forced out by the courts, the anti-corruption commission or by other</p>
<p>The National Anti-Corruption Commission could recommend impeachment in coming days, probably by March 31.</p>
<p>She could then be removed from office by the upper house Senate, which is likely to have an anti-Thaksin majority after an election for half its members on March 30.</p>
<p>Some analysts say it will fall to the Senate to then appoint a &#8220;neutral&#8221; prime minister, probably the type of establishment figure the protesters have been demanding all along.</p>
<p>It is unclear when a new election will take place.</p>
<p>Somchai Srisutthiyakorn, an Election Commission member, offered two options: &#8220;The commission could discuss with the government about issuing a new royal decree for a new date or we could ask the heads of all political parties to decide together when best to set the new election date,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the opposition Democrat Party has been quoted as saying it would boycott any vote, as it did in February, but after Friday&#8217;s decision he said it might be prepared to take part.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ready to join a new election but it depends on the government and whether the political situation is stable enough to hold a new vote,&#8221; Chavanond Intarakomalyasut told Reuters.</p>
<p>Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, who was a deputy prime minister under the previous Democrat-led government, has shown no willingness to compromise.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the court rules the election void, don&#8217;t even dream that there will be another election. If a new election date is declared, then we&#8217;ll take care of every province and the election won&#8217;t be successful again,&#8221; he told supporters late on Thursday.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the government but  Yingluck&#8217;s Puea Thai Party said the verdict was a loss for those who had exercised their right to vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vote was nullified because protesters stopped it from taking place across the country,&#8221; spokesman Prompong Nopparit told Reuters. &#8220;Today, Thais have lost an opportunity to move on  towards completing the election and solving this crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yingluck called the election in December to try to defuse the protests and since then has headed a caretaker government with limited powers. Puea Thai had been expected to win.</p>
<p>The protesters want electoral changes pushed through before any vote, seeking to reduce the influence of Thaksin. Parties led by or allied to him have won every election since 2001.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015288&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>Taliban gunmen killed nine people, including four foreigners, in an attack on a luxury hotel used by United Nations&#8217; staff in Kabul on Thursday, before being shot dead in a shootout with Afghan security forces, police and government officials said.</p>
<p>The assault on the heavily fortified Serena Hotel was the latest in a string of bold attacks by the insurgents seeking to spoil an presidential election on April 5, which would mark the first time in Afghanistan&#8217;s history that one elected government hands power to another.</p>
<p>Four Taliban fighters snuck into the hotel early on Thursday evening and hid for three hours before storming into the restaurant and opening fire on people inside, according to interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi.</p>
<p>They then battled Afghan special forces for more than an hour inside the hotel before being overwhelmed, as terrified guests hid in rooms or fled to bunkers inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard an explosion or anything like that. Only firearms and possible rocket-propelled grenades,&#8221;  one senior UN official said in a text message from his room as hid with the lights turned off.</p>
<p>The foreign nationals killed were from Canada, India, New Zealand and Pakistan, the interior ministry said. The victims included four women, three men and two children.</p>
<p>All United Nations staff were accounted for, a UN agency official told Reuters on condition of anonymity as they were unauthorised to speak to the media.</p>
<p>At the time of the attack, some 18 U.N staff were inside the hotel, where many of them stay, and is frequented by prominent Afghan politicians and visiting foreign officials.</p>
<p>Police are investigating how the gunmen got into te Serena. The hotel has dozens of armed guards patrolling its perimeter, and anyone entering is checked with metal detectors and body searched for weapons.</p>
<p>Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack and said the gunmen had targeted both Afghan foreign guests celebrating the eve of the Afghan new year on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suicide bombers have entered the Serena Hotel, heavy battle is underway, enemies suffered heavy casualties,&#8221; the Taliban spokesman said in a text message.</p>
<p>The Serena hotel has been attacked several times during the Taliban insurgency, but Thursday&#8217;s assault was the most deadly.</p>
<p>In 2008,  gunmen disguised as police stormed the hotel and opened fire on guests inside its gym, killing six.</p>
<p>Despite its history of being targeted, the Serena&#8217;s  restaurant was one of the few places in Kabul where foreign officials were still permitted to dine, following a Taliban attack in January on a Lebanese restaurant that killed 21 people, including three UN staff and the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s top representative in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, the Taliban attacked a police station in the southern city of Jalalabad with suicide bombers and gunmen. The assailants killed at least 11 people.</p>
<p>The day before, on Wednesday, a marketplace bomb killed at least 15 people in northern Faryab province.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015195&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2004587" alt="Sonia Gandhi " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/soniarahul.jpg" /> Sonia Gandhi
<p>A US court has ordered Congress President Sonia Gandhi to provide a copy of her passport as documentary evidence by April 7 to determine if she was in America in September last year when a Sikh rights group claims it had served summons on her in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.</p>
<p>Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) claims that Gandhi was served summons in September last year when she had allegedly visited Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York for a medical check-up.</p>
<p>The group has challenged in court Gandhi&#8217;s claim that she was not present in New York in September last year and so was not served with summons or complaint in the human rights violation lawsuit filed against her by the Sikh rights group.</p>
<p>Judge Brian Cogan of Manhattan federal court on Thursay said Gandhi has not demonstrated sufficiently that she was not in the US between September 2 and 12 last year and should provide some form of documentary evidence, preferably her passport copy, by April 7 to determine whether she was in the US or not.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court cannot find that a sufficient showing of non- presence has been made based on the affirmation without plaintiffs&#8217; having received some discovery to confirm it.</p>
<p>Defendant must provide some documentary evidence to corroborate her otherwise-unsupported declaration stating that defendant was not in the US at the time of service,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to the court that the easiest way would be for defendant to provide a copy of her passport, showing her most recent entry and exit stamps into and out of the United States, thus demonstrating that she was not in the country between 9/2/2013 and 9/12/2013,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>SFJ&#8217;s rights violation case against Gandhi in Brooklyn Federal Court hinges on the issue of whether Gandhi was served summons on September 9 as the group claims or whether she was not present in the US during that time as per her assertion.</p>
<p>Gandhi has filed a motion in court seeking dismissal of the lawsuit against her citing lack of personal jurisdiction and that she was never personally served with the summons.</p>
<p>Responding to Cogan&#8217;s order, Gandhi&#8217;s attorney Ravi Batra said the judge &#8220;focused on Gandhi&#8217;s sworn declaration, has asked for documentary supporting proof to expedite issue-resolution and not waste time on SFJ-sponsored wild goose chases. Swift justice, when available, is to be cherished, and as attorneys for Gandhi, we welcome it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Batra has submitted in court a letter written to him on an All India Congress Committee letterhead and signed by Gandhi.</p>
<p>In the letter, Gandhi states that contrary to claims made by SFJ, she was not in New York in September last year and was not served summons in the case.</p>
<p>SFJ legal advisor Gurpatwant Singh Pannun said if Gandhi is not able to provide proof by April 7 corroborating her claim of absence from the US, the group would move the court to initiate trial on the merits against her on charges of shielding and protecting Congress party leaders allegedly involved in the anti-Sikh riots in 1984.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015178&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Four teenage Taliban gunmen opened fire inside a luxury hotel in Kabul before being shot dead, officials said, adding that three people were wounded as guests rushed to reinforced safe rooms.</p>
<p>Just weeks before Afghanistan&#8217;s presidential election, the attackers last evening hid small pistols in their socks and penetrated several layers of security at the Serena hotel, a prestigious venue favoured by foreign visitors to the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard some gunshots, and we all were taken by guards to the safe rooms,&#8221; a front-desk clerk told AFP.</p>
<p>The Taliban, who have vowed a campaign of violence to disrupt the election on April 5, claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
<p>No guests were reported to have been injured as intense bursts of gunfire erupted inside the hotel and security forces rushed to the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;The four young attackers entered the hotel at about 6:00 pm pretending to be guests and started to attack at 9:00 pm,&#8221; Sediq Sediqqi, the interior ministry spokesman, told reporters, adding the gunmen were all under 18 years old.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two guards have been taken to hospital, as well as one foreign employee of the hotel. All four attackers were gunned down, two of them after they resisted in a bathroom in the hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jane Ferguson, an Al Jazeera TV journalist staying at the hotel, said on Twitter she had &#8220;just got out of Serena hotel safe. Horrible few hours with furniture against my door.&#8221;</p>
<p>The attack occurred on the eve of Nawroz, the Persian New Year which is a major holiday in Afghanistan, and the hotel was hosting special celebrations.</p>
<p>The Serena, the most upmarket accommodation in Kabul, has been targeted by militants in the past, including a Taliban suicide attack in 2008 that left eight people dead.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015043&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/os3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014715" alt="Bin Laden’s son-in-law, Suleiman Abu Ghaith, in a courtroom drawing. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/os3.jpg" /></a> Bin Laden’s son-in-law, Suleiman Abu Ghaith, in a courtroom drawing. (Reuters)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Osama bin Laden’s hours in a dark Afghanistan cave the evening of the Sept. 11 attacks were brought to light when his son-in-law testified in his own defence at his terrorism trial, portraying the al-Qaeda leader as worried and apprehensive as he contemplated how America would respond.</span></p>
<p>The son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, said the al-Qaeda leader asked him hours after the attacks what he thought would happen next.</p>
<p>“Politically, I said, America, if it was proven that you were the one who did this, will not settle until it accomplishes two things: To kill you and topple the state of the Taliban,” Abu Ghaith said he told him.</p>
<p>Bin Laden responded: “You’re being too pessimistic,” Abu Ghaith recalled in a discussion that he said went late into the night.</p>
<p>He said bin Laden had sent a messenger to pick him up earlier on Sept. 11 from a house in Kabul where he had watched the news unfold on TV. He said bin Laden told him: “We are the ones who did it.”</p>
<p>He said he had met bin Laden only six or seven times previously before he was brought to the cave in a rough mountainous area.</p>
<p>The surprise testimony Wednesday by Abu Ghaith seemed to soften the image of the one-time Kuwaiti teacher and preacher known for fiery anti-American rhetoric on widely circulated post-attack videos until a prosecutor took his turn, eliciting damaging admissions from the 48-year-old defendant before showing a videotape on which Abu Ghaith spoke that included a hijacked plane slamming into a World Trade Centre tower.</p>
<p>Questioned by defence lawyer Stanley Cohen and Assistant US Attorney Michael Ferrara, the bearded Abu Ghaith testified bin Laden seemed worried that night.</p>
<p>The next morning, Abu Ghaith said, he saw Laden with an al-Qaeda military leader, Abu Hafs al-Masri, and current al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri at breakfast, and bin Laden invited him to join them.</p>
<p>He said bin laden told him: “Now, after these events, &#8230; it’s a no-brainer to predict what is going to happen. What you expected may actually happen. And I want to deliver a message to the world. And Dr Ayman also wants to deliver a message. I want you to deliver that message.”</p>
<p>Within two hours, the four men were posing in front of a rocky backdrop as Abu Ghaith spoke using what he said were “bullet points” provided by bin Laden that mixed verses from the Quran with justification for the terror attacks.</p>
<p>It was a position that would bring the one-time imam infamy as well as a place in the inner circle of the world’s most wanted terrorists and eventually to federal court in Manhattan, where he was brought after his capture last year in Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>NYT Osama report ridiculous: Pak military</strong></p>
<p><strong>Islamabad:</strong> Pakistani military Thursday rubbished as “ridiculous” a media report alleging former ISI chief Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha knew of Osama bin Laden’s Abbottabad hideout, saying it was “all speculation”.</p>
<p>The allegations are “baseless, ridiculous. Nothing new/credible, all speculations already proven false,” Pakistan military spokesperson Lt Gen Asim Bajwa said in a post on microblogging site Twitter. Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Tasnim Aslam, too, denied Wednesday’s New York Times report, saying: “There are many inconsistencies in the article. The author herself talks about suppositions from sources with no direct knowledge. So it is not something serious.” Intelligence sources, on condition of anonymity, had also rejected the story titled ‘What Pakistan Knew About Bin Laden’, adapted from the book ‘The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014’, to be published next month.</p>
<p>Soon after the US Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden’s house, “a Pakistani official told me the US had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of Bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad,” senior NYT journalist Carlotta Gall wrote in the article. <strong>PTI</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014711&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/putin-med1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014627" alt="The vote came as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Moscow for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/putin-med1.jpg" /></a> The vote came as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Moscow for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin.
<p>The Russian parliament&#8217;s lower house has given its near-unanimous approval to the country&#8217;s annexation of Crimea, ignoring threats from Western powers of more sanctions.</p>
<p>The Kremlin-controlled State Duma voted 445-1 today to make Crimea a part of Russia following a quick discussion in which members assailed the Ukrainian authorities.</p>
<p>The vote came as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Moscow for a meeting with President Vladimir Putin. &#8220;I&#8217;m deeply concerned about the current situation,&#8221; Ban said at the start of the talks. The incorporation of Crimea into Russia needs to be rubber-stamped by the upper house and receive a final endorsement by Putin, formalities expected to be completed by the end of the week.</p>
<p>During today&#8217;s debate, senior lawmakers spoke of the need to protect Russian speakers elsewhere in Ukraine from radical Ukrainian nationalists, statements that could fuel fears of Russian invasion. &#8220;They don&#8217;t understand in Washington that entire territories will flee as Crimea did if such outrage continues,&#8221; said Vladimir Vasilyev, the leader of the dominant United Russia faction.</p>
<p>Though Putin, who signed the treaty for Crimea to join Russia earlier this week, said he&#8217;s not seeking a division of Ukraine, he insisted that the country can &#8220;use all means&#8221; to protect Russian speakers. He also made his view clear that he sees Ukraine as an artificial state carved up by the Soviet government to include some of Russia&#8217;s historic lands.</p>
<p>Russia has been arguing for broad autonomy for Ukraine&#8217;s regions that would turn the nation into a federation, and guarantees of Ukraine&#8217;s neutral status to prevent its membership in NATO. Today&#8217;s vote follows Crimea&#8217;s referendum Sunday, which was held just two weeks after Russian forces effectively took over the strategic Black Sea peninsula. The United States and the European Union have responded by slapping some limited sanctions on Russia.</p>
<p>Ilya Ponomarev, an opposition lawmaker who was the only Duma member who voted against, said in his blog that Russia behaved like a &#8220;banal aggressor&#8221; and made a grave mistake by annexing Crimea.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014624&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The United States on Thursday expanded its sanctions on Russians in response to the annexation of Crimea to include 20 more people, some of whom are close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a senior Obama administration official said.</p>
<p>It also imposed sanctions on the Russian bank Bank Rossiya, which has $10 billion in assets, the official said. The bank, which is used by many senior Russian government officials, will be &#8220;frozen out of the dollar,&#8221; the official said.</p>
<p>Obama signed an executive order giving the U.S. government wider authority to take action against the Russian financial services sector, energy, mining, engineering and defense sectors, the official said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014623&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>India has deployed two sophisticated surveillance aircraft along the southern corridor in the Indian Ocean to help trace the Malaysian plane that went missing nearly two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Australia informed Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak that two possible objects related to the search for MH370 had been identified in the southern Indian Ocean, as the multination search entered the 13th day on Thursday.</p>
<p>Malaysian Defence and Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that India has deployed two aircraft along the southern corridor where 25 aircraft from various countries are searching for the Boeing 777-200.</p>
<p>Sources in New Delhi said India has pressed P-8I Poseidon and C-130J Super Hercules into service to help locate the Beijing-bound plane that went missing on March 8 an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiaplanem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004692" alt="Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with 239 people aboard went missing March 8 on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiaplanem.jpg" /></a> Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with 239 people aboard went missing March 8 on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. (AP)
<p>Search aircraft and ships are investigating two objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean off Australia that could be debris from a <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/weve-not-hidden-anything-about-mh-370-says-malaysian-consul-hatimi/" target="_blank">Malaysian jetliner </a>missing for 12 days with 239 people on board, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Australian officials said the objects were spotted by satellite four days ago in one of the remotest parts of the globe, around 2,500 km (1,500 miles) southwest of Perth in the vast oceans between Australia, southern Africa and Antarctica.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graph1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2014483" alt="graph1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graph1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>The larger of the objects measured up to 24 metres (79 ft), long and appeared to be floating on water several thousand metres deep, they said. The second object was about 5 metres (16 feet) long.</p>
<p>Officials cautioned it could take several days to confirm if they were parts of the missing plane.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s credible enough to divert the research to this area on the basis it provides a promising lead to what might be wreckage from the debris field,&#8221; Royal Australian Air Force Air Commodore John McGarry told a news conference in Canberra.</p>
<p>No confirmed wreckage from Malaysia Airlines  Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia&#8217;s east coast early on March 8, less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can confirm we have a new lead,&#8221; Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in Kuala Lumpur, where the investigation into the missing airliner is based.</p>
<p>Another official in Malaysia said investigators were &#8220;hopeful but cautious&#8221; about the Australian discovery.<br />
The fate of Flight MH370 has been baffling aviation experts for nearly two weeks.</p>
<p>Investigators believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial aviation navigation switched off the plane&#8217;s communications systems before diverting it thousands of miles off its scheduled course.</p>
<p>Exhaustive background checks of the passengers and crew aboard have not yielded anything that might explain why.<br />
An Australian air force AP-3C Orion plane was already at the scene, John Young, general manager of the emergency response division of Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), told the news conference in Canberra.</p>
<p>Three more aircraft were also on their way, including a New Zealand Air Force Orion and a U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon, the world&#8217;s most advanced maritime surveillance plane.</p>
<p>A merchant ship diverted for the task was also arriving in the area, Young said. A Royal Australian Navy ship equipped to recover any objects was also en route, but was still &#8220;some days away&#8221;.</p>
<p>China, whose citizens made up about two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight, said it was also sending ships to the area of the sighting, but it was not clear how long it would take for the vessels to reach the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Potential  Breakthrough</strong></p>
<p>The huge potential breakthrough in an investigation that had appeared to be running out of leads was revealed by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who told parliament the objects had been located with satellite imagery.<br />
&#8220;New and credible information has come to light in relation to the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean,&#8221; Abbott said.</p>
<p>He added that he had already spoken with his Malaysian counterpart, Najib Razak, and cautioned that the objects had yet to be identified.</p>
<p>&#8220;The task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out they are not related to the search for MH370,&#8221; Abbott said.</p>
<p>Young, the Australian official, said it could be some days before authorities have anything to report and added that poor visibility reported in the area could hamper the search.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably the best lead we have right now but we have to get there, find them, see them, assess them, to know whether it&#8217;s really meaningful or not,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Images released by Australia showed the satellite pictures were from U.S. company Digital Globe Inc and were taken on March 16. Arrows on the images pointed to two indistinct objects apparently bobbing in the water.</p>
<p>The dimensions given are consistent with at least one of the objects possibly being the major part of a 777-200ER wing, which is around 27 metres (89 feet) long, though Australian officials cautioned the first images were indistinct.</p>
<p>The relatively large size of the objects would also suggest that, if they do come from the missing aircraft, it was intact when it went into the water.</p>
<p><strong>FBI helping probe</strong></p>
<p>Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that, minutes after its identifying transponder was switched off as it crossed the Gulf of Thailand, the plane turned sharply west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following an established commercial route towards India.</p>
<p>What happened next is unclear, but faint electronic &#8220;pings&#8221; picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours. That would be consistent with the plane ending up in the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The methodical shutdown of the communications systems, together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back, has focused particular attention on the pilot and co-pilot.</p>
<p>The FBI is helping Malaysian authorities analyse data from a flight simulator belonging to the captain of the missing plane, after initial examination showed some data logs had been deleted early last month.</p>
<p>A Malaysian official with knowledge of the investigations into the pilots said three simulator games that 53-year-old pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had played were being looked at.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are following up on the data logs being erased,&#8221; the source said. &#8220;These could be logs of the games that were erased to free up memory, so it may not lead us to anything. He played a lot of games, going into hundreds and thousands of hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>An unprecedented multinational search for the plane has focused on two vast search corridors: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia&#8217;s Sumatra island to west of Australia.</p>
<p>Australia is leading the search in the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>The depth of the water where the possible debris has been sighted would likely make recovering the &#8220;black box&#8221; voice and data recorders that may finally unlock the mystery of what happened aboard Flight MH370 extremely challenging.</p>
<p>University of Western Australia Professor of Oceanography Charitha Pattiaratchi said that, based on currents in the area, if the debris is from the plane it probably would have gone into the water around 300-400 km (180-250 miles) to the west.</p>
<p>The search area covered an ocean ridge known as Naturalist Plateau, a large sea shelf about 3,500 metres (9,800 feet) deep, Pattiaratchi said. The plateau is about 250 km (150 miles) wide by 400 km (250 miles) long, and the area around it is close to 5,000 metres (16,400 feet) deep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whichever way you go, it&#8217;s deep,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014447&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>A US judge has reserved ruling on a lawsuit filed here by a Sikh rights group against Congress party in the anti-Sikh riots after hearing arguments by it that the case should be dismissed since the incidents of 1984 are India&#8217;s internal matters.</p>
<p>In a hearing in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, Indian-American attorney Ravi Batra, appearing before US Federal Judge Robert Sweet, argued that the lawsuit filed by Sikhs for Justice should be dismissed since the events of 1984 are the internal affairs of India and &#8220;no other country can interfere in the internal affairs of another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congress party is seeking dismissal of the human rights violation lawsuit citing lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, expiry of statute of limitation and SJF’s legal standing to file the case.</p>
<p>SFJ has argued that the existence of the Indian National Overseas Congress (USA) and its fund-raising activities give US courts jurisdiction over the political party in the case.</p>
<p>Batra rebuffed this argument, saying it would be criminally illegal for a foreign political party to be political in the US.</p>
<p>He said there are three entities in New York wanting to be a branch of the Congress party and senior Congress leader Motilal Vora has disclaimed all of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect Judge Sweet to issue an order dismissing the complaint, preventing SFJ from being a plaintiff, while being sensitive to a court&#8217;s natural desire to help any who claim to have been wronged,&#8221; Batra added.</p>
<p>SFJ has alleged that the Congress party conspired, aided, abetted and carried out attacks on the Sikh population after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014446&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ip-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014376" alt="India has expressed its intent to export electricity to the tune of 500 MW to Pakistan immediately if infrastructure for transmission of power is made available.  (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ip-med.jpg" /></a> India has expressed its intent to export electricity to the tune of 500 MW to Pakistan immediately if infrastructure for transmission of power is made available. (PTI)
<p>The long discussed Indo-Pak electricity deal has moved closer to reality with energy- starved Pakistan handing over draft of an initial power trade deal to India.</p>
<p>The move comes as the World Bank has offered to finance the feasibility study and transmission line to import 1,200<br />
megawatts (MW) of power from India.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, the World Bank has also offered to finance a feasibility study along with the (installation of) transmission line to import 1,200 MW power from India,&#8221; an unnamed government official told the Express Tribune daily.</p>
<p>The official said a draft of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was handed over to Indian authorities in a recent<br />
meeting held in New Delhi.</p>
<p>India would respond to Pakistan after going through the draft of the initial deal, the official said.</p>
<p>Indian diplomats said Pakistan and India have constituted technical working groups which would review the aspects of the export of 500 MW of electricity to Pakistan.</p>
<p>The Pakistani cabinet had decided in January to import electricity from India. &#8220;The cabinet gave approval to the signing of an MoU between Pakistan and India for trade of electricity,&#8221; an official statement had said.</p>
<p>The Water and Power Ministry had initiated negotiations with India in this regard, it said, adding that the World Bank had undertaken to finance feasibility study of the project.</p>
<p>The issue of electricity trade had come up for discussion during the meeting between Indian Commerce Minister Anand Sharma and Chief Minister of Pakistani Punjab Shahbaz Sharif during his visit to India in December.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Sharif had visited Mahatma Gandhi Power project in Haryana after which he had said Pakistan would<br />
welcome India&#8217;s offer for supply of electricity to Pakistan at a reasonable rate.</p>
<p>India has expressed its intent to export electricity to the tune of 500 MW to Pakistan immediately if infrastructure<br />
for transmission of power is made available. Pakistan would import 500MW of power initially, to be enhanced to 1,200MW at a later stage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the daily quoting the government official said, &#8220;The estimates of required finance will be known once a<br />
feasibility study is done.&#8221; It said preliminary discussions with India were underway and tariff matters still needed to be finalised.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the MoU will be an initial commitment to India,&#8221; the official said, adding the government of Pakistan was also working on other power import projects like Casa-1,000MW and electricity purchase from Iran.</p>
<p>Pakistan is currently importing 35 MW of electricity from Iran to meet requirements of Gwadar, while work on increasing it by 100 MW is going on. The two sides signed an agreement on the project in 2007.</p>
<p>Pakistan also has another project in the pipeline for import of 1,000MW of electricity from Tajikistan under<br />
Casa-1000 programme.</p>
<p>Feasibility report of the project has been finalised and work is expected to be completed by 2016.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s power production ranges between 10,000 MW and 16,000 MW against total installed capacity of 21,000 MW.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014367&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least nine people were killed and five others injured after a passenger train crashed on Thursday into a minibus that was carrying workers to a factory.</p>
<p>Basri Guzeloglu, the local governor, said the train slammed into the vehicle at a level crossing near the Mediterranean port city of Mersin.</p>
<p>All the dead were in the vehicle. Three of the injured were said to be in a serious condition.</p>
<p>Guzeloglu said the cause of the accident would be investigated, but media reports suggested a signalling fault that saw the crossing&#8217;s barrier arms up at the time of the accident.</p>
<p>No one aboard the train, travelling from the southern city of Adana to Mersin, was hurt.</p>
<p>Dogan news agency video footage of the scene showed the mangled wreckage of the vehicle lying near the tracks.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014337&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2014295" alt="Images released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/debris1-cut.jpg" /> Images released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority
<p>Four military search planes were dispatched Thursday to try to determine whether two large objects bobbing in a remote part of the Indian Ocean were part of a possible debris field of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight.</p>
<p>One of the objects spotted by satellite imagery had a dimension of 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other one 5 meters (15 feet). There could be other objects in waters nearby in the area that&#8217;s a four-hour flight from Australia&#8217;s southwestern coast, said John Young, manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority&#8217;s emergency response division.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a lead, it&#8217;s probably the best lead we have right now,&#8221; Young said. He cautioned that the objects could be seaborne debris along a shipping route where containers can fall off cargo vessels, although the larger object is longer than a container.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2014296" alt="debris1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/debris1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=355" width="480" height="355" /></p>
<p>Young told a news conference in Canberra, Australia&#8217;s capital, that planes had been sent to the area about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Perth to check on the objects. He said that satellite images &#8220;do not always turn out to be related to the search even if they look good, so we will hold our views on that until they are sighted close-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott had earlier told Parliament about the debris, and said Orion search aircraft had been dispatched.</p>
<p>Young said visibility was poor and may hamper efforts to find the objects. He said they &#8220;are relatively indistinct on the imagery &#8230; but those who are experts indicate they are credible sightings. The indication to me is of objects that are a reasonable size and probably awash with water, moving up and down over the surface.&#8221;</p>
<p>Military planes from Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand have been covering a search region over the southern Indian Ocean that was narrowed down from 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) to 305,000 square kilometers (117,000 square miles).</p>
<p>Young said the depth of the ocean in the latest area, which is south from where the search had been focused on since Monday, is several thousand meters (yards). He said commercial satellites had been redirected in the hope of getting higher resolution images. He did not say when that would happen. The current images are not sharp enough to determine any markings.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2014299" alt="debris2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/debris2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=355" width="480" height="355" /></p>
<p>The Australian Maritime Safety Authority released two images of the whitish objects floating on or just under the surface. The images were taken March 16, but Australian Air Commodore John McGarry said it takes time to analyze.</p>
<p>&#8220;The task of analyzing imagery is quite difficult, it requires drawing down frames and going through frame by frame. The moment this imagery was discovered to reveal a possible object that might indicate a debris field, we have passed the information from defense across to AMSA for their action,&#8221; he told the news conference.</p>
<p>The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by several false leads since it disappeared March 8 above the Gulf of Thailand.</p>
<p>Oil slicks that were spotted did not contain jet fuel. A yellow object thought to be from the plane turned out to be a piece of sea trash. Chinese satellite images showed possible plane debris, but nothing was found.</p>
<p>Relatives of passengers, who have been huddled at a Beijing hotel awaiting news, said Thursday they did not want to comment until there was more solid information out of Australia.</p>
<p>But this is the first time that possible objects have been spotted since the search area was massively expanded into two corridors, one stretching from northern Thailand into Central Asia and the other from the Strait of Malacca down to southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Abbott said he spoke to the prime minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak, about the latest developments.</p>
<p>The FBI has also joined forces with Malaysian authorities in analyzing deleted data on a flight simulator belonging to the pilot of the missing jet.</p>
<p>Files containing records of flight simulations were deleted Feb. 3 from the device found in the home of the pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu said.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether investigators thought that deleting the files was unusual. They might hold hints of unusual flight paths that could help explain where the missing plane went, or the files could have been deleted simply to clear memory for other material.</p>
<p>Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference Wednesday that Zaharie is considered innocent until proven guilty. He said members of the pilot&#8217;s family are cooperating in the investigation.</p>
<p>Zaharie was known to some within the online world of flight simulation enthusiasts.</p>
<p>A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation by name, said the FBI has been asked to analyze the deleted simulator files.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in Washington that the FBI was working with Malaysian authorities. &#8220;At this point, I don&#8217;t think we have any theories,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Flight 370 disappeared March 8 on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanation, but have said the evidence so far suggests the flight was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca, with its communications systems disabled. They are unsure what happened next.</p>
<p>Investigators have identified two giant arcs of territory spanning the possible positions of the plane about 7½ hours after takeoff, based on its last faint signal to a satellite — an hourly &#8220;handshake&#8221; signal that continues even when communications are switched off. The arcs stretch up as far as Kazakhstan in central Asia and down deep into the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, and have asked for background checks from abroad on all foreign passengers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014291&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US judge has reserved ruling on a lawsuit filed here by a Sikh rights group against Congress party in the anti-Sikh riots after hearing arguments by it that the case should be dismissed since the incidents of 1984 are India&#8217;s internal matters.</p>
<p>In a hearing in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, Indian-American attorney Ravi Batra, appearing before US Federal Judge Robert Sweet, argued that the lawsuit filed by Sikhs for Justice should be dismissed since the events of 1984 are the internal affairs of India and &#8220;no other country can interfere in the internal affairs of another.&#8221;</p>
<p>Congress party is seeking dismissal of the human rights violation lawsuit citing lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, failure to state a claim, expiry of statute of limitation and SJF’s legal standing to file the case.</p>
<p>SFJ has argued that the existence of the Indian National Overseas Congress (USA) and its fund-raising activities give US courts jurisdiction over the political party in the case.</p>
<p>Batra rebuffed this argument, saying it would be criminally illegal for a foreign political party to be political in the US.</p>
<p>He said there are three entities in New York wanting to be a branch of the Congress party and senior Congress leader Motilal Vora has disclaimed all of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect Judge Sweet to issue an order dismissing the complaint, preventing SFJ from being a plaintiff, while being sensitive to a court&#8217;s natural desire to help any who claim to have been wronged,&#8221; Batra added.</p>
<p>SFJ has alleged that the Congress party conspired, aided, abetted and carried out attacks on the Sikh population after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014232&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/abu-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014219" alt="Former al-Qaida spokesperson and Osama bin Laden's son in law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/abu-m.jpg" /></a> Former al-Qaida spokesperson and Osama bin Laden&#8217;s son in law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith. (Reuters)
<p>Osama bin Laden&#8217;s hours in a dark Afghanistan cave the evening of the Sept. 11 attacks were brought to light when his son-in-law testified in his own defense at his terrorism trial, portraying the al-Qaida leader as worried and apprehensive as he contemplated how America would respond.</p>
<p>The son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, said the al-Qaida leader asked him hours after the attacks what he thought would happen next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Politically, I said, America, if it was proven that you were the one who did this, will not settle until it accomplishes two things: To kill you and topple the state of the Taliban,&#8221; Abu Ghaith said he told him.</p>
<p>Bin Laden responded: &#8220;You&#8217;re being too pessimistic,&#8221; Abu Ghaith recalled in a discussion that he said went late into the night.</p>
<p>He said bin Laden had sent a messenger to pick him up earlier on Sept. 11 from a house in Kabul, Afghanistan, where he had watched the news unfold on television. He said bin Laden told him: &#8220;We are the ones who did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he had met bin Laden only six or seven times previously before he was brought to the cave in a rough mountainous area.</p>
<p>The surprise testimony on Wednesday by Abu Ghaith seemed to soften the image of the one-time Kuwaiti teacher and preacher known for fiery anti-American rhetoric on widely circulated post-attack videos until a prosecutor took his turn, eliciting damaging admissions from the 48-year-old defendant before showing a videotape on which Abu Ghaith spoke that included a hijacked plane slamming into a World Trade Center tower.</p>
<p>Questioned by defense lawyer Stanley Cohen and later by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Ferrara, the bearded Abu Ghaith testified bin Laden seemed worried that night.</p>
<p>The next morning, Abu Ghaith said, he saw bin Laden with an al-Qaida military leader, Abu Hafs al-Masri, and current al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahiri at breakfast, and bin Laden invited him to join them.</p>
<p>He said bin laden told him: &#8220;Now, after these events, &#8230; it&#8217;s a no-brainer to predict what is going to happen. What you expected may actually happen. And I want to deliver a message to the world. And Dr. Ayman also wants to deliver a message. I want you to deliver that message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within two hours, the four men were posing in front of a rocky backdrop as Abu Ghaith spoke using what he said were &#8220;bullet points&#8221; provided by bin Laden that mixed verses from the Quran with justification for the terror attacks.</p>
<p>It was a position that would bring the onetime imam infamy as well as a place in the inner circle of the world&#8217;s most wanted terrorists and eventually to federal court in Manhattan, where he was brought after his capture last year in Jordan.</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith was the final witness in his trial on charges he conspired to kill Americans and aid al-Qaida as a spokesman for the terrorist group. Closing arguments were scheduled for Monday.</p>
<p>The testimony was a rare gambit by the defense, a last-ditch effort to counter a mountain of evidence against Abu Ghaith, including an alleged confession and the video showing him sitting beside Bin Laden on Sept. 12, 2001, and another in which he warned Americans that &#8220;the storm of airplanes will not abate.&#8221; The defense has never disputed that Abu Ghaith associated with bin Laden after 9/11, but it contends he was recruited as a religious teacher and orator, and had no role in plotting more attacks.</p>
<p>On cross examination, though, Abu Ghaith admitted that he sent his pregnant wife, six daughters and a son to Kuwait while he went to Afghanistan on Sept. 7, 2001, after hearing inside and outside al-Qaida training camps that something big was going to happen soon.</p>
<p>Ferrera mocked Abu Ghaith&#8217;s statement that he stayed and helped bin Laden for two weeks after Sept. 11 because the conditions in Afghanistan were tense and he had no way to travel.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are telling this jury that you made a speech in which you called on people to terrorize the infidels because you didn&#8217;t have a personal car?&#8221; he said, drawing from one juror a smile and a nod to a fellow juror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand the question,&#8221; Abu Ghaith responded.</p>
<p>Testifying through an Arabic interpreter, the Kuwaiti-born defendant seemed relaxed, wearing a blue shirt, open at the collar, beneath a charcoal-colored jacket.</p>
<p>He testified he first met bin Laden when the al-Qaida leader, who was living in Kandahar, Afghanistan, summoned him in June 2001 after hearing he was a preacher from Kuwait. He took bin Laden&#8217;s daughter as an additional wife years after 9/11.</p>
<p>The defendant said that videos he made warning of more attacks on Americans were based on &#8220;quotes and points by Sheik Osama.&#8221; He testified his videotaped sermons were religious in nature, and meant to encourage Muslims to fight oppression.</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith said he wasn&#8217;t involved in recruiting aspiring terrorists and denied allegations he had prior knowledge of the Sept. 11 attacks or the failed shoe-bomb airline attack by Richard Reid in December 2001.</p>
<p>&#8220;My intention was to deliver a message, a message I believed in,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was hoping the United States would say, `Let&#8217;s sit down and talk and solve these problems,&#8217; but America was going on and doing what I expected them to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>His lawyers said they were hopeful that another part of Abu Ghaith&#8217;s testimony, that he had met self-professed Sept. 11 architect Khalid Sheik Mohammed, would cause the federal judge overseeing the trial to reconsider his decision to exclude Mohammed from testifying via videotape from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p>Ferrera zeroed in on Abu Ghaith&#8217;s testimony that he accepted an invitation to meet with bin Laden on Sept. 11 because the al-Qaida leader was a sheik who deserved respect, along with his admission that he was aware bin Laden&#8217;s organization was behind earlier terrorist attacks against Americans abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite knowing that he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans,&#8221; the prosecutor asked, &#8220;you met with him to be polite?&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014207&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afghanm.jpg" /></a> Afghan army and police gather around the area after an attack on a police station in Jalalabad. (AP)
<p>Taliban insurgents carried out a brazen early morning assault on Thursday on a police station in the country&#8217;s east, killing 10 police officers and a civilian, officials said.</p>
<p>The spectacular attack in Jalalabad, the capital of the eastern Nangarhar province, was the latest in the countdown to next month&#8217;s presidential elections.</p>
<p>The assault involved a suicide bomber, two remotely detonated bombs and seven insurgents and set off a four-hour gunbattle with the police.</p>
<p>By the time it was over, all seven insurgents involved in the multi-pronged attack were killed, said Deputy Interior Minister Gen Mohammed Ayub Solangi.</p>
<p>The attack began with a suicide bomber detonating his explosives-laden car outside the police station, located near the palatial residence of the province&#8217;s Governor Attahullah Ludin.</p>
<p>After the blast, six gunmen stormed into the station simultaneously as two bombs were detonated nearby, presumably by remote control one hidden in a motorised three-wheel rickshaw and another in a vegetable cart.</p>
<p>Solangi said the insurgents were armed with heavy weapons and automatic machine guns. The battle was fierce with the Afghan troops fighting their way out and chasing the attackers down the street and when it ended, 10 policemen, including a district police chief, were dead.</p>
<p>The one civilian who was killed was a university student caught in the cross-fire, said police.</p>
<p>Doctors at nearby hospitals said as many as 20 civilians were wounded, mostly from shrapnel from the initial suicide car bombing, but that the majority were treated and released quickly. Two of the wounded were said to be in serious condition.</p>
<p>The nearby state-run Afghan radio and television building was badly damaged in the first suicide bombing.</p>
<p>In an email in Pashto the language most often spoken by the Taliban the insurgent group&#8217;s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the Taliban had staged the attack in Jalalabad.</p>
<p>The Taliban have carried out numerous attacks in Jalalabad and the country&#8217;s east, which is their traditional stronghold, along with southern Afghanistan.</p>
<p>They have threatened a campaign of violence to disrupt the April 5 vote, which will choose a new Afghan president to lead the country as foreign troops prepare to end their combat mission by the end of the year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013986&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Australia has sent aircraft to investigate two objects spotted by satellite floating in the southern Indian Ocean that could be debris from a Malaysian jetliner missing with 239 people on board, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Thursday.</p>
<p>No confirmed wreckage from Malaysia Airlines  Flight MH370 has been found since it vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia&#8217;s east coast early on March 8, less than an hour after taking off.</p>
<p>&#8220;New and credible information has come to light in relation to the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean,&#8221; Abbott told the Australian parliament.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) has received information based on satellite imagery of objects possibly related to the search.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Following specialist analysis of this satellite imagery, two possible objects related to the search have been identified,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Abbott said he had already spoken with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak and cautioned that the objects had yet to be identified.</p>
<p>&#8220;The task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out they are not related to the search for MH370,&#8221; Abbott said.</p>
<p>Investigators believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial aviation navigation switched off the plane&#8217;s communications systems before diverting it thousands of miles off its scheduled course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
<p>Exhaustive background checks of the passengers and crew aboard have not yielded anything that might explain the reason for the sudden disappearance of the plane.</p>
<p>The FBI is helping Malaysian authorities analyse data from a flight simulator belonging to the captain of the missing plane, after initial examination showed some data logs had been deleted early last month.</p>
<p>Abbott said a search aircraft was due to arrive at the area where the objects were spotted at about the time he was speaking in parliament.</p>
<p>A further three aircraft were also en route to the site.</p>
<p>The AMSA said it would hold a media briefing in Canberra at 0430 GMT.</p>
<p>An unprecedented multinational search for the plane has focused on two vast search corridors: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia&#8217;s Sumatra island to west of Australia.</p>
<p>Australia is leading the search in the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the US Navy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013959&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/wh-m.jpg" /></a> White House maintained its earlier stance over the issue. (Reuters)
<p>There is no reason to believe that anyone in the highest ranks of the Pak government knew about the location of Osama bin Laden, the White House has said.</p>
<p>A day after a major American daily claimed that the top ISI leadership knew about the presence of the al Qaeda leader inside the country, the White House, on Wednesday, maintained its earlier stance over the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;As US officials have said, we have no reason to believe that anyone in the highest levels of the government knew about the location of bin Laden. That continues to be true,&#8221; White House National Security Council spokesperson Laura Lucas Magnuson told PTI, when asked about the news report.</p>
<p>Ever since the bin Laden was killed by the US commandos in a daring operation in 2011, the Obama Administration has maintained that it has got no evidence which indicates that the top Pakistani leadership knew about the presence of the al Qaeda leader in Pakistan.</p>
<p>However, journalist Carlotta Gall in The New York Times, reported that the then ISI chief Ahmed Shuja Pasha knew of Laden&#8217;s presence in Pakistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon after the Navy SEAL raid on Bin Laden&#8217;s house, a Pakistani official told me that the United States had direct evidence that ISI chief Lt General Ahmed Shuja Pasha knew of Laden&#8217;s presence in Abbottabad,&#8221; he wrote from the excerpts of his upcoming book.</p>
<p>&#8220;The information came from a senior United States official, and I guessed that the Americans had intercepted a phone call of Pasha&#8217;s or one about him in the days after the raid.</p>
<p>&#8220;He knew of Osama&#8217;s whereabouts, yes,&#8221; the Pakistani official told me,&#8221; the journalist wrote in the daily. &#8220;The official was surprised to learn this and said the Americans were even more so,&#8221; the journalist wrote.</p>
<p>Pasha was an energetic opponent of the Taliban and an open and cooperative counterpart for the Americans at the ISI.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pasha was always their blue-eyed boy,&#8221; the official said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But in the weeks and months after the raid, Pasha and the ISI press office strenuously denied that they had any knowledge of Laden&#8217;s presence in Abbottabad,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Pakistan too has denied such report.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013935&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hafiz.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013783" alt="Pasha was ISI chief from October 2008 to March 2012." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hafiz.jpg" /></a> Pasha was ISI chief from October 2008 to March 2012.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Lt gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, when he was chief of Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, knew of Osama bin Laden’s hideout in his country and Lashkar-e-Toiba founder Hafiz Saeed was in regular contact with the al-Qaeda chief, the New York Times reported Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Soon after the US Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden’s house, “a Pakistani official told me the US had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of Bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad,” the newspaper said in an article by senior journalist Carlotta Gall.</p>
<p>Bin Laden was shot dead by US commandos in May 2012 in a unilateral raid that caught the Pakistanis by surprise. Pasha was ISI chief from October 2008 to March 2012.</p>
<p>“The information came from a senior US official, and I guessed that the Americans had intercepted a phone call of Pasha’s or one about him in the days after the raid,” Gall wrote in the article headlined ‘What Pakistan Knew About bin Laden’, adapted from the book The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014, to be published next month.</p>
<p>Gall covered Afghanistan and Pakistan for the paper from 2001 to 2013.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">“He knew of Osama’s whereabouts, yes,” the Pakistani official was quoted as saying.</span></p>
<p>“Pasha was always their blue-eyed boy,” the official said, adding he was surprised to learn this.</p>
<p>Pakistani intelligence sources dismissed the NYT report as “baseless”.</p>
<p>“There is no truth in the NYT report. It is a totally baseless story. Nobody in Pakistan knew about the presence of Osama bin Laden,” a Pakistani intelligence source said.</p>
<p>The report added that the haul of handwritten notes, letters, computer files and other information collected from bin Laden’s house during the raid revealed regular correspondence “between bin Laden and a string of militant leaders who must have known he was living in Pakistan, including Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of</p>
<p>Lashkar-e-Toiba, a pro-Kashmiri group that has also been active in Afghanistan, and Mullah Omar of the Taliban”.</p>
<p>“Saeed and Omar are two of the ISI’s most important and loyal militant leaders. Both are protected by the agency. Both cooperate closely with it, restraining their followers from attacking the Pakistani state and coordinating with Pakistan’s greater strategic plans.</p>
<p>“Any correspondence the two men had with bin Laden would probably have been known to their ISI handlers,” it said.</p>
<p>Saeed, who is wanted by Indian security agencies in connection with the 2008 Mumbai attacks, also denied the report. He appeared live on TV channels in Pakistan besides using his Twitter handle to deny the charges.</p>
<p>There has been strong suspicion that some in the Pakistani establishment knew bin Laden’s whereabouts as he was living a stone-throw away from a military academy in Abbottabad.</p>
<p>“According to one inside source, the ISI actually ran a special desk assigned to handle bin Laden. It was operated independently, led by an officer who made his own decisions and did not report to a superior. He handled only one person: bin Laden,” NYT reported.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013774&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">With Russia facing sanctions from the US after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine, India is of the view that it will not support any “unilateral measures” against the Russian government.</span></p>
<p>“India has never supported unilateral sanctions against any country, for example Iraq or Iran. Therefore, we will also not support any unilateral measures by a country or a group of countries,” a government sources said.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin had explained the situation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday, who underlined India’s position on “unity and territorial integrity” of countries and hoped a diplomatic solution would be found to the issue.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon had said, “There are legitimate Russian and other interests involved and we hope they are discussed and resolved.”</p>
<p>The US and the EU have imposed sanctions on several officials in Russia and Ukraine accused of involvement in Moscow’s actions in the Black Sea peninsula. Australia has also announced its decision to impose sanctions.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013761&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>CARLOTTA GALL</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after the September 11 attacks, I went to live and report for The New York Times in Afghanistan. I would spend most of the next 12 years there. In December 2006, I flew to Quetta. After our first day, we noticed that an intelligence agent on a motorbike was following us, and everyone we interviewed was visited afterward by ISI agents.</p>
<p>We visited a neighbourhood called Pashtunabad, home to several members of the Taliban, who live in houses behind high walls, often next to mosques and madrasas they run. One of the madrasas, the Jamiya Islamiya, is a brick-and-concrete building three storeys high, with classrooms that can accommodate 280 students. At least three of the suicide bombers we were tracing had been students here. Senior figures from Pakistani religious parties and provincial-government officials were frequent visitors, and Taliban members would often visit in the dark, in fleets of SUVs.</p>
<p>A female journalist would not be permitted inside, so I passed some questions to the Pakistani reporter with me, and he and the photographer went in. After returning, they told me that words of praise were painted across the wall of the inner courtyard for the madrasa’s political patron, a Pakistani religious-party leader, and the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar.</p>
<p>“The madrasas are a cover, a camouflage,” a Pashtun legislator from the area told me. Behind the curtain, hidden in the shadows, lurked the ISI.</p>
<p>On our fifth and last day in Quetta, four plainclothes agents broke through the door of my hotel room. They snatched my laptop from my hands, went through my clothes and seized my notebooks and a cellphone. When one of the men grabbed my handbag, I protested. He punched me twice, hard, in the face and temple.</p>
<p>The officer told me that I was not permitted to visit Pashtunabad and that it was forbidden to interview members of the Taliban. As they were leaving, I said my photographer colleague, whom they had detained at his hotel earlier, had to stay with me. “He is Pakistani,” the officer said. “We can do with him whatever we want.”</p>
<p>Benazir Bhutto had long warned that a conglomeration of opponents wanted her dead and were all linked in some way. They were the same forces behind the insurgency in Afghanistan: Taliban and Pakistani militant groups and al-Qaeda, as well as the Pak military establishment, which included top generals Pervez Musharraf and Ashfaq Parvez Kayani.</p>
<p>The chief state prosecutor in Bhutto’s murder trial, Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali, told me there was “overwhelming circumstantial evidence” that Musharraf did not provide her with adequate security because he wanted to ensure her death in an inevitable assassination attempt. Ali succeeded in having Musharraf arrested and was pushing to speed up the trial when he was shot to death on his way to work in May 2013.</p>
<p>Ali had no doubts that the mastermind of the plot to kill Bhutto was al-Qaeda. “It was because she was pro-American, because she was a strong leader and a nationalist,” he told me. A Pakistani security official who interviewed some of the suspects in the Bhutto case and other militants told me the decision to assassinate Bhutto was made at a meeting of the top council of al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>It took more than three years before the depth of Pakistan’s relationship with al-Qaeda was thrust into the open and the world learned where Osama bin Laden had been hiding, just a few hundred yards from Pakistan’s top military academy. In May 2011, some 30 hours after Navy SEALs shot him dead, I was fascinated to see where and how he hid.</p>
<p>People knew that the house was strange, and one local rumour had it that it was a place where wounded Taliban from Waziristan recuperated. I was told this by Musharraf&#8217;s former civilian intelligence chief, who had himself been accused of having a hand in hiding Bin Laden in Abbottabad. He denied any involvement, but he did not absolve local intelligence agents, who would have checked the house.</p>
<p>Soon after the Navy SEAL raid, a Pakistani official told me that the United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of Bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad. The information came from a senior US official, and I guessed that the Americans had intercepted a phone call of Pasha’s or one about him in the days after the raid. “He knew of Osama’s whereabouts, yes,” the Pakistani official told me. The official was surprised to learn this and said the Americans were even more so. Pasha had been an energetic opponent of the Taliban and an open and cooperative counterpart for the Americans at the ISI. “Pasha was always their blue-eyed boy,” the official said.</p>
<p>The haul of handwritten notes, letters, computer files and other information collected from Bin Laden&#8217;s house during the raid revealed regular correspondence between Bin Laden and a string of militant leaders who must have known he was living in Pakistan, including Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, and Mullah Omar of the Taliban. Saeed and Omar are two of the ISI’s most important and loyal militant leaders. Both are protected by the agency. Both cooperate closely with it, restraining their followers from attacking the Pakistani state and coordinating with Pakistan’s greater strategic plans. Any correspondence the two men had with Bin Laden would probably have been known to their ISI handlers.</p>
<p>In trying to prove that the ISI knew of Bin Laden’s whereabouts and protected him, I struggled for more than two years to piece together something other than circumstantial evidence and suppositions from sources with no direct knowledge. Only one man, a former ISI chief and retired general, Ziauddin Butt, told me that he thought Musharraf had arranged to hide Bin Laden in Abbottabad. But he had no proof and, under pressure, claimed in the Pakistani press that he’d been misunderstood.</p>
<p>Finally, on a winter evening in 2012, I got the confirmation I was looking for. According to one inside source, the ISI actually ran a special desk assigned to handle Bin Laden. It was operated independently, led by an officer who made his own decisions and did not report to a superior. He handled only one person: Bin Laden. I was sitting at an outdoor cafe when I learned this, and I remember gasping, though quietly so as not to draw attention. (Two former senior American officials later told me that the information was consistent with their own conclusions.) This was what Afghans knew, and Taliban fighters had told me, but finally someone on the inside was admitting it. The desk was wholly deniable by virtually everyone at the ISI — such is how supersecret intelligence units operate — but the top military bosses knew about it, I was told.</p>
<p>America’s failure to fully understand and actively confront Pakistan on its support and export of terrorism is one of the primary reasons President Hamid Karzai has become so disillusioned with the United States. As American and NATO troops prepare to withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of this year, the Pakistani military and its Taliban proxy forces lie in wait, as much a threat as any that existed in 2001.</p>
<p>In January 2013, a spokesperson for the notorious Haqqania madrasa in the northwestern town of Akora Khattak told me, “It is a political fact that one day the Taliban will take power. The white flag of the Taliban will fly again over Kabul, inshallah.”</p>
<p>Pakistani security officials, political analysts, journalists and legislators warned of the same thing. The Pakistani military was still set on dominating Afghanistan and was still determined to use the Taliban to exert influence now that the United States was pulling out.</p>
<p>Kathy Gannon of The Associated Press reported in September that militants from Punjab were massing in the tribal areas to join the Taliban and train for an anticipated offensive into Afghanistan this year. In Punjab, mainstream religious parties and banned militant groups were openly recruiting hundreds of students for jihad, and groups of young men were being dispatched to Syria to wage jihad there. “They are the same jihadi groups; they are not 100 percent under control,” a former Pakistani legislator told me. “But still the military protects them.”</p>
<p>The US was neither speaking out against Pakistan nor changing its policy toward a government that was exporting terrorism, the legislator lamented. “How many people have to die before they get it? They are standing by a military that protects, aids and abets people who are going against the US and Western mission in Afghanistan, in Syria, everywhere.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013708&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pasha-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013600" alt="Pasha was ISI chief from October 2008 to March 2012." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pasha-med.jpg" /></a> Pasha was ISI chief from October 2008 to March 2012.
<p>Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, when he was chief of Pakistani intelligence agency ISI, knew of Osama bin Laden’s hideout in his country and Lashkar-e-Toiba founder Hafiz Saeed was in regular contact with the Al-Qaeda chief, the New York Times reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Soon after the US Navy SEAL raid on bin Laden’s house, “a Pakistani official told me the US had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad,” the newspaper said in an article by senior journalist Carlotta Gall.</p>
<p>Bin Laden was shot dead by US commandos in May 2012 in a unilateral raid that caught the Pakistanis by surprise. Pasha was ISI chief from October 2008 to March 2012.</p>
<p>“The information came from a senior US official, and I guessed that the Americans had intercepted a phone call of Pasha’s or one about him in the days after the raid,” Gall wrote in the article headlined ‘What Pakistan Knew About bin Laden’, adapted from the book The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001-2014, to be published next month.</p>
<p>Gall covered Afghanistan and Pakistan for the paper from 2001 to 2013. “He knew of Osama’s whereabouts, yes,” the Pakistani official was quoted as saying. “Pasha was always their blue-eyed boy,” the official said, adding he was surprised to learn this.</p>
<p>Pakistani intelligence sources dismissed the NYT report as “baseless”. “There is no truth in the NYT report. It is a totally baseless story. Nobody in Pakistan knew about the presence of Osama bin Laden,” a Pakistani intelligence source said.</p>
<p>The report added that the haul of handwritten notes, letters, computer files and other information collected from bin Laden’s house during the raid revealed regular correspondence “between bin Laden and a string of militant leaders who must have known he was living in Pakistan, including Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the founder of<br />
Lashkar-e-Toiba, a pro-Kashmiri group that has also been active in Afghanistan, and Mullah Omar of the Taliban”.</p>
<p>“Saeed and Omar are two of the ISI’s most important and loyal militant leaders. Both are protected by the agency. Both cooperate closely with it, restraining their followers from attacking the Pakistani state and coordinating with Pakistan’s greater strategic plans.</p>
<p>“Any correspondence the two men had with bin Laden would probably have been known to their ISI handlers,” it said.  Saeed, who is wanted by Indian security agencies in connection with the 2008 Mumbai attacks, also denied the report. He appeared live on TV channels in Pakistan besides using his Twitter handle to deny the charges.<br />
There has been strong suspicion that some in the Pakistani establishment knew bin Laden’s whereabouts as he was living a stone-throw away from a military academy in Abbottabad.</p>
<p>“According to one inside source, the ISI actually ran a special desk assigned to handle bin Laden. It was operated independently, led by an officer who made his own decisions and did not report to a superior. He handled only one person: bin Laden,” NYT reported.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013596&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mp-medium.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013610" alt="No wreckage has been found from Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia's east coast. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mp-medium.jpg" /></a> No wreckage has been found from Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia&#8217;s east coast. (AP)
<p>Investigators probing the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner with 239 people on board believe it most likely flew into the southern Indian Ocean, a source close to the investigation said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>No wreckage has been found from Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia&#8217;s east coast at 1:21 a.m. local time on March 8 (1721 GMT March 7), less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing.</p>
<p>An unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER is under way involving 26 nations in two vast search &#8220;corridors&#8221;: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia&#8217;s Sumatra island to west of Australia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The working assumption is that it went south, and furthermore that it went to the southern end of that corridor,&#8221; said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The view is based on the lack of any evidence from countries along the northern corridor that the plane entered their airspace, and the failure to find any trace of wreckage in searches in the upper part of the southern corridor.<br />
China, which is leading the northern corridor search with Kazakhstan, said it had not yet found any sign of the aircraft crossing into its territory.</p>
<p>Malaysian and U.S. officials believe the aircraft was deliberately diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course, but an exhaustive background search of the passengers and crew aboard has not yielded anything that might explain why.</p>
<p><strong>Sophisticated Equipment</strong></p>
<p>The minister in charge of the operation said the multinational search team was deploying the most sophisticated equipment available to find the plane.</p>
<p>&#8220;It probably is the largest peacetime armada of assets and satellite information-sharing that we have ever seen for a rescue and search operation,&#8221; Malaysia&#8217;s Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said.</p>
<p>Officials believe that someone with detailed knowledge of both the Boeing 777 and commercial aviation navigation switched off two vital datalinks: the ACARS system, which relays maintenance data back to the ground, and the transponder, which enables the plane to be seen by civilian radar.</p>
<p>The source close to the investigation said that it was thought &#8220;highly probable that ACARS was switched off prior to the final verbal message&#8221; received for the cockpit.</p>
<p>That message, an informal &#8220;all right, good night&#8221; radioed to Malaysian air traffic controllers to acknowledge their handover of the plane to Vietnamese airspace, was believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot, the airline said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that minutes later the plane turned sharply west, re-crossing the Malay Peninsula and following an established commercial route towards India.</p>
<p>After that, ephemeral pings picked up by one commercial satellite suggest the aircraft flew on for at least six hours. The data from the satellite placed the plane somewhere in one of the two corridors when the final signal was sent at 8:11 a.m.</p>
<p>The methodical shutdown of the communications systems, together with the fact that the plane appeared to be following a planned course after turning back, have been interpreted as suggesting strongly that foul play, rather than some kind of technical failure, was behind the disappearance.</p>
<p><strong>Never Found?</strong></p>
<p>Last week, a source familiar with official U.S. assessments said it was thought most likely the plane flew south, where it presumably would have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.</p>
<p>If it did indeed end up in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the remotest places on Earth and also one of the deepest seas, it increases the chance it may never be found &#8211; and investigators may never know for sure what happened on board.</p>
<p>U.S. government sources said intelligence agencies had extensively analysed people on the flight but came up with no connections to terrorism or possible criminal motives.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. official said he was &#8220;not aware of any stones left unturned&#8221;. China has said there is no evidence that Chinese passengers, who made up over two-thirds of those on board, were involved in a hijack or act of sabotage.<br />
Australia is leading the search of the southern part of the southern corridor, with assistance from the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>It has shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but it still covers an area of 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles), roughly the size of Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>US. Navy said it had switched mainly to using P-8A Poseidon and P-3 Orion aircraft to search for the missing plane instead of ships and helicopters.</p>
<p>&#8220;The maritime patrol aircraft are much more suited for this type of operation,&#8221; said Navy Lieutenant David Levy, who is on board the USS Blue Ridge. &#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s just a much more efficient way to search.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013545&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A 500-year-old extremely rare Chinese &#8216;chicken cup&#8217; belonging to the Ming Dynasty is set to fetch a record-breaking 38.6 million at an auction.</p>
<p>The &#8216;chicken cup&#8217;, one of the just four left in the world, is expected to set a new record for Chinese porcelain at auction, with estimates of between USD 25.7–38.6 million.</p>
<p>The cup produced during the Chenghua reign (1465-87), will feature in Sotheby&#8217;s spring sale in Hong Kong next month, a news agency reported.</p>
<p>The Chenghua &#8216;chicken cups&#8217; were produced in small numbers and now there are just four left in the hands of private owners around the world.</p>
<p>Only a handful of museums worldwide have the cups in their collection including the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert (V&amp;A) Museum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever since the Ming Dynasty when they were produced, Chenghua period &#8216;chicken cups&#8217; have been praised and treasured by emperors and connoisseurs alike,&#8221; said Nicolas Chow, international head of Sotheby&#8217;s Fine Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given their extreme rarity, they are by definition the crowning glory of any collection of Chinese porcelain,&#8221; Chow said.</p>
<p>The creation of &#8216;chicken cups&#8217; reached its peak during the Chenghua period, and they were celebrated for their tactile material, elegance of colour arrangement and distinctive painting style, the report said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013479&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>Investigators are trying to restore files deleted last month from the home flight simulator of the pilot aboard the missing Malaysian plane to see if they shed any light on the disappearance, Malaysia&#8217;s defense minister said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference that the pilot, Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah, is considered innocent until proven guilty of any wrongdoing. He said members of Zaharie&#8217;s family are cooperating in the investigation.</p>
<p>Files containing records of the simulations carried out on the program were deleted on Feb. 3, Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu told the news conference.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 with 239 people aboard went missing March 8 on a night flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possible explanations, but have said the evidence so far suggests the flight was deliberately turned back across Malaysia to the Strait of Malacca. They are unsure what happened next.</p>
<p>Investigators have identified two giant arcs of territory spanning the possible positions of the plane about 7½ hours after takeoff, based on its last faint signal to a satellite. The arcs stretch up as far as Kazakhstan in central Asia and down deep into the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, and have asked for background checks from foreign agencies on all foreign passengers.</p>
<p>Hishammuddin said background checks have been received for all the foreigners except those from Ukraine and Russia — which account for three passengers. He said none of the checks has turned up anything suspicious.</p>
<p>Relatives of passengers on the missing airliner have grown increasingly frustrated over the lack of progress in the search after 12 days. Planes sweeping across vast expanses of the Indian Ocean and satellites peering on Central Asia have turned up no new clues in the hunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really too much. I don&#8217;t know why it is taking so long for so many people to find the plane. It&#8217;s 12 days,&#8221; Subaramaniam Gurusamy, 60, said in an interview from his home on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. His 34-year-old son, Pushpanathan Subramaniam, was on the flight heading to Beijing for a work trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the one son I have,&#8221; Subaramaniam said.</p>
<p>Before Wednesday&#8217;s news briefing at a hotel near the Kuala Lumpur airport, Chinese relatives of passengers held up a banner and started shouting at the venue before police escorted them out.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013443&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<img class="size-full wp-image-2013381" alt="A young Malaysian boy prays, at an event for the missing Malaysia Airline, MH370, at a shopping mall, in Petaling Jaya. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/prayer-480.jpg" /> A young Malaysian boy prays, at an event for the missing Malaysia Airline, MH370, at a shopping mall, in Petaling Jaya. (AP)
<p>The imam cupped his palms before his face and invited the congregation to pray. &#8220;Oh Allah, return to us those who are lost. Oh, Allah, grant safe passage to MH370,&#8221; he declaimed in English.</p>
<p>The prayer was not unusual. The setting was.</p>
<p>Gathered in the courtyard of a shopping mall, the Muslim religious leader was followed by a Christian reading from the Bible, then a Buddhist monk, a Hindu and finally a Taoist priest echoing the imam&#8217;s pleas before hundreds of worshippers in a largely Muslim country where religious intolerance has been on the rise.</p>
<p>The baffling mystery over the disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines jetliner with 239 people on March 8 has united Malaysia, a rainbow nations of numerous ethnicities, as never before in recent memory.</p>
<p>Tuesday night&#8217;s inter-faith ceremony would have been inconceivable 11 days ago in this country of 28 million people where religious differences and bigotry have often been on open display. For Malaysians the sight of non-Muslims bowing respectfully as Imam Hilman Nordin said the prayers from the rostrum was an incredible step toward unity. While there have been interfaith prayers before, they have always been without a Muslim representative.</p>
<p>Muslims have been at loggerheads with Christians and Hindus in recent years, and some sermons last month identified Christians and Jews as enemies of Islam. Hardliner Muslims have called for the burning of Bibles and in January firebombs were thrown into a church compound. A few years ago, a group of hard-line Muslims stomped on the severed head of a cow outside a Hindu temple. Cow is sacred to Hindus.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the shared sadness of loss, the tragedy has revealed and reinforced a strong sense of community,&#8221; said Bridget Welsh, a political scientist from Singapore Management University. &#8220;If anything this is a silver lining of the tragedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the enmity rises from the right of non-Muslims to use the word &#8220;Allah.&#8221; The government and hardliners say &#8220;Allah&#8221; &#8212; the Arabic word for God &#8212; is exclusive to Malay Muslims, who account for about 60 percent of the population. The Catholic Church has challenged this assertion in an ongoing court case which many Muslims see as a threat to the dominance of Islam. Most indigenous tribes in Borneo are Christians, and speak only the Malay language in which the word for God is Allah.</p>
<p>The case remains unresolved in court and religious tension continues to fester.</p>
<p>In January this year, Islamic authorities seized more than 300 Malay-language Bibles from the office of a Christian group because they used the word Allah.</p>
<p>This row over a single word has blackened the country&#8217;s image for religious tolerance and hardened the long-standing sense of alienation among ethnic and religious minorities who feel discriminated by decades of affirmative action policies the benefit Malay Muslims in business, jobs and education. Malays — almost exclusively Muslim — are about 70 percent of the population. Chinese, who are Buddhists, Christians and Taoists, are 21 percent and Indians, who are Hindus, Sikhs and Christians, are about 7 percent.</p>
<p>But such differences have been set aside &#8212; at least temporarily &#8212; following the disappearance of the plane after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8.  A massive sea and air hunt by 26 nations continues.</p>
<p>Thousands of Malaysians of all ethnic backgrounds were also touched by the tweets of Maira Elizabeth Nari, daughter of the chief steward aboard the stricken plane.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been more than 100 hours. Where are you?&#8221; she wrote in one tweet. And one of her 40,000 followers encouraged her: &#8220;Keep on praying, pray to Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the inter-faith vigil at the Curve in the Kuala Lumpur suburb of Damansara Perdana, leaders of several religious groups went on stage to offer their prayers. Many in the crowd wore white t-shirts with the words &#8220;Unite for MH370&#8243; and held white balloons with hand written messages of hope in ink.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today is a rare occasion for us to bring unity, peace and harmony,&#8221; said a Buddhist monk before chanting a prayer for the plane&#8217;s safety.</p>
<p>Video messages from people all over paying tributes to the passengers were played on a large screen. Many people hugged each other and listened to a heartwarming version of Michael Jackson&#8217;s &#8220;You Are Not Alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please come back home. We are all in tears waiting for you brothers and sisters,&#8221; said Shantha Venugopal, the Hindu representative. The Taoist priest beseeched God for divine intervention while the Sikh leader pleaded for a closure to the plane&#8217;s disappearance.</p>
<p>Teh Su They, whose Global Peace Foundation co-organized the gathering with local singer Reshmonu, a Hindu, said the tragedy showed that &#8220;deep inside the heart of every Malaysian, we care for one another, that we are one family. In this difficult time we need to come closer to support each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement, Reshmonu said &#8220;For one night, we forget our divisions and stand united for&#8230; faith, compassion and love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of this tragedy, we stand as one and respect one another&#8217;s religion. I see this as Allah&#8217;s wisdom behind this tragedy to reunite all Malaysians,&#8221; said Nurul Arfarina Nasir, a 28-year-old housewife wearing a headscarf and holding a white balloon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/homo-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013376" alt="Indian-origin gay bank worker allegedly strangled his wife and burnt her body to hide his homosexuality. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/homo-med.jpg" /></a> Indian-origin gay bank worker allegedly strangled his wife and burnt her body to hide his homosexuality. (PTI)
<p>An Indian-origin gay bank worker allegedly strangled his wife and burnt her body months after marrying her to hide his homosexuality, a British court has heard.</p>
<p>Jasvir Ram Ginday, 29, attacked Varkha Rani at their home in Walsall in Midlands with a metal pipe from a vacuum cleaner. He burnt her body in a garden incinerator but told a neighbour he had set fire to &#8220;general rubbish&#8221;, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard.</p>
<p>Ginday admits manslaughter but denies murder. Rani, 24, married Ginday in India in March last year and moved to the UK to live with him in August after being granted a visa, the court heard.</p>
<p>But Ginday had told a friend he was attracted to men as early as 2008, according to prosecutor Deborah Gould. About a month before Rani&#8217;s death on September 12 last year, someone at their home made an internet search for incinerators, she said, adding Ginday initially told police his wife had walked out on him after using him to gain entry to the UK.</p>
<p>Gould said: &#8220;His ultimate intention, the Crown suggests, was to play the role of victim, safe in the knowledge that he could rely upon his married status as a permanent excuse for never having to have another relationship with a woman.&#8221; Besides manslaughter, Ginday has admitted perverting the course of justice by lying to police, BBC reported.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013337&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/fukushimam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013328" alt="Tanks of radiation-contaminated water at Tepco’s tsunami-crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/fukushimam.jpg" /></a> Tanks of radiation-contaminated water at Tepco’s tsunami-crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant. (Reuters)
<p>The operator of Japan&#8217;s crippled Fukushima nuclear plant said on Wednesday that it has temporarily shut down a decontamination system that scrubs radiation-tainted water used to cool damaged reactors. </p>
<p>Tokyo Electric Power (TEPCO) said it had discovered a defect in its Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) and switched it off on Tuesday for repairs. </p>
<p>It is not the first time the utility has shut down the system, which has been hit by a series of glitches since trial operations began a year ago. </p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know yet when we can resume operating the system as we have not detected the cause of the defect yet,&#8221; a TEPCO spokeswoman said. </p>
<p>&#8220;But we still have room to store toxic water so there is no immediate concern.&#8221; </p>
<p>TEPCO is struggling to handle a huge &#8211; and growing &#8211; volume of contaminated water at the tsunami-damaged plant. There are about 436,000 cubic metres of contaminated water stored at the site in about 1,200 purpose-built tanks. </p>
<p>Many experts say that at some point the water will have to be released into the sea after being scoured of the most harmful contaminants. They say it will pose a negligible risk to marine life or people, but local fishermen and neighbouring countries are fiercely opposed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013301&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Poster reads &#8220;Putin out of Ukraine&#8221;. (AP)
<p>After moving to annex Crimea, Russian President Vladimir Putin insists he has no intention of invading other regions in Ukraine, much less other nations.</p>
<p>But leaders in Russia&#8217;s backyard aren&#8217;t so sure, and they&#8217;re looking to Vice President Joe Biden for assurances that the U.S. has a plan to prevent that from happening.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/putin-annexes-crimea-says-it-is-russias-in-peoples-hearts-minds/" target="_blank">Putin annexes Crimea, says it is Russia’s in people’s hearts, minds</a></p>
<p>Biden was to meet in this Baltic capital on Wednesday with the leaders of Lithuania and Latvia, two small countries that, like Ukraine, share their eastern border with Russia.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/crimea-treaty-fallout-russia-suspended-from-g8-says-it-will-retailiate-against-sanctions/" target="_blank">Crimea treaty fallout: Russia suspended from G8, says it will retailiate against sanctions</a></p>
<p>Almost 10 years to the day after Lithuania and Latvia joined NATO, the Baltics are suddenly plunged into the type of eerie concern about foreign aggression they may have thought they&#8217;d left behind at the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>A day after promising more sanctions and regional military exercises to send a stern signal to Putin, Biden was to make the case that the U.S. stands ready to defend nations like Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia whose NATO membership entitles them to a defensive response from the U.S. and others.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/putin-calls-pm-thanks-indias-objectivity/" target="_blank">Putin calls PM, thanks India’s ‘objectivity’</a></p>
<p>The three Baltic nations were once part of the former Soviet Union and have a sizable ethnic Russian minority population. &#8220;Have no doubt: The United States will honour its commitment. We always do,&#8221; Biden said on Tuesday in Warsaw, Poland, which shares a border with both Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Still, the entire region is reeling from Moscow&#8217;s move to absorb Crimea into its orbit. Tough talk, sanctions and travel bans have not been enough so far to dissuade Putin and his military from seizing control of Crimea and then, after a Crimean referendum that the West has condemned as illegal, declaring it part of Russia. Other countries watching warily are concerned they could be next.</p>
<p>&#8220;The punishment doesn&#8217;t fit the crime, and the Baltic states and central European states know this,&#8221; said Michael Geary, a European relations analyst at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re worried that the U.S. response has been mediocre at best, and there&#8217;s a palpable sense they need reassurance. Will they be protected in the event of further westward march by Russia?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, they will, Biden will seek to assure Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and Latvian President Andris Berzins on Wednesday as he closes out a two-day trip to the region intended to send a stern signal to Putin.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Biden offered similar assurances to Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, along with Poland&#8217;s prime minister and president during back-to-back meetings with the NATO allies in Warsaw.</p>
<p>More sanctions are coming, plus new NATO training and exercises that will take place in Poland, Biden said. He added that the U.S. was considering rotating American forces to the Baltic region as a step toward ensuring the collective defense of NATO allies.</p>
<p>Those forces could conduct ground and naval exercises, and engage in training missions. At the same time, other major Western powers were seeking fresh ways to show that Russia would incur real costs unless it changes course.</p>
<p>The British government said it was suspending military cooperation with Russia in light of the crisis. President Barack Obama invited world leaders — excluding Russia — to discuss what comes next during a meeting in Europe next week on the sidelines of a nuclear summit.</p>
<p>At Warsaw&#8217;s request, the U.S. last week sent some 300 air troops and a dozen F-16 fighters to Poland for joint training in a show of military support for a key ally.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a phone call with Obama, agreed that U.N. and other international monitors must be sent in to other parts of Ukraine without delay.</p>
<p>With Crimea now in Russia&#8217;s control, attention has turned to eastern Ukraine and other areas with large ethnic Russian populations to see whether Putin will seek additional territory in what some fear is a return to Moscow&#8217;s traditional imperial ambitions.</p>
<p>Critics of the Obama administration&#8217;s approach say that without a more forceful response, Baltic countries and other regions like the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria could be next.</p>
<p>&#8220;The West must impose real costs on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine,&#8221; Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a statement. &#8220;By failing to do so, we only invite further aggression elsewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Italy&#8217;s highest court has upheld a two-year political ban against Silvio Berlusconi stemming from his tax fraud conviction.</p>
<p>The Court of Cassation ruling handed down late Tuesday is the latest setback for Berlusconi, who was kicked out of Parliament last year after the high court upheld his conviction and four-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>Despite the ban on holding or running for public office, Berlusconi remains a force in Italian politics, heading his Forza Italia party.</p>
<p>The three-time former premier won&#8217;t do any jail time for the tax fraud conviction, which concerned the purchase of TV rights to US films for Berlusconi&#8217;s Mediaset network. The term has been reduced to one year under an amnesty, and Berlusconi will serve it either under house arrest or doing community service.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013115&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Police in China&#8217;s restive western region of Xinjiang shot an armed assailant for attacking an officer, who later died, state media said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The suspect used unspecified weapons to injure a police officer in the city of Urumqi on Monday night, the official China News Service reported. Officers who arrived at the site shot the attacker dead.</p>
<p>The injured officer, who was 29, later died, the news agency reported. The report did not identify the ethnicity of the assailant, but it was the latest in a series of attacks pointing to a growing unrest in the sprawling region.</p>
<p>Xinjiang is home to a simmering rebellion against Chinese rule among parts of the native Turkic Uighur population who chafe against Beijing&#8217;s rule. Recent clashes, including an attack on police last month, have left dozens of people dead.</p>
<p>Officials have also said an attack on March 1 at a train station in the southern city of Kunming, hundreds of miles outside Xinjiang, was carried out by Xinjiang separatists. That attack left 33 people dead, including four assailants who were killed by police.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013064&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, also a Putin ally, has warned that more sanctions could worsen the already tense situation in Crimea. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013065&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2013074" alt="(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rosneft-480.jpg" /> Oil Major Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin told the media that more sanctions means matter could get worse in Crimea. (Reuters)
<p>Expanding sanctions over Russia&#8217;s moves to annex Crimea would only make the situation worse, the head of state oil major Rosneft said at an event in Tokyo on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Moscow&#8217;s seizure of Crimea has caused the most serious East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War. The United States and the EU have imposed sanctions on a handful of officials from Russia and Ukraine accused of involvement in the action.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty in Moscow on Tuesday making Crimea part of Russia again, despite Ukrainian protests and the Western sanctions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking into expanding sanctions is something that will only make the conflict worse,&#8221; said Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin, a long-standing ally of Putin, during a panel discussion at a forum for investment between Japan and Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t help solve the problem and is unproductive.&#8221; The United States imposed visa bans and asset freezes on 11 Russians and Ukrainians on Monday, including four Russian lawmakers. The EU imposed the same punishments on 21 people.</p>
<p>Russian forces took control of the Black Sea peninsula in late February following the toppling of Moscow-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich by protests provoked by his decision to spurn a trade deal with the European Union last November and seek closer ties with Russia.</p>
<p>People in Crimea voted overwhelmingly in last weekend&#8217;s referendum to join Russia.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013065&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>Other countries near Russia could also face aggression if President Vladimir Putin is allowed to get away with his actions in Ukraine, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Clinton, a potential 2016 presidential contender, called Russia&#8217;s move to annex Crimea illegal and a violation of international law.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he&#8217;s allowed to get away with that, I think you&#8217;ll see a lot of other countries either directly facing Russian aggression or suborned with their political systems so that they are so intimidated that in effect they are transformed into vassals, not sovereign democracies,&#8221; Clinton said at an event hosted by the Board of Trade of Metropolitan Montreal at the Palais des Congres.</p>
<p>In response to a question about Ukraine, Clinton advocated a &#8220;two-track&#8221; approach toward resolving the crisis that included economic incentives and &#8220;standing up for our values.&#8221;</p>
<p>Along with sanctions against Russia, Clinton argued for increased financial and technical support for a democratic government in Kiev.</p>
<p>She also said Europe needs to be encouraged to find other energy sources so they aren&#8217;t dependent on Russian oil and gas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to be rattling sabers and all that. That&#8217;s not useful,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But people need to get moving in protecting themselves against future intimidation. It might take a year, it might take two years, but it needs to be slow and steady. And then once again people will see the difference, they will see the choices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clinton referred to the conflict as a &#8220;clash of values&#8221; and &#8220;an effort by Putin to rewrite the boundaries of post-World War II Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to stand up against illegal acts and we&#8217;re going to demonstrate that we have a better model, just like we did for 50 years. That takes continuity and persistence and it takes a consensus across the political spectrum in our country, certainly,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Clinton said she&#8217;s hopeful another Cold War can be avoided.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously nobody wants to see that. I think that&#8217;s primarily up to Putin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Clinton likened Putin&#8217;s actions on the Crimean Peninsula to those of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. She has also said he is a tough but thin-skinned leader who is squandering his country&#8217;s potential.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013007&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2012976" alt="People rally in support of Crimea joining Russia, with banners and portraits of Russian President Vladimir Putin, reading &quot;We are together,&quot; in Red Square in Moscow, Tuesday. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/putin-4802.jpg" /> People rally in support of Crimea joining Russia, with banners and portraits of Russian President Vladimir Putin, reading &#8220;We are together,&#8221; in Red Square in Moscow, Tuesday. (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Ukraine&#8217;s leadership simmered with a mix of hopelessness and anger at losing Crimea, tempering an influx of eager young men signing up as reservists with the growing certainty that no savior would deliver them from the Russian takeover.</span></p>
<div>
<p>For Ukraine&#8217;s government in Kiev, it is a crime — one the inexperienced leaders can do little do address in the face of an overwhelmingly superior military force. But for at least one of the group of people in the new leadership, it is a reality that must be dealt with on practical terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is theft on an international scale, when under the cover of troops, one country has just come and robbed a part of an independent state,&#8221; Ukraine&#8217;s Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said.</p>
<p>Yatsenyuk&#8217;s government now has to contend with the immediate complications of an armed confrontation that flared up Tuesday. A Ukrainian military spokesman said a serviceman was killed and another injured when a military facility in Crimea was stormed by armed men. The official said a truck bearing a Russian flag was used in the operation.</p>
<p>Yatsenyuk said the storming showed the dispute &#8220;has gone from the political stage to the military through the fault of the Russians.&#8221;</p>
<p>But if his rhetoric was combative, there was little to back it up. That is in part down to Ukraine&#8217;s relative helplessness and its stated desire to refrain from aggression, but is also a reflection of what authorities see as Moscow&#8217;s inflated demands. Rejecting international condemnation, Russian President Vladimir Putin cast his government&#8217;s actions as the righting of historic injustices.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are demanding to change the constitution, to change the system, to give up Crimea. This is the language of an aggressor &#8230; this is the language of Josef Stalin,&#8221; said Oleksiy Haran, a politics professor at the University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. &#8220;Ukraine has done everything which it can. We resisted from violence, which again the West demanded from us. We didn&#8217;t kill any Russian soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>While not recognising the referendum, Ukrainian authorities&#8217; preparations for the practicalities of the situation hint at a mood of resignation.</p>
<p>The justice minister offered emergency accommodation in vacation centers for any Ukrainian citizens who want to leave Crimea, where the ethnic Russian population is a majority.</p>
<p>&#8220;My advice to compatriots who live in Crimea is not to give up your Ukrainian passports. You are citizens of Ukraine and you are in effect hostages of the occupiers,&#8221; Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko told Channel 5 television. &#8220;People should make their own decision about revoking citizenship and nobody has the right to force them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s one major lever of power — the electricity and water that comes from the mainland — is complicated by the new Kiev government&#8217;s reluctance to alienate the residents, a majority of them ethnic Russians, but with large Ukrainian and Tatar communities.</p>
<p>With the outcome of the Crimean predicament still nominally in the balance, the government is confronting a growing clamor in eastern Ukraine, another heavily Russian-speaking part of the country, for secession or greater federalization. The claims of the ethnic Russian population ignited soon after the parliament that took center stage after last month&#8217;s ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych provoked outrage — from the Kremlin most notably — by moving to downgrade the role of the Russian language.</p>
<p>That plan has since been dropped and Yatsenyuk on Tuesday insisted that Russian would retain its official status in areas where it is spoken by the majority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody is encroaching on your right to freely use the Russian language. My wife Tereziya speaks primarily in Russian. And she, like millions of other Russian speakers, does not require protection from the Kremlin,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To deal with Moscow, Ukraine will need to restore channels of dialogue, which Russia is reluctant to do with a post-revolutionary government that it describes in the most disparaging terms.</p>
<p>Sergei Taruta, a billionaire businessman appointed by interim authorities to govern the heavily industrial Donetsk region, told The Associated Press that he has proposed the creation of a &#8220;national unity forum&#8221; as a possible solution to that problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should choose delegates that could lead diplomatic dialogue with Russia. Because as I understand it, there is no negotiator now that has a legitimate mandate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is only through a negotiation that we can solve the fraught problems that affect both Crimea and eastern Ukraine. And I think that this negotiating group should also work with a group of Western guarantors that could vouch for the territorial integrity of our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The government announced this week that it will over the coming 45 days mobilize tens of thousands of reservists. Recruitment officers stationed along a main street in the capital, Kiev, were signing up volunteers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At least one of the self-defense groups that came to prominence during the protests, Spilna Sprava, has intimated that it intends to ready for a fight as a partisan force.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the conditions of war with Russia, the regular army has shown itself to be insufficiently effective, which is something Ukraine&#8217;s army command has admitted,&#8221; Interfax news agency cited Spilna Sprava coordinator Alexander Danilyuk as saying.</p>
<p>On and around the Kiev square from which the protest movement sprung up, crude barricades remain in place and within them, groups of men young and old in store-bought fatigues mill around, sharing jokes and warming themselves by barrel fires.</p>
<p>The plan is for people on the Maidan, as the square is known, to stay until a new and elected government is formed and to ensure that it lives up to its promises.</p>
<p>Vasily Volchenko, a 51-year old retired career military officer manning a stall of knick-knacks memorializing the bloody protests that culminated in Yanukovych&#8217;s overthrow, said the loss of Crimea is not going down well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had hoped the government, even though it is only provisional, would react quickly, but they have done practically nothing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If they think they can give up Crimea that easily, then they are quite mistaken. We will just self-organize, because we are not giving up our Ukraine to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Ten days after a Malaysian jetliner disappeared, Thailand&#8217;s military said on Tuesday it saw radar blips that might have been from the missing plane but didn&#8217;t report it &#8220;because we did not pay attention to it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Search crews from 26 countries, including Thailand, are looking for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished early March 8 with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Frustration is growing among relatives of those on the plane at the lack of progress in the search.</p>
<p>Aircraft and ships are scouring two giant arcs of territory amounting to the size of Australia — half of it in the remote waters of the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/mh370-missing-background-checks-clear-chinese-nationals/" target="_blank">MH370 missing: Background checks clear Chinese nationals</a></p>
<p>Cmdr. William Marks, a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet, said finding the plane was like trying to locate a few people somewhere between New York and California.</p>
<p>Early in the search, Malaysian officials said they suspected the plane backtracked toward the Strait of Malacca, just west of Malaysia. But it took a week for them to confirm Malaysian military radar data suggesting that route.</p>
<p>Military officials in neighboring Thailand said Tuesday their own radar showed an unidentified plane, possibly Flight 370, flying toward the strait beginning minutes after the Malaysian jet&#8217;s transponder signal was lost.</p>
<p>Air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn said the Thai military doesn&#8217;t know whether the plane it detected was Flight 370.</p>
<p>Thailand&#8217;s failure to quickly share possible information about the plane may not substantially change what Malaysian officials now know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defense data. At a minimum, safety experts said, the radar data could have saved time and effort that was initially spent searching the South China Sea, many miles from the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tough to tell, but that is a material fact that I think would have mattered,&#8221; said John Goglia, a former member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just bizarre they didn&#8217;t come forward before,&#8221; Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consultancy Leeham Co., said of Thai authorities. &#8220;It may be too late to help the search &#8230; but maybe them and the Malaysian military should do joint military exercises in incompetence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. March 8 and its transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track it, ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m.</p>
<p>Montol said that at 1:28 a.m., Thai military radar &#8220;was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane,&#8221; back toward Kuala Lumpur. The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was infrequent and did not include data such as the flight number.</p>
<p>When asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, &#8220;Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country.&#8221; He said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia&#8217;s initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again,&#8221; Montol said. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The search area for the plane initially focused on the South China Sea. Pings that a satellite detected from the plane hours after its communications went down eventually led authorities to concentrate instead on two vast arcs — one into Central Asia and the other into the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Malaysia said over the weekend the loss of communications and change in the aircraft&#8217;s course were deliberate, whether it was the pilots or others aboard who were responsible.</p>
<p>Malaysian police are considering the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, but have yet to say what they have uncovered.</p>
<p>Investigators had pointed to a sequence of events in which two communications systems were disabled in succession — one of them before a voice from the cockpit gave an all-clear message to ground controllers — as evidence of a deliberate attempt to fly the plane off-course in a hard-to-detect way. On Monday, they backtracked on the timing of the first switch-off, saying it was possible that both were cut around the same time, leading to new speculation that some kind of sudden mechanical or electrical failure might explain the flight going off-course.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said some sort of problem aboard the plane was not out of the question, although he noted it still was intact enough to send a signal to a satellite several hours later.</p>
<p>As further confirmation that someone was still guiding the plane after it disappeared from civilian radar, airline pilots and aviation safety experts said an onboard computer called the flight management system would have to be deliberately programmed in order to follow the route taken by the plane as described by Malaysian authorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are going to fly the airplane to a waypoint that is not a straight &#8230; route to Beijing, and you were going to command the flight management computer and the autopilot system, you really have to know how to fly the airplane,&#8221; said John Gadzinski, a U.S. Boeing 737 captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were a basic flight student and I put you in an airborne 777 and gave you 20 minutes of coaching, I could have you turn the airplane left and right and the auto throttle and the autopilot would make the airplane do what you want,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But to program a waypoint into the flight management computer, if that is what they flew over, is a little bit harder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investigators have asked security agencies in countries with passengers on board to carry out background checks.</p>
<p>China said background checks of the 154 Chinese citizens on board turned up no links to terrorism, apparently ruling out the possibility that Uighur Muslim militants who have been blamed for terror attacks within China might have been involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;So far there is nothing, no evidence to suggest that they intended to do harm to the plane,&#8221; said Huang Huikang, China&#8217;s ambassador to Malaysia.</p>
<p>A Chinese civilian aviation official has said there was no sign of the plane entering the country&#8217;s airspace on commercial radar.</p>
<p>A group of relatives of Chinese passengers in Beijing said they decided to begin a hunger strike to express their anger over the handling of the investigation.</p>
<p>One relative displayed a sign reading, &#8220;Hunger strike protest. Respect life. Return my relative. Don&#8217;t want become victim of politics, Tell the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The search for the aircraft is among the largest in aviation history.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy said P-3 and P-8 surveillance aircraft were methodically sweeping over swaths of ocean, known as &#8220;mowing the grass,&#8221; while using radar to detect any debris in the water and high-resolution cameras to snap images.</p>
<p>Australian and Indonesian planes and ships are searching waters to the south of Indonesia&#8217;s Sumatra Island all the way down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Huang said China had begun searching for the plane in its territory, but gave no details. When asked at a Foreign Ministry briefing in Beijing what this search involved, ministry spokesman Hong Lei said only that satellites and radar were being used.</p>
<p>China also was sending ships to the Indian Ocean, where they will search 300,000 square kilometers (186,000 square miles) of sea.</p>
<p>The area being covered by the Australians is even bigger — 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) — and will take weeks, said John Young, manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority&#8217;s emergency response division.</p>
<p>&#8220;This search will be difficult. The sheer size of the search area poses a huge challenge,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;A needle in a haystack remains a good analogy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Britain&#8217;s Prime Minister David Cameron telephoned his Malaysian counterpart to offer the U.K.&#8217;s help in the first direct contact between the two since the flight disappeared, according to Downing Street.</p>
<p>Cameron did not offer specifics on what particular military or civilian assistance could be provided, the prime minister&#8217;s spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very much inviting any specific requests from the Malaysians,&#8221; Gray said. &#8220;Prime Minister Najib said he would think about that and let us know if they have any specific requests.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012937&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Hours after he thanked India for taking a “restrained and objective” stand on the Ukraine situation, Russian President Vladimir Putin called Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and expressed his gratitude Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>During the 20-minute telephone conversation, Singh thanked Putin for explaining the Russian position with regard to recent developments in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“He emphasised the consistent position India had on the issues of unity and territorial <span style="line-height:1.5em;">integrity of countries. Prime Minister expressed his hope that all sides would exercise restraint and work together constructively to find political and diplomatic solutions that protected the legitimate interests of all countries in the region and ensured long term peace and stability in Europe and beyond,” a Ministry of External Affairs statement said. </span></p>
<p>Behind Putin’s gratitude, it emerges, was National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon’s candid assessment that Russia’s interests were “legitimate” &#8211; as articulated during a March 6 briefing.</p>
<p>As the Russian President addressed a joint meeting of the Russian Parliament Tuesday on the occasion of Crimea’s “reunification” with Russia, he named China and India as the countries that showed understanding for Russia’s role in the Ukraine crisis.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to all those who understood our actions in Crimea,” Putin said. “We are grateful to the people of China, whose leadership sees the situation in Crimea in all its historical and political integrity. We highly appreciate India’s restraint and objectivity.”</p>
<p>South Block, which tracked Putin’s speech, pointed out to the NSA’s comments on the Ukraine situation about 12 days ago &#8211; perceived quite favourably by Moscow.</p>
<p>Responding to a question on March 6, Menon had said: “As far as we are concerned, we are watching what is happening in Ukraine with some concern. We would hope that whatever internal issues there are within Ukraine are settled peacefully and that the broader issues of reconciling the various interests involved, and there are after all legitimate Russian and other interests involved, are discussed, negotiated, and that there is a satisfactory resolution to them. But more than that, at this stage when everything is still fluid, I do not think we can tell you.”</p>
<p>In its statement on the same day, the MEA had linked the situation in Ukraine to the presence of 5,000 Indians in the country without qualifying Russia’s interests.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012825&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>BY: STEVEN LEE MYERS, ELLEN BARRY &amp; ALAN COWELL</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">President Vladimir V Putin claimed Crimea as a part of Russia on Tuesday, reversing what he described as a historic mistake made by the Soviet Union 60 years ago and brushing aside international condemnation that could leave Russia isolated for years to come.</span></p>
<p>Within minutes of delivering a passionate speech to Russia’s political elite, Putin cemented his pledge by signing a draft treaty with Crimean leaders to make the strategic Black Sea peninsula part of Russia. The events unfolded two days after Crimeans voted in a disputed referendum to break away from Ukraine. While the treaty signed Tuesday still needs parliamentary approval, that is regarded as a formality.</p>
<p>“Crimea has always been an integral part of Russia in the hearts and minds of people,” Putin declared in his address, delivered in the chandeliered St George’s Hall in the Grand Kremlin Palace <span style="line-height:1.5em;">before hundreds of members of Parliament, governors and others.</span></p>
<p>His remarks, which lasted 47 minutes, were interrupted repeatedly by thunderous applause, standing ovations and at the end chants of “Russia, Russia”. Some in the audience wiped tears from their eyes.</p>
<p>Reaching deep into Russian and Soviet history, Putin said he did not seek to divide Ukraine any further, but vowed that he would protect Russia’s national security from what he described as Western, and particularly American, actions that had left Russia feeling cornered.</p>
<p>He spoke as he has often in the past of the humiliations Russia has suffered in a world with one dominant superpower — from the NATO air war in Kosovo in 1999 against Moscow’s Serbian allies to the one in Libya that toppled Col. Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 on what he called the false pretence of a humanitarian intervention.</p>
<p>He dipped into deep wells of emotion, starting with the 10th century baptism of Prince Vladimir, whose conversion to Orthodox Christianity transformed the kingdom then known as Rus, to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which left many Russians of his generation feeling that they had been stripped of their nation overnight.</p>
<p>“Millions of Russians went to bed in one country and woke up abroad,” he said. “Overnight, they were minorities in the former Soviet republics, and the Russian people became one of the biggest — if not the biggest — divided nation in the world.</p>
<p>“They cheated us again and again, made decisions behind our back, presenting us with completed facts,” he said of the West. “That’s the way it was with the expansion of NATO in the east, with the deployment of military infrastructure at our borders. They always told us the same thing: ‘Well, this doesn’t involve you.’ “</p>
<p>Western reaction was swift. The White House condemned the move, which it said it would not recognize. Britain’s foreign secretary, William Hague, told Parliament on Tuesday that the crisis in Ukraine “is the most serious test of European security in the 21st century so far.”</p>
<p>“No amount of sham and perverse democratic process or skewed historical references can make up for the fact that this is an incursion into a sovereign state and a land grab of part of its territory with no respect for the law of that country or for international law,” he said.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel firmly rejected Moscow’s absorption of Crimea, a position she said was widely supported by international organizations including the United Nations and the European Council.</p>
<p>“The so-called referendum breached international law, the declaration of independence which the Russian president accepted yesterday was against international law, and the absorption into the Russian Federation is, in our firm opinion, also against international law,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin.</p>
<p>(In Paris, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said Russia had been suspended from the G8 because of the Crimean annexation, wire agencies reported. Russia has the G8’s rotating leadership currently, and Putin was scheduled to host President Barack Obama and other leaders of the group in Sochi in June.</p>
<p>“Concerning the G8&#8230; we decided to suspend Russia’s participation, and it is envisaged that all the other countries, the seven leading countries, will unite without Russia,” Fabius said on Europe-1 radio.)</p>
<p>Putin brushed aside concerns about economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation, saying the West had forced Russia’s hand. By supporting the political uprising that toppled Ukraine’s president, Viktor F Yanukovych, the US and Europe crossed “a red line,” he said, forcing him to act to protect Crimea’s population from what he called “Russophobes and neo-Nazis” that had seized control in an illegal coup abetted by foreigners.</p>
<p>“If you press a spring too hard,” he said, “it will recoil.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/crimea5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012736" alt="People at a rally in support of Crimea joining Russia, celebrate holding Russian flags at Red Square in Moscow Tuesday.

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The United States is considering sending troops for war games in the Baltic states bordering Russia, Vice-President Joe Biden said Tuesday in an effort to reassure NATO allies alarmed at the Kremlin’s intervention in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p>Moscow’s despatch of troops to Ukraine’s Crimea region and its unilateral declaration that the area is now part of Russia have left NATO member states in eastern Europe worried that they could be next in line.</p>
<p>In the Polish capital on the first leg of a two-day trip to the region, Biden condemned Russia’s actions in Crimea as a land grab, and he said NATO’s commitment to protect any of its members from attack was unwavering.</p>
<p>He also said the United States would work on reducing the dependence of eastern European states on imported Russian fuel, a relationship that, US officials say, the Kremlin uses as a tool of political influence.</p>
<p>Biden’s suggestion of sending US troops for military exercises in the Baltics, if it is implemented, would represent the strongest concrete evidence to date of Washington’s resolve in backing up its NATO allies on Russia’s doorstep.</p>
<p>“We are exploring a number of additional steps to increase the pace and scope of our military cooperation including rotating US forces to the Baltic region to conduct ground and naval exercises and training missions,” Biden told reporters after talks with Estonian President Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who was visiting Warsaw.</p>
<p>Earlier, at a briefing alongside Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Biden described Russia’s actions as an assault on Ukraine’s sovereignty and a violation of international law.</p>
<p>“Russia has offered a variety of arguments to justify what is nothing more than a land grab,” Biden said. “But the world has seen through Russia’s actions and rejected the logic, the flawed logic, behind those actions.”</p>
<p>Russia said it sent troops to Crimea to protect Russian residents, who it said were in danger in the unrest that followed toppling of Ukraine’s pro-Russian president. A referendum in Crimea Sunday backed union with Russia, though the West called that vote a Moscow-orchestrated sham.</p>
<p>Biden said the events in Crimea were a reminder to NATO members that they need to stand together.<br />
The three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, are in NATO and the EU. Yet they are particularly vulnerable to any Russian action. They are small, they depend on Russia for energy and trade, and they have sizeable Russian-speaking minorities.</p>
<p><strong>Gorbachev: Crimean vote ‘happy event’</strong></p>
<p>MOSCOW: Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has hailed Crimea’s vote to join Russia as a “happy event”. Gorbachev said in remarks carried Tuesday by online newspaper Slon.ru that the vote offered the Crimean residents the freedom of choice and justly reflected their will. He said Sunday’s referendum showed that “people really wanted to return to Russia” and was a “happy event”. Gorbachev added that the Crimean referendum has set an example for people in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, who also should decide their fate. Gorbachev, who resigned as the Soviet president on Christmas Day 1991, has voiced regret that he was unable to stem the Soviet Union’s collapse. He has criticized President Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian policy, but said Tuesday that he supports his course in the Ukrainian crisis. AP</p>
<p><strong>Ukraine threatens to seize Russian assets</strong></p>
<p>Kiev: Ukraine ratcheted up its stand-off with the Kremlin Tuesday by threatening to nationalise Russian property in response to Crimea’s claims to its own assets in the breakaway Black Sea peninsula. Ukraine’s Justice Minister Pavlo Petrenko called the measures illegal and warned Russia that it faced reprisals should it back Crimea’s moves. “If the Russian Federation officially recognises (Crimea’s) actions, then Ukraine reserves the right to take adequate steps to compensate these losses at the expense of property belonging to the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine and in other states,” Petrenko said. “We are going to do this in strict accordance with Ukrainian and international law.” PTI</p>
<p><strong>PUTIN SPEAK</strong></p>
<p><strong>ON CRIMEA</strong></p>
<p>“It was impossible to imagine that Ukraine and Russia could not be together. That they could be in separate states. But that is what happened. What seemed impossible, unfortunately occurred. The USSR broke up. The events happened so fast that few citizens understood the full-scale of the trauma of the events and their consequences.”</p>
<p>“Millions of Russians went to sleep in one country and woke up in a foreign country &#8211; part became ethnic minorities in former Soviet republics. One of the most divided people on earth. Today, after many years, I heard how Crimeans not long ago said that in the 1990s they were passed from hand to hand like sacks of potatoes.”</p>
<p>“The (Crimean) issue has a vital importance, a historic importance for all of us &#8230; In the hearts and minds of people, Crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of Russia.”</p>
<p><strong>ON UKRAINE</strong></p>
<p>“Our souls are aching over what is happening in Ukraine. We are one people. We simply cannot exist without one another.”</p>
<p>“Don’t believe those who try to frighten you with Russia and who scream that other (Ukrainian) regions will follow after Crimea. We do not want a partition of Ukraine, we do not need this.”</p>
<p>“Relations with Ukraine, the brotherly Ukrainian people, have always been, remain and will always be the most important and key for us, without any exaggeration.”</p>
<p><strong>ON THE WEST</strong></p>
<p>“Western partners, led by the United States, prefer not to be guided by international law in their practical policies, but by the rule of the gun &#8230; They have come to believe in their exceptionalism and their sense of being the chosen ones. That they can decide the destiny of the world, that it is only them who can be right.”</p>
<p>“In the case of Ukraine, our Western partners have crossed the line, have behaved themselves in a rude, irresponsible and unprofessional manner.”</p>
<p>“Some Western politicians are already trying to frighten us not only with sanctions but with the prospect of worsening internal problems&#8230;”</p>
<p>“We will never ourselves aim at confrontation with our partners neither in the East, nor in the West.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012730&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The husband of a passenger from Pune on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight is desperate for news of his wife and grapples every day with conspiracy theories. “Our brains are not working anymore. Only our hearts are. My heart is praying that my wife, mother of my children, comes back,” said Pralhad Shirsath, husband of Kranti Shirsath who was on flight MH370. </span></p>
<p>Pralhad Tuesday forwarded a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh requesting full support for operations to locate the plane.</p>
<p>“There are so many theories. Newspapers and websites come up with theories and the authorities deny it. The media needs to cross-check before sending out speculative stories,” he says.</p>
<p>In his desperation, he hopes the hijack theory is correct, so that he would be sure his wife is still alive. “Yes there are a lot of hijack and other theories. I hope all positive theories are true. That means she will come back eventually,” said Pralhad.</p>
<p>Pralhad has written to PM via the Indian High Commissioner in Malaysia. The mail says, “My wife Kranti Shirsath was on this flight. It is 11days since the flight disappeared. My sons Rahul (16) and Yashwant (11) are desperately waiting to hear news on Kranti’s whereabouts. I have been working for NGOs in India and abroad for the last 18 years helping poor and disadvantaged people&#8230;At the critical moment we beg you and our government to help expedite search and rescue of my wife and all other passengers. We are desperate. I request you to do all in your powers to search and rescue my wife and other passengers.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012694&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Putin said  Russia did not want to move into other regions of Ukraine.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012533&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2012538" alt="putin" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/putin.jpg" /> Putin signed an order “to approve the draft treaty between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Crimea on adopting the Republic of Crimea into the Russian Federation”. (Reuters)
<p>With a historic sweep of his pen, President Vladimir Putin signed a treaty on Tuesday to annex Crimea, describing the move as correcting past injustice and a necessary response to what he called Western encroachment upon Russia’s vital interests.</p>
<p>In a 40-minute speech televised live from the Kremlin, Putin said “in people’s hearts and minds, Crimea has always been an integral part of Russia”.</p>
<p>He dismissed Western criticism of Sunday’s Crimean referendum — in which residents of the strategic Black Sea peninsula overwhelmingly backed breaking off from Ukraine and joining Russia — as a manifestation of the West’s double standards.</p>
<p>At the same time, Putin said  Russia did not want to move into other regions of Ukraine: “We don’t want division of Ukraine.” Thousands of Russian troops have been massed along Ukraine’s eastern border for the last few weeks — Russia says that was for military training while the US and Europe view the troops as an intimidation tactic.</p>
<p>In Paris, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said Russia had been suspended from the G8 because of the Crimean annexation. Russia has the G8’s rotating leadership currently, and Putin was scheduled to host President Barack Obama and other leaders of the group in Sochi in June.</p>
<p>“Concerning the G8&#8230; we decided to suspend Russia’s participation, and it is envisaged that all the other countries, the seven leading countries, will unite without Russia,” Fabius said on Europe-1 radio.</p>
<p>Britain’s foreign Office said Russia was still part of the G8, even though a suspension was not ruled out. British foreign secretary William Hague said Putin had chosen “the route of isolation, denying the citizens of his own country, and of Crimea, partnership with the international community and full membership of a range of international organisations”, and that it was now highly likely that other G8 countries would want to meet without Russia.</p>
<p>Tokyo and Berlin said they were not aware of a decision to suspend Moscow.</p>
<p>In Kiev, the Ukrainian government said it did not recognise the treaty signed in Moscow. “The signing of the so-called agreement on Crimea joining the Russian Federation and the corresponding address by the Russian president has nothing in common with law or democracy or common sense,” foreign ministry spokesman Evhen Perebynis said on Twitter.</p>
<p>“Putin’s address very clearly demonstrates just how real the threat is that Russia poses to international security and international security,” he said.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Kremlin’s white-and-gold St George Hall on the other hand, Putin cast the post-Yanukovych Ukrainian government as illegitimate, driven by radical “nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and anti-Semites”.</p>
<p>He said the rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine had been abused by the new Ukrainian government. He insisted that Crimea’s vote to join Russia was in line with international law and reflected its right for self-determination.</p>
<p>To back his claim, Putin pointed to Kosovo’s independence bid from Serbia — supported by the West and opposed by Russia — and said that Crimea’s secession from Ukraine repeats Ukraine’s own secession from the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>The speech came hours after Putin approved a draft bill for the annexation of Crimea, and was followed by the Russian president signing a treaty with Crimean officials for the Black Sea region to join Russia.</p>
<p>The treaty will now have to be endorsed by Russia’s constitutional court and ratified by both houses of parliament. Valentina Matviyenko, speaker of the upper house of parliament, said the procedure could be completed by the end of the week.</p>
<p>Crimea had been part of Russia since the 18th century until Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred it to Ukraine in 1954. Both Russians and Crimea’s majority ethnic Russian population see the annexation as correcting a historic insult.</p>
<p>The US and European Union on Monday announced asset freezes and other sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian officials involved in the Crimean crisis. President Barack Obama warned that more would come if Russia didn’t stop interfering in Ukraine.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Russian state Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, unanimously passed a resolution condemning US sanctions targeting Russian officials including members of the chamber. The chamber challenged Obama to extend the sanctions to all the 353 deputies who voted for Tuesday’s resolution, suggesting that being targeted was a badge of honour. Eighty-eight deputies left the house before the vote.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mp-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012613 " alt="" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mp-med.jpg" /></a> With only its own radar to go on, it took Malaysia a week to confirm that Flight 370 had entered the strait, an important detail that led it to change its search strategy. (AP)
<p>Thailand&#8217;s military said on Tuesday that its radar detected a plane that may have been Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 just minutes after the jetliner&#8217;s communications went down, and that it didn&#8217;t share the information with Malaysia earlier because it wasn&#8217;t specifically asked for it.</p>
<p>A twisting flight path described on Tuesday that Thai air force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Suchookorn took the plane to the Strait of Malacca, which is where Malaysian radar tracked Flight 370 early March 8. But Montol said the Thai military did not know whether it detected the same plane.</p>
<p>Thailand&#8217;s failure to quickly share possible information regarding the fate of the plane, and the 239 people aboard it, may not substantially change what Malaysian officials know, but it raises questions about the degree to which some countries are sharing their defense information, even in the name of an urgent and mind-bending aviation mystery.</p>
<p>With only its own radar to go on, it took Malaysia a week to confirm that Flight 370 had entered the strait, an important detail that led it to change its search strategy.</p>
<p>When asked why it took so long to release the information, Montol said, &#8220;Because we did not pay any attention to it. The Royal Thai Air Force only looks after any threats against our country, so anything that did not look like a threat to us, we simply look at it without taking actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the plane never entered Thai airspace and that Malaysia&#8217;s initial request for information in the early days of the search was not specific.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they asked again and there was new information and assumptions from (Malaysian) Prime Minister Najib Razak, we took a look at our information again,&#8221; Montol said. &#8220;It didn&#8217;t take long for us to figure out, although it did take some experts to find out about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. Malaysian time and its transponder, which allows air traffic controllers to identify and track the airplane, ceased communicating at 1:20 a.m.  Montol said that at 1:28 a.m., &#8220;Thai military radar was able to detect a signal, which was not a normal signal, of a plane flying in the direction opposite from the MH370 plane,&#8221; back toward Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>The plane later turned right, toward Butterworth, a Malaysian city along the Strait of Malacca. The radar signal was infrequent and did not include any data such as the flight number. He said he didn&#8217;t know exactly when Thai radar last detected the plane. Malaysian officials have said Flight 370 was last detected by their own military radar at 2:14 a.m.</p>
<p>The search area for the plane initially focused on the South China Sea, where ships and planes spent a week searching. Pings that a satellite detected from the plane hours after its communications went down have led authorities to concentrate instead on two vast arcs, one into central Asia and the other into the Indian Ocean , that together cover an expanse as big as Australia.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012584&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

And if that is the case, whose interests are being served?"<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012591&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mp-ist.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012605" alt="mp-ist" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mp-ist.jpg?w=480&#038;h=275" width="480" height="275" /></a></p>
<p>There were 12 crew and 227 passengers on the Malaysia Airlines jet that disappeared about 40 minutes into a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8. They were from far-flung parts of the world: 14 nationalities that included New Zealanders, Iranians, Americans and Indonesians. Two thirds of the passengers were from China. These are the stories of some of those on board.</p>
<p><strong>Experienced Captain </strong></p>
<p>The flight&#8217;s pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had more than 18,000 hours of flight experience. People who knew Zaharie from his involvement in opposition political circles in Malaysia and other areas of his life described him as sociable, humble, caring and dedicated to his job.</p>
<p>His Facebook page showed an aviation enthusiast who built his own flight simulator at home and flew remote-controlled aircraft, posting pictures of his collection, which included a lightweight twin-engine helicopter and an amphibious aircraft.</p>
<p>Born in northern Penang state, the captain and grandfather was an enthusiastic handyman and proud home cook.  As part of what he called &#8220;community service,&#8221; he had posted several YouTube videos including how to make air conditioners more efficient to cut electricity bills, how to waterproof window panes, and how to repair a refrigerator icemaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Likes&#8221; and other activity on Zaharie&#8217;s YouTube account showed approval of atheist views, an unusual admission in predominantly Muslim Malaysia.</p>
<p><strong>Cockpit Controversy</strong></p>
<p>Described by the imam of his local mosque as a &#8220;good boy&#8221; and by neighbors as pious, co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid was dubbed a playboy by foreign media after the revelation he and another pilot invited two women boarding their aircraft to sit in the cockpit for an international flight in 2011. During the journey, the pilots smoked and flirted, one of the women, South African Jonti Roos, said in an interview broadcast by Australia&#8217;s Nine Network.</p>
<p>Fariq, 27, was filmed recently by a crew from &#8220;CNN Business Traveler,&#8221; and reporter Richard Quest described the experience as a perfect landing of a Boeing 777-200, the same model as the plane that vanished. An online tribute page to the pilots shows a photo of Fariq in the cockpit with Quest, both smiling.</p>
<p>Fariq, however, was new to the 777 and had 2,763 flight hours overall.</p>
<p>Neighbor Ayop Jantan said he had heard that Fariq was engaged and planning his wedding. The eldest of five children, Fariq&#8217;s professional achievements were a source of pride for his father, Ayop said.<br />
<strong> </strong><br />
<strong>Destination North Korea</strong></p>
<p>Chemistry lecturer Kranti Shirsath was on her way to North Korea via Beijing to visit her husband Prahlad, who was close to completing a three-year contract with nonprofit group Concern Worldwide. She was planning to help him pack for the move home to India, where she lived with the couple&#8217;s two sons in the western city of Pune.</p>
<p>Over the past 17 years, the couple lived in many countries, including Afghanistan and Tajikistan, as Prahlad took assignments with different NGOs. But she stayed behind with the children when he took up the post in North Korea&#8217;s capital Pyongyang.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mp-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012604" alt="mp-3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mp-3.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>Prahlad was among family members who traveled to Kuala Lumpur after hearing that the plane had gone missing. After spending four fruitless days in Kuala Lumpur, Prahlad has returned to Pune to be with his sons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apart from no news of the aircraft, what is even more painful are the conspiracy theories,&#8221; Prahlad Shirsath told reporters in Pune.</p>
<p><strong>Feted Calligrapher</strong></p>
<p>Prize-winning calligrapher Meng Gaosheng, 64, was leading a delegation of two dozen artists to Malaysia for a three-day exhibition titled &#8220;The China Dream, An Ode to Colors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meng&#8217;s works are among the collections on display in major tourist spots in Beijing such as Mao Zedong&#8217;s memorial hall and mausoleum and the Great Hall of the People.</p>
<p>In Kuala Lumpur, Meng spent most of his time with the artists at the exhibition. On the day before their departure, however, the artists toured well-known sites in the city that included the royal palace and the Petronas Twin Towers, which are Malaysia&#8217;s tallest buildings.</p>
<p>According to Xu Lipu, an artist who was on the trip but took another flight back to China, Meng was a knowledgeable artist and was happy to share his thoughts on artistic theory with the others. Meng was always encouraging the other artists by praising them and their work, Xu said.</p>
<p><strong>Retired civil servant, passionate artist</strong></p>
<p>Wang Linshi, 69, worked for the Chinese government in the eastern city of Nanjing until he retired, but his passion was painting, in particular chickens and roosters, according to son Wang Zhen. The elder Wang was traveling with Meng Gaosheng&#8217;s group.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-med1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012601" alt="plane-med" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-med1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I remember that when I was a child, my father raised chickens to watch how they behave in order to draw them,&#8221; Wang Zhen said.</p>
<p>Wang Linshi&#8217;s wife Xiong Deming, 63, also traveled with the group. Wang Zhen described his mother as sweet and thoughtful, someone who was always looking out for him and was also kind to his new wife.</p>
<p>Wang Zhen, an engineer, said that since he got married a year ago, his parents have made it their mission to encourage him and his wife to have a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have wanted us to bear them a grandchild. They didn&#8217;t care if the child was a boy or a girl, as long as they had a grandchild,&#8221; said Wang.</p>
<p>The last time he heard from his father was when they exchanged mobile text messages when his father was at Kuala Lumpur&#8217;s international airport. Wang had messaged his father to ask him how things were going. &#8220;The trip was quite successful. We&#8217;ll be back tomorrow evening. A bit too busy to talk now, &#8221; was Wang&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p><strong>Last work trip to China</strong></p>
<p>Philip Wood&#8217;s family saw him in Texas before what was meant to be his last work trip to China as an executive for IBM. The 50-year-old Wood had recently earned his certification for scuba diving, one of the ways in which he satisfied his craving for adventure.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mp1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012602" alt="mp1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mp1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=257" width="480" height="257" /></a></p>
<p>Wood&#8217;s family continues to track the twists and turns of the investigation at home in Keller, Texas, a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth. His youngest brother, James, said on Monday that the family continues to pray, though they are realistic about Philip&#8217;s chances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our faith isn&#8217;t that he&#8217;s going to come back home safe, even though that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re hoping for,&#8221; James Wood said. &#8220;Our faith is everything is going to be OK.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wood had been working in Beijing for the past two years and was making his last work trip to China, via Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>James Wood said his brother was an adventurous person who loved to travel and see new places, one of the things he loved about his job. He was divorced and has two grown children, one of whom attends Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can honestly say he&#8217;s one person who&#8217;s lived his life to the fullest,&#8221; said James Wood.</p>
<p><strong>First trip abroad</strong></p>
<p>Maimaitijiang Abula, a 34-year-old art teacher from China&#8217;s far west Xinjiang region, home to China&#8217;s Turkic-speaking Uighur ethnic minority, was abroad for the first time and part of the group of painters and calligraphers in Malaysia for an exhibition.</p>
<p>His close friend, Yimamu&#8217;aishanjiang, told the Chinese magazine Nanfang People Weekly that the artist had confided in him that he aspired to be a master at painting in the style of realism.</p>
<p>Maimaitijiang was overjoyed by the accolades he received in Malaysia: he won an award, was interviewed by a Malaysian TV station and had one of his paintings curated by a gallery, the friend told the magazine.</p>
<p>Another friend Aiyin Abudu told the magazine that Maimaitijiang began drawing at age 6 and wishes that &#8220;the whole world can know about Xinjiang through his works.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moments before he boarded flight 370, Maimaitijiang called his friend Yimamu&#8217;aishanjiang. &#8220;How are you guys?&#8221; Maimaitijiang asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all at the school, waiting for your return,&#8221; the friend said.<br />

<strong>New job in Mangolia</strong></p>
<p>Paul Weeks, a 39-year-old mechanical engineer and New Zealand national was on his way to a new job in Mongolia. He planned to return as often as possible to his home in the Western Australia city of Perth, where he left his wife and two young sons.</p>
<p>Before he left, he handed his wedding ring and watch to his wife, Danica, for safekeeping, and told her to pass it down to his two sons, 3-year-old Lincoln and 11-month-old Jack, should anything happen to him.</p>
<p>Danica Weeks said Tuesday that she was &#8220;surviving,&#8221; but was too upset to say anything further.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post the day after the plane vanished, she wrote: &#8220;in a place I never wanted to be, trying to gather strength for my two beautiful boys, miss my darling with all my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paul Weeks was interviewed by New Zealand&#8217;s The Press newspaper in 2012 about his decision to move his family to Australia from the southern New Zealand city of Christchurch, which was devastated by an earthquake the previous year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider our move to Australia to be one of necessity, rather than by choice, as we were content starting a family in Christchurch,&#8221; Weeks told The Press.</p>
<p><strong>Aviation engineeer</strong></p>
<p>Mohamad Khairul Amri Selamat, 29, an aviation engineer with a private jet charter company and father of a 15-month-old daughter, was traveling to Beijing for work. His presence on the flight has drawn scrutiny after Malaysian authorities said they believed the plane&#8217;s course change and the severing of automated communications were deliberate.</p>
<p>Mohamed Khairul had recently moved into a new house in a suburb outside Kuala Lumpur and his family was planning to visit him this month when he returned from Beijing, said his father Selamat Omar.</p>
<p>Khairul called his father on the evening of March 6 to let him know about the trip and ask about his health as Selamat said he is diabetic.</p>
<p>&#8220;People can talk but I know my son. It is impossible for him to be involved in something like this,&#8221; Selamat said. &#8220;I am praying hard that the plane didn&#8217;t crash and he will be back soon.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Always called twice</strong></p>
<p>Chandrika Sharma always called her mother twice before traveling.</p>
<p>The first call is to tell her about the trip and to ask if she needed anything. The second call is to say she was at the airport and getting ready to fly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This time too, Chandrika called me before leaving to remind me to take my medicines,&#8221; said 88-year-old Shakuntala Sharma, recalling her last conversation with her daughter late on Mar. 7 before the flight took off.</p>
<p>An NGO worker who was director of the International Collective in Support of Fishworkers, Chandrika was en route to Mongolia for a conference. Chandrika had always been concerned with the &#8220;poor and the powerless in society,&#8221; her mother said.</p>
<p>She is married with a daughter, a university student studying in the Indian capital.</p>
<p>Chandrika&#8217;s husband, K.S. Narendran, a management consultant in Chennai, puzzled over how the plane could have simply vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;One is left with a creeping suspicion that there is more to it than what is being shared. And if that is the case, whose interests are being served?&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012591&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>France&#8217;s foreign minister says that leaders of the Group of Eight world powers have suspended Russia&#8217;s participation in the club amid tensions over Ukraine and Russia&#8217;s incursion into Crimea.</p>
<p>The other seven members of the group had already suspended preparations for a G8 summit that Russia is scheduled to host in June in Sochi.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s Laurent Fabius went further today, saying on Europe-1 radio that &#8220;concerning the G8 &#8230; we decided to suspend Russia&#8217;s participati ..</p>
<p><strong>Will retaliate against EU sanctions: Russia</strong></p>
<p>Russia sharply criticised the European Union on Tuesday for imposing sanctions on Russian officials and lawmakers involved in efforts to make Crimea part of Russia, and said it will retaliate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Attempts to speak to Russia in the language of force and threaten Russian citizens with sanctions will lead nowhere,&#8221; the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The adoption of restrictive measures is not our choice; however, it is clear that the imposition of sanctions against us will not go without an adequate response from the Russian side.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Ukraine does not recognise treaty</strong></p>
<p>Ukraine does not recognise a treaty signed in Moscow on Tuesday making its Crimean peninsula a part of Russia, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The signing of the so-called agreement on Crimea joining the Russian Federation and the corresponding address by the Russian president has nothing in common with law or democracy or common sense,&#8221; ministry spokesman Evhen Perebynis said on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Putin&#8217;s address very clearly demonstrates just how real the threat is that Russia poses to international security and international security,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Putin has chosen path to Russia&#8217;s isolation: Britain</strong></p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin has chosen the path to Russia&#8217;s isolation by moving to annex Ukraine&#8217;s Crimea region, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was regrettable to hear President Putin choosing the route of isolation, denying the citizens of his own country, and of Crimea, partnership with the international community and full membership of a range of international organisations,&#8221; Hague said in a statement to parliament.</p>
<p>Hague also said there was grave danger that a provocation elsewhere in Ukraine could be used as a pretext for a further military escalation. He said that it was highly likely that other G8 countries would now want to meet without Russia.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rape-medium.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012570" alt="RAPE-MEDIUM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rape-medium.jpg" /></a> The girl submitted an application to the police and an FIR of kidnap and rape has been registered.
<p>A Pakistani girl was allegedly kidnapped, forcibly married twice before being gangraped and stripped naked to avenge her brother&#8217;s elopement with a woman from the same village in Punjab province.</p>
<p>Sanaullah, 22, had allegedly eloped with the daughter of a man, who belongs to the Mallah caste, of the same village in Chiniot district after the families refused to marry them.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s family called a Panchayat which ruled that Sanaullah&#8217;s sister would have to marry Zahid Ali, brother of the girl who had eloped, the Dawn daily reported today.</p>
<p>After the decision of Panchayat, accomplices of Zahid kidnapped Sanaullah&#8217;s sister from her house, held &#8216;nikah&#8217; with her and divorced her after five days, the report said.</p>
<p>Later, the victim was forcibly married to Zahid&#8217;s cousin Noor Ahmad.</p>
<p>Some days later, four members of Zahid&#8217;s family gangraped her and subjected her to torture.</p>
<p>&#8220;They stripped her naked, tied her with a tree in the village and called her parents to get their daughter back in return for their girl. The family got her back a month after her alleged kidnapping,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The girl approached the Magistrate at Lalian tehsil who ordered her medical examination and registration of case.</p>
<p>Chiniot District Police Officer Munir Zia said a Panchayat had forced the victim to marry Zahid to avenge the act of her brother in February but neither she nor her family approached the police for registering a case.</p>
<p>The girl submitted an application to the police yesterday and an FIR of kidnap and rape has been registered.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012557&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2012502 " alt="(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/5823f7f7695dd886e22102d3fe25.jpg" /> Violence had erupted in Bangkok in February demanding the ouster of Prime Minister Yingluck which led to a 60 day emergency period . (PTI)
<p>Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra Tuesday lifted a nearly two-month-old emergency in Bangkok and surrounding areas and replaced it with a security law after political violence against her government eased.</p>
<p>The Cabinet lifted the state of emergency and enforced the Internal Security Act (ISA). Department of Special Investigation Chief Tarit Pengdith, a member of the Centre for Maintaining Peace and Order, said the ISA enforcement will continue till April 30.</p>
<p>For the past few months the CMPO, formed by the Yingluck government, had been handling the protests. On January 22, the Shinawatra-led caretaker government imposed a state of emergency for 60 days to quell protests.</p>
<p>The emergency was due to expire on March 22. The emergency had expanded the power of security forces to issue orders and search, arrest and detain people.</p>
<p>Tarit said the caretaker prime minister and defence minister Yingluck will have to set up a new agency to replace the CMPO to enforce the ISA to maintain security.</p>
<p>But caretaker Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Surapong Towichukchaikul said the government would continue to use the same CMPO structure to enforce the ISA.</p>
<p>Violence had erupted in Bangkok and other parts of the country ahead and during the February 2 snap polls, boycotted by main opposition Democrat Party demanding the ouster of Prime Minister Yingluck.</p>
<p>Twenty-three people have been killed and over 700 injured in the political conflict since November.</p>
<p>Surapong Tovichakchaikul, chief advisor to the government&#8217;s Centre for Maintaining Peace and Order (CMPO) which has been set up to handle anti-government protests, had yesterday said the body will ask for the state of emergency to be lifted.</p>
<p>Thailand has been in a political crisis since mass rallies began in November. The protesters are demanding an unelected People&#8217;s Council to replace the Yingluck regime.</p>
<p>Opposition-backed protesters had blocked polling in several opposition stronghold provinces and in some parts of Bangkok on February 2 and during advance polling on January 26.</p>
<p>The protesters accuse Yingluck of acting as a proxy for her fugitive brother, former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup in 2006. He lives in self-exile in Dubai to escape a jail term on a corruption conviction.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012483&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-med.jpg" /></a> Flight MH370 vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia&#8217;s east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. (AP)
<p>China deployed 21 satellites to scour its territory for a missing Malaysian jetliner, while Australia said it had drastically narrowed its sector of the search area but was still looking in an expanse of ocean the size of Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Malaysia said on Tuesday it had conferred with the U.S. and Chinese ministers on the search for Malaysian Airlines  Flight MH370, an unprecedented 26-nation operation that now spans Asia from the Caspian Sea to the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Investigators are convinced that someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation diverted the jet, carrying 12 crew and 227 mainly Chinese passengers, perhaps thousands of miles off its scheduled course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
<p>But intensive background checks of everyone aboard have so far failed to find anyone with a known political or criminal motive to crash or hijack the plane, Western security sources and Chinese authorities said.</p>
<p>China has begun to search for MH370 in Chinese territory, which falls within the northern search corridor, said state news agency Xinhua, and Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news conference that 21 satellites were involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;In accordance with Malaysia&#8217;s request, we are mobilising satellites and radar to search over the Chinese section of the northern corridor which the Malaysians say the plane may have flown over,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Australia, which is leading the southernmost leg of the search, said it had shrunk its search field based on satellite tracking data and analysis of weather and currents, but that it still covered 600,000 sq km (230,000 sq miles).</p>
<p>&#8220;A needle in a haystack remains a good analogy,&#8221; John Young, general manager of the emergency response division of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aircraft could have gone north or south, and if it went south, this is AMSA&#8217;s best estimate of where we should look with the few resources we have at our disposal for such a search.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Still loooking for motive</strong></p>
<p>China&#8217;s ambassador to Malaysia said his country had carried out a detailed probe into its nationals aboard the flight, which vanished on March 8, and could rule out their involvement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The probe into the incident&#8217;s cause is not suitable to be conducted in a high-profile way,&#8221; Ambassador Huang Huikang said, state television said on one of its official microblogs.</p>
<p>U.S. and European security sources said efforts by various governments to investigate the backgrounds of everyone on the flight had not, as of Monday, turned up links to militant groups or anything else that could explain the jet&#8217;s disappearance.</p>
<p>An European diplomat in Kuala Lumpur also said trawls through the passenger manifest had come up blank.</p>
<p>One source familiar with U.S. inquiries said the pilots were being studied because of the technical knowledge needed to disable the aircraft&#8217;s communications systems.</p>
<p>Malaysian officials said on Monday that suicide by the pilot or co-pilot was a line of inquiry, although they stressed that it was only one of the possibilities under investigation.</p>
<p>Flight MH370 vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia&#8217;s east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Investigators piecing together patchy data from military radar and satellites believe that someone turned off the aircraft&#8217;s identifying transponder and ACARS system, which transmits maintenance data, and turned west, crossing the Malay Peninsula and following a commercial aviation route towards India.</p>
<p>Thailand said on Tuesday a re-examination of its military data had picked up the plane re-tracing its route across Peninsular Malaysia. The Thai military had previously said it had not detected any sign of the plane.</p>
<p>What happened next is less certain. The plane may have flown for another six hours or more after dropping off Malaysian military radar about 200 miles northwest of Penang Island.</p>
<p>But the satellite signals that provide the only clues were not intended to work as locators. The best they can do is place the plane in one of two broad arcs &#8211; one stretching from Laos up to the Caspian, the other from west of Indonesia down to the Indian Ocean off Australia &#8211; when the last signal was picked up.</p>
<p><strong>Flight Simulator</strong></p>
<p>Malaysian police have searched the homes of the captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and first officer, Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, both in middle-class suburbs of Kuala Lumpur close to the  airport.</p>
<p>Among the items taken for examination was a flight simulator Zaharie had built in his home.</p>
<p>A senior police officer with direct knowledge of the investigation said the programs from the pilot&#8217;s simulator included Indian Ocean runways in the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Diego Garcia and southern India, although he added that U.S. and European runways also featured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally these flight simulators show hundreds or even thousands of runways,&#8221; the officer said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are trying to see is what were the runways that were frequently used.  We also need to see what routes the pilot had been assigned to before. This will take time, so people cannot jump the gun just yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some U.S. officials have expressed frustration at Malaysia&#8217;s handling of the investigation. The Malaysian government still had not invited the FBI to send a team to Kuala Lumpur by Monday, two U.S. security officials said.</p>
<p>China has also repeatedly voiced impatience with Malaysia&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<p>Malaysia&#8217;s Defence and Acting Transport Minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, told Reuters the country was co-operating with the FBI.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been working with them,&#8221; he said on Tuesday. &#8220;It&#8217;s up for the FBI to tell us if they need more experts to help because it&#8217;s not for us to know what they have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hishammuddin added that he had spoken to U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and &#8220;my counterpart in China&#8221; about the search for the plane, now in its 11th fruitless day.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy is sending a P-8A Poseidon, its most advanced maritime surveillance aircraft, to Perth, in Western Australia, to assist with the search.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the plane was a major topic of conversation at the International Society of Transport Air Trading in San Diego, an annual gathering of 1,600 airplane makers, buyers and lessors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people that I deal with are looking at this with great concern &#8211; it appears considerable efforts may have gone into cloaking the aircraft,&#8221; said Robert Agnew, chief executive of aviation consultants Morten Beyer &amp; Agnew.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012475&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2012440" alt="People shout slogans during a rally, part of the &quot;Brotherhood and Civil Resistance March&quot;, in Moscow" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cb-21.jpg" /> Demonstration against the Russian annexation of Ukraine in Moscow. (Reuters)
<p>Among the voices drowned out by victory celebrations across Crimea as it voted to leave Ukraine and join Russia were those of the Tatars, a minority group for whom the prospect of a return to Moscow rule brings only fear and uncertainty.</p>
<p>The Sunni Muslims, who are of Turkic origin, consider Crimea their home, and their deportation to Central Asia by Soviet forces during World War Two and earlier suppression by Josef Stalin meant they were far more comfortable with Ukraine. Now they face being dragged into modern-day Russia against their will, despite their boycott of Sunday&#8217;s referendum in which 97 percent of voters in the Russian-majority region were said to have rejected Kiev.</p>
<p>Tatars account for 12 per cent of the Black Sea peninsula&#8217;s population of two million people and their protest was not enough to change the outcome of a vote that has brought East-West relations to their lowest ebb since the Cold War.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do I not want to be a part of Russia?&#8221; asked Mustafa Asaba, a regional leader of Crimean Tatars. &#8220;Russia&#8217;s government is unpredictable, because at its head sits a dictator,&#8221; he said, referring to President Vladimir Putin who has masterminded the annexation of Crimea and alarmed Europe and the United States in the process. Asaba, wearing a traditional black wool hat, said he feared pro-Russian agitators in Crimea would resort to &#8220;provocation&#8221; to chip away at Tatars&#8217; identity, by curtailing their language, culture and religion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have always enjoyed freedom of expression &#8230; and I think that if they oppress us, we will resist,&#8221; he told Reuters at a friend&#8217;s home in the windswept town of Belogorsk, 50 km (30 miles) east of the Crimean capital Simferopol.<br />
&#8220;There will be trials and prisons. Nothing good will come of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stocky 58-year-old was born in Uzbekistan, where his family was banished in the 1944 deportation &#8211; punishment for Tatars who joined special Nazi units and fought the Soviets. Many also served in the Red Army, but when Soviet troops retook the Black Sea peninsula, Stalin punished the entire Tatar population by loading them into railway cattle cars to spend a life in exile. Many died from disease or starvation, and Tatars were only allowed back to Crimea in the 1980s under Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p><strong>Hard Times</strong></p>
<p>Crimean Tatars, who have not been afraid to express their views during the crisis, draw on the hardships of the past to steel themselves for what they expect will be hard times ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the worst-case scenario comes about (joining Russia) &#8211; and we still hope it will not happen &#8211; I think our people have been through worse times, including deportation and living under curfew in Uzbekistan,&#8221; Asaba said. He believed only a small number of Tatars would leave Crimea now that it looks destined to become part of Russia &#8211; a process that has yet to be formally completed. &#8220;I think 95 percent of Tatars will stay here under whatever conditions, because Crimea is our homeland. There is no other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The brave face cannot hide genuine fear among Tatars that Russian rule could mean curtailed freedoms.<br />
In a shop at the end of a potholed, dirt road in Belogorsk lined with modest bungalows, manager Niyara, who did not want to give her surname, said people had been stockpiling food. &#8220;People are really worried,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have a child, and I myself am scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Niyara fears that Russian Crimeans may now try to seize back property from Tatars that they believe is theirs.<br />
&#8220;A lot of our houses are unregistered, and Russian regulations on that kind of thing are very, very strict.&#8221;<br />
Crimea has been under the control of Russian troops for weeks, since Moscow sent in thousands of soldiers ostensibly to protect Russians against what it says are &#8220;fascists&#8221; in Kiev who overthrew the Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s interim government and Western leaders dismiss that justification as nonsense. The military buildup, and formation of unarmed volunteer groups who have taken on low-level security tasks, coincides with an increase in physical and verbal threats against Tatars.</p>
<p>Like Tatars, Russian nationalists have long memories, and recall to this day that the Crimean Khanate which Tatars ruled from the 15th to the 18th century was notorious for enslaving Christian Slavs and selling them on in the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>The sizeable Tatar community in Belogorsk has organised unarmed patrols to check for military hardware stationed in the area or anything unusual that may pose a danger. Refat Chubarov, a Crimean Tatar leader who led the campaign to boycott the referendum, told reporters on Monday that the fate of several dozen Tatars remained unknown after they had disappeared in the last week.</p>
<p>Disappearances in Crimea in the last month have also been reported among human rights activists, individuals linked to the &#8220;Maidan&#8221; protests in Kiev that toppled Yanukovich and journalists. The body of one Tatar in his 30s, named by Chubarov as Reshat Ametov, was found this week after he disappeared on March 3, and Chubarov said he had died violently. His funeral will be held on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Authorities Reach Out </strong></p>
<p>Crimea&#8217;s pro-Russian authorities have said they will guarantee Tatar representation in the local government and give the community proper land ownership rights and financial aid. Both Chubarov and Asaba have also discussed establishing some form of autonomy for Tatars in Crimea, although the talks are in their infancy.</p>
<p>Sergei Aksyonov, the leader of Crimea&#8217;s separatist authorities whose election Kiev does not recognise, said in a recent interview that money available to Tatars would be doubled this year. &#8220;There are no ethnic or religious conflicts and we will never allow that,&#8221; Aksyonov told Reuters.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Tatars regard Aksyonov with deep suspicion. &#8220;Aksyonov is unreliable, he&#8217;s a separatist,&#8221; said Lenura Asanova, an elderly Tatar woman in Belogorsk. &#8220;Russia stands behind him.&#8221; Asaba warned Putin that his aggressive move on Crimea could backfire. &#8220;In five years&#8217; time, the same Maidan will happen in Russia,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is why he is afraid. A year ago no-one thought anyone could overthrow Viktor Yanukovich. No-one.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012393&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/abbas-main.jpg" /></a> President Barack Obama shakes hands with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during their meeting in White House, Washington, March 17, 2014. (AP)
<p>US President Barack Obama told Mahmoud Abbas that the <a title="Clinton asks Israeli,Palestinian leaders to stop blame game" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/clinton-asks-israeli-palestinian-leaders-to-stop-blame-game/" target="_blank">Palestinian leader</a> and Israel&#8217;s politicians must be prepared to make tough decisions and take &#8220;risks&#8221; for peace.</p>
<p>Abbas arrived at the White House two weeks after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, warning that time was running short for a final deal and saying Israel could show it was serious by honouring a scheduled release of Palestinian prisoners this month.</p>
<p>Obama, personally supporting Secretary of State John Kerry&#8217;s exhaustive <a title="Kerry to present Israel,Palestine outline for final Middle East peace deal" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/middle-east-africa/kerry-to-present-israel-palestine-outline-for-final-middle-east-peace-deal/" target="_blank">Middle East peace drive</a> at a critical moment, is pressing both sides to accept a framework to carry negotiations past an end-of-April deadline. &#8220;As I said to Prime Minister Netanyahu when he was here just a few weeks ago, I believe that now is the time&#8230; to embrace this opportunity,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very hard, very challenging. We are going to have to take some tough political decisions and risks if we&#8217;re able to move it forward.&#8221; Obama said that everyone understood the shape of an &#8220;elusive&#8221; peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, saying it would be based on 1967 lines with mutual land swaps.</p>
<p>Abbas sat beside Obama in the same Oval Office chair recently used by Netanyahu, when the Israeli leader complained Israel had done its part over decades of peace talks and the Palestinians hadn&#8217;t done theirs.</p>
<p>The white-haired Palestinian leader told Obama: &#8220;We don&#8217;t have any time to waste.&#8221; &#8220;Time is not on our side, especially given the very difficult situation that the Middle East is experiencing and the entire region is facing.&#8221; Abbas did not use a photo opportunity before the talks to directly address the Israeli government&#8217;s demand for the Palestinians to recognise Israel as a &#8220;Jewish&#8221; state in public. But he did say through a translator that the Palestinians had recognised Israel&#8217;s legitimacy in 1988 and in &#8220;1993 we recognised the state of Israel.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012400&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-medium.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012416 " alt="PLANE-MEDIUM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-medium.jpg" /></a> Hundreds of family members are still waiting for information in a Beijing hotel.<br />Credit: Reuters/Damir Sagolj
<p>Furious Chinese families threatened on Tuesday to go on hunger strike until the Malaysian government tells them the truth about the fate of their relatives aboard a Malaysia Airlines flight which went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
<p>Ten days after the airliner vanished an hour into its flight, hundreds of family members are still waiting for information in a Beijing hotel.</p>
<p>Around two thirds of the 239 passengers on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 are Chinese. Families vented their pain and anger on Chinese representatives sent by the airline to meet them on Tuesday and demanded to see the Malaysian ambassador.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we want is the truth. Don&#8217;t let them become victims of politics. No matter what political party you are, no matter how much power you have, if there isn&#8217;t life, what&#8217;s the point? Where is compassion?&#8221; asked one middle-aged woman angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re always going back and forth. I think your government knows in their heart why we want you to answer us. Because you&#8217;re always tricking us, telling us lies,&#8221; added one man.</p>
<p>China has repeatedly called on the Malaysian side to do a better job at looking after the relatives of the Chinese passengers, and to provide them with updated information.</p>
<p>&#8220;China has all along demanded that the Malaysian side and Malaysia Airlines earnestly respond to the reasonable requests of the Chinese families,&#8221; Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a daily news briefing.The Chinese representative from the airline said what information the families received was beyond his control.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can accept the criticisms and mistakes that you have pointed out. But the problem is that some information and material we really have no way to access. From my position, I really cannot access it. So I beg for your forgiveness,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As the representatives left, families shouted after them, chanting slogans with their fists in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep protesting, Respect life, Don&#8217;t let them become victims of politics, Tell us the truth!&#8221; they shouted. Speaking to reporters, a woman who had led the chanting held up a piece of paper with slogans written on it, and said the families were calling for a hunger strike.</p>
<p>&#8220;Respect life, return our relatives. Can everyone read it? Can everyone read it?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going on hunger strike. I&#8217;m representing,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The families are on the point of collapse. There are so many families coming and going, some have already left. The young people can stand it, but the elderly have already broken down,&#8221; she shouted.</p>
<p>It was not clear how many of the relatives would join the hunger strike, or if it had even begun. A man surnamed Wen whose son was aboard the plane repeated demands to see the ambassador.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t yet decided whether we will go to the embassy, but we demand that the Malaysian ambassador come and represent the government to come and answer the families&#8217; questions and give them some information. They&#8217;re secretive, they never tell the truth,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Anger has also spread online, with some Chinese calling on the government to impose sanctions on Malaysia for its poor handling of the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Malaysia knew that the plane changed direction, yet concealed it, knew that it was not in South China Sea, yet let everyone look there for several days, and they are still hiding all kinds of information,&#8221; one user wrote on microblogging site Sina Weibo. &#8220;This rogue state really should be sanctioned.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012399&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2012382" alt="In this photo by China's Xinhua News Agency, China's rescue ships sail different ways as they conduct a search operation for a missing Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, flight MH370.

(AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Finding the missing Malaysian jetliner would be a coup for any of the more than two dozen countries out there looking. But for China and the United States, it&#8217;s a lot more than that — it has been a chance for the two rival powers in the Pacific to show off what they can do in a real-life humanitarian mission across one of the world&#8217;s most hotly contested regions.</span></p>
<div>
<p>The hunt has major ramifications for Beijing, which has been rapidly improving its military while aggressively challenging neighbours over territorial disputes. Washington is looking to prove it&#8217;s still the top dog to allies worried about how seriously it takes the threat China poses to the Pacific status quo.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/mh370-missing-background-checks-clear-chinese-nationals/" target="_blank">MH370 missing: Background checks clear Chinese nationals</a></p>
<p>So far, neither country has come up with anything significant. But they have been vigorously waving their flags.</p>
<p>China has the most at stake and has been taking an unusually high-profile role. Almost immediately after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared March 8, China dispatched its largest-ever rescue flotilla to the initial search area in the South China Sea, which Beijing considers its own backyard.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/missing-malaysian-plane-flew-low-to-avoid-radar-detection/" target="_blank">Missing Malaysian plane flew low to avoid radar detection</a></p>
<p>Beijing sent four warships and five coast guard and civilian patrol service vessels, along with helicopters and fixed-wing surveillance aircraft. Among the warships are two of China&#8217;s largest and most advanced amphibious docking ships. The 20,000-ton vessels are equipped with helicopters and a range of small boats, including up to four hovercrafts.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, China is simply doing its duty in orchestration with other countries,&#8221; said Ni Lexiong, a military expert at Shanghai&#8217;s University of Political Science and Law. &#8220;On the other hand, this operation offers an opportunity to assess the Chinese navy&#8217;s willpower, efficiency and ability to carry out operations far from home, especially in comparison with the U.S.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fresh off a massive relief effort after Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines — which China barely got involved in — the U.S. was once again quick to respond. Within days, the Navy had two destroyers in the South China Sea participating in the search, the USS Kidd and the USS Pinckney. Both are both based in San Diego but were training in the area when the jet disappeared.</p>
<p>Since the flight was bound for Beijing and two-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, the public expects the government and military to pull out all the stops. With more Chinese traveling abroad than ever — 100 million last year, more than double the figure for 2009 — they are increasingly reliant on their government to assist and protect them when overseas, and they are looking for proof that it can fulfill that role.</p>
<p>National prestige is also a huge factor.</p>
<p>Though the U.S. remains the dominant power in the Pacific, China deeply craves that role. Sizable chunks of its defense spending, which has grown significantly over the past two decades to $131 billion, have been devoted to boosting its ability to project force for both military and humanitarian missions.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s Achilles&#8217; heel is its relative lack of experience, not having fought in a major conflict since the end of the Korean War in 1953. Its leaders have been trying to compensate with more realistic training scenarios, including joint maritime search and rescue exercises with other nations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone understands, without anything being said, that the U.S. has unmatched search and rescue capabilities that reflect the size and sophistication of its air and naval forces,&#8221; said Avery Goldstein, a China security expert at the University of Pennsylvania. &#8220;China&#8217;s capabilities in this regard are improving but not yet in the same league, especially for operations at great distance from the Chinese mainland.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given new clues from radar and satellite data that the missing Boeing 777 turned west and flew on for several more hours, the search has shifted to a vast swath of land and sea stretching from the southern Indian Ocean up to Kazakhstan. That&#8217;s an area that neither China nor the U.S. has traditionally put much emphasis on, and has forced both to rethink their strategies.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy decided that long-range naval aircraft were a more efficient way to search such a vast area, so will be relying on P-3 and P-8 planes, while the two destroyers go back to normal duties.</p>
<p>The mission is one of the first on the international stage for the P-8 Poseidon, one of the newest additions to the Navy&#8217;s air capabilities. The Navy touts the aircraft as the world&#8217;s most advanced anti-submarine and anti-surface ship reconnaissance plane and says it can cover 15,000 square miles (38,850 square kilometers) in a nine-hour flight.</p>
<p>China, meanwhile, has sent most of its ships involved in the search toward Singapore, where they will split into two groups, one traveling north and the other south. They will be searching two huge blocks of ocean off the coast of Sumatra and near the Andaman Islands — a total area of 300,000 square kilometers (186,000 square miles), or roughly three times the area they searched in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>A big problem for China is its bad blood with virtually all of its neighbors, many of whom are key players in the search. China has territorial disputes with India, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam, and many other countries in the region are wary of its efforts to exert more control over Pacific shipping lanes that could impact their freedom of trade.</p>
<p>&#8220;China is strong in terms of hardware, but it lacks experience and good security ties with regional states,&#8221; said China expert Li Mingjiang at Singapore Nanyang Technological University. &#8220;The U.S. sailors have far better networking with their regional counterparts, making it more possible for the U.S. to play a leading role in the search and rescue effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chinese officials haven&#8217;t done themselves any favors by criticizing Malaysia&#8217;s leadership in the search effort. Some saw that as an attempt to shift public attention away from its own shortcomings, and Beijing&#8217;s weak military-to-military relationship with Malaysia probably exacerbated the issue.</p>
<p>Japan, which is Washington&#8217;s staunchest ally in Asia and is locked in a tense dispute with China over several small islands, has been watching Beijing&#8217;s response especially closely. Experts in Tokyo say that while they remain skeptical, there is hope that by coming together with other countries to pursue a common goal, China may learn to work more amiably with its neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people say China is trying to use the mission as a way to show off its presence, but that also means they are stepping up their efforts and capabilities in disaster relief,&#8221; said Kyouji Yanagisawa, a former Japanese Cabinet adviser on national security. &#8220;This is a search operation and I think it could be an opportunity to cultivate trust among participating countries, rather than conflict.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2012370" alt="(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/fumio-480.jpg" /> Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida says that Japan does not recognise the outcome of Crimea&#8217;s referendum. (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Japan on Tuesday imposed some modest sanctions on Russia for its recognition of Crimea as an independent state suspending talks on relaxing visa requirements between the two countries and talks on investment, space exploration and military cooperation.</span></p>
<p>Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said in a statement that Japan does not recognise the outcome of Crimea&#8217;s referendum to split from Ukraine, saying it violates the Ukrainian constitution. &#8220;It is regretful that Russia&#8217;s recognition of the independence of Crimea interferes with the integrity of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territory,&#8221; Kishida told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot overlook Russia&#8217;s attempt to change the status quo by force.&#8221; The moves are seen as mild compared to sanctions by the US and European Union, which have frozen the assets of individuals linked to the unrest in Crimea or who support the region&#8217;s vote to secede from Ukraine.</p>
<p>But Japanese officials said that an investment seminar sponsored by private institute but also backed by both governments that is scheduled for tomorrow was still on. Ties between Russia and Japan have been strained for decades due to a dispute over a cluster of Russian-controlled islands off the northern island of Hokkaido called the southern Kurils in Russia and the Northern Territories in Japan.</p>
<p>The dispute has kept the two countries from signing a peace treaty after World War II. But last month, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that negotiations toward forging a treaty were accelerating. Abe is also eager to unleash new trade and energy business with Russia that has been hung up by the dispute.</p>
<p>Kishida urged Russia to comply with international laws, withdraw the recognition of Crimea&#8217;s independence and not move further toward its annexation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012362&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2012260" alt="Pro-Russian people celebrate in the central square in Sevastopol, Ukraine.

<p>Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday approved a draft bill for the annexation of Crimea, one of a flurry of steps to formally take over the Black Sea peninsula.</p>
<p>Crimea on Sunday voted overwhelmingly to secede from Ukraine and seek to join Russia. The West and Ukraine described the referendum which was announced two weeks ago as illegitimate.</p>
<p>The United States and the European Union on Monday announced asset freezes and other sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian officials involved in the Crimean crisis. President Barack Obama warned that more would come if Russia didn&#8217;t stop interfering in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russian troops have been occupying the region for more than two weeks.</p>
<p>The decree signed by Putin and posted on the official government website Tuesday morning is one of the steps which would formalize the annexation of Crimea. Russia, however, still has a room to back off. The treaty to annex Crimea has to be signed by leaders of Russia and Crimea leader and then ratified by the parliament.</p>
<p>Putin is set to address both houses of the parliament at 3 p.m. Moscow time (1100 GMT) in a nationally televised speech where he is widely expected to stake Russia&#8217;s claim on Crimea.</p>
<p>Crimea had been part of Russia since the 18th century until Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred it to Ukraine in 1954. Both Russians and Crimea&#8217;s majority ethnic Russian population see annexation as correcting a historic insult.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s turmoil, which began in November with a wave of protests against President Viktor Yanukovych and accelerated after he fled to Russia in late February, has become Europe&#8217;s most severe security crisis in years.</p>

<p>Checks into the background of all the Chinese nationals on board the missing Malaysian jetliner have uncovered no links to terrorism, the Chinese ambassador in Kuala Lumpur said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The remarks will dampen speculation that Uighur Muslim separatists in far western Xinjiang province might have been involved with the disappearance of the Boeing 777 and its 239 passengers and crew early on March 8.</p>
<p>The plane was carrying 154 Chinese passengers, when Malaysian officials say someone on board deliberately diverted it from its route to Beijing less than one hour into the flight. A massive search operation in the Indian Ocean and beyond has yet to find any trace of the plane.</p>
<p>Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang said background checks on Chinese nationals didn&#8217;t uncover any evidence suggesting they were involved in hijacking or an act of terrorism against the plane, according to the state Xinhua News Agency.</p>
<p>Uighur groups have been involved in attacks inside China, and some have a presence in the Afghan-Pakistan border area, where al-Qaida and other transnational jihadi groups are based.</p>
<p>Malaysian police are investigating the pilots and ground engineers of the plane, and have asked intelligence agencies from countries with passengers on board to carry out background checks on those passengers.</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities say that someone on board the flight switched off two vital pieces of communication equipment, allowing the plane to fly almost undetected. Satellite data shows it might have ended up somewhere in a giant arc stretching from Central Asia to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Huang also that authorities in China had begun searching for the plane on its territory.</p>
<p>Malaysian police say they are investigating the possibility of hijacking, sabotage, terrorism or issues related to the mental health of the pilots or anyone else on board, but have yet to give any update on what they have uncovered.</p>
<p>Malaysian military radar spotted the plane in the northern reaches of the Strait of Malacca at 2:14 a.m. on March 8, just over 1 ½ hours after it took off from Kuala Lumpur. That is the plane&#8217;s last known confirmed position. A signal to a satellite from the plane at 8:11 a.m. suggests that, by then, it was somewhere in a broad arc spanning from Kazakhstan to the Indian Ocean west of Australia.</p>
<p>Investigators are scouring over what little data they have to try and determine who was in control of the plane when it stopped communicating. They have indicated that whoever was in control must have had aviation experience and knowledge of commercial flight paths.</p>
<p>On Monday, Malaysian Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an initial investigation indicated that the last words ground controllers heard from the plane — &#8220;All right, good night&#8221; — were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the defense minister Hishammuddin Hussein said this were spoken before the jetliner&#8217;s data communications systems — the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System — had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit was knowingly deceiving ground controllers.</p>
<p>But Ahmad made a potentially significant change to that timeline.</p>
<p>Speaking alongside Hishammuddin, he said that while the final data transmission from ACARS, which gives plane performance and maintenance information, came before the co-pilot&#8217;s words, it was still unclear at what point the system was switched off. The search for the plane is one of the largest in aviation history, and now involves 26 countries.</p>
<p>It was initially focused on seas on either side of Peninsular Malaysia, in the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca. It has since expanded to include the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal and 11 countries to the northwest which the plane in theory could have crossed, including China and India.</p>
<p>But had the plane gone northwest to Central Asia, it would have crossed over countries with busy airspace. Some experts believe it more likely would have gone south, although Malaysian authorities are not ruling out the northern corridor and are eager for radar data that might confirm or rule out that.</p>
<p>U.S., Australian and Indonesian planes and ships are searching waters to the south of Indonesia&#8217;s Sumatra Island all the way down to the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean, the world&#8217;s third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water. The area being covered by the Australians is massive — 600,000 square kilometers (232,000 square miles) — and will take weeks to search thoroughly, said John Young, manager of Australian Maritime Safety Authority&#8217;s emergency response division.</p>
<p>&#8220;This search will be difficult. The sheer size of the search area poses a huge challenge,&#8221; Young said. &#8220;A needle in a haystack remains a good analogy.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012168&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2012014" alt="s1.reutersmedia.net 480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/s1-reutersmedia-net-480.jpg" /> People lay flowers at the barricades in memory of the victims of the recent clashes in central Kiev. The West has struggled to find leverage to force Moscow to back off in the Ukraine turmoil, of which Crimea is only a part, and analysts saw yesterday&#8217;s sanctions as mostly ineffectual. (Reuters)
<p>Ignoring the toughest sanctions against Moscow since the end of the Cold War, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised Ukraine&#8217;s Crimean Peninsula as an &#8220;independent and sovereign country&#8221;, a bold challenge to Washington that escalates one of Europe&#8217;s worst security crises in years.</p>
<p>The brief decree posted on the Kremlin&#8217;s website came just hours after the United States and the European Union announced asset freezes and other sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian officials involved in the Crimean crisis, yesterday.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama warned that more would come if Russia didn&#8217;t stop interfering in Ukraine, and Putin&#8217;s move clearly forces his hand.</p>
<p>The West has struggled to find leverage to force Moscow to back off in the Ukraine turmoil, of which Crimea is only a part, and analysts saw yesterday&#8217;s sanctions as mostly ineffectual.</p>
<p>Moscow showed no signs of flinching in the dispute that has roiled Ukraine since Russian troops took effective control of the strategic Black Sea peninsula last month and supported the Sunday referendum that overwhelmingly called for annexation by Russia.</p>
<p>Recognising Crimea as independent would be an interim step in absorbing the region.</p>
<p>Crimea had been part of Russia since the 18th century, until Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred it to Ukraine in 1954 and both Russians and Crimea&#8217;s majority ethnic Russian population see annexation as correcting a historic insult.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s turmoil &#8220;which began in November with a wave of protests against President Viktor Yanukovych and accelerated after he fled to Russia in late February&#8221; has become Europe&#8217;s most severe security crisis in years.</p>
<p>Russia, like Yanukovych himself, characterises his ouster as a coup, and alleges the new authorities are fascist-minded and likely to crack down on Ukraine&#8217;s ethnic Russian population. Pro-Russia demonstrations have broken out in several cities in eastern Ukraine near the Russian border, where the Kremlin has been massing troops.</p>
<p>Fearing that Russia is prepared to risk violence to make a land-grab, the West has consistently spoken out against Russia&#8217;s actions but has run into a wall of resistance from Moscow.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011995&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011957" alt="The last transmission from the ACARS system was received at 1.07 am, as the plane crossed Malaysia’s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-main.jpg" /></a> The last transmission from the ACARS system was received at 1.07 am, as the plane crossed Malaysia’s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.
<p><strong>Anshuman Daga </strong>&amp;<strong> Yantoultra Ngui</strong></p>
<p>The co-pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 spoke the last words heard from the cockpit, the chief executive of the airline said on Monday, as investigators considered suicide by the captain or his first officer as one possible explanation for the plane’s disappearance.</p>
<p>MH370 vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard while on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. Investigators are increasingly convinced it was diverted perhaps thousands of miles off course by someone with deep knowledge of the Boeing 777-200ER and commercial navigation.</p>
<p>A search unprecedented in its scale is now under way for the aircraft, covering an area stretching from the shores of the Caspian Sea in the north to deep in the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya also told a news conference that it was unclear exactly when one of the plane’s automatic tracking systems had been disabled, appearing to contradict the weekend comments of government ministers.</p>
<p>Suspicions of hijacking or sabotage had hardened further when officials said on Sunday that the last radio message from the plane — an informal “all right, good night” — was spoken after the system, called ACARS, was shut down.</p>
<p>“Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke the last time it was recorded on tape,” Ahmad Jauhari said on Monday, when asked who it was believed had spoken those words.</p>
<p>That was a sign-off to air traffic controllers at 1.19 am, as the Beijing-bound plane left Malaysian airspace under the command of its captain, 53-year-old Zaharie Ahmad Shah, and first officer, 27-year-old Fariq Abdul Hamid.</p>
<p>The last transmission from the ACARS system — a maintenance computer that relays data on the plane’s status — was received at 1.07 am, as the plane crossed Malaysia’s northeast coast and headed out over the Gulf of Thailand.</p>
<p>“We don’t know when the ACARS was switched off after that,” Ahmad Jauhari said. “It was supposed to transmit 30 minutes from there, but that transmission did not come through.”</p>
<p>Satellite data suggests the plane could be anywhere in either of two vast corridors that arc through much of Asia: one stretching north from Laos to the Caspian, the other south from west of the Indonesian island of Sumatra into the southern Indian Ocean west of Australia.</p>
<p>China, which has been vocal in its impatience with Malaysian efforts to find the plane, called on Kuala Lumpur to “immediately” expand and clarify the scope of the search. About two-thirds of the passengers aboard MH370 were Chinese.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he had spoken to Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak by telephone, and had offered more surveillance resources in addition to the two P-3C Orion aircraft Canberra has already committed.</p>
<p>The plane’s disappearance has baffled investigators and  aviation experts. It vanished from civilian air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities believe that, as the plane crossed the northeast coast and flew across the Gulf of Thailand, someone on board shut off its communications systems and turned sharply to the west.</p>
<p>That has focused attention on the crew. Malaysian police are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, flight and ground staff for any clues to a possible motive in what they say is now being treated as a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Asked if pilot or co-pilot suicide was a line of inquiry, Malaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said: “We are looking at it.” But he added it was only one of the possibilities under investigation.</p>
<p>A senior police official familiar with the investigation said the programmes in the flight simulator that was seized from the home of MH370’s captain Shah over the weekend appeared to be normal ones that allow users to practise flying and landing in different conditions.</p>
<p>A second officer said they had found no evidence of a link between the pilot and any militant group. “Based on what we have so far, we cannot see the terrorism link here,” he said. “We looked at known terror or extremist groups in Southeast Asia. The links are not there.”</p>
<p>Electronic signals between the plane and satellites continued to be exchanged for nearly six hours after MH370 flew out of range of Malaysian military radar off the northwest coast, following a commercial aviation route across the Andaman Sea towards India.</p>
<p>The plane had enough fuel to fly for about 30 minutes after that last satellite communication, Ahmad Jauhari said.</p>
<p>Twenty-six countries are involved in the search, stretching across much of Asia. Three French civil aviation experts who were involved in the search for an Air France jet that crashed in the Atlantic in 2009 arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday to help.</p>
<p>A source familiar with official US assessments of satellite data being used to try to find the plane said it was believed most likely it turned south sometime after the last sighting by Malaysian military radar, and may have run out of fuel over the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>The Malaysian government-controlled New Straits Times on Monday quoted sources close to the investigation as saying data collected was pointing instead towards the northern corridor.</p>
<p><strong>SAME FLIGHT, 9 DAYS LATER</strong></p>
<p>On board Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER Flight MH318, as it cruises towards Beijing over the South China Sea, at approximately 1.30 am on Monday. MH318 has replaced the missing MH370, which has been retired.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india9.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011898" alt="At a cafe in Tehran. Reports of cafes being shut for violating “Islamic dignities” have dropped sharply.  AP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india9.jpg" /></a> At a cafe in Tehran. Reports of cafes being shut for violating “Islamic dignities” have dropped sharply. AP
<p>Shoulder to shoulder, cheek to cheek, young women and men sit next to each other while a thick film of cigarette smoke fills the dimly-lit cafe in central Tehran. Bob Dylan’s Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door blares from the speakers.</p>
<p>Young Iranians with slick smart phones and packs of American-made cigarettes who frequent the cafe come for a chance to hang out, away from the eyes of moralising elders. They also form a bloc of strong support for moderate President Hassan Rouhani as he works to allow greater social freedom in the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>It is a reflection of a boom in cafe culture that has led to a mushrooming of similar coffee shops over the past two years, providing an outlet for young middle-class Iranians who suffer from a lack of public places to meet.</p>
<p>With a box of black Marlboros on his table, Mahnaz Ghassemi, 20, who voted for Rouhani in June, said she comes to the cafe for the freedom it offers.</p>
<p>“Here, I can smoke freely. At home, both my mom and dad regularly complain about it,’’ she said. Majid Rouhian, 24, sips his double espresso while chatting with his girlfriend Maryam. Both voted for Rouhani. “In the past we had fewer chances to meet,’’ he said. “In recent years we have more chances simply because of increasing number of public places, like this.’’</p>
<p>For years, Iranian authorities kept the number of cafes limited since they were seen as a symbol of Western influence and places to spread non-Isamic beliefs. But reports of cafes being shut because they violate “Islamic dignities” have dropped markedly in recent months, suggesting a growing tolerance by the authorities.</p>
<p>During his campaign, Rouhani vowed that young people would have more social freedom. “We should not intervene in private life&#8230; We should know that young people are energetic so we should not be tough on them. It will not lead to positive results,’’ he said.</p>
<p>Tehran-based economic and political analyst Saeed Leilaz believes cafes symbolise the network of young people who played an essential role in bringing Rouhani to power. “The role of the young people, those who sit in cafes, was a significant&#8230; part of Rouhani’s success,’’ he said.</p>
<p>Leilaz said authorities learned they had to give youth more freedom and a bigger role in society as the economic failures of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s administration grew more acute in recent years. “If getting government permits for cafes gets easier, then their number would match the number of mosques in Tehran,’’ said Leilaz. There are some 2,000 mosques in Tehran, according to official statistics. Cafe association head Eskandar Azmoudeh said the number of cafés has roughly quadruped over the past two years, from around 20 or 30 up to around 80.</p>
<p>More than half of Iran’s 76 million citizens are under age 30. Many juice shop owners who have watched those young customers flock to cafes have converted their businesses to coffee shops to keep up with the changing times. Many of the new shops are decorated with replica paintings and pictures of local and foreign celebrities. They typically offer free high-speed Wi-Fi, a major draw for many customers.</p>
<p>The loosening of the reins started even before Rouhani’s election. The number of Western-type cafes, which first appeared in Iran in the 1920s, began to increase in 2011, two years after Ahmadinejad’s controversial re-election that led to a massive crackdown on opposition activists.<br />
Mehrdad Khadir, a social columnist for the moderate Asr-e Iran news website, said cafes provide “fewer restrictions on relations between the genders,’’ compared to other places in the Iranian society. “Girls and boys feel secure there,’’ he said, adding that cafe goers “supported Rouhani in the 2013 elections simply because Rouhani promised more social freedom.’’</p>
<p>In another corner of the city in a different café, 30-year-old Farzin, who would not give his family name because he was there with his girlfriend, said the cafés offer a feeling of luxury, which is another attraction to the culture. “They look antique — it’s about the ornaments and good decoration and lighting,’’ he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011896&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india8.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011895" alt="A protest by the ultra-orthodox against draft being extended to them." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india8.jpg" /></a> A protest by the ultra-orthodox against draft being extended to them.
<p>Israel’s parliament on March 12 voted to begin drafting large numbers of ultra-Orthodox men into the military, moving to end a contentious system that enraged many secular Israelis by allowing young seminary students to evade army service.</p>
<p>The legislation sought to resolve an issue at the heart of a heated culture war in Israel. Instead, it only widened the rift, drawing criticism from both sides. It also could shake Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s longstanding alliance with religious political parties.</p>
<p>The issue of draft exemptions goes back to the times around Israel’s establishment in 1948, when the government allowed several hundred gifted students to pursue religious studies. The number of exemptions has grown over the years, with thousands of young religious men evading the draft to pursue seminary studies while most other Jewish men are conscripted for three years of mandatory service.</p>
<p>The exemptions have caused widespread resentment toward the ultra-Orthodox and were a central issue in parliamentary elections last year.</p>
<p>“The change begins March 13 morning and it is expected to transform the face of Israeli society,” said Yaakov Peri, a Cabinet minister from the party Yesh Atid, who helped spearhead the new legislation.</p>
<p>The ultra-Orthodox make up nearly 10 per cent of Israel’s 8 million people. Leaders insist their young men serve the nation through prayer and study, thus preserving Jewish learning and heritage. Itzhak Vaknin, a lawmaker from the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, said it is “unacceptable &#8230; that a Jew who studies the Torah is committing a felony”.</p>
<p>Beyond the claims of fairness, proponents of the law say it is an essential step toward integrating the religious sector into the workforce. Many ultra-Orthodox men continue their full-time religious studies into adulthood, collecting welfare payments and other subsidies.</p>
<p>A high unemployment rate has led to widespread poverty in the ultra-Orthodox sector. Israel’s central bank and international organisations have warned the country’s economic future is in danger if the religious do not join the workforce in bigger numbers.</p>
<p>The law does not impose universal conscription. Instead, the army will be required to draft an increasing number of ultra-Orthodox Jews each year, with the goal of enlisting 5,200 ultra-Orthodox soldiers — roughly 60 per cent of those of draft age — by mid-2017. Israel would grant financial incentives to religious seminaries that send their students to the army.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011893&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Is Isreal ‘the Jewish state’?</em><br />
The answer may seem as obvious as the Star of David on the Israeli flag. Yet the question is starting to complicate the ambitious US effort to ram through a peace deal between the Palestinians and Israel.</p>
<p>A broad-based group of Israelis plans to lobby the Knesset to declare the country, for the first time, a Jewish state by law. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded that the Palestinians recognise Israel’s Jewish status explicitly as part of any agreement.</p>
<p>“This is the Jewish land. This is the Jewish state,” he said in a speech to assembled US Jewish leaders recently. “When we make an agreement, it is an agreement between the nation state of the Jewish people and a nation state of the Palestinian people.”</p>
<p>Leading Palestinians have made their opposition clear, insisting that by introducing the Jewish factor, Israel is drawing a red line that could doom negotiations.</p>
<p>“I remember the days when we were told, ‘All you need is to get the PLO to recognise Israel, and recognise Israel’s right to exist in safe and secure boundaries’,” said Hanan Ashrawi, a prominent member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. The Palestinians did just that, she noted, as part of the 1990s interim peace agreements.</p>
<p>“The Jewishness of the state of Israel, this is a new addition,” she told reporters. “We are working to establish a pluralistic, democratic, inclusive state in Palestine. Not an exclusive state based on religion, ethnicity or whatever.”</p>
<p>The Palestinians reject Israel’s demand for pragmatic reasons as well: Embrace of Israel as a Jewish state would amount to giving up the dreams of Palestinian refugees to return to lost properties — the so-called “right of return”, which is a central sticking point in peace talks. They also say it would undermine the rights of Israel’s own Arab minority, 20 per cent of Israel’s 8 million people who are themselves ethnic Palestinians.</p>
<p>Even some Israelis suspect the demand is intended to complicate — but the idea has wide support nonetheless. To be criticised even for the desire to have a state of their own chafes many Jewish Israelis.</p>
<p>Israeli academic Avraham Diskin, a self-professed lifelong dove, said a Palestinian refusal meant perpetuating the conflict. “This is the minimal test to show that their face is to peace,” he said.</p>
<p>The US usually doesn’t recognise countries by ethnicities, but Deputy State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the US does recognise Israel as a Jewish state. In his State of the Union speech to Congress recently, President Barack Obama said the goals of the negotiations launched last July were “dignity and an independent state for Palestinians, and lasting peace and security for the State of Israel — a Jewish state that knows America will always be at their side”.</p>
<p>Kerry himself implied support for the idea of a Jewish state by advising Israelis they must pull out of Palestinian-populated lands occupied in the 1967 war in order to retain a strong Jewish majority.</p>
<p>Indeed, if Israelis eventually hand over significant territories to a Palestinian state, the motivation will stem largely from a desire to unload their Palestinian population and leave themselves with a strong Jewish majority. An Israel that controls the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza — the areas occupied in 1967 — would have some 12 million people roughly evenly divided between the two groups.</p>
<p>In a speech to Israel’s parliament Knesset on March 12, British Prime Minister David Cameron echoed the words of Kerry, appearing to recognise Israel as “the nation state of the Jewish people”.</p>
<p>Writing in the Haaretz newspaper, liberal columnist Ari Shavit said: “The deal on the table is clear: A Jewish state in exchange for the 1967 borders.” That, Shavit and others maintain, means the Palestinians must forget about a return by Arab refugees and their descendants to Israel.</p>
<p>But the notion of a Jewish state is a complicated one. By shining strong light on a matter that lives more comfortably in the shadows, Israel may be rekindling some awkward questions: Are the Jews a nation — or individuals who share a religion? Should a religion have a state? Should a state have a religion?</p>
<p>And beyond that lies a bigger issue still: Is the idea of a nation-state — with members of that nation fretting over how to stay dominant numerically — not somehow unbecoming in the age of globalisation?</p>
<p>Israel’s 1948 Declaration of Independence was essentially a national statement, proclaiming that Palestine — referred to interchangeably as “the land of Israel” — was “the birthplace of the Jewish people”.</p>
<p>Zvi Hauser, who until recently served as Netanyahu’s Cabinet secretary, lamented that this declaration was never followed by a constitution cementing the country’s status as the Jewish state. “The Jewish people is not just a religion. It is also a national group that has a right to self-actualisation,” he said.</p>
<p>In fact, the question of what it means to be a Jew is a matter of debate — abroad and in Israel itself. Israel’s ‘Law of Return’ combines the lineage and religion definitions. It grants citizenship to anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent, as well as to converts who have no Jewish heritage but are recognised by rabbis.</p>
<p>Consensus on the matter is extremely hard to find. Many Jews around the world see their identity as primarily a matter of religion. Plenty of Israelis think that a “Jewish state” should be more of a theocracy, outlawing work on the Sabbath, for example. At the same time, many Jews in Israel and elsewhere are not at all religious and view themselves as Jewish simply because they were born to Jewish parents — a situation not unlike that of ethnic Irish or Japanese.</p>
<p>Most confounding, perhaps, are the ethnic divisions that persist between the Jews themselves. Israel’s founders were overwhelmingly European Jews, and that group — known as Ashkenazim — was numerically dominant among Jews before the Nazi Holocaust. But the reality today in Israel is diverse. Almost half of the Jewish population of 6 million is descended from the Arab world.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011887&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011886" alt="Nils Horner. 51, was shot at point-blank range" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india6.jpg" /></a> Nils Horner. 51, was shot at point-blank range
<p><strong>By MATTHEW ROSENBERG</strong><br />
With few facts emerging about why a Swedish journalist was gunned down on a crowded street here last week, some Afghan officials have begun offering an unsupported, if not familiar, theory: A spy war involving Western intelligence agents was to blame, rather than some homegrown cause.<br />
No officials who offered the theory wanted their names attached to it, and none could say what countries might have been involved in the killing of Nils Horner, 51, a reporter for Swedish Radio. But it opened a new front for speculation in a case swamped with conjecture.</p>
<p>Already, a claim of responsibility by an unconfirmed breakaway Taliban group that accused Horner of being spy has been received and then widely denied — including by the main Taliban spokesman. The timing of the death, on a day that anti-Western demonstrations broke out during the burial of Vice-President Muhammad Qasim Fahim, raised questions about whether growing anger toward foreigners might have led to Horner’s death, but no further detail supports it.</p>
<p>The biggest break so far in the investigation is video of a suspected gunman and an accomplice running from the scene of the crime. The video was captured by a surveillance camera that was mounted near the street by a Western embassy and not by the Afghan government, Afghan and foreign diplomats said.</p>
<p>Afghan officials now have the video, but have refused to release it. A copy was obtained by the Expressen newspaper of Sweden and posted on its website. The grainy black-and-white video, which Afghan and Western officials said was authentic, shows a pair of men — one in traditional dress, the other in what appears to be a track suit — running down a main street in Kabul’s diplomatic enclave.</p>
<p>The video was taken moments after the shooting, around the time the area had been cordoned off by heavily armed police officers to secure a route for a motorcade carrying senior officials to Fahim’s burial. The suspects ran toward the cordon and, judging from the video, most likely dashed past several police checkpoints as they escaped onto a narrow side street.</p>
<p>Apart from the video, “the facts are thin”, said a European diplomat. “We’re all struggling to explain this.”</p>
<p>Now, some are saying Horner may have been killed as part of some shadowy intelligence war in Afghanistan waged by foreigners.</p>
<p>The European diplomat described the claim that Horner was an intelligence agent as “delusional nonsense”. “We’re all tired of people thinking that the Great Game is being played out here every day,” the diplomat said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011883&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011882" alt="Osama bin Laden spokesman who is on trial in New York says he had no role in planning military operations for al-Qaeda." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india5.jpg" /></a> Osama bin Laden spokesman who is on trial in New York says he had no role in planning military operations for al-Qaeda.
<p>The self-described mastermind of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the US says the one-time Osama bin Laden spokesman who is on trial in New York had no role in planning military operations for al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, said in a statement filed in Manhattan federal court late Sunday that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith served as an al-Qaeda spokesman because he was “an eloquent, spellbinding speaker”.</p>
<p>But Mohammed says Abu Ghaith “had nothing to do with military operations”.</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith, who is a son-in-law of bin Laden, is charged with conspiring to kill Americans. He is the highest-level al-Qaeda figure to be tried in the US since the September 11 attacks.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say he was part of al-Qaeda’s deadly plot in his role as spokesman in fiery videos and as a motivational speaker at the group’s training camps in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith’s lawyers have said the Kuwait-born imam made inflammatory remarks but didn’t conspire to carry out terrorism.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers are seeking to use testimony from Mohammed, who is in a detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. They would need US District Judge Lewis A Kaplan’s approval to introduce the information.</p>
<p>The defence has suggested Mohammed could help rebut the government’s claim that Abu Ghaith must have known in advance of al-Qaeda’s so-called shoe bomb airplane plots, including Richard Reid’s attempt to carry one out in December 2001.</p>
<p>The statement from Mohammed filed Sunday consisted of answers he gave to questions posed by Abu Ghaith’s lawyers.</p>
<p>In the statement, Mohammed said he never spoke with Abu Ghaith about the shoe bomb operation and added, “Those tasked with giving statements to the media do not necessarily know all the details of an operation and are sometimes even unaware of the very existence of the operation.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors rested their case Friday in the trial of Abu Ghaith. The defense case is due to start Monday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011879&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(File Photo AP)
<p>Caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra&#8217;s government is set to revoke a nearly two-months-old state of emergency tomorrow and replace it with a security law to deal with the political situation in the country.</p>
<p>Surapong Tovichakchaikul, chief advisor to the government&#8217;s Centre for Maintaining Peace and Order (CMPO) which has been set up to handle anti-government protests, said the body will ask for the state of emergency to be lifted.</p>
<p>The Internal Security Act (ISA) will replace the emergency decree.The state of emergency is due to expire on March 22.</p>
<p>After the ISA is implemented, the CMPO will become the Centre for the Administration of Peace and Order (CAPO) but would initially work under the same structure.</p>
<p>Thailand has been in a political crisis since mass rallies began in November. The protesters are demanding an unelected People&#8217;s Council to replace the Yingluck regime.</p>
<p>On January 22, the Yingluck Shinawatra-led caretaker government put Bangkok under a state of emergency for 60 days to quell protests.</p>
<p>Violence had erupted in Bangkok and other parts of the country ahead and during the February 2 snap polls, boycotted by main opposition Democrat Party demanding the ouster of Prime Minister Yingluck.</p>
<p>Opposition-backed protesters had blocked polling in several opposition stronghold provinces and in some parts of Bangkok on February 2 and during advance polling on January 26.</p>
<p>The protesters accuse Yingluck of acting as a proxy for her fugitive brother, former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup in 2006. He lives in self-exile in Dubai to escape a jail term on a corruption conviction.</p>
<p>Since November 2013, seventy attacks against protesters have resulted in over 20 deaths and 720 injuries. In recent days, five persons have died in blasts at protest sites.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011820&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>The crimes of North Korea&#8217;s regime are as chilling as those of the Nazis, South Africa&#8217;s apartheid regime or Cambodia&#8217;s Khmer Rouge and must be stopped, the head of a UN enquiry said Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Contending with the great scourges of Nazism, apartheid, the Khmer Rouge and other affronts required courage by great nations and ordinary human beings alike,&#8221; Michael Kirby told the UN Human Rights Council.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is now your solemn duty to address the scourge of human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His comments followed a searing 400-page report, released last month, that documented a range of gross human rights abuses in the country, including the extermination of people, enslavement and sexual violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gravity, scale, duration and nature of the unspeakable atrocities committed in the country reveal a totalitarian state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,&#8221; Kirby said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The country is a dark abyss where the human rights, the dignity and the humanity of the people are controlled, denied and ultimately annihilated.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report insisted North Korea&#8217;s leaders should answer for a litany of crimes against humanity before an international court.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011823&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama-m1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011819" alt=" White House announcement came as US President Barack Obama in an executive order imposed sanctions related to Russia's incursion into Ukraine. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama-m1.jpg" /></a> White House announcement came as US President Barack Obama in an executive order imposed sanctions related to Russia&#8217;s incursion into Ukraine. (Reuters)
<p>The US on Monday imposed sanctions on seven top Russian officials, including presidential aides, and lawmakers for their alleged actions in Crimea that violated Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty, the White House said.</p>
<p>The White House announcement came as US President Barack Obama in an executive order imposed sanctions related to Russia&#8217;s incursion into Ukraine.</p>
<p>The sanction was also imposed on former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US also will seek to hold accountable individuals who use their resources or influence to support or act on behalf of senior Russian government officials,&#8221; the White House said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recognise that the Russian leadership derives significant support from, and takes action through, individuals who do not themselves serve in any official capacity. Our current focus is to identify these individuals and target their personal assets, but not companies that they may manage on behalf of the Russian state,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The announcement came shortly after Crimea&#8217;s parliament on Monday declared the region an independent state after a referendum held on Sunday.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the European Union announced travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people they have linked to the unrest in Crimea.</p>
<p>The new executive order authorises US Treasury Secretary  Jack Lew to work with Secretary of State John Kerry to impose sanctions on &#8220;any individual or entity that operates in the Russian arms industry, and any designated individual or entity that acts on behalf of, or that provides material or other support to, any senior Russian government official&#8221;, it said.</p>
<p>The sanctions are intended to &#8220;impose costs on named individuals who wield influence in the Russian government and those responsible for the deteriorating situation in Ukraine,&#8221; the White House said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stand ready to use these authorities in a direct and targeted fashion as events warrant,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>In response to the Russian government&#8217;s actions contributing to the crisis in Ukraine, this new order lists seven Russian government officials who are being designated for sanctions.</p>
<p>The officials named in the list were Vladislav Surkov, Sergey Glazyev (both aides to President Vladimir Putin), Leonid Slutsky, Andrei Klishas, Valentina Matviyenko, Dmitry Rogozin, and Yelena Mizulina.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on four other individuals under for their actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine and in undermining the Government of Ukraine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011817&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

AP/Fareed Khan
<p>The police chief of Pakistan&#8217;s southern Sindh province on Monday ordered for security to be beefed up in areas inhabited by members of the minority Hindu community following tensions over alleged desecration of a holy book.</p>
<p>The orders came after a Hindu temple and a dharmashala were set on fire on Saturday night by a frenzied mob in Larkana city, the hometown of the Bhutto family and the stronghold of the Pakistan People&#8217;s Party.</p>
<p>The incident took place over alleged desecration of a holy book, marring Holi celebrations and prompting authorities to impose a curfew in the area.</p>
<p>The mob surrounded the house of a Hindu man accused of burning the pages of the holy book, prompting police to fire warning shots and teargas shells. In his directives, Sindh Inspector General Iqbal Mahmood ordered special measures to be adopted for security of all<br />
temples as well as community halls and other facilities frequented by members of the Hindu community across the province.</p>
<p>The Sindh police chief said no complacency could be allowed in providing protection to members of the community in particular and the public in general.</p>
<p>He also ordered coordinated patrolling and snap checking to be adopted as essential components of the security plan developed for areas across the province.</p>
<p>Mahmood said security must also be immediately strengthened across the board at all mosques, imambargahs, seminaries, mausoleums and other sensitive buildings, including government installations, educational institutions managed by missionaries and public places.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011814&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Sri Lankan police have arrested two rights activists under an anti-terrorism law to prevent them from spreading &#8220;communal disharmony&#8221; in the country&#8217;s war-torn northern region, ahead of voting on a resolution against the country at the UNHRC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two people were arrested at 10.30 last night under the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. They were acting so as to promote communal disharmony,&#8221; police spokesman Ajith Rohana said.</p>
<p>The arrests came ahead a key meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva later this month that is expected to pass a US-sponsored resolution against Sri Lanka over its<br />
alleged rights abuses during the ethnic war with LTTE rebels.</p>
<p>Human rights groups said the arrested activists were Father Praveen, Director of the Jaffna-based Center for Peace and Reconciliation and Ruki Fernando of the Colombo-based INFORM, a human rights documentation center.</p>
<p>They were arrested from the northern town of Kilinochchi.</p>
<p>The Kilinochchi&#8217;s police chief said: &#8220;Ruki Fernando and Rev Praveen behaved in a suspicious manner as they visited some families of those who have lost their family members.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UN Human Rights Council resolution is the third in as many years on Sri Lanka&#8217;s accountability and reconciliation with the Tamil minority after the end of the 37-year ethnic conflict.</p>
<p>Up to 40,000 Tamil civilians were killed at the end of the separatist war in 2009, rights groups and UN experts have said.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has long resisted calls for an international investigation calling its own domestic processes were credible enough to deal with the allegations of civilian deaths.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011787&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A son of deposed Islamist president Mohamed Morsi will face trial for alleged possession and use of hashish, judicial sources said , but no date has yet been fixed.</p>
<p>Abdullah Morsi, 19, was arrested on March 1 along with a friend for allegedly possessing two joints while they were in a car parked by the roadside in Qalyubia province north of Cairo.</p>
<p>The two were freed the next day pending investigation after agreeing to give urine samples which the prosecution says tested positive.</p>
<p>Morsi&#8217;s other son Osama has denied the charges against Abdullah, saying the authorities were &#8220;fabricating the case&#8221; and that his brother&#8217;s arrest was an attempt to &#8220;defame the family&#8221;.</p>
<p>Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood have been the target of a relentless government crackdown since the Islamist was ousted last July after just a year in office.</p>
<p>Amnesty International says that more than 1,400 people have been killed, mostly Morsi supporters, in street clashes since his ouster.</p>
<p>Morsi himself and several Brotherhood leaders have been put on trial on charges that could lead to the death penalty.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011768&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-m2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011725" alt="The timing of the last words has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane's disappearance. (AP) " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-m2.jpg" /></a> The timing of the last words has sharpened suspicions that one or both of the pilots may have been involved in the plane&#8217;s disappearance. (AP)
<p>Amid mounting evidence that the disappearance of the Malaysian plane was a deliberate act, authorities on Monday said the last words from the cockpit were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot as search operations covering 11 countries were intensified.</p>
<p>Evidence indicating that the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that went missing 10 days ago was sabotaged or hijacked was mounting after it emerged that the last message from the cockpit was spoken after someone had begun disabling one of the plane&#8217;s automatic tracking systems.</p>
<p>The last words &#8212; &#8220;All right, good night&#8221; &#8212; were believed to have been spoken by the co-pilot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initial investigations indicate it was the co-pilot who basically spoke,&#8221; Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya told a media briefing.</p>
<p>Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and his first officer Fariq Abdul Hamid are under scanner of the probe into the disappearance of the plane.</p>
<p>The last signal from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) was received 12 minutes before the co-pilot&#8217;s final words.</p>
<p>The officials are also looking at the possibility whether the plane -with 239 people on board including five Indians and one Indian-Canadian &#8211; had taken advantage of the busy airways over the Bay of Bengal and avoided suspicion of military radars.</p>
<p>Malaysia&#8217;s defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said, &#8220;I can confirm that search and rescue operations in the northern and southern corridors have already begun. Countries including Malaysia, Australia, China, Indonesia and Kazakhstan have already initiated search and rescue operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>A detailed map of the northern and southern corridors where the search operations were on was released on Monday.</p>
<p>Malaysia got in touch with countries along the northern and southern corridors about the flight. These countries include: Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, China, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Australia and France.</p>
<p>Australian was leading the search of the remote southern Indian Ocean for the missing plane.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan joined the search on Monday in the farthest northwest section of the search area, taking the total number of countries involved in the operation to 26.</p>
<p>During the last 24 hours, Prime Minister Najib Razak has spoken to the Prime Minister of Australia and the Premier of China. Malaysia&#8217;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent diplomatic notes to all countries involved in the search operation, Hishammuddin said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday assured Najib of &#8220;all assistance&#8221; by Indian authorities when the latter called him to seek India&#8217;s &#8220;technical assistance&#8221;.</p>
<p>Najib last week said authorities are trying to trace the plane across two possible corridors &#8211; in the north to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern corridor from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Hishamuddin said hopes had not been lost. &#8220;There has been no distress call, no ransom demand, no parties claiming responsibility&#8230;so there is always hope,&#8221; he said. He informed that aviation experts from China were joining the search team.</p>
<p>Hishamuddin said two Malaysian ships had been deployed and French civil aviation teams have also joined the search.</p>
<p>Australia is sending extra two P 3 Orions and C130 Hercules.</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities said they had begun probing the crew the day the aircraft disappeared.  Police have visited the houses of the pilot and the co-pilot twice.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities who had already cleared the passengers on board have been asked to take a re-look.</p>
<p>Jauhari said so far there had been no evidence from phone companies of any passenger trying to call when the plane turned around. Hishamuddin said Inmarsat had got six pings from the plane.</p>
<p>The satellite could see aircraft at alleviation and could give the time but not the location.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point, I would like to stress that Malaysia has been co-operating with the FBI, Interpol and other relevant international law enforcement authorities since day one,&#8221; Hishamuddin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our priority has always been to find the aircraft. We would not withhold any information that could help. But we also have a responsibility not to release information until it has been verified by the international investigations team,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;With support from our many international partners, this new phase of the search is underway. Assets are being deployed, and search and rescue operations have begun. I wish to thank our partners from around the world for their continued support,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011744&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-m2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011725" alt="Investigators are trying to determine if it had flown low and used &quot;terrain masking&quot; during the time it was missing from the radar coverage. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-m2.jpg" /></a> Investigators are trying to determine if it had flown low and used &#8220;terrain masking&#8221; during the time it was missing from the radar coverage. (AP)
<p>Malaysian authorities are probing new information that the missing plane with 239 people on board dropped to an altitude of 5,000 feet or possibly lower to evade radar detection after it turned back midair.</p>
<p>Investigators are poring over the Boeing 777 flight MH370 profile to determine if it had flown low and used &#8220;terrain masking&#8221; during most of the eight hours it was missing from the radar coverage of possibly at least three countries, the New Straits Times reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The officials are looking at the possibility whether the plane -with 239 people on board including five Indians and one Indian-Canadian &#8211; had taken advantage of the busy airways over the Bay of Bengal and avoided suspicion of military radars.</p>
<p>&#8220;The person who had control over the aircraft has a solid knowledge of avionics and navigation, and left a clean track. It passed low over Kelantan, that was true,&#8221; the paper quoted officials as saying.</p>
<p>The plane &#8220;would appear to be just another commercial aircraft on its way to its destination,&#8221; it said.  &#8220;It&#8217;s possible that the aircraft had hugged the terrain in some areas, that are mountainous to avoid radar detection.&#8221;</p>
<p>This technique is called terrain masking and is used by military pilots to fly to their targets stealthily, using the topography to mask their approach from prying microwaves.</p>
<p>The officials said this type of flying is considered very dangerous, especially in low-light conditions and spatial disorientation, and airsickness could easily set in.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the ongoing search is divided into two massive areas, the data that the investigating team is collating is leading us more towards the north,&#8221; sources said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Najib Razak last week said authorities are trying to trace the plane across two possible corridors &#8211; in the north to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a  southern corridor from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Officials involved in the multi-national investigation said the probe would also focus on regions with disused airports equipped with long runways.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two likely possibilities &#8211; either the plane landed somewhere and the engine was shut down or it crashed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as the first country comes up with evidence of the flight&#8217;s position after its last confirmed position (320km northwest of Penang), we will be able to refine the search and better determine its possible location,&#8221; the officials said.</p>
<p>The mystery of the missing plane from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing since March 8 continued to baffle aviation and security authorities who have not succeeded in tracking the<br />
aircraft despite deploying hi-tech radar and other gadgets.</p>
<p>Malaysian police have refocused the probe on the crew, passengers and ground staff based on &#8220;new leads&#8221; that the plane was deliberately disabled and its transponder switched<br />
off before the plane veered from its path.</p>
<p>Authorities examined a flight simulator found at the home of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of the missing plane, but initial forensics checks showed it was &#8220;clean&#8221;, the paper said.</p>
<p>However, experts are probing deeper into the footprint of the homemade simulator. Investigators are also probing a flight engineer who was among the passengers on the missing plane.</p>
<p>A Malaysian opposition leader and a close friend of Zaharie has said the pilot would have had the safety of his passengers uppermost in his mind, adding if there was foul play like hijacking then his friend would have been a victim.</p>
<p>Peter Chong, an aide to MP R Sivarasa of opposition PKR party, was reacting to a report in a British paper which termed Zaharie as a &#8220;political fanatic&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zaharie is someone who is very passionate about flying and very aware of the great responsibility a pilot bears towards his passengers and crew,&#8221; Chong said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a management pilot, which means he doesn&#8217;t just fly but is involved in training and examining other pilots.&#8221; Zaharie, 53, began flying with MAS in 1981 and has more than 18,000 flying hours under his belt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of countries involved in the search and rescue operation has increased from 14 to 25.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Sunday said his country will lead a search of the remote southern Indian Ocean for the missing plane.</p>
<p>Asked if Australian agencies had any data to back up the theory of mising plane&#8217;s presence in the southern Indian Ocean, Abbott said he didn&#8217;t have any information.</p>
<p>&#8220;But all of our agencies that could possibly help in this area are scouring their data to see if there&#8217;s anything that they can add to the understanding of this mystery,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Australia had two AP-3C Orion surveillance planes assisting with the search, now in its second week. &#8220;One of our Orions as I understand it has been redeployed to the Indian Ocean search,&#8221; Abbott said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got two Orions which have been assisting with the search. They remain available to assist in whatever way the Malaysian authorities wish and it&#8217;s my intention to talk later today with the Malaysians to see if there&#8217;s additional help that Australia can offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were six Australians and two New Zealanders on  the missing jet.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011718&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/flight-med.jpg" /></a> Notes offering support to relatives of those on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. (Reuters)
<p>Malaysian police are investigating a flight engineer who was among the passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines plane as they focus on the pilots and anyone else on board who had technical flying knowledge, a senior police official said.</p>
<p>The aviation engineer is Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat, 29, a Malaysian who has said on social media he had worked for a private jet charter company.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we are looking into Mohd Khairul as well as the other passengers and crew. The focus is on anyone else who might have had aviation skills on that plane,&#8221; a senior police official with knowledge of the investigations said.</p>
<p>Malaysian investigators are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, crew and ground staff who worked on the missing Boeing 777-200ER for clues as to why someone on board flew it hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of miles off course.</p>
<p>No trace of the plane has been found more than a week after it vanished but investigators believe it was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and of commercial navigation.</p>
<p>Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday evidence pointed to a deliberate diversion of the flight, given the controlled way it was apparently turned around and flown far to the west of its original route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
<p>A flight engineer is responsible for overseeing systems on a plane during flights to confirm they are working correctly and to make repairs if necessary. As an engineer specializing in executive jets, Khairul would not necessarily have all the knowledge needed to divert and fly a large jetliner.</p>
<p>Khairul had said he worked for a Swiss-based jet charter firm called Execujet Aviation Group, but the company declined to say whether it still employed him. In a picture posted on Khairul&#8217;s Facebook account in 2011, he identified himself as an employee of Execujet&#8217;s Malaysian operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t disclose anything. We want to protect the family&#8217;s privacy,&#8221; an official at the company&#8217;s Malaysian office said.</p>
<p>Khairul, a father of one daughter, had recently bought a house on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, and had more than 10 years experience as a flight engineer, his father Selamat Omar said. He declined to say whether he believed his son could have been involved in any foul play.</p>
<p>Selamat said he and other family members were supposed to visit Khairul&#8217;s new house this month. But Khairul had told his father on Thursday he had to go for a job in Beijing and that they would reschedule. That was the last time they spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Khairul was doing well in his job and was a good son. He would come visit us at least once a month,&#8221; Selamat said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011654&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Japan on Monday said it would &#8220;strongly urge&#8221; Russia not to annex Crimea, joining a chorus of criticism over a weekend referendum by the region of Ukraine as Washington hinted at fresh sanctions against Moscow.</p>
<p>With more than half the ballots counted, preliminary results showed 95.5 per cent of voters were in favour of leaving Ukraine and rejoining former political master Russia.</p>
<p>The vote would mark the most radical redrawing of the map of Europe since Kosovo&#8217;s 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia, and follows the ouster of Ukraine&#8217;s pro-Moscow leader.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our country does not approve the result&#8221; of the referendum, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, the Japanese government&#8217;s top spokesman, told a regular news conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Japan will strongly urge Russia to abide by international law completely, respect Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and integrity of its territory, and not to go ahead with annexing Crimea,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The comments came as US President Barack Obama hinted at possible additional sanctions on Russia, warning his counterpart Vladimir Putin that the United States and its allies would &#8220;never&#8221; recognise Crimea&#8217;s breakaway vote held on Sunday.</p>
<p>Suga said Japan would cooperate with other Group of Seven world powers in dealing with the Crimea issue.</p>
<p>Tokyo has started to study possible economic sanctions against Russia, the leading Nikkei business daily reported on Sunday, citing unnamed government sources.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011616&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011556" alt="In this March 6, 2014, photo, President Barack Obama talks about the situation in Ukraine, in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. (AP photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama3.jpg" /></a> In this March 6, 2014, photo, President Barack Obama talks about the situation in Ukraine, in the briefing room of the White House in Washington. (AP photo)
<p>President Barack Obama told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday the United States rejected the results of a secession referendum in Ukraine&#8217;s Crimea region and warned that Washington was ready to impose sanctions on Moscow over the crisis.</p>
<p>With Washington and its European allies expected to slap &#8220;targeted&#8221; punitive measures on Russian officials as early as Monday, the White House said Obama made clear to Putin that the dispute could still be resolved diplomatically but that Russia first must halt military incursions into Ukrainian territory.</p>
<p>Confirming what was considered a foregone conclusion in Sunday&#8217;s hastily called referendum in Crimea, a region with a Russian-speaking majority, regional authorities said that with over half the vote counted 95.5 percent had chosen the option of annexation of the strategic peninsula by Moscow.</p>
<p>The regional government in Crimea, now controlled by Russian forces, went ahead with the ballot despite fierce US and European opposition, underscoring the West&#8217;s limited leverage in the worst standoff of its kind since the end of the Cold War.</p>
<p>&#8220;He (Obama) emphasized that Russia&#8217;s actions were in violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and that, in coordination with our European partners, we are prepared to impose additional costs on Russia for its actions,&#8221; the White House said in a summary of Obama&#8217;s telephone call with Putin.</p>
<p>Obama suggested to Putin that the referendum was a sham carried out &#8220;under duress of Russian military intervention&#8221; and Washington and the international community would never accept the results, the White House said.</p>
<p>According to the Kremlin, Putin told Obama the referendum on union with Russia was legitimate the two leaders agreed on the need to cooperate to stabilize Ukraine. The readouts of the call from both capitals spoke of the need to deploy international monitors to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Amid accusations from Republican critics that Obama had not shown enough resolve against Putin, the US administration appeared intent on proving it was not bluffing over its threat of consequences for the seizure of Crimea.</p>
<p>US options to prevent Russian from formally absorbing the strategic region are few. But some officials in Washington are hopeful that instead of pressing ahead with such a provocative action, Putin may hold off for now, seeking to avoid further escalation of the crisis.</p>
<p>White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said the administration would step up pressure on Russia. &#8220;You can expect sanctions designations in the coming days,&#8221; Pfeiffer told NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press,&#8221; as the administration prepared to identify Russians whom the United States will seek to punish with visa bans and asset freezes the president authorized earlier this month.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated Sanctions</strong></p>
<p>A US sanctions announcement is expected on Monday, and foreign ministers from the European Union, which has major trade ties with Russia, will decide on possible similar action in Brussels on the same day, Western sources said.</p>
<p>While Washington and its allies have ruled out military action, U.S. and European Union officials worked over the weekend to coordinate lists of those to be targeted initially.</p>
<p>Sanctions are not expected to be imposed on Putin himself at this point, and a congressional source said the first round could also spare Russian oligarchs close to him. Though news reports have cited some senior Putin aides as possible targets, Western governments could decide to start mostly with lower- or mid-level officials seen as complicit in the takeover of Crimea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Otherwise you leave yourself with no room to escalate&#8221; the allied response, the congressional source said. The measures would include bans on travel to the United States and Europe and a freeze on bank accounts and other assets held in those places.</p>
<p>Another congressional aide said he believed the administration was looking at &#8220;targeted sanctions&#8221; to be imposed on some Russian officials based on their holding positions of authority over the Crimea intervention rather than direct evidence of involvement. But the aide stressed that he was not privy to the administration&#8217;s specific plans.</p>
<p>It was also unclear whether those sanctions might be announced on Monday or held in abeyance if deemed necessary.<br />
Not expected to be named in the latest round of sanctions, however, are the heads of Russian oil company Rosneft or gas company Gazprom, with such figures possibly held in reserve if further punitive measures are needed.</p>
<p><strong>Complications</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, the Obama administration is mindful that Russia could retaliate with steps of its own. Any efforts to punish Moscow are complicated by the need for cooperation on Iran nuclear diplomacy, removal of Syrian chemical weapons and use of Russian territory for U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s aides have discussed the potential for &#8220;blowback&#8221; in other areas of U.S.-Russia relations and believe that Moscow will not take dramatic steps on issues unrelated to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Pfeiffer sidestepped the question of whether Washington would provide military aid to Ukraine&#8217;s interim government, which has accused Russia of violating its sovereignty. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at all ways of assistance,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Pfeiffer said Putin has a choice. &#8220;Is he going to continue to further isolate himself, further hurt his economy, further diminish Russian influence in the world, or is he going to do the right thing?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, just back from a visit to Ukraine, urged the administration to provide military assistance to Ukraine, resume development of a US missile defense system for Eastern Europe and take steps toward NATO membership for Georgia and Moldova.</p>
<p>&#8220;The United States of America has to first of all have a fundamental reassessment of our relationship with Vladimir Putin. No more &#8216;reset&#8217; button,&#8221; McCain told CNN, referring to Obama&#8217;s outreach to Russia early in his first term.</p>
<p>In a phone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Russian forces must return to their bases and objected to Moscow&#8217;s military activities in Ukraine&#8217;s Kherson oblast area and continuing &#8220;provocations&#8221; in Eastern Ukraine, a senior State Department official said.</p>
<p>Lavrov and Kerry, according to a Russian statement, &#8220;agreed to continue work to find a resolution on Ukraine through a speedy launch of constitutional reform.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011555&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/crimea2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011550" alt="People celebrate in Lenin Square, in downtown Simferopol, Ukraine, Sunday, March 16, 2014." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/crimea2.jpg" /></a> People celebrate in Lenin Square, in downtown Simferopol, Ukraine, Sunday, March 16, 2014.

<p>Just two weeks after Russian troops seized their peninsula, Crimeans voted Sunday to leave Ukraine and join Russia, overwhelmingly approving a referendum that sought to unite the strategically important Black Sea region with the country it was part of for some 250 years.</p>
<p>The vote was widely condemned by Western leaders, who planned to move swiftly to punish Russia with economic sanctions.</p>
<p>As the votes were counted, a jubilant crowd gathered around a statue of Vladimir Lenin in the center of Simferopol to celebrate with song and dance. Many held Russian flags, and some unfurled a handwritten banner reading &#8220;We&#8217;re Russian and proud of it.&#8221; Fireworks exploded in the skies above.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to go back home, and today we are going back home,&#8221; said Viktoria Chernyshova, a 38-year-old businesswoman. &#8220;We needed to save ourselves from those unprincipled clowns who have taken power in Kiev.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s new government in Kiev called the referendum a &#8220;circus&#8221; directed at gunpoint by Moscow, referring to the thousands of troops that now occupy the peninsula, which has traded hands repeatedly since ancient times.</p>
<p>The referendum offered voters the choice of seeking annexation by Russia or remaining in Ukraine with greater autonomy. After 50 percent of the ballots were counted, more than 95 percent of voters had approved splitting off and joining Russia, according to Mikhail Malishev, head of the referendum committee.</p>
<p>Final results were not expected until Monday.</p>
<p>Opponents of secession appeared to have stayed away Sunday, denouncing the vote as a cynical power play and land grab by Russia.</p>
<p>Putin insisted the referendum was conducted in &#8220;full accordance with international law and the U.N. charter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Russia was expected to face strong sanctions Monday from the U.S. and Europe for going forward with the vote, which could also encourage rising pro-Russian sentiment in Ukraine&#8217;s east and lead to further divisions in this nation of 46 million. Residents in western Ukraine and the capital, Kiev, are strongly pro-West and Ukrainian nationalist.</p>
<p>Andrew Weiss, vice president for Russian and East European studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, suggested the confrontation could intensify.</p>
<p>Russia &#8220;is really turning its back on the outside world and is basically going to say to the West, &#8216;Now, go ahead. Show us how tough you are.&#8217; And the West, I think, is struggling to come with an adequate response.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Crimean parliament planned to meet Monday to formally ask Moscow to be annexed, and Crimean lawmakers were to fly to Moscow later in the day for talks, Crimea&#8217;s pro-Russia prime minister said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Russian lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky said the annexation could take &#8220;from three days to three months,&#8221; according to the Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>Some residents in Crimea said they feared the new Ukrainian government that took over, when President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia last month, would oppress them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like they&#8217;re crazy Texans in western Ukraine. Imagine if the Texans suddenly took over power (in Washington) and told everyone they should speak Texan,&#8221; said Ilya Khlebanov, a voter in Simferopol.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s new prime minister insisted that neither Ukraine nor the West would recognize the vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the stage direction of the Russian Federation, a circus performance is underway: the so-called referendum,&#8221; Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Sunday. &#8220;Also taking part in the performance are 21,000 Russian troops, who with their guns are trying to prove the legality of the referendum.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the polls closed, the White House again denounced the vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;The international community will not recognize the results of a poll administered under threats of violence,&#8221; it said in a statement. &#8220;Russia&#8217;s actions are dangerous and destabilizing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Russia raised the stakes Saturday when its forces, backed by helicopter gunships and armored vehicles, took control of the Ukrainian village of Strilkove and a key natural gas distribution plant nearby, the first Russian military move into Ukraine beyond the Crimean peninsula of 2 million people.</p>
<p>The Russian forces later returned the village but kept control of the gas plant. On Sunday, Ukrainian soldiers were digging trenches and erecting barricades between the village and the gas plant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not let them advance further into Ukrainian territory,&#8221; said Serhiy Kuz, commander of a Ukrainian paratrooper battalion.</p>
<p>Despite the threat of sanctions, Putin has vigorously resisted calls to pull back in Crimea. At the United Nations on Saturday, Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution declaring the referendum illegal.</p>
<p>However, Putin spoke with President Barack Obama and supported a proposal from Germany to expand an international observer mission in Ukraine, the Kremlin said Sunday in a statement after the vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;The heads of state noted that despite the differences in their assessments, it was necessary to work together to find a way to stabilize the situation in Ukraine,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who also spoke with Putin on Sunday, wants more observers sent to tense areas, particularly in eastern Ukraine, her spokesman said. Putin told Obama that such a mission would be welcome but would need to be extended to all regions in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>In Donetsk, one of the main cities in eastern Ukraine, pro-Russia demonstrators called Sunday for a referendum similar to the one in Crimea.</p>
<p>In the streets of Sevastopol, the Crimean port where Russia now leases a major naval base from Ukraine for $98 million a year, speakers blared the city anthem, but the military threat was not far away, a Russian naval warship still blocked the port&#8217;s outlet to the Black Sea, trapping Ukrainian boats.</p>
<p>At a polling station inside a historic school, tears came to Vladimir Lozovoy, a 75-year-old retired Soviet naval officer, as he talked about his vote.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to cry. I have finally returned to my motherland. It is an incredible feeling. This is the thing I have been waiting for for 23 years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But Crimea&#8217;s large Muslim Tatar minority, whose families had been forcibly removed from their homeland and sent to Central Asia during Soviet times, remained defiant.</p>
<p>The Crimea referendum &#8220;is a clown show, a circus,&#8221; Tatar activist Refat Chubarov said on Crimea&#8217;s Tatar television station. &#8220;This is a tragedy, an illegitimate government with armed forces from another country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fate of Ukrainian soldiers trapped in their Crimean bases by pro-Russian forces was still uncertain. But Ukraine&#8217;s acting defense minister, Igor Tenyuk, was quoted as saying Sunday that an agreement had been reached with Russia not to block Ukrainian soldiers in Crimea through Friday. It was not clear exactly what that meant.</p>
<p>Ethnic Ukrainians interviewed outside the Ukrainian Orthodox cathedral of Vladimir and Olga said they refused to take part in the referendum, calling it an illegal charade stage-managed by Moscow. Some said they were scared of the potential for widespread harassment.</p>
<p>Vasyl Ovcharuk, a retired gas pipe layer, predicted dark days ahead for Crimea.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will end up in military action, in which peaceful people will suffer. And that means everybody,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Shells and bullets are blind.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011548&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia15.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011505" alt="Journalists outside co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid’s house near Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. AP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia15.jpg" /></a> Journalists outside co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid’s house near Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The final words from the missing Malaysian jetliner’s cockpit gave no indication anything was wrong even though one of the plane’s communications systems had already been disabled, officials said Sunday, adding to suspicions that one or both of the pilots were involved in the disappearance. </span></p>
<p>As authorities examined a flight simulator that was confiscated from the home of one of the pilots and dug through the background of all 239 people on board and the ground crew that serviced the plane, they were also grappling with the enormity of the search ahead of them.</p>
<p>The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 took off from Kuala Lumpur at around 12.40 am on March 8, headed to Beijing. On Saturday, Malaysia’s government confirmed that the plane was deliberately diverted and may have flown as far north as Central Asia, or south into the vast reaches of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Authorities have said someone on board the plane first disabled one of its communications systems — the Aircraft and Communications <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Addressing and Reporting System, or ACARS — at 1.07 a.m. Around 14 minutes later, the transponder, which identifies the plane to commercial radar systems, was also shut down. The fact that they went dark separately is strong evidence that the plane’s disappearance was deliberate.</span></p>
<p>On Sunday, Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference that that the final, reassuring words from the cockpit — “All right, good night” — were spoken to air traffic controllers after ACARS was shut down. Whoever spoke did not mention any trouble on board, seemingly misleading ground control.</p>
<p>Air force Maj Gen Affendi Buang told reporters he did not know whether it was the pilot or co-pilot who spoke to air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>Given the expanse of land and water that might need to be searched, the plane might take months — or longer — to find, or might never be located. The search area now includes 11 countries the plane might have flown over, with the number of countries involved in the operation increasing from 14 to 25.</p>
<p>The search effort initially focused on the relatively shallow waters of the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca, where the plane was first thought to be. On Sunday, Malaysia briefed envoys from nearly two dozen nations and appealed for help in the search along two arcs stretching from the shores of Caspian Sea to the far south of the Indian Ocean. “From focusing mainly on shallow seas, we are now looking at large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans,” Hishammuddin said.</p>
<p>In the United States, Dan Pfeiffer, senior adviser to President Barack Obama, told NBC’s Meet the Press that the FBI was supporting the criminal probe.</p>
<p>Investigators are trying to answer these questions: If the two pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own volition? Did one or more of the passengers manage to break into the cockpit, or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then pilot the plane? And what possible motive could there be for flying off with the plane?</p>
<p>Malaysia’s police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said he requested countries with citizens on board the plane to investigate their background, looking for ties to terrorist groups, aviation skills or evidence of prior contact with the pilots.</p>
<p>Police searched the homes of both pilots on Saturday, the first time they had done so since the plane went missing. Asked why it took them so long, Khalid said authorities “didn’t see the necessity in the early stages”.</p>
<p>Khalid said police confiscated the elaborate flight simulator that one of the pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had built in his home and reassembled it in their offices to study it for clues. Zaharie, 53, who has three grown children and one grandchild, had previously posted photos online of the simulator.</p>
<p>Malaysian police are also investigating engineers and ground staff who may have had contact with the plane before it took off.</p>
<p>ACARS is used to send information about the plane’s engines and other parts to the airline. Even though it was disabled on Flight 370, it continued to send out faint hourly pulses that were recorded by a satellite. The last ‘ping’ was sent out at 8.11 am — 7 hours and 31 minutes after the plane took off.</p>
<p>While many people believe the plane has crashed, there is a very small possibility it may have landed somewhere and be relatively intact. Affendi and Hishammuddin said it was possible for the plane to ‘ping’ when on the ground if its electrical systems were undamaged.</p>
<p>Australia said it was sending one of its two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search to islands in the Indian Ocean. The plane will search the north and west of the Cocos Islands, a remote Australian territory.</p>
<p>Given that the northern route the plane may have taken would take it over countries with busy airspace, most experts say the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen the southern route. The southern Indian Ocean is the world’s third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage.</p>
<p>Zaharie, the pilot, was a supporter of a Malaysian opposition political party that is locked in a bitter dispute with the government, according to postings on his Facebook page and a friend, Peter Chong, who is a party member.</p>
<p>Chong said that he last saw Zaharie a week before the pilot left on the flight for Beijing, and that they had agreed to meet on his return to organise a shopping trip for poor children.</p>
<p>“If I am on a flight, I would choose Captain Zaharie,” he said. “He is dedicated to his job, he is a professional and he loves flying.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011499&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[According to sources, Indian PM assured Najib of “all assistance” by Indian authorities in “corroborating possible pathways” Flight MH370.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011406&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/delhi36.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011409" alt="Japan Coast Guard personnel prepare their Gulfstream V Jet aircraft to search for the missing plane over the waters of the South China Sea.  REUTERS" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/delhi36.jpg" /></a> Japan Coast Guard personnel prepare their Gulfstream V Jet aircraft to search for the missing plane over the waters of the South China Sea. REUTERS
<p>The search for the missing Malaysian airplane MH370 will now be expanded to the Northern and Southern Arc, with the Malaysian authorities expected to share the fresh coordinates with the Indian agencies in the next few days.</p>
<p>This will mean that the Indian authorities will comb a broad sweep of area, on land and sea, since the Northern Arc covers parts of northern India, and the Southern Arc covers Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. So far, the Indian establishment had mobilised aircrafts and ships in order to search the waters of the Andaman Sea.</p>
<p>This emerged as the new area of search as Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called up Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while Indian officials were briefed in Kuala Lumpur.<br />
Razak called up Singh on Sunday evening, and requested “technical assistance” from Indian authorities in tracing the plane.</p>
<p>Official sources in New Delhi confirmed the call, which took place at about 5.30 pm, as Singh spoke with his Malaysian counterpart from his Race Course Road residence.</p>
<p>According to sources, Singh assured Najib of “all assistance” by Indian authorities in “corroborating possible pathways” Flight MH370 may have taken.</p>
<p>Sources told The Indian Express that the Malaysian side briefed the Indian High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur T S Tirumurti and the Ministry of External Affairs’ joint secretary (south) Sanjay Bhattacharya — who is also in Malaysia — about the progress in the investigations on Sunday.<br />
A government source told The Indian Express, “The Malaysian side were very appreciative of Indian efforts to find the missing aircraft. Now, they have to give us the coordinates of the Northern Arc —  which covers several countries, and the Southern Arc — which covers the Indian Ocean. The Indian side will then work on those two possible flight paths.”</p>
<p>Singh, during the phone conversation with Najib, shared “his concern and anxiety” about the fate of the aircraft and the wellbeing of the passengers, and assured all possible assistance from the concerned Indian authorities.</p>
<p>The conversation took place, a day after Najib said Malaysian investigators suspect that the communication system in the missing Boeing 777-200 aircraft was “deliberately disabled” and its transponder switched off before it veered from its path and flew for more than seven hours.</p>
<p>This had led to a theory about a possible 9/11-type attack on India, as former US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott had tweeted : “Malaysian plane mystery: Direction, fuel load &amp; range now lead some to suspect  hijackers planned a 9/11-type attack on an Indian city.” However, Talbott, whose comments went viral over the last 24 hours, called it “speculation” on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Malaysian#370 as hijack: 1 of many theories. Speculation: hijackers headed toward India but crashed like UA#93 on 9/11”, he tweeted on Sunday.</p>
<p>India had put on hold its search operations as it said it was awaiting fresh instructions from Malaysian authorities.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011406&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Officials say Fulani Muslim herders attacked three Christian villages and killed more than 100 civilians. Hundreds of thatched-roof huts were set ablaze.</p>
<p>Thousands have been killed in recent years in competition for land and water between mainly Muslim Fulani herdsmen and Christian farmers across Nigeria&#8217;s Middle Belt. More than 100 people were killed in similar attacks in neighboring Katsina state last week.</p>
<p>Chenshyi village chief Nuhu Moses said Sunday that gunmen killed more than 50 people including the pastor&#8217;s wife and children. He said the entire village in the southern part of Kaduna state was destroyed.</p>
<p>Local government acting chairman Daniel Anyip said about 100 people were killed in attacks on three villages on Friday night.</p>
<p>The Southern Kaduna Indigenes Progressive Forum blamed the government for failing to take action.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011326&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukr-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011311" alt="Voters can choose to become part of Russia or retain more autonomy but stay in Ukraine -- a vote for the status quo is not an option. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukr-m.jpg" /></a> Voters can choose to become part of Russia or retain more autonomy but stay in Ukraine &#8212; a vote for the status quo is not an option. (AP)
<p>Crimeans on Sunday voted in a unique referendum on breaking away from Ukraine to join Russia that has precipitated a Cold War-style security crisis on Europe&#8217;s eastern frontier.</p>
<p>Cossacks and pro-Moscow militias were seen patrolling at some polling stations and Russian flags were being flown everywhere from city buses to convoys of bikers roaming the streets.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s new government and most of the international community except Russia have said they will not recognise a result expected to be overwhelmingly in favour of immediate secession.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a historic moment, everyone will live happily,&#8221; Sergiy Aksyonov, the local pro-Moscow prime minister, told reporters after casting his ballot in the regional capital Simferopol.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will celebrate this evening,&#8221; Aksyonov said, after a man waving a blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag and demanding it be put up inside the polling station was pushed away by security guards.</p>
<p>The Black Sea peninsula is inhabited mostly by ethnic Russians and has been seized by Russian forces over the past month after the ouster of Ukraine&#8217;s pro-Kremlin leader in February, plunging US-Russia ties to their lowest point since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s interim President Oleksandr Turchynov, who last month replaced the ousted Viktor Yanukovych, called for a boycott of the ballot, accusing Moscow of preparing an invasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;The result has been pre-planned by the Kremlin as a formal justification to send in its troops and start a war that will destroy people&#8217;s lives and the economic prospects for Crimea,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Some Crimeans who requested anonymity said they were planning to spoil their ballots in protest and there was a call on social media for people to stay at home and cook vareniki &#8212; Ukrainian dumplings &#8212; instead of going out to vote.</p>
<p>Accredited journalists including AFP were prevented from entering some polling stations in the port city of Sevastopol and the regional capital Simferopol, and several people were seen voting in Sevastopol even before the polls opened.</p>
<p>Foreign observers were present but the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) declined an invitation to monitor saying it was not official because it did not come from Ukraine&#8217;s national government.</p>
<p>Voters can choose to become part of Russia or retain more autonomy but stay in Ukraine &#8212; a vote for the status quo is not an option.</p>
<p>Preliminary results were expected to be announced soon after polls close at 8:00 pm (1800 GMT). The referendum committee said turnout was at 44 per cent a third of the way through voting.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011308&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Indian intelligence officials have cleared the five Indians on board the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, police here said on Sunday</span></p>
<p>The plane carrying 239 people, including five Indians, vanished from radar screens last Saturday one hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. As new information emerged that the communication system in the missing aircraft was deliberately disabled and its transponder switched off before the plane veered from its path, police focused their probe on the crew, passengers and the ground staff and sought background checks of all people on board.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still awaiting reply from all agencies, especially intelligence reports from many countries. So far, Indian and Chinese authorities have cleared the list,&#8221; police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said. Khalid said they were awaiting for an acknowledgement from several countries contacted.</p>
<p>He said the investigation will be conducted for hijacking and terrorist acts. Prime Minister Najib Razak had said on Saturday that investigators will refocus on the crew and passengers of the plane. Khalid said they will also probe the ground staff also.</p>
<p>The list of passengers on board includes 154 Chinese, 38 Malaysians, 7 Indonesians, 6 Australians, 5 Indians, 4 Americans and 2 Canadians.</p>
<p>Indians, including three from one family, were identified as Chetna Kolekar, 55, Swanand Kolekar, 23, Vinod Kolekar, 59, Chandrika Sharma, 51, and Kranti Shirsatha, 44.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011286&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Hundreds of Latvians have celebrated Legionnaires Day — which their government abolished in 2000 — by paying tribute to World War II veterans who fought alongside Nazi troops.</span></p>
<div>
<p>After a church service in the Lutheran Cathedral in Riga, the capital, on Sunday, the marchers went to the Freedom Monument, where they laid roses in the red and white colors of the Latvian flag.</p>
<p>Police closely guarded the peaceful march.</p>
<p>A small group from Latvia&#8217;s Russian-speaking minority protested from a nearby park behind police barricades, shouting: &#8220;Shame!&#8221; and &#8220;Fascism will never end!&#8221;</p>
<p>During World War II, Latvian soldiers fought alongside Nazi troops in a Latvian Waffen SS unit against the Red Army, which invaded in 1944.</p>
<p>Many Latvians honor war veterans on Legionnaires Day, but Russians see it as glorifying fascism.</p>

<p>A Hindu temple and a dharmashala have been set on fire by a frenzied mob in Pakistan&#8217;s southern Sindh province over alleged desecration of a holy book, marring Holi celebrations and prompting authorities to impose a curfew in the area.</p>
<p>The mob attacked the temple overnight in Larkana city, the hometown of the Bhutto family and the stronghold of the Pakistan People&#8217;s Party.</p>
<p>It surrounded the house of a Hindu man accused of burning the pages of the holy book, prompting police to fire warning shots and teargas shells.</p>
<p>A local police official said that soon after the news of the man desecrating the book spread, angry students and followers of local religious seminaries started gathering in groups and demanded the man be handed over to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They set on fire the main Hindu temple in the Jinnah Bagh Chowk area which also completely gutted the adjoining dharmashala,&#8221; the official said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curfew has now been imposed in the area with heavy patrolling by the paramilitary rangers and police who had to baton charge and use teargas shells to disperse the mob,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Hindu man, who was accused of blasphemy, has been taken into protective custody.</p>
<p>According to local media reports, initial investigation indicates that the man had rented the house from a Muslim family and cleaned it before he moved in. &#8220;He may have burned the holy book inadvertently,&#8221; a policeman said.</p>
<p>Tensions gripped the Larkana&#8217;s Jinnah Bagh and some other parts of the city after mob went berserk. People from the area said Holi celebrations have been called off in various localities due to the security situation.</p>
<p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah directed DIG Larkana to bring the situation under control and probe the incident.</p>
<p>Traffic remained sparse in the affected areas as a complete shut down was observed and businesses, shops, filling stations and markets were closed.</p>
<p>Additional contingents of police and rangers were deployed in the affected areas to avoid any untoward incident.</p>
<p>A ban on pillion riding was also imposed in the city  under Section 144.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are taking strict action. We have already booked people for vandalism and arrests are being carried out. No blasphemy case has been registered,&#8221; a senior aide of PPP<br />
leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari told PTI. Bhutto took to social media network Twitter to express his anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deliberate attempts to disturb religious harmony will not succeed. Maintaining peace in this volatile situation is the number one priority,&#8221; he tweeted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider attack on temple akin to attack on GKB (Garhi Khuda Bakhsh). Perpetrators will b(e) brought 2 justice as will people who spread lies and incited violence,&#8221; he added.     Garhi Khuda Bakhsh is a village in Sindh province. It is the burial place of Zulfiqar, Murtaza and Benazir Bhutto.  The PPP is the ruling party in Sindh province.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011270&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">North Korea fired 18 short-range rockets into the sea off its east coast Sunday, South Korean officials said, in an apparent continuation of protests against ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills.</span></p>
<p>Such short-range rocket tests are usually considered routine, as opposed to North Korean long-range rocket or nuclear tests, which are internationally condemned as provocations. North Korea has conducted a string of similar short-range launches in recent weeks that have coincided with the annual military drills by allies Washington and Seoul.</p>
<p>North Korea says the drills are preparation for an invasion. The allies say the exercises, which last year prompted North Korean threats of nuclear war against the South and the United States, are routine and defensive in nature.</p>
<p>Outside analysts say the North is taking a softer stance toward the U.S.-South Korean military drills this year because it wants better ties with the outside world to revive its struggling economy. North Korea&#8217;s weeks-long tirade of war rhetoric against Washington and Seoul last spring followed international condemnation of its third nuclear test, in February 2013.</p>
<p>South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said the type of rockets North Korea launched on Sunday wasn&#8217;t yet clear.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Seoul said a North Korean artillery launch happened minutes before a Chinese commercial plane reportedly carrying 202 people flew in the same area.</p>
<p>Pyongyang has said that its recent rocket drills are part of regular training and are mindful of international navigation.</p>
<p>The Korean Peninsula remains officially at war because the Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011272&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Malaysia&#8217;s Premier Najib Razak on Sunday spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking India&#8217;s help in the massive search for the Malaysian jet that went missing with 239 people aboard over a week ago.</span></p>
<p>Razak spoke to Singh a day after he said Malaysian investigators suspect that the communication system in the missing Boeing 777-200 aircraft was &#8220;deliberately disabled&#8221; and its transponder switched off before it veered from its path and flew for more than seven hours.</p>
<p>India had put on hold its search operations for the missing airliner as it said it was awaiting fresh instructions from Malaysian authorities who are likely to look into new areas for locating the plane.</p>
<p>India had deployed five warships and six surveillance aircraft for the search operation. Earlier in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein today said the number of countries involved in search mission for Flight MH370 had nearly doubled to 25.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of countries involved in the search and rescue operation has increased from 14 to 25,&#8221; Hussein told a press conference here. Hussein also confirmed Premier Razak spoke to his counterparts in India, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>Besides, he said Malaysian Foreign Ministry officials today briefed representatives from at least 22 countries, including India, and sought their help in the search, whose &#8220;entered a new phase&#8221; as its &#8220;nature&#8221; has changed.</p>
<p>The help includes satellite and primary radar data and requesting deployment of sea search assets, the minister said. The Beijing-bound jetliner carrying 227 passengers, including five Indians and one Indian-Canadian, and 12 crew members mysteriously vanished from radar screens an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on March 8.</p>
<p>There has been no trace of the plane nor any sign of wreckage despite a search by the navies and military aircraft of several countries across Southeast Asia.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011260&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2011253" alt="Chinese relatives of passengers aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines plane walk out from a hotel room after attending a briefing by Malaysia Airlines in Beijing, China Sunday, March 16, 2014. Attention focused Sunday on the pilots of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight after the country's leader announced findings so far that suggest someone with intimate knowledge of the Boeing 777's cockpit seized control of the plane and sent it off-course. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-crash-new-480.jpg" /> Chinese relatives of passengers aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines plane walk out from a hotel room after attending a briefing by Malaysia Airlines in Beijing. (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Malaysia&#8217;s government on Sunday asked for help from nearly a dozen Asian countries that the missing jetliner may have flown over, saying that finding the plane would be very difficult without additional data on its final movements.</span></p>
<div>
<p>Meanwhile, police were examining a flight simulator belonging to one of the pilots of the Malaysia Airlines plane, which went missing more than a week ago with 239 passengers aboard a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
<p>The government said police searched the homes of both of the plane&#8217;s pilots on Saturday, the first time they have done so since the plane went missing. Asked why it took them so long, police chief Inspector General Khalid Abu Bakar said authorities &#8220;didn&#8217;t see the necessity in the early stages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bakar told reporters that he had requested countries with citizens on board the plane to investigate their background. He said that the intelligence agencies of some countries had already done this and found nothing suspicious, but that he was waiting for others to respond.</p>
<p>Satellite data has shown that after losing contact with air traffic controllers, the plane could have kept flying as far north as Kazakhstan in Central Asia or deep into the southern Indian Ocean, posing awesome challenges for efforts to recover the aircraft and flight data recorders vital to solving the mystery of what happened on board. That has left authorities desperate to narrow down a search area now stretching across 11 nations and one of the most remote oceans in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;The search was already a highly complex, multinational effort. It has now become even more difficult,&#8221; Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our hope with the new information, parties that can come forward and narrow the search to an area that is more feasible,&#8221; he said, adding that the search effort now includes 25 countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The search area has been significantly expanded. And the nature of the search has changed. From focusing mainly on shallow seas, we are now looking at large tracts of land, crossing 11 countries, as well as deep and remote oceans,&#8221; Hishammuddin said.</p>
<p>He said the number of countries involved in the search and rescue operation had increased from 14 to 25, bringing &#8220;new challenges of co-ordination and diplomacy to the search effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Australia said it was sending one of its two AP-3C Orion aircraft involved in the search to the remote islands in the Indian Ocean at Malaysia&#8217;s request. The plane will search the north and west of the Cocos Islands, a remote Australian territory with an airstrip about 1200 kilometers (745 miles) southwest of Indonesia, military chief Gen. David Hurley said.</p>
<p>Given that the northern route the plane may have taken would take it over countries with busy airspace, most experts say the person in control of the aircraft would more likely have chosen the southern route. The southern Indian Ocean is the world&#8217;s third-deepest and one of the most remote stretches of water in the world, with little radar coverage. The wreckage might take months — or longer — to find, or might never be located.</p>
<p>Malaysia has asked for help from countries in South, Central and Southeast Asia for assistance in tracing the jet by providing satellite and radar data, the government said in a statement. It said that for now, both the northern and southern routes that the plane may have taken were being treated with &#8220;equal importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Confirmation Saturday that someone on board severed the communication links with the ground and flew off course for more than six hours has triggered a formal criminal investigation into who on the plane was involved, and what motive they might have for doing so.</p>
<p>Investigators are trying answer these questions: If the pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own volition? Did one or more of the passengers manage to break into the cockpit, or use the threat of violence to gain entry and then pilot the plane?</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possibilities, and to establish what happened with any degree of certainty investigators will likely need to examine information, including cockpit voice recordings, from the plane&#8217;s flight data recorders should the jet be located.</p>
<p>The government gave few details on the police investigation into the pilots. Khalid, the inspector general, said police had confiscated the flight simulator belonging to Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the 59-year-old pilot, and reassembled it in their offices to examine it. He said police also were investigating engineers and ground staff who may have had contact with the plane before it took off.</p>
<p>Zaharie, who has three grown children and one grandchild, had previously posted photos online of the flight simulator he built for his home using three large computer monitors and other accessories. Earlier this week, the head of Malaysia Airlines said this was not in itself cause for any suspicion.</p>
<p>Malaysian officials and aviation experts said that whoever disabled the plane&#8217;s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting one or both of the pilots high on the list of possible suspects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Nigerian Navy says it destroyed 260 illegal oil refineries and burned 100,000 tons of contraband fuel to try to halt oil thefts bedeviling the economy of Africa&#8217;s biggest petroleum producer.</span></p>
<p>Commanding officer Capt. Musa Gemu said sailors of the NNS Delta destroyed the refineries in the Warri South-West area of<br />
southern Delta region on Friday night and arrested five suspects. He spoke last night.</p>
<p>Similar missions in the past have failed to slow estimated daily thefts of 200,000 barrels worth more than USD 20 million. Critics and analysts say most is stolen by politically-connected criminal cartels for sale on the international market.</p>
<p>The small-time criminals targeted in such attacks can reconstruct crudely built sites in days. Shell Nigeria, the biggest operator, says it lost USD 1 billion to oil thefts in 2013.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011226&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2011219" alt="An Indonesian Navy pilot checks his map during a search operation for the missing Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 over the waters bordering Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.

(AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">As police investigate the two pilots of a Malaysian passenger jet that disappeared more than a week ago, a possibility they must consider is that one of them committed suicide by deliberately crashing the plane.</span></p>
<p>While such incidents have happened before, the topic remains almost taboo, with investigators and officials reluctant to conclude that a pilot purposely crashed a plane in order to commit suicide even when the evidence appears compelling.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/missing-flight-mh370-focus-turns-to-pilots-as-hunt-for-jet-widens/" target="_blank">Missing flight MH370: Focus turns to pilots as hunt for jet widens</a></p>
<p>A dozen years ago, U.S. investigators filed a final report into the 1999 crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which plunged into the Atlantic Ocean near the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, killing all 217 aboard. They concluded that when co-pilot Gameel El-Batouty found himself alone on the flight deck, he switched off the auto-pilot, pointed the plane downward, and calmly repeated the phrase &#8220;I rely on God&#8221; over and over, 11 times in total.</p>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Yet while the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the co-pilot&#8217;s actions caused the crash, they didn&#8217;t use the word &#8220;suicide&#8221; in the main findings of their 160-page report, instead saying the reason for his actions &#8220;was not determined.&#8221; Egyptian officials, meanwhile, rejected the notion of suicide altogether, insisting instead there was some mechanical reason for the crash.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370-vanished/" target="_blank">Vanished: Malaysia Airlines flight MH370′s baffling mystery</a></p>
<p>There was also disagreement over the cause of the crash of SilkAir Flight 185, which plunged into a river in 1997 during a flight from Jakarta, Indonesia, to Singapore, killing all 104 passengers and crew. A U.S. investigation found that the Boeing 737 had been deliberately crashed, but an Indonesian investigation was inconclusive.</p>
<p>Mozambique officials have been investigating a crash that killed 33 people in November. They say preliminary investigations indicate that the pilot of the Mozambican Airline plane bound for Angola intentionally brought it down, and they&#8217;re continuing to look into his possible motives.</p>
<p>A 2014 study by the Federal Aviation Administration indicates that in the U.S. at least, flying remains a remarkably safe mode of transport and pilot suicide is a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>The study found that during the 10 years ending in 2012, just eight of 2,758 fatal aviation accidents in the U.S. were caused by pilot suicide, a rate of 0.3 percent. The report found that all eight suicides were men, with four of them testing positive for alcohol and two for antidepressants.</p>
<p>The cases ranged from a pilot celebrating his 21st birthday who realized a woman didn&#8217;t want a relationship with him, to a 69-year-old pilot with a history of drinking and threatening suicide by plane. Seven of the cases involved the death of only the pilot; in the eighth case, a passenger also died.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aircraft-assisted suicides are tragic, intentional events that are hard to predict and difficult to prevent,&#8221; the FAA&#8217;s report found, adding that such suicides &#8220;are most likely under-reported and under-recognized.&#8221;</p>
<p>In at least one case, a major international airline allowed a pilot who had expressed suicidal thoughts to continue flying. He flew nearly three more years, without incident, before he resigned in 1982 with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported that the Workers Compensation Commission heard that the Qantas pilot struggled several times to resist an overwhelming urge to switch off the plane&#8217;s engines. Once during a flight to Singapore, the pilot&#8217;s hand moved &#8220;involuntarily&#8221; toward the start levers and he was forced to &#8220;immobilize his left arm in order not to act on the compulsion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He left the flight deck and, once he felt calm enough, returned to his seat,&#8221; the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>After telling his colleagues of his urges, the newspaper said, the pilot was examined by several doctors and ultimately declared fit to fly.</p>
<p>Malaysia&#8217;s government said police on Saturday searched the homes of both the pilot and the co-pilot of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet. It said police were examining an elaborate flight simulator taken from the home of 59-year-old pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah.</p>
<p>Police also are investigating engineers who may have had contact with the plane before it took off.</p>
<p>Mike Glynn, a committee member of the Australian and International Pilots Association, said Friday that he considers pilot suicide to be the most likely explanation for the plane&#8217;s disappearance.</p>
<p>A pilot rather than a hijacker is more likely to be able to switch off the communications equipment, he said, adding that he thinks suicide was to blame in the EgyptAir and SilkAir crashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last thing that I, as a pilot, want is suspicion to fall on the crew, but it&#8217;s happened twice before,&#8221; Glynn said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">An angry crowd set fire to a Hindu community center in southern Pakistan after allegations circulated that a Hindu had desecrated Islam&#8217;s holy book, police said Sunday.</span></p>
<div>
<p>The incident took place overnight in the city of Larkana in Sindh province after some people said they saw burned pages of the Quran in a garbage bin near the home of a Hindu man, said Anwar Laghari, the area police officer.</p>
<p>Violence triggered by allegations of Quran desecration and other allegedly blasphemous acts is common in conservative Pakistan. A controversial Pakistani law imposes the death penalty, but sometimes crowds take the law into their own hands and attacked the accused, often members of a religious minority in the majority Sunni Muslim state.</p>
<p>Laghari said that a crowd of about 200 angry people gathered and attacked the community center, which was next to a Hindu temple. He said the building was partly gutted, while the alleged desecrater and his family members were taken into protective custody.</p>
<p>The officer said initial investigation revealed that the Hindu rented the house from a Muslim family and cleaned it before he moved in. He may have burned the holy book inadvertently, the policeman said.</p>
<p>Crowds also attacked Hindu property in the nearby towns of Usta Mohammad, Dera Allah Yar and Sohbat Pur, but they were dispersed by police, senior officer Syed Ashfaq Anwar said. They are in a part of adjoining Baluchistan province where significant numbers of Hindus live.</p>
<p>Anwar said dozens attempted to set fire to a temple and some shops owned by Hindus. Police fired tear gas shot and shot into the air. He said someone from the crowd fired at the police, and two civilians and an officer were wounded.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2011135" alt="Two Syrian men carry Adul-Karim, 18, a Syrian rebel who was injured during a battle against the Syrian government forces and Hezbollah fighters in Yabroud. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mideast-480.jpg" /> Two Syrian men carry Adul-Karim, 18, a Syrian rebel who was injured during a battle against the Syrian government forces and Hezbollah fighters in Yabroud. (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Syria said on Sunday its military has seized a key town on the Lebanese border that was the target of a months-long army offensive. Activists said fighting was still ongoing but the government was in effective control of much of Yabroud.</span></p>
<p>Yabroud was an important supply line for rebels into neighboring Lebanon, and overlooked an important cross-country highway. Its fall, coming as the Syrian conflict enters fourth year, would be the latest blow to rebels since the initiative passed to the government in the spring of 2013.</p>
<p>It is the last major rebel-held town in the mountainous Qalamoun region, where President Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s forces have been waging an offensive for months to try to sever rebel supply lines across the porous border into eastern Lebanon. Its fall would come just a week after the Syrian army seized the village of Zara, which also served as a conduit for rebels from mountainous northern Lebanon into central Syria.</p>
<p>Syria&#8217;s state news agency SANA reported that military forces seized Yabroud early on Sunday and were now combing the city, removing booby-traps and bombs and hunting down rebel hold-outs.</p>
<p>Kasem Alzein, a Syrian pro-rebel doctor who lives in the nearby border town of Arsal, said military forces entered the eastern part of Yabroud and that rebels fled to the nearby town of Flita. He said a small hardcore group of fighters had decided to fight to the death in the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t want to surrender,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But, he said, &#8220;supplies are cut off. The weapons that were promised (to rebels) never arrived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Qusair will repeat itself,&#8221; Alzein said, referring to another strategic rebel-held town on the Syrian border that fell last summer. As in the Qalamoun offensive, Lebanese Hezbollah militants played a key role backing government troops.</p>
<p>Gunfire and clashes could be heard on footage broadcast live by the Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen. It showed troops walking through empty streets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new flare-up of violence in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli linked to the Syrian civil war left 12 people dead in recent days, Lebanon&#8217;s state-run news agency said.</p>
<p>NNA says the latest fatality was a soldier, killed when attackers fired on his armored vehicle with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms on Sunday.</p>
<p>His death brings the death toll to 12 since clashes erupted Thursday, the NNA said.</p>
<p>The clashes pit Sunni gunmen from the neighborhood of Bab Tabbaneh who back Syria&#8217;s Sunni-majority rebels against rivals from nearby Jabal Mohsen, dominated by the Alawite sect, also the faith of Syrian President Bashar Assad.</p>
<p>Some Sunni gunmen have also attacked Lebanese soldiers, accusing them of loyalty to rival sectarian factions in Lebanon.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011121&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>A Tibetan Buddhist monk today set himself on fire in China&#8217;s northwest Qinghai province which has witnessed a spate of self-immolation incidents in the recent past.</p>
<p>The monk hails from the Shaderi Monastery at Zekog County in the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Huangnan, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
<p>There is no information on his condition.</p>
<p>According to overseas Tibetan groups, over 120 Tibetans committed self immolation in the last few months, calling for the return of the Dalai Lama from exile in India.</p>
<p>Many Tibetans accuse the Chinese government of repressing their religion and culture. China claims that Tibetans enjoy religious freedom and benefit from better living standards linked to Chinese investment in underdeveloped Tibetan regions.</p>
<p>Beijing has accused the Dalai Lama of inciting the self-immolations to promote Tibetan separatism. He has,however, rejected it and said China must conduct a &#8220;serious investigation&#8221; into the self-immolations rather than placing the blame on him.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011080&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/najib.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011029" alt="najib" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/najib.jpg" /></a> Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, center, delivers a statement to the media regarding the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner MH370, Saturday, March 15, 2014 (AP photo).
<p>Malaysian authorities Sunday were investigating the pilots of the missing jetliner after it was established that whoever flew off with the Boeing 777 had intimate knowledge of the cockpit and knew how to avoid detection when navigating around Asia.</p>
<p>Satellite data suggested the plane flew for at least 7 hours, more than six hours after the last radio contact, and that it could have reached as far northwest as Kazakhstan or deep into the southern Indian Ocean, making the hunt by 12 nations involving more than 100 planes and ships one of the largest in aviation history. Given that the northern route would take the plane over several countries, experts thought a southern path over one of the most remote stretches of water much more likely.</p>
<p>In the first detailed findings on what happened to the plane, Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday someone severed communications with the ground and deliberately diverted Flight 370 back over the Malay Peninsula after it departed Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early on March 8th.</p>
<p>The revelations raised questions over possible lapses by Malaysian authorities, including why the air force wasn&#8217;t aware that a jetliner was flying over the country. It also triggered speculation over who on the plane was involved and what motive they might have for flying away with a plane carrying a 12-person crew and 227 passengers.</p>
<p>If the pilots were involved in the disappearance, were they working together or alone, or with one or more of the passengers or crew? Did they fly the plane under duress or of their own volition? Did one or more of the passengers manage to break into the cockpit, or use threat of violence to gain entry and then pilot the plane?</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities have not ruled out any possibility, and the answers to those questions will have to wait until the flight data recorders are recovered, assuming the plane is ever found.</p>
<p>Police are investigating all those on board, especially the pilots and anyone else on the manifest with possible aviation experience. That could include past contact with each other, physiological, mental or financial issues or ties to extremist organizations.</p>
<p>Malaysian officials and aviation experts said that whoever disabled the plane&#8217;s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience, putting the pilots at the top of the possible suspects list.</p>
<p>&#8220;In view of this latest development, the Malaysian authorities have refocused their investigation into the crew and passengers on board,&#8221; Najib told reporters, reading from a written statement but not taking any questions.</p>
<p>Police on Saturday went to the Kuala Lumpur homes of both the pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27. They have released no details on their investigation so far.</p>
<p>Zaharie, who joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had more than 18,000 hours of flying experience, was known as an avid aviation enthusiast who had set up an elaborate flight simulator at home. Earlier this week, the head of Malaysia Airlines said this was not unusual.</p>
<p>Fariq was contemplating marriage after having just graduated to the cockpit of a Boeing 777. He has drawn scrutiny after the revelation that he and another pilot invited two female passengers to sit in the cockpit during a flight in 2011.</p>
<p>The flight departed Kuala Lumpur at 12:40 a.m. heading toward Beijing. Investigators now have a high degree of certainty that one of the plane&#8217;s communications systems, the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), was partially disabled before the aircraft reached the east coast of Malaysia, Najib said. Shortly afterward, someone on board switched off the aircraft&#8217;s transponder, which communicates with civilian air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>To turn off the transponder, someone in the cockpit would have to turn a knob with multiple selections to the &#8220;off&#8221; position while pressing down at the same time, said John Goglia, a former member of the US National Transportation Safety Board. That&#8217;s something a pilot would know, but it could also be learned by someone who researched the plane on the Internet, he said.</p>
<p>The ACARS system has two aspects, Goglia said. The information part of the system was shut down, but not the transmission part. In most planes, the information section can be shut down by hitting cockpit switches in sequence in order to get to a computer screen where an option must be selected using a keypad, said Goglia, an expert on aircraft maintenance.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s also something a pilot would know how to do, but that could also be discovered through research, he said.</p>
<p>But to turn off the other transmission portion of the ACARS, it would be necessary to go to an electronics bay beneath the cockpit. That&#8217;s something a pilot wouldn&#8217;t normally know how to do, Goglia said. The Malaysia plane&#8217;s ACARS transmitter continued to send out blips that were recorded by satellite after the transponder was turned off. The blips don&#8217;t contain any messages or data, but the satellite can tell in a very broad way what region the blips are coming from.</p>
<p>Najib confirmed that Malaysian air force defense radar picked up traces of the plane turning back westward, crossing over Peninsular Malaysia into the northern stretches of the Strait of Malacca. Authorities previously had said this radar data could not be verified.</p>
<p>The air force has yet to explain why it didn&#8217;t spot the plane flying over the country, and respond. The search was initially focused on the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea, where the plane severed its communication links. That search has now ended.</p>
<p>&#8220;One that thing that does bother me greatly is the fact that unidentified aircraft could navigate back over Malaysia and out to sea without a physical or material response to that fact,&#8221; said Britain-based aviation security consultant Chris Yates. &#8220;They were not watching.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011024&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A frenzied mob attacked a Hindu temple and set a dharmashala on fire over alleged desecration of a holy book, prompting authorities to impose a curfew in the Larkana city of Pakistan&#8217;s southern Sindh province.</p>
<p>The protesters attacked the temple, set the dharmashala on fire last night and surrounded the house of a Hindu man who was accused of burning the pages of the holy book, prompting security forces to fire warning shots and tear gas shells.</p>
<p>Police said curfew has been imposed in Jinnah Bagh and some other parts of the city after mob went bersek.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man accused of blasphemy is a habitual drug addict and the Hindu community in Larkana can&#8217;t even think of disrespecting any community&#8217;s religious beliefs,&#8221; Kalpana Devi, the head of the local Hindu Panchayat, told Geo News.</p>
<p>A local police official said that soon after news spread of the man desecrating the book, angry students and followers of local religious seminaries had started gathering in groups and demanded the man be handed over to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They set on fire the main Hindu temple in the Jinnah Bagh chowk area and also completely gutted the adjoining dharamshala,&#8221; the official said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curfew has now been imposed in the area with heavy patrolling by the paramilitary rangers and police who had to baton charge and use tear gas shells to disperse the mob,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Larkana is the hometown of the Bhutto family and the stronghold of the ruling Pakistan People&#8217;s Party.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011009&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The case of an Army general accused of sexually assaulting a female captain under his command is set to return to a Fort Bragg courtroom less than a week after proceedings were postponed to allow time for a possible plea agreement.</p>
<p>Officials at the North Carolina Army base said the trial of Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair suddenly postponed last week will resume tomorrow.</p>
<p>There haven&#8217;t been any major developments since the trial judge on Tuesday sent the jury of five two-star generals back to their duty stations around the world, Sinclair spokesman Josh Zeitz said.</p>
<p>Unless a plea agreement is reached by tomorrow, the hearing is expected to deal only with procedural issues like whether the judge should designate someone other than Fort Bragg&#8217;s base commander with the authority to accept a plea agreement, Zeitz said.</p>
<p>The trial was postponed to give plea negotiations a second chance after emails surfaced showing the base commander, Lt. Gen. Joseph Anderson, may have weighed the broader implications on the Army if he accepted a deal. The military code of justice requires the decision to be based solely on the evidence in the case.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has been under heavy pressure from Congress to combat rape and other sex crimes in the military. The Senate Monday unanimously approved a bill making big changes in the military justice system to deal with sexual assault.</p>
<p>Sinclair, 51 and the former deputy commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, is accused of twice forcing a female captain to perform oral sex on him in Afghanistan in 2011 during a three-year extramarital affair.</p>
<p>He has admitted to adultery, which is a crime in the military, but denied assaulting the woman. He could get life in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>The defence has portrayed the woman as a liar who concocted the allegations after she saw emails between Sinclair and another woman.</p>
<p>If no plea deal is reached, testimony in Sinclair&#8217;s trial could not resume until the jury of generals returned to Fort Bragg from their posts as far away as Korea and Alaska.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010965&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Crimea is braced for a referendum Sunday on whether to leave Ukraine and join Russia, escalating a Cold War-style security crisis on Europe&#8217;s eastern edge that has left diplomacy in disarray.</p>
<p>Around 1.5 million people are being called to vote on the rugged diamond-shaped peninsula, which is inhabited mostly by ethnic Russians.</p>
<p>The choice is between becoming part of Russia or taking more powers but staying in Ukraine &#8212; and a vote for the status quo is not an option.</p>
<p>Polls open at 0600 GMT and close at 1800 GMT, with initial results soon after &#8212; although rehearsals for the big day including the slogan &#8220;We are in Russia!&#8221; beamed onto a government building left no doubt as to the outcome.</p>
<p>The West has said it will not recognise the referendum, while Moscow insists it is an example of self-determination like Kosovo.</p>
<p>Russian troops and pro-Moscow militias took control of the strategic peninsula soon after the Kremlin-backed Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled Kiev last month after three months of deadly protests against his rule.</p>
<p>Ukrainian military bases in the region &#8212; home to Russia&#8217;s Black Sea Fleet since the 18th century &#8212; are surrounded but there has been no armed confrontation and it is not clear what will happen to them after the vote.</p>
<p>There have been several attacks on journalists and pro-unity activists condemned by Amnesty International as &#8221;extremely worrying&#8221;.</p>
<p>Washington has dismissed a vote &#8220;under the barrel of a gun&#8221; and the new government in Ukraine has branded it &#8221;illegitimate&#8221; and is concerned Moscow is trying to stir up a wider rebellion in Russified parts of eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Three activists have been killed in the eastern cities of Donetsk and Kharkiv in the run-up to the Crimea referendum and supporters of Russia have called for similar separatist polls to be held in other Ukrainian regions.</p>
<p>Russian lawmakers have given the go-ahead for President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine when he wants, citing the need to defend ethnic Russians against ultra-nationalist radicals.</p>
<p>Ukraine is on full combat alert and on the eve of the vote it accused Russian forces of seizing a village just outside Crimea saying: &#8220;Ukraine reserves the right to use all necessary measures to stop the military invasion by Russia&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010946&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India on Sunday put on hold its search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, at the request of the government in Kuala Lumpur, which wants to reassess the week-old hunt for the Boeing 777 that is now suspected of being hijacked.</p>
<p>India had been searching in two areas, one around the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and a second further west in the Bay of Bengal. Both searches have been suspended, but may resume, defence officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more of a pause,&#8221; said Commander Babu, a spokesman for the country&#8217;s Eastern Naval Command.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Malaysian authorities are reassessing the situation. They will figure whether they need to shift the area of search.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010891&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>Investigators believe someone aboard the missing Malaysian airliner deliberately shut off its communications and tracking systems, turned the plane around and flew for nearly seven hours after it vanished, Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday.</p>
<p>Shortly after the prime minister finished speaking, police arrived at the home of the missing aircraft’s pilot to search for evidence, a senior police officer told Reuters.</p>
<p>As the unprecedented search for Flight MH370 and its 239 passengers and crew entered its second week, Najib told a news conference that the hunt for wreckage around the scheduled flight path to the east of Malaysia was being called off.</p>
<p>“Despite media reports the plane was hijacked, I wish to be very clear, we are still investigating all possibilities as to what caused MH370 to deviate,” Najib said.</p>
<p>The fate of the Boeing 777-200ER has been shrouded in mystery since it disappeared off Malaysia’s east coast less than an hour into a March 8 scheduled flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
<p>But investigators have increasingly focused on the possibility that it was flown off-course by the pilot or co-pilot, or someone else on board with detailed knowledge of how to fly and navigate a large commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight were Chinese, and Beijing has been showing increasing impatience with the speed and co-ordination of the Malaysian search effort. On Saturday, China said it had demanded that Malaysia keep providing more thorough and accurate information.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010584&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/karzaim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2010727" alt="Karzai steps down after next month’s presidential elections." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/karzaim.jpg" /></a> Karzai steps down after next month’s presidential elections.
<p>In his final address to Afghanistan’s parliament Saturday, President Hamid Karzai told the United States its soldiers can leave at the end of the year because his military, which already protects 93 percent of the country, was ready to take over entirely.</p>
<p>He reiterated his stance that he would not sign a pact with the United States that would provide for a residual force of US troops to remain behind after the final withdrawal, unless peace could first be established.</p>
<p>The Afghan president has come under heavy pressure to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement, with a council of notables that he himself convened recommend that he sign the pact. The force would train and mentor Afghan troops, and some US Special Forces would also be left behind to hunt down al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>All 10 candidates seeking the presidency in April 5 elections have said they would sign the security agreement. But Karzai himself does not appear to want his legacy to include a commitment to a longer foreign troop presence in his country.</p>
<p>Karzai was brought to power in the wake of the 2001 US-led invasion and subsequently won two presidential elections — in 2004 and again in 2009. But he has in recent years espoused a combatative nationalism, with his hour-long speech Saturday no exception.</p>
<p>“I want to say to all those foreign countries who maybe out of habit or because they want to interfere, that they should not interfere,” he said.</p>
<p>Karzai said the war in Afghanistan was “imposed” on his nation, presumably by the 2001 invasion, and told the United States it could bring peace to Afghanistan if it went after terrorist sanctuaries and countries that supported terrorism, a reference to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Pakistan has a complicated relationship with the Taliban. It backed the group before their 2001 overthrow, and although now it is at war with its own militants, Afghan insurgents sometimes find refuge on its territory.</p>
<p>Karzai told parliament, which was holding its opening session for this term, that security forces were strong enough to defend Afghanistan without the help of international troops.</p>
<p>Karzai steps down after next month’s presidential elections. Under Afghanistan’s constitution, he is banned from seeking a third term.</p>
<p>He came to power in December 2001 following an international agreement signed in Bonn, Germany, and was confirmed by a Loya Jirga or grand council. He subsequently won two elections.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010721&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Malaysian police Saturday went to the house of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, the pilot of the missing flight MH370, minutes after Prime Minister Najib Razak announced that investigators will refocus on the crew and passengers of the aircraft that disappeared eight days ago.</p>
<p>Two police officers went to 53-year-old Capt Zaharie’s house in the suburb of Shah Alam here, officials said, without further elaborating.</p>
<p>Zaharie, a pilot with 18,365 flight hours under his belt, is reportedly also a flight instructor.</p>
<p>He has been in the news after questions were raised in the media over a flight simulator found at his home.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines chief executive officer Ahmad Jauhari Yahya had said earlier this week that the airline had no policy forbidding staff from owning the technology. He said Capt Zaharie was allowed to pursue hobbies. “There are several other pilots who have flight simulators in their home,” he had said.</p>
<p>Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Tun Hussein had said the authorities will search the home of MH370 crew members if it was necessary to do so.</p>
<p>The move came hours after Prime Minister Najib said the missing aircraft’s communication system and the transponder were switched off deliberately “by someone on the plane”.</p>
<p>Najib said new data showed the last communication between the missing plane and satellites at 8:11 a.m. Malaysian time.</p>
<p>That is almost seven hours after it dropped off civilian air traffic control screens at 1:22 am last Saturday, less than an hour after take-off.</p>
<p>Najib said satellite data confirmed an unidentified aircraft later appeared on military radar off Malaysia’s west coast before going out of range at 2:15 am which was flight MH370. “Up until the point at which it left military radar coverage, these movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane,” he said.</p>
<p>He said analysis of the plane’s last communication with satellites placed it somewhere in one of two corridors: a northern corridor stretching from northern Thailand to the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, or a southern corridor stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Earlier, a source said it appeared most likely the plane turned south over the Indian Ocean, where it would presumably have run out of fuel and crashed into the sea.</p>
<p><strong>Pakistan dismisses reports of missing jet in its territory</strong></p>
<p>Pakistan’s top aviation official Saturday dismissed suggestions that the missing Malaysian airliner could have potentially reached as far as this country.</p>
<p>“It’s wrong, the plane never came towards Pakistan,” Special Assistant to the Prime Minister  on Aviation Shujaat Azeem said in response to some media reports.</p>
<p>“Pakistan’s civil aviation radars never spotted this jet,” he was quoted as saying by Dawn,  “so how it could be hidden somewhere in the country.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010708&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The dry season has already hurt prospects for the cereal harvest. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010677&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Middle East’s driest winter in several decades could pose a threat to global food prices, with local crops depleted and farmers’ livelihoods blighted, UN experts and climatologists say.</span></p>
<p>Varying degrees of drought are hitting almost two-thirds of the limited arable land across Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the Palestinian territories and Iraq. “Going back to the last 100 years, I don’t think you can get a five-year span that’s been as dry,” said Mohammad Raafi Hossain, a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) environmental economist.</p>
<p>The dry season has already hurt prospects for the cereal harvest. Several of the countries under pressure are already significant buyers of grain from international markets.</p>
<p>“When governments that are responsible for importing basic foodstuffs have shortages in production, they will go to outside markets, where the extra demand will push global food prices higher,” said Nakd Khamis, seed expert and consultant to the FAO.<br />
The Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) shows the region has not had such low rainfall since at least 1970. This was part of the initial findings of a joint technical study on Drought Risk Management undertaken by several UN agencies, including the FAO, UNDP and UNESCO, Hossain said.</p>
<p>Water and agriculture authorities, alongside specialist UN agencies, have begun preparing plans to officially declare a state of drought that spreads beyond the Eastern Middle East to Morocco and as far south as Yemen, climatologists and officials say.</p>
<p>Drought is becoming more severe in parts of the Eastern Mediterranean and Iraq, while Syria, having seen several droughts in recent decades, is again being hit hard, said Mohamad Khawlie, a natural resources expert with Planinc, an international consultancy focused on geospatial studies in the Middle East and Africa (MENA) region.</p>
<p>In Jordan, Hazem al-Nasser, minister of water and irrigation, told Reuters precipitation levels were the lowest since records began 60 years ago.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, where climate change has stripped its mountains of the snow needed to recharge groundwater basins, rain is “below average”, said Beirut-based ecosystem and livelihoods consultant Fady Asmar, who works with UN agencies. He said the stress on water resources was exacerbated by the presence of nearly a million refugees since the Syrian civil war began in 2011.</p>
<p>Only Israel will not face acute problems, helped by its long-term investment in desalination plants and pioneering water management techniques.</p>
<p>In Iraq, which once boasted the largest tracts of fertile land in the region, it is only three years since the last cycle of drought ended, which covered more than 73 per cent of the country.<br />
Extracts from a soon-to-be released UN-commissioned study says drought in Iraq will persist, increasing in severity from 2017 to 2026, increasing further the dependence on foreign food imports by one of the top grains importers in the world.</p>
<p>The extracts say Turkey, where much of Iraq and Syria’s water resources originate, has cut the volume of water flowing into the Euphrates and Tigris rivers by dam construction to meet their own growing domestic needs.</p>
<p>A poor rain season in Syria has already hit its 2014 wheat outlook in the main rain-fed areas in the north-eastern parts, Syrian agriculturalists say. Even if late heavy rain comes in March, it is not expected to save the cereal harvest, which farmers are resigned to relegating to animal fodder.</p>
<p>The drought and war could slash total wheat output to less than a third of its pre-crisis harvest of around 3.5 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Drought that peaked in severity during 2008 and 2009 but persisted into 2010 was blamed by some experts in Syria for the soaring food prices that aggravated social tensions and in turn triggered the 2011 uprising against President Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>“Prior to the protests, food costs were soaring. In fact, because of these food costs, the protests were instigated,” said FAO’s Hossain.</p>
<p>Middle-Eastern experts predict more frequent drought cycles in coming years, accompanied by delayed winter rainy seasons that damage fruits by promoting premature flowering and prevent cereal crops growing to full maturity.</p>
<p>“The climate change cycles are now shorter, which means &#8230; we will eventually have less rain and more frequent droughts,” Fady Asmar said.</p>

<p><strong>Until the wells run dry</strong></p>
<p><em>A small community north of Los Angeles is running dry amid a deep California drought even though residents are changing water habits</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">People in the mountain town Lake of the Woods, California, straddling the San Andreas Fault are used to scrapping for water. The lake for which it is named went dry 40 years ago. But now, this tiny community is dealing with its most unsettling threat yet: It could run out of water by summer. </span></p>
<p>So far, nothing has seemed to have helped: not the yearlong ban on watering lawns and washing cars, not running the washing machine once a week, not the conscientious homeowners who clean their dishes in the sink and reuse the gray water on trees, not even the three inches of rain that soaked the area last weekend. Three attempts to drill new wells, going down 500 feet, have failed.</p>
<p>But for 17 small communities in California, the absence of rain is posing a fundamental threat to the most basic of services: drinking water. And Lake of the Woods, a middle-class enclave 80 miles from Los Angeles, a mix of commuters, retirees and weekend residents, is one of the most seriously threatened. Signs along its dusty roadways offer stark red-on-white warnings of a “Water Emergency,” and plead for conservation.</p>
<p>For a while, Lake of the Woods bought water from Frazier Park, five miles up the road, but that community halted sales as its water table dropped through the winter. Now the community is trying to line up alternatives, and fast. State officials predict that the existing water supply will last no more than three months.</p>
<p>The town, which has a population of about 900, says it is prepared to truck in water should the wells run dry, an expensive remedy it employed briefly last year and which now looms as a potential fact of life.  NYT</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010677&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[But the days of our unqualifiedly celebrating the rowdy, libidinous, self-destructive artist may be drawing to a close.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010698&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>BY: TEDDY WAYNE</strong></p>
<p>Justin Bieber’s rap sheet over the past year would have been an afternoon’s work for Keith Richards. Yet for a number of factors — not least of which is that, in certain circles, Exile on Main St. is considered a slightly superior achievement to My World 2.0 — we excoriate Bieber for his misdeeds while glorifying Richards for his. And musicians aren’t the only ones expected to be on their best behaviour.</p>
<p>“If there was an arrest for drunk driving,” Robert J Wagner writes of old Hollywood in his new memoir, You Must Remember This, “there would be a nod, a wink, perhaps some modest amount of money changing hands, and that would be the end of it”. He added, “If an actor behaved the way that, say, Tiger Woods did — and believe me, it was not unusual — it was covered up.”</p>
<p>But the days of our unqualifiedly celebrating the rowdy, libidinous, self-destructive artist may be drawing to a close. What’s more, celebrities are no longer behaving all that badly.</p>
<p>Blame the Internet’s power to shame and memorialise. It certainly had an effect on Alec Baldwin, who has quit Twitter multiple times and bade a recent long goodbye to public life in New York magazine. And for every public figure accused of trolling for inflamed reactions with a controversy-baiting essay or tweet, there are probably several more who hold back their real opinions for fear of online censure.</p>
<p>Those chronicling the famous also have to mind their manners. A reporter who parties like Hunter S Thompson did in the 1970s is unlikely to be published regularly by Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>Cat Marnell, 31, is the rare journalist who seems to be written about more than she writes. The news media in New York, where she lives, have broadly covered her exploits with drugs. Marnell has written for a number of publications but has not stayed too long at any of them; she told The New York Post, “I couldn’t spend another summer meeting deadlines behind a computer at night when I could be on the rooftop of Le Bain looking for shooting stars and smoking angel dust with my friends and writing a book.”</p>
<p>“As somebody who’s overdosed and nearly died in September, I struggle with what kind of tone I want,” she said of her writing. She noted that heroin, back in the spotlight since Philip Seymour Hoffman’s death, has been verboten in the art scene since the 2009 death of Dash Snow.</p>
<p>Yet Marnell has written extensively about her drug use and acknowledged that “people do like me because I’m bad”. “Drugs are bad, but they’re still fun.”</p>
<p>Our cultural image of the writer has historically been of a thrice-divorced, whiskey-swilling chain smoker who brawls with his rival over a nasty review in a dimly lit Manhattan speakeasy. Now it’s a married yogi in a BabyBjörn who tweets exclamatory encomia from the kale section of a supermarket.</p>
<p>Coming of age, the writer Jay McInerney idolised what he called the “holy trinity” of American modernism — Ernest Hemingway, F Scott Fitzgerald and William Faulkner, all with a noted fondness for alcohol — along with what he called “the silver generation” of hard drinkers like Norman Mailer, John Cheever and William Styron.</p>
<p>By the time McInerney published his debut novel, Bright Lights, Big City, in 1984, followed a year later by Bret Easton Ellis’s Less Than Zero — which depicted cocaine-hoovering Reagan-era Manhattan and Los Angeles, respectively — “drugs were part of a rite of passage” for young writers, he said.</p>
<p>In the early part of the decade, McInerney recalled, “I was hanging around with some friends who were discovering this nice little drug with me, and we saw an ad in The Village Voice for Cocaine Anonymous. It was the most hilarious thing we’d heard.”</p>
<p>McInerney, at 59, now writes a column for The Wall Street Journal about a less lethal inebriant: wine. He has just finished a draft of a new novel.“I’m glad I survived my excesses,” he said. “I feel like an extinct species.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010698&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>The disappearance of <a title="India puts on hold search for missing Malaysia Airlines MH370" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/india-puts-on-hold-search-for-missing-malaysia-airlines-mh370/" target="_blank">Malaysia Airlines</a> flight MH370 has been called one of the most baffling mysteries in modern aviation. How can a plane disappear in this age of total connectivity? Not entirely impossible, writes YP Rajesh</em></p>
<p>“There is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition, and it lies between the pit of man’s fears and the summit of his knowledge. This is the dimension of imagination. It is an area which we call the Twilight Zone.”</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia-main.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2006183" alt="malaysia-main" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia-main.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>An anguished, anonymous reader took to repeating the words of American TV series creator Rod Serling, the man behind the 1959 science fiction-fantasy show The Twilight Zone, in his response to the befuddling theories in a US newspaper report about the missing <a title="Missing jet diverted deliberately, says Malaysian PM" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/missing-jet-diverted-deliberately-says-malaysian-pm/" target="_blank">Malaysia Airlines flight MH370</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, an international aviation safety expert put it more simply: It seems like the perfect murder, but without the body.</p>
<p>The truth, perhaps, lies somewhere in between. But for now, it has been called one of the most baffling mysteries in modern aviation. And the most critical question being posed to try and unravel the mystery: how could an ultra-modern plane with state-of-the-art communication equipment in this day and age of hyperconnectivity simply disappear without a trace and not be found for days?</p>
<p>Theories abound, but first the facts.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004596" alt="MALAYSIA6" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia6.jpg?w=475&#038;h=316" width="475" height="316" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Malaysian jet turned around, flew towards Malacca" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysian-jet-turned-around-flew-towards-malacca/" target="_blank">The aircraft</a> was a Boeing 777-200ER, a wide-bodied long-range jet that first flew in the late 1990s and had more than 400 planes in service as of mid-2013. It has an almost squeaky clean safety record for any commercial aircraft in service.</p>
<p><a title="MH370 continued flying for 6 hours, could have gone towards Kazakhstan or south of Indian Ocean: Malaysian PM" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/mh370-continue-flying-for-six-hours-more-could-have-gone-towards-kazakhstan-or-south-of-indian-ocean-malaysian-pm/" target="_blank">MH370</a> was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew. It took off from the Malaysian capital at 12.40 am on March 8, flying in a northeasterly direction. It was last registered on Malaysian air traffic control radar just before 1.30 am, a little after it had crossed the Malaysian peninsula, and was flying at 35,000 feet over the Gulf of Thailand.</p>
<p>Until then, there was no sign of any trouble with the flight and the weather in the region was fine. “All right, good night,” one of the pilots said in the last radio transmission from the cockpit to Malaysian ATC after the ATC said it was handing the plane over to the jurisdiction of Vietnam’s ATC. And then, <a title="Missing Malaysia plane may have run out of fuel over Indian Ocean" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/missing-malaysia-plane-may-have-run-out-of-fuel-over-indian-ocean/" target="_blank">MH370 vanished</a>.</p>
<p>The first, and easiest, conclusion was that a sudden, catastrophic event — such as both engines failing or an explosion or the aircraft breaking up in mid-air — had caused the jet to disintegrate in the skies or crash into the sea. But the likelihood of this possibility over the Gulf of Thailand has reduced by the day as extensive searches by ships and aircraft of multi-national forces failed to spot any debris.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiaairlinesm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004079" alt="MALAYSIAAIRLINESM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiaairlinesm.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>“I don’t see how the plane could have crashed there and floating debris not be spotted for days,” said an Indian captain who has been flying a 777 for the last seven years. “Debris is light. Something has to come up. Everything can’t just go and sit at the bottom of the sea. And if there was a malfunction, there has to be some trigger, some warning. So this is quite baffling.”</p>
<p>Equally, if not more, mystifying has been the failure of all communication systems on the plane that coincided with its disappearance.</p>
<p>A modern passenger jet such as the 777 communicates basically through an electronic device called the ‘transponder’. It responds to signals from an ATC ‘secondary radar’ on the ground and sends information about itself and its flight. When the plane is beyond the range of a radar, say for instance on long, trans-oceanic flights, the transponders turn to communicating with satellites.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-m1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2009084" alt="plane-m" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-m1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>The first sign of trouble with MH370 came when its transponder stopped responding — it had either failed, or was switched off, as it can be. Adding to the mystery was the apparent failure of other communication systems to track the plane.</p>
<p>Besides the secondary radar, there exist basic ‘primary radars’ that send radio waves into the skies and track a plane when it simply bounces the waves back to the radar. Also, planes such as the 777 are equipped with high frequency (HF), very high frequency (VHF) and satellite communication (Satcom) systems that can be used in the event of a transponder failure.</p>
<p>Yet another system called the Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) allows air traffic controllers and pilots to communicate through data exchange. Lastly, modern long-range jets also come with what is called the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS), an automatic data transfer mechanism through which the aircraft periodically sends information about its health to the airline or the engine manufacturer or a designated maintenance facility so that a problem can be addressed on landing.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rescue-t.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2006215" alt="VIETNAM-MALAYSIA-MALAYSIAAIRLINES-CHINA-TRANSPORT-ACCIDENT-AVIAT" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rescue-t.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>“All these systems cannot fail in one go,” said Captain Arvind Kathpalia, a veteran Air India pilot who flies the 747, 777 and the 787 and a former DGCA flight operations inspector. “They can’t fail even if lightning strikes the aircraft as there is shielding. There are independent sources of power, backups, inverters, different buses, satellite monitoring.”</p>
<p>Although many, if not all, systems can be switched off and the jet fly incognito, it can still be spotted and tracked by a primary radar. But the region where MH370 went missing is known to have low primary radar coverage with many gaps. “Besides, new generation air traffic controllers do not have the wits to look for a primary echo,” Kathpalia added. In fact, the first signs of a possible breakthrough in the search for MH370 are based on information from primary radars used by the Malaysian military and faint signals the aircraft is thought to have sent to satellites after it “vanished”.</p>
<p>Almost a week after it disappeared, investigators suspect the plane flew in a designated aviation corridor in the opposite direction of its designated flight path and moved towards the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal in the Indian Ocean. This has to be done deliberately, causing them to suspect foul play behind the entire saga.<br />
Renowned US pilot, air travel blogger and author Patrick Smith writes that although the idea of a plane disappearing may not seem possible in an age of instant and total connectivity, it is not fully inconceivable.</p>
<p>“I think people need to reconcile with the possibility that the plane might never be found,” he wrote on his website askthepilot.com. “I know that sounds absurd to many people in this day and age, where fast and easy answers are taken for granted, but it might happen. I don’t expect that to happen, but it could.”<br />
Kathpalia is more confident about MH370 being traced.</p>
<p>“Eventually it will be,” he said. “Unless this is a James Hadley Chase thriller where terrorists have taken the plane to a remote island and hidden it there. But what will they do with it there?”</p>
<p><strong>The plane truths</strong></p>
<p>A look at how an aircraft communicates:</p>
<p><strong>TRANSPONDERS</strong></p>
<p>These electronic devices identify commercial aircraft within the range of an ATC radar and transmit information on the plane’s identity, location and altitude to ground radar stations.</p>
<p><strong>ACARS</strong></p>
<p>Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System is a data link system used to transmit short messages such as weather updates between aircraft and ground stations via radio or satellite. Apparently, ACARS messages sent by the missing plane continued after its transponder went silent.</p>
<p><strong>SATELLITE LINK</strong></p>
<p>Boeing has a satellite service that can receive data during a flight on how the aircraft is functioning and relay it to the plane’s home base. US officials have said automated pings were received from the jetliner for four hours after it went missing.</p>
<p><strong>FLIGHT DATA RECORDER </strong></p>
<p>It can hold a record of over 100 hours of flight and is specially manufactured to survive a crash.</p>
<p><strong>COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER</strong></p>
<p>Over two hours of recording is stored by this hardened box that emits a tracking signal after impact.</p>
<p><strong>Indian mysteries</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nov 1950:</strong> Air India’s ‘Malabar Princess’, a Lockheed Constellation, had begun its descent to Geneva when it disappeared. It had struck the Mont Blanc mountain in France, killing all 48 on board.</p>
<p><strong>April 1955:</strong> `Kashmir Princess’, an AI Lockheed Constellation aircraft, disappeared over the South China sea after an explosion. The attack was meant to kill Chinese premier Zhou Enlai, but he was not on board. While 16 died, 3 of the crew survived and were rescued from an island.</p>
<p><strong>Jan 1966:</strong> AI’s ‘Kanchenjunga’, a Boeing 707, crashed 200 metres from the crash site of the Malabar Princess in 1950. All 117 on board were killed, including scientist Homi Bhabha.</p>
<p><strong>Feb 1968:</strong> An IAF AN-12 transport aircraft with 102 people went missing between Chandigarh and Leh, following bad weather. It was only in 2003 that a few hikers found the wreckage in Himachal Pradesh.</p>
<p><strong>April 2002:</strong> An IAF MiG 21 fighter with two officers on board went missing during a training mission in Assam. It has still not been found.</p>
<p><strong>SEPT 2009:</strong> A Bell 430 chopper carrying Andhra CM YSR Reddy went missing over the dense Nallamala forests. The chopper could not be traced for  24 hours. All people on board died.</p>
<p><strong>April 2011:</strong> The helicopter of Arunachal Pradesh CM Dorjee Khandu disappeared during a flight from Tawang to Itanagar. Remains were found only five days later.</p>
<p><strong>Oct 2011:</strong> An IAF MiG 29 disappeared during a night flying operation. One of the largest military hunts took 19 days to recover the body of the pilot.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[As critics grow ahead of its 30th anniversary, Chris Anderson continues to build brand TED.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010689&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As critics grow ahead of its 30th anniversary, Chris Anderson continues to build brand TED.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Chris Anderson was sitting in a very low-power pose. Off to the side at an all-staff meeting at TED’s New York headquarters in January, he was folded forward with his hand on his neck, a posture that communicates self-protection according to the 2012 TED Talk on body language by social psychologist Amy Cuddy (15.7 million views).</span></p>
<p>By letting his employees give mini TED Talks on what they were working on, Anderson was allowing for what Alain de Botton, in his 2009 TED Talk (2.9 million views), called “a kinder, gentler philosophy of success”.</p>
<p>When Anderson took the floor himself, he raised the question, “What are we building today that honestly is going to impress historians in 2,000 years?” It could have come straight from the playbook on “practical wisdom” outlined in a 2009 TED Talk by psychologist Barry Schwartz (1.9 million views).</p>
<p>At 57, Anderson, the British former magazine publisher and Internet entrepreneur who took over the organisation in 2001 and built it into a colossus, is in many ways the embodiment of his famous ideas organisation. Like the TED Talks millions love, Anderson is high-minded but sometimes inaccessible, forward thinking to the point of “whoa”, and so earnest it can be easy to smirk.</p>
<p>But as the 30th anniversary TED Conference this month in Vancouver, British Columbia, approaches, Anderson, forever mild-mannered, is quietly celebrating all he’s accomplished.</p>
<p>What began somewhat modestly in 1984 when architect and designer Richard Saul Wurman summoned 300 friends and colleagues to Monterey, California, to discuss Technology, Entertainment and Design, now has more angles to it than a Mandelbrot set. Part of Anderson’s non-profit Sapling Foundation, the organisation has two annual conferences (this month’s includes 1,200 attendees from 42 countries), the free online collection of more than 1,600 TED Talks has been viewed 2 billion times, a $100,000 TED Prize, a TED Fellows programme and global education initiative, TED digital books, the TED Radio Hour and TEDx events in more than 150 countries.</p>
<p>By helping turn under-the-radar “thought leaders” like Salman Khan, Daniel Gilbert, Brené Brown and Sir Ken Robinson into best-selling authors and lecture-circuit Godzillas, the TED stage has replaced Oprah Winfrey’s couch as the platform most likely to thrill one’s publicist, publisher, accountant and mother-in-law. Al Gore, who first spoke at TED in 1996, for 18 minutes or less, as per the guidelines Anderson established, said: “Every time I have a feeling that TED has come so far that it is about to jump the shark, it doesn’t. Instead, it renews itself.”</p>
<p>Not everyone thinks that way. Lately, Anderson has spent nearly as much time defending his operation as he has running it. Thomas Frank wrote an essay in Salon last October with the headline, ‘TED Talks Are Lying to You’, about the perils of turning “innovation” into an industry.</p>
<p>Then in December at an independent TEDx event in San Diego, Benjamin H Bratton, an associate professor of visual arts at the University of California, San Diego, used his moment on TED’s round red rug to talk smack about TED itself. Bratton called TED “a recipe for civilisational disaster,” pointing to the tent-revival nature of the talks, the faith in technology and what Bratton called a “dumbing-down” of complex science and scholarship. Spreading ideas via short orations adds up to “middlebrow megachurch infotainment”, he said.</p>
<p>In person, Anderson is less imposing and certainly shyer than the Yoda figure in a Nehru jacket on the TED stage. “I’m terrible at the kind of conversations that are normally expected in a social environment,” he said. Susan Cain, whose 2012 TED Talk on introversion has been viewed nearly 8 million times, said of Anderson, “He’s an introvert, I’d say, definitely.”</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Anderson has been blasting back at TED’s naysayers. He comments on threads critical of TED on Reddit and he wrote an essay in The Guardian in January, explaining why most complaints about TED are based on misconceptions. TED is not leftist propaganda nor corporate-sponsored misinformation, he said. And because TED is a non-profit, nobody is getting rich off the $6,000 conference fees that many like to bring up. As for the dumbing down of Internet content, Anderson smiled wryly and said: “Compared to what? Hilarious cat videos?”</p>
<p>The son of British medical missionaries who grew up in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, Anderson said he spent much of his childhood “reading, observing and lying out, looking at the stars and thinking about ideas”. After studying philosophy at Oxford, he turned to journalism, writing about the convergence of video games and computing, before moving to the publishing side.</p>
<p>With fortunes made and lost and made again in publishing, Anderson purchased TED with the idea that it would “change minds and maybe the world,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010689&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2010569" alt="The teenager's death had caused unrest across turkey.(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/s1-reutersmedia-net1.jpg" /> The teenager&#8217;s death had caused unrest across turkey with people taking to the streets chanting &#8216;Tayyip! Killer! and &#8220;Everywhere is Berkin &#8220;. (Reuters)
<p>Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said a teenager who died this week after sustaining a head injury in anti-government protests last summer was linked to &#8220;terrorist organisations&#8221;, in comments likely to fan political tensions.</p>
<p>The death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan on Tuesday after nine months in a coma sparked Turkey&#8217;s worst unrest since nationwide anti-government demonstrations last June, compounding Erdogan&#8217;s woes as he battles a graft scandal that has become one of the biggest challenges of his decade in power.</p>
<p>Erdogan made his remarks, his first about Elvan, late on Friday at a campaign rally in southeast Turkey ahead of nationwide municipal elections on March 30.</p>
<p>&#8220;This kid with steel marbles in his pockets, with a slingshot in his hand, his face covered with a scarf, who had been taken up into terror organisations, was unfortunately subjected to pepper gas,&#8221; Erdogan told a crowd of supporters in a speech broadcast on state-run TRT-Haber news channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could the police determine how old that person was who had a scarf on his face and was hurling steel marbles with a slingshot in his hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elvan, then 14, got caught up in street battles in Istanbul on June 16 while going to buy bread for his family. He was hit in the head by what is believed to be a police gas canister, slipped into a coma and became a rallying point for government opponents, who held regular vigils at the hospital where he lay in intensive care.</p>
<p>After his death, riot police used water cannon, tear gas and rubber pellets to disperse tens of thousands of protesters who took to the streets of Turkey&#8217;s largest cities chanting &#8220;Tayyip! Killer!&#8221; and &#8220;Everywhere is Berkin, everywhere is resistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>At campaign rallies in the past few days, Erdogan has accused a coalition of &#8220;anarchists, terrorists and vandals&#8221; as well as opposition parties and an influential U.S.-based Islamic cleric of orchestrating the unrest to undermine him.</p>
<p>Using harsh words unlikely to soothe public anger, Erdogan &#8211; who unlike President Abdullah Gul and other public figures did not send condolences to Elvan&#8217;s family &#8211; criticised the boy&#8217;s parents and suggested he had not really gone to buy bread.</p>
<p>&#8220;His mother says &#8216;my son&#8217;s killer is the prime minister&#8217;. I know love, fondness for one&#8217;s child, but I could not understand why you threw steel marbles and carnations into your son&#8217;s grave,&#8221; Erdogan said at his election campaign rally.</p>
<p>Elvan&#8217;s family are Alevis, a religious minority in mainly Sunni Muslim Turkey which espouses a liberal version of Islam and has often been at odds with the Islamist-rooted government.</p>
<p>Erdogan contrasted Elvan&#8217;s death with that of 22-year-old Burakcan Karamanoglu, who was shot dead in Istanbul on Wednesday after an apparent standoff with a group of anti-government protesters. Erdogan has blamed his death on a far-leftist group.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our son Burakcan was martyred just three months after coming back from his military service. Burakcan was not carrying a slingshot or a gun,&#8221; Erdogan said. The fathers of Elvan and Karamanoglu spoke together on Friday and made a joint appeal on television to Turks to remain calm and not to use their sons&#8217; deaths for political ends.</p>
<p>Erdogan, who has presided over a decade of rising living standards, remains Turkey&#8217;s most popular politician and his AK Party is expected to outstrip its rivals in the local polls. But critics say Erdogan is becoming increasingly authoritarian and intolerant, pointing to moves to tighten government control of the judiciary and of the Internet.</p>
<p>Erdogan says the moves are necessary to counter what he sees as attempts by a former ally-turned-foe, U.S.-based Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, to unseat him.</p>
<p>Gulen&#8217;s many followers in Turkey&#8217;s police and judiciary are widely believed to be behind a series of leaked audio recordings purportedly exposing graft and other malpractices in Erdogan&#8217;s inner circle. Gulen denies any involvement in the scandal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010559&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thailand on Saturday called off its search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane over the Gulf of Thailand and Andaman Sea after Malaysian Premier said hunt for the aircraft will shift to two new destinations.</p>
<p>Navy commander Adm Narong Pipattanasai ordered the search to stop after Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak confirmed that flight MH370 had changed its course to a new destination, including Kazhakistan and southern Indian ocean, Thailand navy spokesman Adm Karn Dee-ubon said here.</p>
<p>But the navy still directed four ships &#8211; HTMS Pattani, HTMS Tapi, HTMS Songkhla and HTMS Sattahip &#8211; to stand ready in case the Malaysian government needed help for another search, said Rear Adm Karn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our most updated information in the radar system was in Hat Yai in southern Thailand where the air force detected MH370 flying out of Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. That was the first and last time we detected MH370,&#8221; air force spokesman AM Monthon Sutchukorn said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010620&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Indian navy ships supported by long-range surveillance planes and helicopters scoured Andaman Sea islands for a third day on Saturday without any success in finding evidence of the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, officials said.</p>
<p>Nearly a dozen ships, patrol vessels, surveillance aircraft and helicopters have been deployed, but &#8220;we have got nothing so far,&#8221; said V.S.R. Murthy, an Indian coast guard official.</p>
<p>The Indian navy&#8217;s coordinated search has so far covered more than 250,000 square kilometers (100,579 square miles) in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal &#8220;without any sighting or detection,&#8221; the Defense Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>The search has been expanded to the central and eastern sides of the Bay of Bengal, the ministry said.</p>
<p>India intensified the search on Saturday by deploying two recently acquired P8i long-range maritime patrol and one C 130J Hercules aircraft to the region. Short-range maritime reconnaissance Dornier aircraft have also been deployed, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has joined the search effort in the Bay of Bengal with two patrol aircraft and two frigates, said Mahbubul Haque Shakil, an aide of Bangladesh&#8217;s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.</p>
<p>Seeing no headway, Malaysian authorities suggested Friday a new search area of 9,000 square kilometers (3,474 square miles) to India along the Chennai coast in the Bay of Bengal, India&#8217;s Defense Ministry said.</p>
<p>On Friday, India used heat sensors on flights over hundreds of uninhabited Andaman Sea islands that stretch south of Myanmar, covering an area 720 kilometers (447 miles) long and 52 kilometers (32 miles) wide. Only 37 of 572 are inhabited, with the rest covered in dense forests.</p>
<p>The island chain has four airstrips, but only the main airport in Port Blair can handle a large commercial jet.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010585&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2010586" alt="Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, center, Malaysia's Minister for Transport Hishamuddin Hussein, left, and director general of the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, deliver a statement to the media  in Sepang on Saturday.

<p>The missing Malaysian jetliner was deliberately diverted and continued flying for more than six hours after losing contact with the ground, meaning it could have gone as far northwest as Kazakhstan or into the Indian Ocean&#8217;s southern reaches, Malaysia&#8217;s leader said Saturday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Najib Razak&#8217;s statement confirmed days of mounting speculation that the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 to Beijing more than a week ago was not accidental. It refocused the investigation into the flight&#8217;s crew and passengers and underlined the massive task for searchers who already have been scouring vast areas of ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly the search for MH370 has entered a new phase,&#8221; Najib said at a televised news conference.</p>
<p>Najib stressed that investigators were looking into all possibilities as to why the Boeing 777 deviated so drastically from its original flight path, saying authorities could not confirm whether it was a hijacking. Earlier Saturday, a Malaysian official said the plane had been hijacked, though he added that no motive had been established and no demands had been made known.</p>
<p>&#8220;In view of this latest development, the Malaysian authorities have refocused their investigation into the crew and passengers on board,&#8221; Najib told reporters, reading from a written statement but not taking any questions.</p>
<p>Police on Saturday drove into the residential compound where the missing plane&#8217;s pilot lives in Kuala Lumpur, according a guard and several local reporters who were barred from entering the complex. Authorities have said they will investigate the pilots as part of their probe, but have released no information about how they are progressing.</p>
<p>Experts have previously said that whoever disabled the plane&#8217;s communication systems and then flew the jet must have had a high degree of technical knowledge and flying experience. One possibility they have raised was that one of the pilots wanted to commit suicide.</p>
<p>The plane was carrying 239 people when it departed for an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing at 12:40 a.m. on March 8. Its communications with civilian air controllers were severed at about 1:20 a.m., and the jet went missing — heralding one of the most puzzling mysteries in modern aviation history.</p>
<p>Investigators now have a high degree of certainty that one of the plane&#8217;s communications systems — the Aircraft and Communications Addressing and Reporting System — was disabled before the aircraft reached the east coast of Malaysia, Najib said. Shortly afterward, someone on board then switched off the aircraft&#8217;s transponder, which communicates with civilian air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>Najib then confirmed that Malaysian air force defense radar picked up traces of the plane turning back westward, crossing over Peninsular Malaysia into the northern stretches of the Strait of Malacca. Authorities previously had said this radar data could not be verified.</p>
<p>&#8220;These movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane,&#8221; Najib said.</p>
<p>Although the aircraft was flying virtually blind to air traffic controllers at this point, onboard equipment continued to send pings to satellites.</p>
<p>The prime minister said the last confirmed signal between the plane and a satellite came at 8:11 a.m. — 7 hours and 31 minutes after takeoff. This was more than five hours later than the previous time given by Malaysian authorities as the possible last contact.</p>
<p>Airline officials have said the plane had enough fuel to fly for up to about eight hours.</p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-2010587" alt="A foam plane with messages and other cards with personalized messages dedicated to people involved with the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner MH370, is placed at the viewing gallery at Kuala Lumpur International Airport." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia22.jpg" /> A foam plane with messages and other cards with personalized messages dedicated to people involved with the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner MH370, is placed at the viewing gallery at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
<p>&#8220;The investigations team is making further calculations which will indicate how far the aircraft may have flown after this last point of contact,&#8221; Najib said.</p>
<p>He said authorities had determined that the plane&#8217;s last communication with a satellite was in one of two possible &#8220;corridors&#8221; — a northern one from northern Thailand through to the border of the Central Asian countries Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern one from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Searching in the South China Sea, where the plane first lost contact, has ended, Najib said.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the plane&#8217;s 227 passengers were Chinese, and China&#8217;s government has been under pressure to give relatives firm news of the plane&#8217;s fate.</p>
<p>In a stinging commentary, the Chinese government&#8217;s Xinhua News Agency accused Malaysia of dragging its feet in releasing information. Information released by the Malaysian leader is &#8220;painfully belated,&#8221; the commentary said. It said delays had resulted in wasted efforts and strained the nerves of relatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given today&#8217;s technology, the delay smacks of either dereliction of duty or reluctance to share information in a full and timely manner,&#8221; Xinhua said. &#8220;That would be intolerable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said China had urged Malaysia to release more details about the new search area.</p>
<p>The northern route described by Najib might have taken the plane through a region home to extremist Islamist groups and unstable governments, as well as remote, sparsely populated areas. But the region also hosts U.S. military bases with powerful surveillance capabilities.</p>
<p>Flying south would put the plane over the Indian Ocean, with an average depth of 3,890 meters (12,762 feet) and thousands of kilometers (miles) from the nearest land mass.</p>
<p>Malaysia has faced accusations that it isn&#8217;t sharing all its information or suspicions about the plane&#8217;s final movements, which have been the subject of constant media leaks both in Malaysia and the United States. Najib said that he understood the need for families to receive information, but that his government wanted to release only fully corroborated information.</p>
<p>He said that from Day One, the country had been sharing information with international investigators, even when it meant placing &#8220;national security concerns&#8221; second to the search, a likely reference to its release of military radar data. U.S., British and Malaysian air safety investigators have been on the ground in Malaysia to assist with the investigation.</p>
<p>In the Chinese capital, relatives of passengers who have anxiously awaited news at a hotel near Beijing&#8217;s airport said they felt deceived at not being told earlier about the plane&#8217;s last signal. &#8220;We are going through a roller coaster, and we feel helpless and powerless,&#8221; said a woman, who declined to give her name.</p>
<p>At least one of the people waiting at the hotel saw a glimmer of hope in word that the plane&#8217;s disappearance was a deliberate act, rather than a crash. &#8220;It&#8217;s very good,&#8221; said the woman, who gave only her surname, Wen.</p>
<p>Malaysian police have already said they are looking at the psychological state, family life and connections of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27. Both have been described as respectable, community-minded men.</p>
<p>Zaharie joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had more than 18,000 hours of experience. His Facebook page showed an aviation enthusiast who flew remote-controlled aircraft, posting pictures of his collection, which included a lightweight twin-engine helicopter and an amphibious aircraft.</p>
<p>Fariq was contemplating marriage after having just graduated to the cockpit of a Boeing 777. He has drawn scrutiny after the revelation that in 2011, he and another pilot invited two women aboard their aircraft to sit in the cockpit for a flight from Phuket, Thailand, to Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Fourteen countries are involved in the search, which is using 43 ships and 58 aircraft.</p>
<p>A U.S. P-8A Poseidon, the most advanced long-range anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft in the world, was to arrive over the weekend and sweep parts of the Indian Ocean. It has a nine-member crew and has advanced surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, the U.S. Defense Department said in a statement.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010583&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Slovak citizens are voting in a presidential election, choosing among 14 candidates to succeed Ivan Gasparovic in a largely ceremonial post.</span></p>
<div>
<p>Left-leaning Prime Minister Robert Fico is a favourite in Saturday&#8217;s balloting. The 49-year-old heads Slovakia&#8217;s dominant SMER-Social Democracy party. He led it to a landslide victory in 2012 that allowed the party to govern alone — a first for Slovakia.</p>
<p>Fico&#8217;s major challenger is Andrej Kiska, the 51-year-old successful businessman-turned philanthropist.</p>
<p>Other notable candidates include Milan Knazko, a leading figure of the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended Communist rule in Czechoslovakia and Radoslav Prochazka, an independent conservative lawmaker with a degree from Yale Law School.</p>
<p>If no candidate wins at least 50 percent, the top two will advance to a second round on March 29.</p>

(AP)
<p>There is more than enough proof that would allow a jury to decide to convict <a title="Osama Bin Laden’s son-in-law goes on trial in NYC" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/americas/osama-bin-ladens-son-in-law-goes-on-trial-in-nyc/" target="_blank">Osama Bin Laden</a>&#8216;s son-in-law and<a title="Top IM men have joined al-Qaeda, fighting in Af-Pak: NIA chargesheet" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/top-im-men-have-joined-al-qaeda-fighting-in-af-pak-nia-chargesheet/" target="_blank"> Al-Qaeda</a> spokesman of conspiring to kill Americans, a judge said as he turned down a defence request to dismiss the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government&#8217;s evidence in (the count) of the conspiracy to murder Americans is dramatically more than merely sufficient,&#8221; US District Judge Lewis A Kaplan said, adding that he also saw evidence as &#8220;more than sufficient to warrant a conviction&#8221; on other charges concerning providing material support to terrorists. The verdict &#8220;is ultimately up to the jury, not me,&#8221; he noted. &#8220;But it is sufficient to permit the jury to convict on all counts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutors rested their case Friday in the trial of the highest-level Al-Qaeda figure to be tried in the US since the September 11 attacks. The defence case is due to start Monday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say that Abu Ghaith was part of  Al-Qaeda&#8217;s deadly plotting in his role as spokesman in fiery videos and interviews after 9/11 and as a motivational speaker at the group&#8217;s training camps in Afghanistan in the summer before the attacks. Prosecutors have built their case partly on his own words, including a declaration on September 12, 2001, that &#8220;the storm of airplanes will not abate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith&#8217;s lawyers have said the Kuwait-born Imam made inflammatory remarks but didn&#8217;t conspire to carry out terrorism. He said in a statement to authorities after his arrest last year that as 9/11 approached, he knew nothing of any specific plan to attack the US, though he&#8217;d heard &#8220;something big was going to happen.&#8221; &#8220;The government has not met its burden (of proof), and the case should be dismissed,&#8221; one of his lawyers, Zoe Dolan, said Friday in urging Kaplan to toss out the case.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers have sought information from professed September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed, and they&#8217;re likely to revisit Monday whether they can use it at the trial.</p>
<p>They recently received answers to written questions they sent to Mohammed in a detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but they would need Kaplan&#8217;s OK to introduce the information.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010424&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">This is Ukraine today, at least as seen by most Russian news media: the government is run by anti-Semitic fascists, people killed in protests were shot by opposition snipers and the West is behind it all.</span></p>
<p>And the room to disagree with that portrayal is getting smaller by the week.</p>
<p>With Crimea set to hold a referendum on Sunday on whether to merge with Russia, the push to demonize Ukraine&#8217;s leadership has reached fever pitch. Authorities in Ukraine have responded by blocking Russian TV channels.</p>
<p>Lev Gudkov, head of a respected independent Moscow-based polling agency, says the propagandist tone of Russian state television has reached new levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;For intensity, comprehensiveness and aggressiveness, this is like nothing I have ever seen over the whole post-Soviet period,&#8221; Gudkov said.</p>
<p>News bulletins on top network Channel 1 carry extensive reports detailing purported rampant lawlessness to vague threats of reprisals against ethnic Russians and Jews, as well as showing interviews with talking heads alleging foreign-engineered plots.</p>
<p>NTV, owned by gas giant Gazprom&#8217;s media arm, on Thursday aired a report about purportedly hacked email correspondence between U.S. and Ukrainian officials on plans for staging an attack on military jets. The piece goes on to claim that the incident was to serve as an excuse for the United States to take military action against Russia.</p>
<p>It is steadily becoming conventional wisdom in the most widely watched news shows that those shot dead during protests in Kiev last month were victims of shadowy figures possibly hired by opposition forces.</p>
<p>Right Sector, a radical ultranationalist group that spearheaded the most violent assaults against riot police, is a subject of scaremongering daily exposes. For all the attention it has received, the group has not been granted any posts in the new government and observers say it has little actual clout.</p>
<p>Late Thursday night, clashes broke out in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk between government supporters and a hostile pro-Russian crowd. At one point a pro-Russian mob encircled and threw objects at a small huddle of people, shouting for them to get on their knees. At least one person died in the turmoil.</p>
<p>Rossiya-1, another state station, on the same evening reported that the incident had been provoked by &#8220;special forces&#8221; of the Maidan, the informal name of the movement that brought about last month&#8217;s ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
<p>Ukraine&#8217;s pushback against the Kremlin-led smear campaign has not been much more sophisticated.</p>
<p>Broadcast authorities there on Tuesday ordered the suspension of the signal of Russian state-controlled television stations — a move that drew swift indignation from Moscow and international media advocacy groups alike.</p>
<p>People in Russia&#8217;s provinces, where Internet penetration is weak, are particularly prone to one-sided information.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only sources of information there are the federal television stations, and they have been conducting an exercise in brainwashing,&#8221; Gudkov said.</p>
<p>In Crimea, one of the two TV stations allowed to broadcast keeps repeating a clip that displays the slogan &#8220;March 16: Together with Russia&#8221; while blaring the Russian national anthem.</p>
<p>The only other TV station broadcasting there is ATR, run by representatives of the peninsula&#8217;s Crimean Tatar community which supports the government in Kiev. The channel, which has a &#8220;United Country&#8221; logo, has shown regular on-the-street interviews with people explaining that they want Crimea to remain part of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Many journalists on the ground covering events in Crimea have faced intimidation and assaults from members of pro-Russian militia forces, further complicating efforts to report a fuller picture.</p>
<p>A recent survey published this week by Gudkov&#8217;s Levada Center appears to show the propaganda campaign has had the desired effect in Russia. Asked if there were grounds for Russia deploying troops to Crimea, which has an ethnic Russian majority, 43 percent of respondents said a military response was justified because people there were at risk of attack from &#8220;bandits and nationalists.&#8221; Another 28 percent agreed on the threat, but suggested a political solution would be preferable.</p>
<p>There have been no signs people in Crimea are facing threats.</p>
<p>Dissenting Russians have turned to online sources for alternative viewpoints, including on current developments in Ukraine, but an unfolding crackdown on Internet news outlets looks set to stem that flow.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the owner of leading independent news website Lenta.ru fired its chief editor, Galina Timchenko, following official complaints over the outlet&#8217;s coverage of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The communications regulator said Lenta.ru breached a law banning dissemination of extremist material by linking to comments by Dmytro Yarosh, a nationalist Ukrainian leader wanted in Russia on charges of instigating terrorism.</p>
<p>Ominously for online outlets, closure of websites deemed to contain &#8220;extremist&#8221; material or incitements to join unauthorized rallies can as of this year be closed without a court order.</p>
<p>One day after the Lenta.ru editor was fired, a handful of websites notable for their criticism of the government, and a blog run by prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny, were summarily banned on a request from prosecutors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russian authorities are unabashedly cleansing the media landscape of independent voices that have the power to shape minds,&#8221; said Committee to Protect Journalists representative Nina Ognianova. &#8220;We condemn this ban on alternative sources of news and opinion, and call on Moscow to cease this Soviet-style crackdown.&#8221;</p>
<p>Less than half of Russia&#8217;s adult population uses the Internet on a daily basis, but the sight of commuters in Moscow and other major cities glued to their smartphones suggests that is changing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The authorities are increasingly interested in the generation that looks much more at the Internet,&#8221; said Sergei Buntman, deputy editor of liberal-leaning Ekho Moskvy radio station, whose website was also momentarily blocked by major providers overnight Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Turning off sources of information to skeptics is probably the main goal of this drumbeat of propaganda that there has been since the events in Ukraine,&#8221; Buntman said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010432&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gunmen opened fire on a checkpoint in Cairo on Saturday, killing five Egyptian soldiers, state television reported.</p>
<p>The attack comes two days after gunmen attacked a military bus in the capital, killing a soldier. Militants have launched scores of attacks, mainly targeting security forces, since the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in July.</p>
<p>Most of the attacks have taken place in the restive Sinai Peninsula, but in recent months militants have expanded their reach to the Nile Delta and the capital. The government has blamed much of the violence on Morsi&#8217;s Muslim Brotherhood, which renounced violence decades ago and has denied any involvement.</p>
<p>The most prominent attacks, including a car bombing at a police headquarters in Cairo and the downing of a military helicopter in Sinai, have been claimed by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis (Partisans of Jerusalem), a Sinai-based jihadist movement.</p>
<p>The group has said the attacks are in retaliation for a brutal government crackdown on Morsi&#8217;s Islamist supporters, which Amnesty International says has claimed some 1,400 lives.</p>
<p>Morsi was elected in Egypt&#8217;s first-ever democratic presidential election, following the 2011 uprising that toppled long-ruling dictator Hosni Mubarak. But his year in power bitterly polarised Egyptians, and last summer the military ousted him amid massive street protests demanding his overthrow.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010387&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The investigating official says no motive has been established, and it is not yet clear where the plane was taken.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010224&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia13.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2010356" alt="malaysia" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia13.jpg" /></a> The official said that hijacking was no longer a theory. &#8220;It is conclusive,&#8221; he said.
<p>Communications on a missing <a href="http://Missing Malaysia plane may have run out of fuel over Indian Ocean">Malaysia Airlines jet</a> were deliberately disabled and the last signal from the plane came more than seven hours after takeoff, meaning it could have ended up anywhere from the southern Indian Ocean to Central Asia, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said Saturday.</p>
<p>Najib&#8217;s announcement confirmed days of mounting speculation that the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 with 239 people on board was not accidental. It means the investigation will now focus on who may have taken control of the plane and why, and that the search area will be vastly expanded, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly the search for MH370 has entered a new phase,&#8221; Najib said. &#8220;We hope this new information brings us one step closer to finding the plane.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flight 370 departed from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing at 12:40 a.m. March 8, and latest available satellite data showed the last confirmed signal from the plane to a satellite was at 8:11 a.m.</p>
<p>Najib said authorities are now trying to trace the airplane missing for more than a week across two possible &#8220;corridors&#8221; _ a northern corridor from northern Thailand through to the border of Kazakstan and Turkmenistan, and a southern corridor from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Najib said that searching in the South China Sea, where the plane first lost contact with air traffic controllers, would be ended. He said the new search corridors were based on the latest satellite data.</p>
<p>Earlier authorities have said the plane had enough fuel to fly for up to about eight hours.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010224&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2005286 " alt="Missing plane last has contact with air traffic controllers 120 nautical miles off the east coast of the Malaysian town ( FIle photo: Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mall-lll.jpg" /> There is a  possibility that after the airliner did a sharp turn towards the Indian Ocean where officials think, it flew until it ran out of fuel and crashed into the sea. ( Reuters)
<p>Analysis of electronic pulses picked up from a missing Malaysian airliner shows it could have run out of fuel and crashed into the Indian Ocean after it flew hundreds of miles off course, a source familiar with official U.S. assessments said on Friday.</p>
<p>The source, who is familiar with data the U.S. government is receiving from the investigation into the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines plane, said the other, less likely possibility was that it flew on toward India.</p>
<p>The data obtained from pulses the plane sent to satellites had been interpreted to provide two different analyses because it was ambiguous, said the source, who declined to be identified because of the ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>But it offers the first real clues as to the fate of Flight MH370, which officials increasingly believe was deliberately diverted off its scheduled course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The Boeing 777-200ER was carrying 239 people.</p>
<p>Two sources familiar with the probe earlier said Malaysian military radar data showed a plane that investigators suspect was Flight MH370 following a commonly used navigational route toward the Middle East and Europe when it was last spotted by radar early on March 8, northwest of Malaysia.</p>
<p>The electronic pulses were believed to have been transmitted for several hours after the plane flew out of radar range, said the source familiar with the data.</p>
<p>The most likely possibility is that after travelling northwest, the airliner did a sharp turn to the south, into the Indian Ocean where officials think, based on the available data, it flew until it ran out of fuel and crashed into the sea, added the source.</p>
<p>The other interpretation from the pulses is that Flight MH370 continued to fly to the northwest and headed over Indian territory, said the source. Because of the fragmentary nature of the data, U.S. officials don&#8217;t know for sure which analysis is correct, although they believe the turn to the south is more likely, the source said.</p>
<p>The source added that it was believed unlikely the plane flew for any length of time over India because that country has strong air defence and radar coverage and that should have allowed authorities there to see the plane and intercept it.</p>
<p>Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on Friday he could not confirm the last heading of the plane or if investigators were focusing on sabotage. There has been no trace of the plane nor any sign of wreckage as the navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries scour the seas on both sides of peninsular Malaysia.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010198&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukraine-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009970" alt="US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in London Friday. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukraine-med.jpg" /></a> US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in London Friday. (AP)
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Friday said differences remain between Moscow and the US following negotiations in London aimed at ending the crisis in Ukraine, whose strategic Crimea region is voting this weekend on whether to secede.</p>
<p>After several hours of talks with US Secretary of State John Kerry, Lavrov confirmed there was “no common vision” between the two nations although he described the dialogue as “useful”.</p>
<p>Sunday’s vote on Crimea &#8211; Ukraine’s strategic Black Sea peninsula of 2 million people &#8211; is widely expected to back secession and, potentially, annexation with Russia. The new government in Kiev believes the vote is illegal, but Moscow says it does not recognize the new government as legitimate.</p>
<p>The US and EU say the Crimean vote violates Ukraine’s constitution and international law. If Crimea votes to secede, the US and European Union plan to slap sanctions as early as Monday on Russian officials and businesses accused of escalating the crisis and undermining Ukraine’s new government.</p>
<p>Lavrov on Friday reaffirmed that Russia will “respect the results of the referendum” in Crimea and said sanctions would harm relations. “Our partners also realize that sanctions are counterproductive,” he said.</p>
<p>The Russian Foreign Ministry said clashes on Thursday in the eastern city of Donetsk showed that Ukrainian authorities had lost control of the country and could not provide basic security.</p>
<p>Ukraine responded by calling the Russian statement “impressive in its cynicism”.</p>
<p>“(The Donetsk clashes had) a direct connection to deliberate, destructive actions of certain citizens of Russia and some Russian social organisations&#8230;’’ Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Evgeny Perebiynis said.</p>
<p>The UN assistant secretary-general Ivan Simonovic, told reporters Friday in Kiev that there was “no sign of human rights violations of such a proportion, of such widespread intensity that would require any military measures.”</p>
<p>British Prime Minister David Cameron underlined the threat of sanctions. “We want to see Ukrainians and the Russians talking to each other. And if they don’t, then there are going to have to be consequences,’’ he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009965&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysian-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009961" alt="Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the country had yet to determine what happened to the plane after it dropped off civilian radar and ceased communicating with the ground around 40 minutes into the flight to Beijing.

(AP)
<p>Malaysian investigators are increasingly certain that the missing jetliner turned back across the country after losing communications, and that someone with aviation skills was responsible for the unexplained change in course, according to a government official involved in the probe.</p>
<p>The official, who declined to be identified as he is not authorized to brief the media, said only a skilled person could navigate the Boeing 777 the way it was flown after its last confirmed location over the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Speaking earlier, acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the country had yet to determine what happened to the plane after it dropped off civilian radar and ceased communicating with the ground around 40 minutes into the flight to Beijing.<br />
He said investigators were still trying to establish with certainty that military radar records of a blip moving west across the Malay Peninsula into the Strait of Malacca showed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.</p>
<p>“I will be the happiest person if we can actually confirm that it is the MH370, then we can move all (search) assets from the South China Sea to the Strait of Malacca,” he told reporters. Until then, he said, the international search effort would continue expanding east and west from the plane’s last confirmed location.</p>
<p>The Malaysian official said it had now been established with a “more than 50 percent” degree of certainty that military radar had picked up the missing plane.</p>
<p>On Thursday, an American official said the plane remained airborne after losing contact with air traffic controllers because it was sending a signal to establish contact with a satellite.</p>
<p>The Malaysian official confirmed this, referring to the process by its technical term of a “handshake”.</p>
<p>Boeing offers a satellite service that can receive a stream of data on how an aircraft is functioning during flight and relay the information to the plane’s home base. Malaysia Airlines didn’t subscribe to that service, but the plane still had the capability to connect with the satellite and was automatically sending signals, or pings, said the US official.</p>
<p>Hishammuddin said the government would only release information about the signals when they were verified. “I hope within a couple of days to have something conclusive,” he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Malaysia has faced accusations it isn’t sharing all its information or suspicions about the plane’s final movements. It insists it is being open, and says it would be irresponsible to narrow the focus of the search until there is undeniable evidence of the plane’s flight path.</p>
<p>No theory has been ruled out in one of modern aviation’s most puzzling mysteries.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009956&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>NASA has joined international search operations to trace the missing Malaysian aircraft by analysing satellite data and images gathered since the plane with 239 people aboard vanished from radar screens a week ago.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s premier space agency on Monday began examining ways it can contribute to the search for missing Flight MH370.</p>
<p>&#8220;Activities under way include mining data archives of satellite data acquired earlier and using space-based assets, such as the Earth-Observing-1(EO-1) satellite and the ISERV camera on the International Space Station, to acquire new images of possible crash sites,&#8221; said Allard Beutel, spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p>
<p>&#8220;The resolution of images from these instruments could be used to identify objects of about 98 feet (30 meters) or larger,&#8221; he told Space.com.</p>
<p>The space agency will be sending relevant data to the US Geological Survey&#8217;s Earth Resources Observations and Science Hazard Data Distribution System, which facilitates the sharing of information whenever the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters is activated, Beutel said.</p>
<p>NASA&#8217;s ISERV camera system was launched in July 2012 to observe &#8220;specific areas of the globe for disaster analysis and environmental studies,&#8221; the space agency said.<br />
The Beijing-bound Boeing 777-200 mysteriously disappeared from radar screens an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on March 7.</p>
<p>Despite massive search operations involving the navies and military aircraft from 13 countries, there has been no trace of the missing jet.</p>
<p>Malaysia on Friday widened its search in the Indian Ocean for the plane and sought radar data from its neighbours and India. The missing jetliner was carrying 227 passengers, including five Indians and one Indian-origin Canadian, and 12 crew members.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009921&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/same-sex-marriage-medium.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009910" alt="SAME-SEX-MARRIAGE-MEDIUM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/same-sex-marriage-medium.jpg" /></a> It is going to be an inordinate percentage of the wedding market in the next five to 10 years says experts. (Reuters)
<p>Growing acceptance and legalization of same-sex marriages in the United States and around the globe will fuel the travel and hospitality industries and boost spending by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender consumers, experts say.</p>
<p>Seventeen U.S. states and the District of Columbia, and a similar number of countries recognize gay unions. Last month Scotland legalized gay marriages, joining a list that includes the Netherlands, Brazil, France, New Zealand, Argentina, South Africa and others.</p>
<p>Although the LGBT community is a small segment of the U.S. population, Charlie Rounds, of the Florida-based International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA) Foundation, said the changes in marriage laws will have big implications for travel in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is going to be an inordinate percentage of the wedding market in the next five to 10 years,&#8221; he said in an interview during a visit to New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though we are only maybe 4 or 5 percent of the population, the number of us getting married is probably going to be 20 times that because we couldn&#8217;t and now we can,&#8221; added Rounds, who is also the managing director of U.S. marketing agency OutThink Partners.</p>
<p>Gay couples who have waited years, and in some cases decades, to legalize their unions will be tying the knot and many have the economic resources to pay for large, expensive weddings in far-flung locations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting married at a different place in life,&#8221; said Rounds, who wed his long-term partner in a big church wedding. INCREASED VISIBILITY, NEW DESTINATIONS</p>
<p>Data released in November by Out Now Business Class, a resource website to reach LGBT consumers, showed that in 2014 LGBT tourism spending is expected to top $200 billion for the first time.</p>
<p>The United States accounts for $56.5 billion of the spending, according to the figures, followed by Brazil with $25.3 billion. LGBT Europeans are expected to spend $66.1 billion on tourism.</p>
<p>LoAnn Halden, media relations director of IGLTA, said LGBT travel has increased in visibility in recent years.</p>
<p>&#8220;As acceptance of LGBT rights increases people feel more comfortable being open when they are traveling and more destinations are getting on the bandwagon to market to gay travelers,&#8221; Halden explained.</p>
<p>Key West in Florida, San Francisco, New York and Provincetown in Massachusetts, which have long welcomed gay tourists, are being joined by new cities, regions and countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of people marketing openly has also increased,&#8221; Halden added in an interview. &#8220;Now we are seeing places like Door County, Wisconsin, marketing to the LGBT community. In South America we are seeing more smaller regional destinations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gay cruises now travel to Cambodia and Vietnam, as well as some Croatian ports, and Asia, Brazil and India are among the growth markets.</p>
<p>Major hotel brands and airlines are also appealing directly to the LGBT community through microsites and advertising.<br />
Rounds said safety and legal protection are still concerns for gay travelers and he stressed the importance when searching for travel destinations to look at their rights on LGBT issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are demanding visibility and equal rights,&#8221; said Halden. &#8220;There are a lot of people who haven&#8217;t been able to get married and they are queuing up.&#8221;   (Editing by Eric Kelsey and Steve Orlofsky)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009903&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Puneet Talwar has been confirmed by the US Senate to a key diplomatic position, becoming the second Indian-American to join the State Department.</p>
<p>Talwar, who was a key aide of President Barack Obama on the Middle East, would now serve as the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. He was confirmed on Thursday by voice vote.</p>
<p>In September last year Obama nominated Talwar, who played a key role on negotiations with Iran, to this top diplomatic position in the State Department.</p>
<p>After being sworn-in, Talwar would be the second Indian American serving as assistant secretary in the State Department after Nisha Desai Biswal, who is the Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia.</p>
<p>Talwar would provide policy direction in the areas of international security, security assistance, military operations, defence strategy and plans, and defence trade.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Political-Military Affairs is the Department of State&#8217;s principal link to the Department of Defence.</p>
<p>Since 2009, Talwar has been a Special Assistant to the US President and Senior Director for Iran, Iraq, and the Gulf States on the White House National Security Staff.</p>
<p>Prior to this, Talwar served as a Senior Professional Staff Member on the Committee on Foreign Relations of the US Senate (SFRC) from 2001 to 2009 and from 1997 to 1999, and was the chief advisor on the Middle East to then Senator Joseph R Biden in his capacity as the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
<p>He served as a member of the Department of State&#8217;s Policy Planning Staff from 1999 to 2001. From 1992 to 1995, he served as a foreign policy advisor to Representative Thomas C Sawyer, and from 1990 to 1992 as an official with the United Nations.</p>
<p>Talwar received a B.S. from Cornell University and an M.A. from Columbia University&#8217;s School of International and Public Affairs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009896&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>China on Friday welcomed India joining the multi-nation hunt for the missing Malaysian plane in what has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history.</p>
<p>China, anxious for a quick breakthrough in the search for the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 with 154 of its nationals aboard, has so far confined its search to the South China Sea. Malaysia on Friday widened its search into the Indian Ocean for the missing aircraft with 239 people aboard and sought radar data from its neighbours and India.</p>
<p>Five Indians are also among the missing passengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Malaysia invited India for the search and rescue operations in the western part of the sea. We contacted the Indian side and confirmed it with them. We appreciate their efforts in search and rescue,&#8221; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a media briefing here on Friday answering questions whether Beijing is in touch with New Delhi.</p>
<p>Hong said eight Chinese vessels, three aircraft and five helicopters all focused their efforts on the South China Sea based on data that the plane went missing over Vietnam on March 8. But as latest investigations pointed to new possibilities that the plane might have turned back and flown over the Malacca Straits and towards the Andaman Islands, Malaysia requested India to join search operations.</p>
<p>India has deployed four warships along with six aircraft including the latest special surveillance P-8I plane and three helicopters under the &#8216;Operation Searchlight&#8217;.</p>
<p>As the theatre of operations shifted to the Indian Ocean, China has alerted its commercial ships plying in the Malacca Straits and the Andaman Sea to look out for debris from the missing plane.</p>
<p>Asked whether China would now extend its search operations to the Andaman Sea, Hong said only the marine search and rescue centre can provide that information.</p>
<p>While the scope of the search broadened, China continued to raise possibilities that the plane might be missing over the Gulf of Thailand located between Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Chinese researchers are reported to have detected a &#8220;seafloor event&#8221; resembling a tremor near the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam, an area suspected to be linked with the<br />
missing planes flightpath.</p>
<p>The event occurred at about 2:55 am local time on Saturday, about one and a half hours after the plane&#8217;s last definitive sighting on civilian radar, according to a research<br />
group on seismology and physics of the earth&#8217;s interior under the University of Science and Technology of China.</p>
<p>&#8220;The seafloor event could have been caused by the plane possibly plunging into the sea,&#8221; the research group said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009889&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A knife-wielding attacker hacked five persons to death before being shot dead by police in a central Chinese city, reminiscing a slashing spree at a railway station by militants from the restive Xinjaing province that claimed 33 lives.</p>
<p>A knife fight broke out between two vendors reportedly from volatile northwestern Xinjiang province at an outdoor market in Changsha City, the capital of Hunan province.</p>
<p>A vendor fatally attacked and killed another after a heated debate. He then started attacking innocent bystanders,killing two persons and injuring two others, before being shot dead by the police.</p>
<p>The two injured later died in hospital, Changsha police said.The vendors were said to be from Xinjiang, home to the mostly-Muslim Uygur minority, media reports said.</p>
<p>Police had cordoned off the site and primary school in a north Changsha neighbourhood has been closed, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
<p>China remains nervous after a deadly stabbing incident at the railway station in Kunming, the capital of southwest Yunnan province, on March 1 in which 33 people were killed and 143 wounded.</p>
<p>The government blamed the Kunming attack on militants from Xinjiang region where the native Muslim Uygur community is opposed to settlements of people from the majority Hans from the rest of the country.</p>
<p>It was the first time militants from the banned East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an al-Qaeda-backed group,from Xinjiang had been blamed for carrying out such a large-scale attack from their remote homeland.</p>
<p>ETIM has been fighting for the independence of Xinjiang province.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009885&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2005752" alt="The Beijing-bound Boeing 777-200 Flight MH370 of Malaysia Airlines had 227 passengers aboard. (AP Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiaairline_480.jpg" /> The Beijing-bound Flight MH370 of Malaysia Airlines had 239 passengers aboard and now has been missing for nearly a week.  (AP)
<p>Chinese researchers have detected a &#8220;seafloor event&#8221; near the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam, an area suspected to be linked with the missing Malaysian jetliner that disappeared nearly a week ago.</p>
<p>The event occurred at about 2:55 am local time on Saturday, about one and a half hours after the plane&#8217;s last definitive sighting on civilian radar, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, suggesting a tremor of a kind on the floor bed of the sea.</p>
<p>The area, 116 km northeast from where the last contact with the Boeing plane was recorded, used to be a non-seismic region, according to a research group on seismology and physics of the earth&#8217;s interior under the University of Science and Technology of China.</p>
<p>The seafloor event could have been caused by the plane possibly plunging into the sea, the research group said.</p>
<p>The plane carrying 239 passengers and crew went missing on last Friday. There was no clue so far about its whereabouts despite intense search involving planes and ships from several countries.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009528&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mush.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009521 " alt="Musharraf had on Tuesday failed to turn up for his indictment in the court citing security reasons and was summoned on Friday" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mush.jpg" /></a> Recently, Musharraf failed to turn up for his indictment in the court citing security reasons and was summoned on Friday
<p>Embattled former Pakistani dictator General Pervez Musharraf&#8217;s legal team, on Friday, filed a petition seeking exemption for his personal appearance before the special court conducting his treason trial.</p>
<p>A three-member bench, headed by Justice Faisal Arab of the Sindh High Court, had summoned 70-year-old Musharraf on Friday for him to be indicted.</p>
<p>However, Musharraf&#8217;s counsel, Anwar Mansoor, submitted an application in the court requesting for the his exemption from today&#8217;s hearing. He said the background checks need to be conducted on the security personnel deployed for Musharraf&#8217;s security and this would take at least 10-12 weeks.</p>
<p>Justice Arab said that the lawyer should inform the court in 30 minutes if Musharraf will appear or not. The judge noted that in case he does not appear, charges will be read out to the lawyer.</p>
<p>Ahmad Raza Kasuri, another lawyer of Musharraf, said that an accused cannot be indicted in absentia. Meanwhile, a team of police reached the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology to take the former President to the court.With authorities promising fool-proof security, Justice Arab had yesterday said the order to produce the former President in court on March 14 remained intact.</p>
<p>Musharraf had on Tuesday failed to turn up for his indictment in the court citing security reasons and was summoned today. This is the first time in Pakistan&#8217;s history that a former military ruler is facing high treason trial. The Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) briefed the special court judges on the security alert issued relating to Musharraf.</p>
<p>The ISI representatives told the judges that the latest alert was issued after a call had been traced in relation to a possible attack being planned against him.</p>
<p>The men, who briefed the judges after the hearing was adjourned on Thursday, said the threat to Musharraf&#8217;s life was real.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009502&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1998216" alt="Putin told Merkel that the steps taken by his government were intended to defend Russia's interests. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/angelamerkelm.jpg" /> The territorial integrity of Ukraine is non-negotiable and this must be the basis for any efforts to resolve the crisis, says Merkel.  (AP)
<p>Accusing Russia of &#8220;exploiting a phase of uncertainty&#8221; in Ukraine, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that Moscow would risk &#8220;massive&#8221; political and economic damage if it refused to change course on Crimea.</p>
<p>Merkel&#8217;s comments came as tension mounted ahead of Sunday&#8217;s referendum in Ukraine&#8217;s autonomous Black Sea peninsula on whether to join the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>&#8220;An annexation of Crimea and a destabilisation of eastern Ukraine would not only change the relationship between the EU and Russia, but Russia would also be damaging itself massively in both economic and political terms,&#8221; Merkel said.</p>
<p>Merkel called upon Russia to show its willingness for a diplomatic solution by agreeing to create an international &#8220;contact group&#8221; or an observer mission.</p>
<p>The territorial integrity of Ukraine is non-negotiable and this must be the basis for any efforts to resolve the crisis, she said.</p>
<p>The chancellor referred to the decision taken by the EU leaders at their summit in Brussels last Thursday to impose a set of sanctions against Russia in three stages.</p>
<p>In the first phase, negotiations with Russia on easing visa restrictions and on a new agreement concerning the basis of EU-Russia cooperation were suspended.</p>
<p>If Russia refuses to cooperate in the efforts to resolve the conflict peacefully, the EU foreign ministers will decide next Monday to impose the second stage of the sanctions, Merkel said.</p>
<p>They will include travel ban into the EU for those responsible for the crisis in Ukraine, freezing of accounts and cancelling the next EU-Russia summit.</p>
<p>She also warned that if Russia continues to destabilise the situation in Ukraine and if there are &#8220;worrying developments&#8221; in the eastern region close to the Russian border, the third stage of the sanctions will come into force.</p>
<p>They will have far-reaching consequences for the economic cooperation between the EU and Russia, she said. However, Merkel rejected a military confrontation over<br />
Crimea</p>
<p>&#8220;This conflict cannot resolved using military means,&#8221; she said in a policy statement to the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament yesterday at the start of a debate on the crisis in Ukraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Military action is not an option,&#8221; she told the lawmakers.</p>
<p>The chancellor accused Russia of &#8220;exploiting a phase of uncertainty&#8221; in Ukraine. With its intervention in Crimea, Russia is openly questioning the territorial integrity of Ukraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The law of the jungle, the principle that might is right is taking precedence over the strength of the law, unilateral geopolitical interests are taking precedence over mutual understanding and cooperation,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009470&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>US officials helping in efforts to locate a <a title="China’s satellites spot possible debris from missing Malaysian plane" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/chinas-satellites-spot-possible-debris-from-missing-plane/" target="_blank">missing Malaysian plane</a> on Friday said they are shifting their search to the Indian Ocean region amid reports that the aircraft could have flown for several hours before it disappeared nearly a week ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my understanding that based on some new information that&#8217;s not necessarily conclusive &#8211; but new information &#8211; an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean,&#8221; White House spokesman Jay Carney said.&#8221; And we are consulting with international partners about the appropriate assets to deploy,&#8221; he said without specifying the nature of the new information.</p>
<p>The move to expand the search to the Indian Ocean came after the US&#8217; defence and aviation experts said that there was a significant probability of the plane to be at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>India, along with US Navy&#8217;s P-3C Orion maritime surveillance aircraft with long-range radar and communication capabilities, will search in the Andaman Sea west of the Malacca Strait. &#8220;The US P-3 will search west of the Strait of Malacca in the Andaman Sea,&#8221; Lt Col Jeffrey Pool, a Pentagon spokesman said.</p>
<p>USS Kidd is now transiting from the Strait of Malacca to the Indian Ocean, the US Navy said, referring to a guided- missile destroyer initially deployed to the Gulf of Thailand.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines Beijing-bound flight<a title="Vietnam scales down search for missing Malaysian jet" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/vietnam-scales-down-search-for-missing-malaysian-jet/" target="_blank"> MH370 </a>was carrying 227 passengers, including five Indians and one Indian-origin Canadian, and 12 crew members when it mysteriously vanished from radar screens an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur last week.</p>
<p>There has been no trace of the plane nor any sign of wreckage despite a search by the navies and military aircraft of more than a dozen countries across Southeast Asia. India yesterday deployed four warships to locate the jetliner.</p>
<p>A US official briefing on search said that the flight sent signals to a satellite for four hours after the aircraft went missing, Washington Post reported.</p>
<p>The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Boeing 777-200 wasn&#8217;t transmitting data to the satellite, but was instead sending out a signal to establish contact.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the two engines on the Boeing 777 functioned for up to four additional hours, that could strengthen concern that a rogue pilot or hijacker took control of the plane early Saturday over the Gulf of Thailand,&#8221; the paper said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal said communication satellites received intermittent data &#8220;pings&#8221; from the missing jet, giving the plane&#8217;s location, speed and altitude for at least five hours after it disappeared from radar screens.</p>
<p>The final satellite ping was sent from over water, at what one of these people called a &#8220;normal&#8221; cruising altitude. Noting that it is unclear why the transmissions stopped, the daily reported that one possibility could be that the system sending them had been disabled by someone on board.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009440&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2000239" alt="Kerry described relations with India as very vital for the region and the world. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kerry-lll.jpg" /> Kerry described relations with India as very vital for the region and the world. (AP)
<p>US Secretary of State John Kerry has refused to comment on the issue of granting visa to BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, saying his comments may have a &#8220;play&#8221; in the upcoming general elections in India.</p>
<p>Responding to a question on the visa issue from Congressman George Holding, Kerry said: &#8220;I am not going to comment on that part of it, if you do not mind, simply because it is before the election and I do not want anything I say here to have any play into the election in any way that it should or should not.&#8221;</p>
<p>During a Congressional hearing Holding said: &#8220;Within a month or so almost 800 million people are going to go to the polls and choose a new government in India. The Wall Street Journal recently said that the Congress Party will suffer more than likely an overwhelming defeat, and more than likely the BJP party will form a government with Narendra Modi at the head of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing to put us at a good place in our relations with India, with the BJP government? And how much do you think we will have as a setback the issue with Modi&#8217;s visa status and us denying a visa to him? And where do you see that we sit with that right now?&#8221; Holding had asked.</p>
<p>Kerry described relations with India as very vital for the region and the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;It (India-US) is a very important relationship. (India is) a very, very vital country in terms of the region and globally. And we need to&#8230; We have big issues to work on together,&#8221; Kerry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We respect that democracy, respect India. We have worked hard to get over the hiccup we had recently with respect to a diplomat in New York. Our Assistant Secretary (of State for South and Central Asia, Nisha Desai Biswal) has just returned from a trip to India,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very, very anxious. It is a very important relationship,&#8221; Kerry said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009474&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>An Indian-origin man in Singapore has been jailed for 12 weeks for brutally assaulting his wife suspecting her to be having an affair, a media report said on Friday.</p>
<p>Inderjit Singh Bhagh Singh, 36, had hit his wife twice with a motorcycle exhaust pipe which broke her collarbone and a finger.</p>
<p>On July 27, 2012, Singh returned home and beat his wife under the influence of alcohol. He suspected his wife of having an affair with another man, The Straits Times reported on Friday. Singh&#8217;s 26-year-old wife denied the allegations.</p>
<p>Singh was also fined SGD 2,000 on Thursday for abusive a police sergeant.</p>
<p>On January 2, Singh hurled abuses at Sergeant Benjamin Cheah Fook Yeong, who responded to a call of loud music from his apartment.</p>
<p>Reeking of alcohol, both Singh and his friend argued with the Sergeant.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009327&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>India has a critical role to play in Afghanistan as it is the most important partner of the war-torn country in the region, the commander of the US-Nato forces in Kabul has said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think India&#8217;s role in Afghanistan is critical. India is a very close partner to Afghanistan, and from an economic perspective and from a trade perspective, probably their most important partner in the region right now,&#8221;<a title="Can’t envision Afghan success without Pak cooperation: US" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/neighbours/cant-envision-afghan-success-without-pak-cooperation-us/"> General Joseph Dunford.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;They (India) are not providing lethal aid to Afghanistan, as a result of the dynamics in the region. Pakistan would certainly be concerned with that,&#8221; Dunford said in response to a question during a Congressional hearing on Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Dunford said India can play a very important role, diplomatically and economically in particular.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact they are doing that. They have a very close relationship with the Afghan people and even with the Afghan security forces,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have assisted in the sense of providing some nonlethal support, helicopters and parts, and some training that will help our efforts to grow Afghan security forces. So I think India is a very important partner in that regard,&#8221; Dunford said.</p>
<p>Dunford also said the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan is going to be important for the US to achieve American ends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last year I&#8217;ve been encouraged by a couple of things. At the political level, Prime Minister Sharif and President Karzai have met four times. That&#8217;s probably unprecedented over the last several years in terms of engagement at that level,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve also had an effective military-to-military relationship, between the Afghans and the Pakistanis that we&#8217;ve tried to facilitate. It&#8217;s been in fits and starts, frankly, in 2013 for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I met about six weeks ago with the chief of the Army staff in Pakistan, General Raheel Sharif. He&#8217;s committed to improving the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan,&#8221; he said. Dunford said he is encouraged by the conversation that&#8217;s focused on two particular areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;First and foremost, the ministers of interior have met to discuss the issue of extremism, and also the broader border management issues that start with the political, economic and the security issues,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t tell you that we&#8217;re weeks or months away from a true partnership between the two countries. But I think we have got to the point where they recognise that it&#8217;s in their common interest to deal with the threat of extremism and to improve the regime along the border,&#8221; the general said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009333&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kerry.jpg" /> Kerry spoke briefly with Russian Foreign minister Lavrov in advance of their meeting in London. (AP)
<p>Ahead of their key meeting in London, Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to express concern over the referendum in Crimea, warning there will be costs if Russia continues to take escalatory steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kerry spoke briefly with Lavrov this morning in advance of their meeting in London on Saturday. He provided an update on the constructive meetings Prime Minister Yatsenyuk had while he was in Washington,&#8221; a Senior State Department official said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, he reiterated the United States&#8217; concern about the upcoming referendum, and made clear there will be costs if Russia continues to take escalatory steps,&#8221; the official said on condition on anonymity, as the White House reiterating that it is for a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia has already incurred costs because of the actions Russia has already taken. Russia will incur additional costs because of the actions Russia has already taken. Should Russia continue down the path that it is currently on and move forward with an attempt to annex Crimea or to in other ways<br />
continue to violate Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty, there will no doubt be additional costs,&#8221; White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters at his daily news conference.</p>
<p>Carney&#8217;s comments came ahead of a last attempt by Kerry to head off a confrontation over Crimea, which holds a vote on Sunday on whether to break off from Ukraine and perhaps join Russia. Kerry will meet Lavrov in London to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Carney warned that further escalation would result in more problems for Russia and clearly for Ukraine, and that would not be good for the region or the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working very hard on an effort to make clear to the Russians that we understand they have concerns and interests in Ukraine, and making clear that there is a way for those concerns and interests to be addressed and protected through the utilisation of international monitors and through dialogue with the <a title="Russia open to ‘equal’ dialogue with West on Ukraine: Lavrov" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/russia-open-to-equal-dialogue-with-west-on-ukraine-lavrov/" target="_blank">Ukrainian government</a>,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009366&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Vanuatu National Disaster Management Office Director Shadrack Welegtabit said Friday that authorities are flying over the affected northern islands to assess the extent of the damage. He said Cyclone Lusi struck Monday and lasted through Wednesday, much longer than a typical cyclone.</p>
<p>He says there are reports of widespread crop damage as well as flooding and mudslides. He said two elderly people died in separate incidents after being struck by trees and an infant also died after being swept away by floodwaters.</p>
<p>New Zealand is now bracing for Lusi, which is expected to make landfall in the northern part of the country late Friday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009329&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(IE)
<p>US Secretary of State John Kerry has refused to comment on the issue of granting visa to BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, saying his comments may have a &#8220;play&#8221; in the upcoming general elections in India.</p>
<p>Responding to a question on the visa issue from Congressman George Holding, Kerry said, &#8220;I am not going to comment on that part of it, if you do not mind, simply because it is before the election and I do not want anything I say here to have any play into the election in any way that it should or should not&#8221;.</p>
<p>During a Congressional hearing Holding said: &#8220;Within a month or so almost 800 million people are going to go to the polls and choose a new government in India. The Wall Street Journal recently said that the Congress Party will suffer more than likely an overwhelming defeat, and more than likely the BJP party will form a government with Narendra Modi at the head of it&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing to put us at a good place in our relations with India, with the BJP government? And how much do you think we will have as a setback the issue with Modi&#8217;s visa status and us denying a visa to him? And where do you see that we sit with that right now?&#8221; Holding had asked.</p>
<p>Kerry described relations with India as very vital for the region and the world. &#8220;It (India-US) is a very important relationship. India is a very, very vital country in terms of the region and globally. And we need to&#8230; We have big issues to work on together&#8221;, Kerry said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We respect that democracy, respect India. We have worked hard to get over the hiccup we had recently with respect to a diplomat in New York. Our Assistant Secretary (of State for South and Central Asia, Nisha Desai Biswal) has just returned from a trip to India,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are very, very anxious. It is a very importantrelationship,&#8221; Kerry said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009328&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Steven Lee Myers &amp; Alison Smale </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Russia&#8217;s Defence Ministry announced new military operations in several regions near the Ukrainian border on Thursday, even as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany warned the Kremlin to abandon the politics of the 19th and 20th centuries or face diplomatic and economic retaliation from a united Europe.</span></p>
<p>In Moscow, the military acknowledged significant operations involving armoured and airborne troops in the Belgorod, Kursk and Rostov regions abutting eastern Ukraine, where many ethnic Russians have protested against the new interim government in Ukraine’s capital, Kiev, and appealed to Moscow for protection.</p>
<p>A day after a deputy minister denied any military buildup on the border, the Defence Ministry released a series of statements beginning early Thursday that appeared to contradict that. They outlined what was described as intensive training of units involving artillery batteries, assault helicopters and at least 10,000 soldiers.</p>
<p>The operations confirmed, at least in part, assertions by Ukrainian leaders on Wednesday that Russia was massing forces, as well as amateur photographs that appeared to show columns of armoured vehicles and trucks in a border village called Lopan, only 30 miles from the Ukrainian city Kharkiv. One statement announced that another 1,500 paratroopers from Ivanovo, east of Moscow, had parachuted onto a military base in Rostov, not far from the Ukrainian cities Donetsk and Lugansk.</p>
<p>With NATO announcing its own deployments of fighter jets and exercises to countries on Ukraine’s western border, the crisis appeared to worsening despite 11th-hour diplomatic efforts to halt a secession referendum scheduled for Sunday in Crimea. The ouster of the government of Viktor F Yanukovych and Russia’s subsequent intervention in Crimea has deeply divided Russia and the West, and in Berlin, Merkel underscored the potential risks of what is being called the worst crisis in relations since the end of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Appearing before Parliament on Thursday, Merkel criticized Russia’s actions in some of her toughest language to date, declaring that “the territorial integrity of Ukraine cannot be called into question.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009175&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia9.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008783 " alt="malaysia" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia9.jpg" /></a> Vietnamese Air Force Col. Pham Minh Tuan watches out from a window on board a flying aircraft during a mission to search for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in the Gulf of Thailand.
<p>Planes sent on Thursday to search the area where Chinese satellite images showed possible debris from the missing Malaysian jetliner found nothing, Malaysia&#8217;s civil aviation chief said, deflating the latest lead in the six-day hunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing. We went there, there is nothing,&#8221; Azharuddin Abdul Rahman told reporters in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Adding to the mystery, The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. investigators suspect the plane flew on for four hours once it lost contact with air traffic controllers, based on data from the plane&#8217;s engines that are automatically downloaded and transmitted to the ground as part of routine maintenance programs.</p>
<p>The report, based on two anonymous sources, raises questions as to why the Boeing 777 would have been flying without passive or active contact with the ground, and if anyone would have been in control during that time. U.S. counterterrorism officials are considering whether a pilot or someone else on board intentionally disabled the jetliner&#8217;s transponders to avoid detection and divert it, the report said.</p>
<p>The hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 has been punctuated by false leads since it disappeared with 239 people aboard about an hour after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday.</p>
<p>The plane was heading northeast over the Gulf of Thailand toward Vietnam when vanished. The last message from the cockpit of the missing flight was routine: &#8220;All right, good night,&#8221; was the sign-off transmitted to air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>Shortly after that it fell off commercial radar, but military authorities say it might have turned west and flown into the northern stretches of the Strait of Malacca based on unconfirmed traces seen on its air defense radar.</p>
<p>Dozens of ships and aircraft from 12 nations have been searching the Gulf of Thailand and the strait, but no trace has been found. The search area has grown to 35,800 square miles (92,600 square kilometers), or about the size of Portugal.</p>
<p>If the Wall Street Journal report is confirmed, the search area will have to significantly expand.</p>
<p>The Chinese satellite imagery showing possible debris was not far from where the last confirmed position of the plane was between Malaysia and Vietnam. The images and coordinates were posted on the website of China&#8217;s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s state Xinhua News Agency said the images from around 11 a.m on Sunday appear to show &#8220;three suspected floating objects&#8221; of varying sizes in a 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius, the largest about 24-by-22 meters (79-by-72 feet) off the southern tip of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Li Jiaxiang, chief of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said later China had yet to confirm any link between the suspected floating objects and the plane.</p>
<p>Pham Quy Tieu, Vietnam&#8217;s deputy transport minister, told The Associated Press that the area had been &#8220;searched thoroughly&#8221; by vessels and aircraft from other countries over the past few days.</p>
<p>Malaysia sent planes to the area again on Thursday morning, and said the search again was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities have come under fire for their handling of the search amid sometimes confusing and conflicting statements, including the time of the plane&#8217;s disappearance. Officials had also said that five passengers had checked into the flight but did not board the plane, and their luggage had been removed, but later they said this was not true.</p>
<p>Malaysia&#8217;s air force chief said Wednesday that an unidentified object appears on military radar records about 200 miles (320 kilometers) northwest of Penang, Malaysia, and experts are analysing the data to determine whether the blip is the missing plane.</p>
<p>Authorities have not ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage and terrorism, and they are waiting to find any wreckage or debris to determine what went wrong.</p>
<p>Two U.S. Federal Aviation Administration technical experts and a regional representative are in Kuala Lumpur as part of a National Transportation Safety Board team supporting the investigation. Experts in air traffic control and radar are providing technical help, the board said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008775&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/main3.jpg" /></a> A pedestrian adjusts his mask after the gas explosion in New York. (AP)
<p>A<a title="Gas explosion injures six in Thergaon" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/gas-explosion-injures-six-in-thergaon/" target="_blank"> gas leak</a> triggered an earthshaking explosion that flattened two apartment buildings, killing at least three people, injuring more than 60 and leaving nine missing. A tenant said residents had complained repeatedly in recent weeks about &#8220;unbearable&#8221; gas smells.</p>
<p>By Wednesday evening, rescue workers finally began the search for victims amid the broken bricks, splintered wood and mangled metal after firefighters spent most of the day dousing the flames. Heavy equipment, including back hoes and a bulldozer, arrived to clear the mountain of debris where the two five-story East Harlem buildings stood. Flood lights were in place. Thermal imaging cameras were at the ready to identify heat spots bodies or pockets of fire.</p>
<p>The recovery was facing hardship in the form of the weather, which was expected to drop below freezing with rain. Some parts of the debris pile were inaccessible because of a sinkhole caused by a subsurface water main break, officials said.</p>
<p>The fiery blast, on Park Avenue at 116th Street, not far from the edge of Central Park, erupted about 9:30 a.m.around 15 minutes after a neighboring resident reported smelling gas, authorities said. The Con Edison utility said it immediately sent workers to check out the report, but they didn&#8217;t arrive until it was too late.</p>
<p>The explosion shattered windows a block away, rained debris onto elevated commuter railroad tracks close by, cast a plume of smoke over the skyline and sent people running into the streets.</p>
<p>&#8220;It felt like an earthquake had rattled my whole building,&#8221; said Waldemar Infante, a porter who was working in a basement nearby. &#8220;There were glass shards everywhere on the ground, and all the stores had their windows blown out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emanuel Rivera, 24, lives on the corner of 116th and Park Avenue, across the street from the blast site. He was at home sleeping with his wife Rehanna and their two children when it happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you heard was boom. The whole building shook. We looked outside and there was a bunch of smoke. Everything was in flames,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Like several other neighbors, Rivera said they started smelling gas Tuesday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;The smell of gas was there since yesterday night,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hunter College identified one of the people killed in the blast as Griselde Camacho, a security officer who worked for the college since 2008.</p>
<p>Another of the people who died was Carmen Tanco, 67, a dental hygienist. The identity of the third victim wasn&#8217;t immediately disclosed.</p>
<p>At least three of the injured were children one, a 15-year-old boy, was reported in critical condition with burns, broken bones and internal injuries. Most of the other victims&#8217; injuries were minor and included cuts and scrapes.</p>
<p>Fire officials said some people were unaccounted for but cautioned they may not have been in the buildings.</p>
<p>A tenant in one of the destroyed buildings, Ruben Borrero, said residents had complained to the landlord about smelling gas as recently as Tuesday.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Borrero said, city fire officials were called about the odor, which he said was so bad that a tenant on the top floor broke open the door to the roof for ventilation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was unbearable,&#8221; said Borrero, who lived in a second-floor apartment with his mother and sister, who were away at the time of the explosion. &#8220;You walk in the front door and you want to turn around and walk directly out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fire department said a check of its records found no instances in the past month in which tenants of the two buildings reported gas odors or leaks.</p>
<p>Edward Foppiano, a Con Ed senior vice president, said the block was last checked on Feb. 28 as part of a regular leak survey, and no problems were detected.</p>
<p>City records show that the building Borrero lived in was owned by Kaoru Muramatsu. A phone number listed for Muramatsu rang unanswered.</p>
<p>Con Ed said it remains to be seen whether the leak was in a company main or in customer-installed inside plumbing. The gas main that serves the area was made of plastic and cast iron, and the iron dated to 1887, Foppiano said.</p>
<p>A National Transportation Safety Board team arrived in the evening to investigate. The agency investigates pipeline accidents in addition to transportation disasters.</p>
<p>NTSB team member Robert Sumwalt said investigators would be looking at how Con Edison handles reports of gas odors and issues with the pipe and would be constructing a timeline of events.</p>
<p>Just before the explosion, a resident from a building next to the two that were destroyed reported smelling gas inside his apartment and thought the odor might be coming from outside, Con Ed spokesman Bob McGee said. Con Ed dispatched two crews two minutes after the 9:15 a.m. call came in, McGee said. But they didn&#8217;t get there in time.</p>
<p>The tragedy brought the neighborhood to a standstill as police set up barricades to keep residents away. Thick, acrid smoke made people&#8217;s eyes water. Some people wore surgical masks, while others held their hands or scarves over their faces. Witnesses said the blast was so powerful it knocked groceries off store shelves.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008470&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mainobama.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008548" alt="President Barack Obama, right, and Ukraine Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, left, shake hands. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mainobama.jpg" /></a> President Barack Obama, right and Ukraine Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, left, shake hands, White House, Washington. (AP)
<p>US President Barack Obama has vehemently rejected the Russian bid for a &#8220;slapdash&#8221;<a title="Ukraine crisis: Crimea sets referendum on whether to join Russia" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-others/ukraine-crisis-crimea-sets-referendum-on-whether-to-join-russia/" target="_blank">referendum</a> in Ukraine&#8217;s Crimea region to merge it with Russia. &#8220;We completely reject a referendum patched together in a few weeks with Russian military personnel basically taking over Crimea. We reject its legitimacy. It is contrary to international law. It is contrary to the Ukrainian constitution,&#8221; Obama told reporters following his meeting with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that we&#8217;ve heard from the Russian Federation this notion that these kinds of decisions are often made in other places, and they&#8217;ve even analogised it to Scotland or other situations of that sort,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In each of those cases that they&#8217;ve cited, decisions were made by a national government through a long, lengthy, deliberative process. It&#8217;s not something that happens in a few days, and it&#8217;s not something that happens with an outside army essentially taking over the region,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue now is whether or not Russia is able to militarily dominate a region of somebody else&#8217;s country, engineer a slapdash referendum, and ignore not only the Ukrainian constitution but a Ukrainian government that includes parties that are historically in opposition with each other including the party of the previous president,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we will not recognise, certainly, any referendum that goes forward. My hope is that as a consequence of diplomatic efforts over the next several days that there will be a rethinking of the process that&#8217;s been put forward,&#8221; said the US president.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008503&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2008495" alt="China's Premier Li Keqiang laughs after a news conference following the closing ceremony of the Chinese National People's Congress at the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/china-li.jpg" /> China&#8217;s Premier Li Keqiang laughs after a news conference following the closing ceremony of the Chinese National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People, in Beijing, March 13, 2014. (REUTERS)
<p>Amid growing tensions with its neighbors over territorial disputes, Premier Li Keqiang today said China has an unshakable will to safeguard its sovereignty but at the same time would enhance common interests and narrow differences with neighboring countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;China has unwavering commitment to pursuing peaceful development and unshakable will in safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, both for the sake of upholding stability and creating a favorable environment for its development,&#8221; Li said addressing a press conference at the end of the annual parliamentary session ended.</p>
<p>&#8220;When neighbors interact with each other, it is only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of some kind or another,&#8221; Li said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as they respect each other, properly manage differences and pursue mutual benefits, there will be harmonious sound instead of jarring noises,&#8221; he said responding to a question on his visits to several neighboring countries after he took power last year.</p>
<p>Li visited India first to show the importance Chinese leadership attached to bilateral relations followed by Pakistan and other countries.</p>
<p>His visit was reciprocated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh making 2013 a rare year when premiers of both countries visited each other in the same year.</p>
<p>During his annual press meet today, Li recalled his visit to Vietnam while references to India were conspicuously absent in his response to the question on China&#8217;s relations with neighbors.</p>
<p>China at present is involved in maritime disputes with several of its neighbors in the South China Sea and with Japan over the disputed islands in the East China Sea, besides the long standing border dispute with India.</p>
<p>Li said peace and friendship and peaceful coexistence represent common aspirations of all people in China and its neighboring countries, he said.</p>
<p>As a developing country, China needs a favorable neighboring and international environment for its modernisation drive, he said.</p>
<p>As long as China and its neighbors together improve common interests and narrow differences, they will bring greater benefits to their people, Li said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008442&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 41-year-old Indian man in Australia today pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting women on trains after offering to read their palms.</p>
<p>Ajay Chopra pleaded guilty to assaulting three women and attempting to assault two others on V/Line trains as they<br />
travelled between Bendigo and Melbourne. Chopra, now prohibited from boarding trains between the<br />
two stations, had approached five women in the age group of 20 to 30 years between February and October 2011.</p>
<p>Previous court hearings were told he approached the women offering to read their palms, according to media reports. He applied to the court for a suppression order to prevent reporting on the issue, saying he was embarrassed.</p>
<p>Judge Gerard Mullaly, however, said there was not a &#8220;skerrick&#8221; of a reason to suppress reporting so long as<br />
Chopra&#8217;s victims were not identified. Chopra had his bail extended but has been asked to surrender his passport and not to leave Australia and report to police twice a week.</p>
<p>He will undergo a psychological assessment test before his plea hearing resumes in June.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008327&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>The US cannot envision success in Afghanistan without cooperation from Pakistan, a top American commander based in Kabul has told lawmakers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find it difficult to envision success in the region without cooperation of Pakistan and without an effective relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan,&#8221; Commander of US and <a title="NATO flying surveillance planes to Ukraine border" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/nato-flying-surveillance-planes-to-ukraine-border/">NATO </a>forces in Afghanistan told lawmakers during a Congressional hearing yesterday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past year I&#8217;ve been encouraged on a couple of fronts. One is I believe that Pakistan also recognises the existential threat of extremism to their own security, and they also recognise that it&#8217;s not in their best interest to have anything other than a stable, secure and unified Afghanistan,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dunford said, since August the heads of state have met four times, which is very positive.</p>
<p>&#8220;That hasn&#8217;t happened in quite some time. With (Pakistan) Prime Minister (Nawaz) Sharif has come new resolve to improve the relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two areas that they have identified for cooperation I think are important to point out. One is to have a common definition of extremism and to cooperate on dealing with extremism. And the other is to come up with a broader border management framework that would address the political issues, the economic issues as well as the security issues between the two countries,&#8221; Dunford said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our role is to work on developing a constructive military-to-military relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Referring to his meeting with the Pakistan army chief, Dunford said that he has indicated a strong resolve to improve the relationship between the Afghan security forces and the Pakistani army as have his Afghan counterparts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will spend a lot of time over the next several months doing that. One of the things we want to accomplish by the end of the year is to have a constructive bilateral relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heretofore over the last few years, it&#8217;s actually been trilateral. We&#8217;ve played a important facilitating role and we hope over time to work ourselves out of that role, certainly maintain effective bilateral relationships with both countries, between the US and Pakistan and US and Afghanistan, but play less of a role in the important relationship between those two countries,&#8221; Dunford said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008385&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysian.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008381" alt="The images and coordinates were posted on the website of China's State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. AP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysian.jpg" /></a> The images and coordinates were posted on the website of China&#8217;s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense. AP
<p>The area where Chinese satellite images show what might be debris from the missing Malaysian jetliner has been thoroughly searched in recent days, Vietnam said on Thursday as Malaysia urged caution over the findings.</p>
<p>The hunt for the Boeing 777 has been punctuated by false leads since it disappeared with 239 people aboard just hours after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday. The plane was heading east over the South China Sea when it disappeared, but authorities believe it may have turned back and headed into the upper reaches of the Strait and Malacca or beyond.</p>
<p>The Chinese sighting of possible debris is not far from where the last confirmed position of the plane was in between Malaysia and Vietnam. The images and coordinates were posted on the website of China&#8217;s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.</p>
<p>A Xinhua report said the images from around 11 a.m. on Sunday appear to show &#8221;three suspected floating objects&#8221; of varying sizes in a 20-kilometer radius, the largest about 24-by-22 meters (79-by-72 feet) off the southern tip of Vietnam.</p>
<p>Pham Quy Tieu, deputy transport minister, told The Associated Press that the area had been &#8221;searched thoroughly&#8221; by forces from other countries over the past few days. Doan Huu Gia, chief of air search and rescue coordination center, said Malaysian and Singaporean aircraft were scheduled to visit area again Thursday.</p>
<p>Malaysia&#8217;s civil aviation chief, Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said Malaysia had not been officially informed by China about the images, something he said was a &#8221;a breach of protocol&#8221;. He said if Beijing informs them of the coordinates, Malaysia would dispatch vessels and planes.</p>
<p>Until then, he urged caution, noting that the general area had been searched several times and the images were taken on Sunday. &#8221;There have been lots of reports of suspected debris,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A Malaysian military attache in Hanoi told Vietnamese search authorities on Thursday that two ships and two aircraft had been dispatched to the area.</p>
<p>Li Jiaxiang, chief of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said later China had yet to confirm any link between the floating objects and the plane.</p>
<p>Malaysia has come under some criticism for its handling of the search, which currently covers 35,800 square miles (92,600 square kilometers) and involves 12 nations, including the United States and Japan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008346&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/chinasatellites.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008383" alt=" China's Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday that the image show suspected debris from the missing aircraft. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/chinasatellites.jpg" /></a> China&#8217;s Xinhua News Agency reported Wednesday that the image show suspected debris from the missing aircraft. (AP)
<p>China today said it would not give up its efforts in searching for the<a title="IAF aircraft on standby for missing Malaysian Airlines search ops" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/iaf-aircraft-missing-malaysian-airline-search-ops/" target="_blank"> missing Malaysia Airlines plane </a>as long there is a &#8220;glimmer of hope&#8221; after its satellites spotted three floating pieces of possible debris in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>China will not give up its efforts in searching for the missing aircraft with 154 Chinese passengers aboard &#8220;as long as there is a glimmer of hope,&#8221; Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told the media at the end of the parliament session. &#8220;We will not give up any suspected clue that is being found,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are also looking very closely at all suspected clues showing on satellite images,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His comments came after a Chinese satellite found three floating objects at a suspected crash site of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane. He said that the Chinese government has asked all relevant parties in the ongoing massive international search to enhance coordination to investigate the cause and to locate the missing jetliner as soon as possible.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defence (SASTIND) said early today that the objects were monitored in the South China Sea at 6.7 degrees north latitude and 105.63 degrees east longitude,spreading across an area with a radius of 20 kms.</p>
<p>The satellite images, which were captured around 11 am on Sunday, showed the objects measuring 13 by 18 meters, 14 by 19 meters and 24 by 22 meters respectively.The images are being analysed, according to the SASTIND.</p>
<p>The plane has been missing for over five days since contact with it was lost early on Saturday. It was flying over the Ho Chi Minh air traffic control area in Vietnam and carrying 227 passengers, including 154 Chinese.</p>
<p>The international search for the missing plane, which has so far involved at least 40 ships and nearly 40 aircraft from 12 countries, entered its sixth day today, but the whereabouts of the Boeing 777-200 remain unknown.</p>
<p>China has employed 10 satellites to provide technological support in attempts to locate the aircraft, which was expected to land in Beijing at 6:30 am local time on Saturday.</p>

" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/os1.jpg" /></a> At his bail hearing last year, Pistorius justified shooting because of the extreme vulnerability he felt because of his disability.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Oscar Pistorius was on his stumps when he smashed down a locked toilet door to reach his shot girlfriend, a South African police forensic expert said on Wednesday, countering the Paralympic star’s assertion he was wearing his prosthetic legs at the time.</span></p>
<p>Wielding the cricket bat in his hands, police colonel Johannes Vermuelen knelt down before swinging it at the wooden door in a court reconstruction to show the angle of the marks and to suggest they could only have been made by someone much shorter than him.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old double amputee is charged with the murder of model and law graduate Reeva Steenkamp, whom he shot through the locked toilet door on Valentine’s Day last year.</p>
<p>Prosecutors want to prove that it was premeditated killing, but Pistorius says he was defending himself from what he thought was an intruder who had broken into his gated-community home in the capital of the crime-ridden country.</p>
<p>At his bail hearing last year, Pistorius justified shooting because of the extreme vulnerability he felt because of his disability. However, in his affidavit he stated that he had put on his prostheses before smashing down the door.</p>
<p>Vermuelen disagreed. “The marks on the door are actually consistent with him not having his legs on and I suspect they must be similar to the height that he was when he fired the shots,” he told the court.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008176&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007999" alt="The Malaysian flight MH370 that went missing over the South China Sea en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur had 227 passengers on board, including five Indians. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-m.jpg" /></a> The Malaysian flight MH370 that went missing over the South China Sea en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur had 227 passengers on board, including five Indians. (AP)
<p>Malaysian Air Force chief on Wednesday said a &#8220;blip&#8221; detected on the military radar may have been the missing flight MH370 in an area northwest of Penang in the Straits of Malacca, amid uncertainty over where to look for the plane that disappeared with 239 people on board.</p>
<p>Air Force Chief Rodzali Daud said the &#8216;plot&#8217; was detected at 2:15 a.m. on Saturday at 200 miles northwest of the island of Penang at the northern end of the Straits of Malacca.</p>
<p>However, it is not known if it was the missing plane as that sort of data is not recorded by the military radar.</p>
<p>This would be 45 minutes after the Boeing 777-200 lost contact with air traffic control about 100 miles from Kota Baru at 1.31 a.m. on Saturday. The flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing had taken off at 12.41 a.m. on Saturday.</p>
<p>The multi-national search operations were then extended to the Straits of Malacca from the original search site in the South China Sea. The search is still on in both areas, with 42 ships and 39 aircraft from 12 countries taking part.</p>
<p>Rodzali said it was not confirmed that the unidentified plane was the missing flight, but Malaysia was sharing the data with international civilian and military authorities.</p>
<p>According to the data provided by Rodzali, a position 200 miles northwest of Penang, in the northern part of the Strait of Malacca, would put the missing plane roughly south of Thailand&#8217;s tourist destination Phuket and east of the tip of Indonesia&#8217;s Aceh province and Andaman and Nicobar islands.</p>
<p>Thailand and Indonesia have said their militaries detected no sign of any unusual aircraft in their airspace.</p>
<p>Malaysia has asked India for help in tracing the aircraft and New Delhi&#8217;s coastguard planes have joined the search.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will never give up hope&#8221; of inning the plane, acting Transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said, adding that the search will continue till authorities find the aircraft.</p>
<p>The flight MH370 that went missing over the South China Sea en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur had 227 passengers on board, including five Indians and one Indian-origin Canadian, and 12 crew members.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007998&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The New York Police Department confirmed one dead in the building explosion, collapse in the East Harlem neighbourhood of New York City on Wednesday. At least 20 other people received minor injuries, officials said.</p>
<p>Police and firefighters are responding to reports of an explosion and partial collapse of the building around 9 AM at a building on Park Avenue between 114th and 117th streets, the Fire Department said.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2007985" alt="explosion-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/explosion-480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></p>
<p>So far, there are reports of 20 injuries. The site of the explosion is close to a major commuter rail line that connects New York&#8217;s suburbs to the city. Video footage from the scene of the explosion showed heavy smoke rising from the area as firefighters and police reached the spot to put the blaze out.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2007983" alt="explo-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/explo-480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></p>
<p>A man who was on the 15th floor of a building on 125th Street told CBS News he saw dark smoke billowing down several blocks. &#8220;The building shook and then we looked to see what was happening. We saw a whole lot of smoke. A lot of smoke came out,&#8221; witness Samuel Paul said. The city&#8217;s bomb squad is also responding to the situation as a precaution.</p>
<p>Many residents in the neighbourhood reported hearing a loud explosion. News helicopters showed that the roof of the building appeared to have completely collapsed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007817&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/scs-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007972" alt="China withdrew one of three ships engaged in a standoff with Philippines vessels in a disputed area of the South China Sea on April 13, 2012 as both sides pursued talks to defuse the dispute." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/scs-med.jpg" /></a> China withdrew one of three ships engaged in a standoff with Philippines vessels in a disputed area of the South China Sea on April 13, 2012 as both sides pursued talks to defuse the dispute. (Reuters)
<p>Concerned by reports that China has blocked two vessels of the Philippines in the South China Sea, the US on Wednesday described it as a provocative move that raised tensions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are troubled by reports that China&#8217;s Coast Guard blocked efforts by two Filipino vessels to re-supply the Philippines&#8217; outpost at Second Thomas Shoal. This is a provocative move that raises tensions,&#8221; State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pending resolution of competing claims in the South China Sea, there should be no interference with the efforts of claimants to maintain the status quo,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Philippines has maintained a presence at Second Thomas Shoal since 1999, as other claimants have maintained a presence elsewhere in the South China Sea, she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The regular resupply and rotation of personnel positioned in the South China Sea at locations that have existed since before the Declaration of Conduct in the South China Sea was issued by ASEAN and China in 2002 is consistent with maintenance of the status quo. Other claimants regularly resupply and repair their outposts without interference,&#8221; Psaki said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Freedom of navigation and overflight is a linchpin of security in the Pacific. Safe and unimpeded lawful commerce, freedom of navigation, stability, and respect for international law must be maintained,&#8221; said the spokesperson.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007964&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The special court conducting the high treason trial against Pervez Musharraf on Tuesday summoned top intelligence officials for an in-camera session to explain the recent security alert warning of a possible attack on the former Pakistani military dictator.</p>
<p>A three-member bench, headed by Justice Faisal Arab, is hearing the case relating to treason charges against the former president for imposition of emergency rule in 2007. During the hearing, Justice Arab said the court wanted to be apprised of the nature and seriousness of the threat against Musharraf.</p>
<p>&#8220;He (Justice Arab) took the intel alert warning attacks against Musharraf seriously. He wanted to be briefed about the issue and has asked for the head of intelligence agency responsible for the alert to come tomorrow,&#8221; a court source said.</p>
<p>Asked who is likely to appear before the court, he said, &#8220;Most likely the Interior Secretary would be accompanied by senior officials of the intelligence agency&#8221;. The hearing of the case was adjourned until Thursday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lawyer Rana Ijaz of the defence team representing Musharraf, 70, reached the court for the hearing but the security personnel prevented him from entering the court premises on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ijaz was barred from entering the court on a written order of Registrar Abdul Ghani Soomro in wake of his verbal attack on Justice Arab during the treason trial yesterday.</p>
<p>Justice Arab had asked security personnel to remove Ijaz from the courtroom after the lawyer said that he had received &#8220;life threats&#8221; and presumed that Justice Arab was behind them.</p>
<p>Talking to the media outside the court, Ijaz said that he had been told to apologise for his attitude and on his refusal to do so his entry into the court has been banned. He said he was Musharraf&#8217;s lawyer and he was being prevented from defending his client. Musharraf is slated to appear before the special court on Friday and would be indicted.</p>
<p>The former army chief did not appear in court on Tuesday following a security alert issued by the interior ministry saying that he might be targeted by al-Qaeda or the Pakistani Taliban.</p>
<p>The ministry told the court that the alert was a copy of information received from intelligence officials.</p>
<p>This is the first time in Pakistan&#8217;s history that a former military chief is on trial for treason.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007929&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>NATO says it has dispatched two surveillance planes to fly over Poland and Romania to monitor the crisis unfolding in neighbouring Ukraine.</p>
<div>
<p>The military alliance says two AWAC, or Airborne Warning And Control System, reconnaissance planes took off from its bases in Geilenkirchen, Germany, and Waddington, Britain, on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>A spokesman for NATO&#8217;s operational headquarters Mons, Belgium, said the flights will not leave the air space of its member nations thus not crossing either into Ukrainian or Russian airspace.</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;The planes can observe over 300,000 square kilometres (115,000 square miles) and will primarily be looking on air activity and the sea,&#8221; Lt. Col. Jay Janzen said, adding that one AWACS aircraft already went on a surveillance mission to Romania on Tuesday and that more missions were being planned. &#8220;Our flights will not leave NATO airspace,&#8221; Janzen said. &#8220;Regardless, we can observe, we can look a very long way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Janzen said that one AWAC aircraft already went on a surveillance mission to Romania on Tuesday and that more missions were being planned. NATO&#8217;s 28 member states decided Monday to intensify the assessment of the possible threat the Ukrainian crisis poses to the alliance by sending AWACS planes. The decision comes after deployments of U.S. fighter planes to eastern European nations bordering Russia, such as Poland and Lithuania.</p>
<p>&#8220;The planes can observe over 300,000 square kilometers (115,000 square miles) and will primarily be looking on air activity and the sea,&#8221; Lt. Col. Jay Janzen said, adding that one AWACS aircraft already went on a surveillance mission to Romania on Tuesday and that more missions were being planned. &#8220;Our flights will not leave NATO airspace,&#8221; Janzen said. &#8220;Regardless, we can observe, we can look a very long way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Janzen said the flights had already been planned as training missions before NATO&#8217;s decision, but more planes will be added to the exercises in the coming days. The plane flying out of the German base to Romania was an E-3A AWACS and the plane leaving Britain for Poland was an E-3B AWACS, Janzen said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007608&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two Indian-American students today made it to the top 10 of the prestigious Intel Science Talent Search awards, bagging a prize of USD 20,000 each. Anand Srinivasan of Georgia bagged the eighth position while Shaun Datta from Maryland took the last 10th spot in the awards.</p>
<p>Eric S Chen, 17, of San Diego won the top award of USD 100,000 from the Intel Foundation for his research of potential new drugs to treat influenza.<br />
His interdisciplinary approach combined computer modelling with structural studies and biological validation, while focusing on drugs that inhibit endonuclease, an enzyme essential for viral propagation.</p>
<p>Eric, the co-president of his school&#8217;s fencing team and a junior Olympics qualifier, hopes his work will lead to a new class of drugs to control flu outbreaks during a pandemic, allowing time f or a vaccine to be developed.</p>
<p>Second-place honours and USD 75,000 went to Kevin Lee, 17, of California, who developed a mathematical model to describe the shape of the heart as it beats using the principles of fluid mechanics.</p>
<p>Kevin&#8217;s faster and computationally efficient model could provide insights into arrhythmia and may lead to better treatments for the disease.<br />
Third-place honours and USD 50,000 went to William Henry Kuszmaul, 17, of Massachusetts, who developed a new approach to the mathematics of modular enumeration, which has applications to a wide number of problems in computer science, bioinformatics and computational biology.</p>
<p>Srinivasan received a USD 20,000 award for his neural- network-based computer model, RNNScan, which &#8220;learns&#8221; patterns in DNA to predict the boundaries of certain genomic regions.<br />
Datta also received a USD 20,000 award for his research that used computer models and equations to improve the understanding of the interactions of nuclear matter.<br />
&#8220;We at Intel celebrate the work of these brilliant young scientists as a way to inspire the next generation to follow them with even greater energy and excitement into a life of  invention and discovery,&#8221; Wendy Hawkins, executive director of the Intel Foundation, said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine the new technologies, solutions and devices they will bring to bear on the challenges we face. The Intel Science Talent Search finalists should inspire all of us with hope for the future,&#8221; Hawkins said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007610&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/internet-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007543" alt="'NSA and GCHQ turned internet into a weapon in the service of special interests, in the process flouting freedom of information and the right to privacy'. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/internet-m.jpg" /></a> &#8216;NSA and GCHQ turned internet into a weapon in the service of special interests, in the process flouting freedom of information and the right to privacy&#8217;. (Reuters)
<p>US&#8217; National Security Agency, India&#8217;s Centre for Development of Telematics, and the UK&#8217;s GCHQ have been named among the worst online spies by a non-profit group for implementing censorship and surveillance.</p>
<p>Three of the government bodies designated by Reporters Without Borders as &#8216;Enemies of the Internet&#8217; are located in democracies that have traditionally claimed to respect fundamental freedoms, a report by the Reporters Without Borders said.</p>
<p>Besides these, the report names several government bodies from other countries. These include Pakistan&#8217;s Telecommunication Authority, North Korea&#8217;s Central Scientific and Technological Information Agency, Vietnam&#8217;s Ministry of Information and Communications and China&#8217;s State Internet Information Office.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NSA in the United States, Government Communications Headquarters in the United Kingdom and the Centre for Development of Telematics in India are no better than their Chinese, Russian, Iranian or Bahraini counterparts,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The NSA and GCHQ have spied on the communications of millions of citizens including many journalists. They have knowingly introduced security flaws into devices and software used to transmit requests on the Internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they have hacked into the very heart of the Internet using programmes such as the NSA&#8217;s Quantam Insert and GCHQ&#8217;s Tempora. The Internet was a collective resource that the NSA and GCHQ turned into a weapon in the service of special interests, in the process flouting freedom of information, freedom of expression and the right to privacy,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s &#8220;Enemies of the Internet&#8221; report, which Reporters Without Borders publishes every year on World Day against Cyber-Censorship, spotlights the government units and agencies that implement online censorship and surveillance.</p>
<p>In its report, it asserted that the Indian government carefully refrained from joining the wave of condemnation that followed Edward Snowden&#8217;s revelations of the scandalous scale of NSA surveillance. &#8220;India had reason for silence,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The extensive Indian surveillance system has been expanded since the Mumbai attacks in 2008. The Central Monitoring System, developed by the Centre for Development of Telematics, allows the government direct, unlimited and real-time access to a wide variety of electronic communications without relying on internet service providers,&#8221; Reporters Without Borders said.</p>
<p>The existing Indian laws, it said, give the authorities a free hand to mount major surveillance operations against users of the web and other telecommunication technology.</p>
<p>While one section of the Indian law authorises heavy financial penalties against any individual who refuses to provide any document, return or report to the government; it also authorises the interception of any information transmitted by computer.</p>
<p>Likewise, any person who refuses to decrypt his private information upon official request faces up to seven years in prison, it said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007541&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jj3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007521" alt="jj3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jj3.jpg" /></a> Jasmine Joseph, was found dead in her car, she committed suicide by inhaling noxious fumes of some sort.  (Photo courtesy: Facebook)
<p>A 22-year-old New York-based Indian-origin student, who was missing since February, has been found dead in her car after allegedly committing suicide.</p>
<p>Jasmine Joseph&#8217;s body was found here on Tuesday in her car parked at a Syosset shopping center parking lot, less than a kilometer from her home.</p>
<p>She was last seen leaving her home in Syosset area on February 24 in her car to go to the New York Institute of Technology&#8217;s campus.</p>
<p>She had called her parents in the evening to say she was at the college library and had not been seen or heard from since.</p>
<p>Joseph committed suicide by inhaling noxious fumes of some sort, police told CBS News.</p>
<p>While Joseph had told her parents that she was studying at NYIT, the institute had issued a statement saying she had not been enrolled at the school since May 2013.</p>
<p>The Nassau County Police Department confirmed that Joseph was not enrolled at NYIT for the current semester and that her parents were not aware of that fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was somewhat deceptive about her personal life, which made the investigation more complicated,&#8221; Nassau Police Inspector Kenneth Lack was quoted as saying by NBC News.</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s family members said the car was found in a spot where police had previously searched.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can we miss the car? It&#8217;s a mystery kind of thing now,&#8221; Joseph&#8217;s uncle James said.</p>
<p>Police did not comment on any other issues in Joseph&#8217;s personal life and did not speculate about why she apparently took her own life.</p>
<p>Joseph&#8217;s family had set up a Facebook page to locate her and had distributed fliers throughout the city asking the public&#8217;s assistance in finding her.</p>
<p>Her parents had also offered a USD 5,000 reward for her safe return. Joseph&#8217;s family and friends expressed shock and grief over her death. &#8220;Honestly, we&#8217;re still in disbelief. It still hasn&#8217;t really hit us,&#8221; said friend Simi Jawandha.She said Joseph was &#8220;an absolutely incredible human being, both inside and out, and she absolutely loved her friends and family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidentally, there have been three cases of Indian-American students mysteriously disappearing in the last few weeks, with their parents originally from Kerala.</p>
<p>Apart form Joseph, Southern Illinois University student from Morton Grove, Pravin Varughese, who had gone missing in Illinois, was found dead last month in a wooded area in Carbondale. He had disappeared after getting into a dispute with an acquaintance who was giving him a ride.</p>
<p>Reny Jose, 21, a mechanical engineering major and a member of Martel College at Rice University, is still missing after he mysteriously disappeared while vacationing with friends in the US state of Florida.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007474&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/carcas.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007525" alt="The weeks of violence have left more than 300 people injured in Carcas. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/carcas.jpg" /></a> The weeks of violence have left more than 300 people injured in Caracas. (AP)
<p>Students and opponents of the Venezuelan government have called a new rally on Wednesday to mark a month of protests in Caracas, as the death toll from demo-related violence reached 21.</p>
<p>Students throwing rocks and homemade firebombs clashed late on Tuesday with police who tried to disperse them with tear gas and water cannon. No injuries were immediately reported.</p>
<p>The anti-government demonstrations have been fuelled by rising discontent over deteriorating living conditions and police crackdowns in the oil-rich OPEC nation.</p>
<p>President Nicolas Maduro&#8217;s socialist government has outraged many, particularly with shortages of basic goods like toilet paper and food, and amid spiralling violent crime and corruption.</p>
<p>Maduro vowed he would bar the protesters from entering the centre of the capital on wednesday, saying they are looking for trouble in an unauthorised rally.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not going to let them in,&#8221; he said in a radio program. &#8220;I know they are coming with plans for violence.&#8221; The planned march could cross paths with a pro-government procession called by the education minister.</p>
<p>Political scientist John Magdaleno said anti-government protests would carry on but might start losing steam because they have yielded little.</p>
<p>Maduro, the handpicked leftist successor of the late populist firebrand Hugo Chavez, has denounced the protests as a coup in the making, encouraged by the opposition with the backing of the Unite States.</p>
<p>The death toll climbed to 21 after a student was fatally shot in the city of San Cristobal, authorities said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The weeks of violence have left more than 300 people injured. Daniel Tinoco, 24, was killed Monday night in the western city where nationwide protests against the leftist government of Maduro first ignited February 4.</p>
<p>In Caracas they got under way February 12 and three people were killed in a big rally. Tinoco died from a gunshot wound to the chest, opposition Mayor Daniel Ceballos told AFP.</p>
<p>Since protests began, opposition leaders and government officials have blamed each other for the deadly violence.</p>
<p>The protests have spread to cities such as Caracas, Merida, Valencia and Maracay.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007502&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Picture for representative purposes only)
<p>An Indian-American doctor in the US has pleaded guilty to taking kickbacks for diagnostic testing referrals of his patients and failing to file tax returns on USD 1 million of income over a three-year period.</p>
<p>Dr Yash Khanna, 72, of Livingston in New Jersey, admitted to earning income of more than USD 381,000 in 2008, USD 400,000 in 2009 and USD 214,000 in 2010. He intentionally failed to file tax returns or ask for extensions during those years, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>He faces a maximum potential penalty of several years in prison and a maximum USD 250,000 fine, or twice the gain or loss caused by the offense.</p>
<p>From 2009 through to 2011 Khanna owned and operated his own medical practice, Family Medicine and Pediatrics LLC, according to court documents.</p>
<p>He agreed with representatives of a diagnostic testing facility called Orange Community MRI LLC (Orange MRI) that he would be paid cash in exchange for patients he referred for testing.</p>
<p>He received cash kickbacks from Orange MRI for diagnostic tests performed on Medicare and Medicaid patients and met with an Orange MRI representative at his office on October 4, 2011, and November 10, 2011, taking envelopes with cash, according to the documents.</p>
<p>Khanna acknowledged taking kickbacks from Orange MRI on other occasions as well, federal prosecutors said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007262&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/guo.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007197" alt="Guo Shaochun" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/guo.jpg" /></a> Guo Shaochun, center, head of a joint working group in charge of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane speaks to journalists. (AP)
<p>Authorities on Wednesday said a missing Malaysian plane with 239 people aboard may have changed course before losing contact, as multinational search operations were widened to hundreds of kilometers from the original radius to cover the Andaman Sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;The RMAF does not rule out the possibility that the aircraft made turn-back before it disappeared from the radar and this is why the search and rescue operation had been widened to a larger area to include waters off Penang,&#8221; Malaysia&#8217;s Air Force (RMAF) chief General Rodzali Daud said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This resulted in the search and rescue operations being widened to the vicinity of the waters (off the west coast of Malaysia),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Beijing-bound Boeing 777-200 plane had 227 passengers on board, including five Indians and one Indian-origin Canadian, and 12 crew members.</p>
<p>Rodzali denied a report that claimed he had confirmed that the missing Beijing-bound Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 had been last detected near Pulau Perak in the Straits of Malacca far from its flight path.</p>
<p>He said the report in the Malay-language daily Berita Harian yesterday was &#8220;incorrect&#8221;.</p>
<p>The paper reported that Rodzali had confirmed the Butterworth base had received a signal that the missing plane made a turn back Saturday towards Kota Bharu in Kelantan state before it entered the airspace above the northern and east coast of Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>That location would have indicated that the plane had banked far to the west of its intended flight path over the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Search and rescue operations which had been mobilised since early Saturday morning have failed to find the jetliner in the South China Sea and authorities have expanded the area of search into the Andaman sea, officials said.</p>
<p>Authorities have put the plane&#8217;s last known point of contact with air-traffic control off eastern Malaysia -roughly midway between  Kota Bharu and the southern tip of Vietnam, flying at 35,000 feet.</p>
<p>The search for the missing plane entered the fifth day, as 34 planes, 40 ships and teams from ten countries are scouring the waters on the plane&#8217;s flight path and beyond to find it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vietnam has said it is scaling back search operations in its waters. &#8220;We&#8217;ve decided to temporarily suspend some search and rescue activities, pending information from Malaysia,&#8221; deputy minister of transport Pham Quy Tieu said, adding that boats were still searching the area.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007186&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Vietnam said on Wednesday it was scaling back the search in Vietnamese waters for a Malaysian Airlines jetliner missing for four days, a senior Vietnamese official said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We still have plans to search with a few flights today, while other activities are suspended,&#8221; Deputy Transport Minister Pham Quy Tieu, who heads the Vietnam search, told reporters. Tieu said searches by ships were being suspended.</p>
<p>He said Vietnam had asked Malaysian authorities for information about reports that the plane, carrying 239 passengers and crew, had changed direction after its last known contact on Saturday but it had yet to receive any response.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, the head of Malaysia&#8217;s air force denied making comments that the Malaysian military had last tracked the plane far to the west of its course over the Strait of Malacca.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007131&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Aviation authorities in Kuala Lumpur have asked India to help locate the <a title="China deploys 10 satellites to help in search for Malaysia Airlines" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/china-deploys-10-satellites-to-help-in-search-for-malaysia-airlines/" target="_blank">missing Malaysian airliner</a> that is now believed to have strayed towards the Malacca Strait, and a <a title="military search mission" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/kolkata-family-awaits-call-from-son-on-board-missing-plane/" target="_blank">military search mission</a> is expected to be launched as early as Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Indian maritime search aircraft are likely to be deployed to join the search after a request was received by the Chennai air traffic control authorities from their counterparts in Kuala Lumpur, sources said.</p>
<p>The request came after the latest findings by the Malaysian air force suggested <a title="4 days on, a Kolkata family prays, awaits call from son on board missing MH370" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/4-days-on-a-kolkata-family-prays-awaits-call-from-son-on-board-missing-mh370/" target="_blank">flight MH370</a>, a Boeing 777 plane, may have strayed off course during its journey from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and headed in the opposite direction to the Malacca Strait.</p>
<p>Reports quoting the Malaysian air chief said the last located position of the plane is now suspected to be in the western part of the busy strait that sees heavy shipping traffic. This location is close to the Andaman Sea that is dominated by the Indian Navy.</p>
<p>Sources said the Navy, that has assets near the location including several radars, ships and aircraft, has not been officially asked to take part in the search yet.</p>
<p>However, the Navy and IAF are expected to extend full cooperation from Wednesday morning to search for the missing plane whose passengers include five Indian nationals.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006990&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/int1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006983" alt="Military personnel look out of a Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) C130 transport plane as they search for the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane over the South China Sea Tuesday. (REUTERS)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/int1.jpg" /></a> Military personnel look out of a Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) C130 transport plane as they search for the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 plane over the South China Sea Tuesday. (REUTERS)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Malaysian military has radar data showing the missing Boeing 777 jetliner had changed course and made it to the Malacca Strait, hundreds of kilometers from the last position recorded by civilian authorities, according to a senior military official.</span></p>
<p>The development injects more mystery into the probe of the disappearance of the flight, and raises questions about why the aircraft was not transmitting signals detectable by civilian radar.</p>
<p>Local newspaper Berita Harian quoted Malaysian air force chief Gen Rodzali Daud as saying radar at a military base had detected the airliner at 2:40 am near Pulau Perak at the northern approach to the strait, a busy waterway that separates the western coast of Malaysia and Indonesia’s Sumatra island. “After that, the signal from the plane was lost,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>A high-ranking military official involved in the investigation confirmed the report and also said the plane was believed to be flying low.</p>
<p>Authorities had earlier said the plane, which took off at 12:20 am and was headed to Beijing, may have attempted to turn back to Kuala Lumpur, but they expressed surprise that it would do so without informing ground control.</p>
<p>The search for the plane was initially focused on waters between the eastern coast of Malaysia and Vietnam, the position where aviation authorities last tracked it. No trace of the plane has been found by than 40 planes and ships from at least 10 nations searching the area.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Malaysian police Tuesday said one of the two passengers known to have used stolen passports to board the missing Malaysian airliner was a 19-year-old Iranian who wanted to migrate to Germany and appeared to have no connection to terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>The passenger, Pouria Nourmohammadi Mehrdad, using a passport that had been stolen from an Austrian man, was traveling to Germany, where he was to meet his mother, said Khalid Abu Bakar, the inspector general of the Malaysian police. “We are in contact with his mother,” Khalid said at a news meet.</p>
<p>Khalid said the authorities had not yet identified the second passenger on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 who had been traveling on a stolen passport, but he said the person had arrived in Malaysia on the same day, Feb. 28.</p>
<p>Khalid said the police were still investigating the possibilities of hijacking, sabotage and possible psychological or personal problems among the crew and passengers. Other agencies in Malaysia continue to investigate non-criminal explanations for the aircraft’s disappearance.</p>
<p>Speaking at Interpol’s headquarters, chief Ronald K Noble said the evidence emerging about the two Iranians suggested that they were not likely to be linked to any terror groups. “..We are inclined to conclude it is not a terrorist incident,” Noble said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006980&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Iran offered its assistance on Tuesday with a Malaysian investigation, two of its nationals believed to have been travelling on stolen passports on an airliner missing for days.</p>
<p>Foreign ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said &#8220;Iran was following up on reports regarding the possibility of two Iranian passengers aboard the plane. We are offering our cooperation to obtain more information,&#8221; she said, pledging that Tehran would provide any information on the Iranians and their status as soon as it is available.</p>
<p>Malaysian police said today that one of two suspect passengers aboard the missing jet was an Iranian illegal immigrant, as hopes for the 239 passengers and crew ebbed away.</p>
<p>Fears of terrorism were stoked by the weekend revelation that two men boarded the flight using stolen European passports. But police said people-smuggling was emerging as the likeliest explanation for the identity fraud. One of the pair has been identified as 19-year-old Iranian Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, Malaysia&#8217;s national police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terror group and we believe he was trying to migrate to Germany,&#8221; Abu Bakar said, adding that authorities had not yet identified the other man.</p>
<p>Authorities have doubled the search radius to 100 nautical miles around the point where Malaysia Airlines MH370 disappeared from radar over the South China Sea early on Saturday, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
<p>With the aviation industry and authorities baffled over the plane&#8217;s fate, investigators say they are ruling nothing out over how a huge Boeing 777-200 jet could have completely vanished.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006737&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Malaysian Airlines says it is investigating an Australia television report that the co-pilot on its missing flight had invited two women to stay in the cockpit for a flight two years ago. Jonti Roos described the encounter on the program &#8220;A Current Affair&#8221;. It aired multiple still photographs from Roos that showed the women inside the cockpit and the pilots apparently working the plane&#8217;s controls.</p>

<p>The airline said late on Tuesday it wouldn&#8217;t comment about the report until its investigation into it is complete. Roos said Fariq Abdul Hamid and the second pilot talked to her and her friend in the cockpit during the entire flight in December 2011 from Phuket, Thailand, to Kuala Lumpur. Roos didn&#8217;t immediately reply to a message sent to her via Facebook.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006744&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chinese high-resolution satellites have found three oil slicks which scientists believe might be linked to the missing Malaysian plane, providing a new direction to the multinational search operations which have failed to spot the wreckage.</p>
<p>The Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that its findings are based on comparison of remote-sensing satellite images of the oil patterns on the ocean surface in the targeted area before and after the plane went missing.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether the oil slicks are the same as those found earlier by search and rescue forces, the institute said.</p>
<p>The institute is cooperating with various departments, including the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Centre, to determine the hypothetical location of oil from the plane by analysing factors such as the speed of local currents and timeline for the missing plane in order to confirm whether the oil slicks are related to the plane, an international news agency reported.</p>
<p>China on Monday pressed ten high-resolution satellites to look for the missing plane.</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities who tested the sample of an earlier oil slick near Vietnam said it did not belong to the aircraft.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Malaysian airline spokesman here said there is still no trace of the aircraft 88 hours after its disappearance.</p>
<p>Rescue efforts are ongoing, covering eastern and western parts of peninsular Malaysia, but there is &#8220;no finding of the aircraft,&#8221; an airline spokesman told the media in Beijing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A total of 42 vessels and 35 aircraft from various countries have joined the rescue mission. China, which is under pressure as majority of the passengers are its citizens, has stepped up its efforts by sending nine ships and besides number of aircraft for the search operations, Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang told media here.</p>
<p>It also sent a joint working team to Kuala Lumpur to coordinate the search operations with the Malaysian officials.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006733&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malay-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006735" alt="Over a dozen microphones are propped on a table as Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar answers questions from members of the media.

(AP)
<p>Investigators trying to solve the disappearance without trace of the Malaysia Airlines jetliner face an extremely rare challenge that could hinder their efforts: they lack the powers of a formal air safety investigation. Four days after Flight MH370 went missing in mid-air with 239 people on board, no nation has stepped forward to initiate and lead an official probe, leaving a formal leadership vacuum that industry experts say appears unprecedented.</p>
<p>Malaysian officials are conducting their own informal investigations, in cooperation with other governments and foreign agencies, but they lack the legal powers that would come with a formal international probe under U.N.-sanctioned rules. Those powers include the legal rights to take testimony from all witnesses and other parties, the right to have exclusive control over the release of information and the ability to centralise a vast amount of fragmentary evidence.</p>
<p>A senior official familiar with the preliminary Malaysian probe said Malaysian authorities could not yet convene a formal investigation due to a lack of evidence on where &#8211; namely, in which national jurisdiction &#8211; the Boeing 777-200ER jet crashed. He said this was not hampering their work, that preliminary investigations had begun and that they were working with their neighbours, U.S. officials and the jet&#8217;s maker, Boeing.</p>
<p>The Malaysians have begun collecting information from neighbouring countries without any problems, including air-traffic control communications and radar data, he said. &#8220;There have been no issues in getting that information.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Southeast Asian waters are rife with territorial disputes, and any decision by Malaysia to unilaterally open a formal investigation under U.N. rules could be seen as a subtle assertion of sovereignty if the crash site turns out to be inside another country&#8217;s territory.</p>
<p>Without a formal investigative process being convened quickly under rules set out by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a U.N. agency, there is a risk that crucial early detective work could be hampered, and potential clues and records lost, air accident experts said.</p>
<p>Witnesses such as cargo handlers, mechanics and company officials might be reluctant to speak to Malaysian investigators who were operating outside a formal ICAO-sanctioned probe which could offer them some protection from law suits, experts said. &#8220;The sole objective of an accident investigation is to prevent future accidents and not to apportion blame or liability,&#8221; said aviation lawyer Simon Phippard of international legal firm Bird &amp; Bird. &#8220;The international standards attempt to provide a degree of protection, for example from criminal prosecution, for individuals who give statements to the enquiry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lack of a formal investigation also means Malaysia does not have exclusive control over the release of information or the ability to centralize fragmentary evidence such as wreckage parts and witness accounts, effectively relying for cooperation on other parties&#8217; good-will, the experts said.</p>
<p>Under a formal investigation, a board is set up to designate parties to the investigation, including the plane maker, engine maker, unions, the airline and aviation safety regulatory agency of the country where the airline is based. Each of these parties typically has a representative on each of the working groups. &#8220;If they haven&#8217;t even decided what country is in charge of the investigation, then whatever is being done at this point is probably suffering from a severe lack of top-down control and coordination,&#8221; said Ted Ellett, an aviation lawyer at Hogan Lovells in Washington and a former Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) chief counsel.</p>
<p>U.S. investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), FAA and Boeing arrived in Kuala Lumpur on Monday and, according to the official familiar with the Malaysian probe, have been talking with the Malaysian investigators. An NTSB-led team, including the FAA and Boeing officials, is &#8220;standing by for when the aircraft is located and they are in touch with Malaysian officials and have offered our assistance and support for anything they may need,&#8221; NTSB spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. Boeing and FAA declined to comment.</p>
<p><strong>LACKING FORMAL POWERS</strong><br />
A lack of clarity over the investigation already appears to be a source of tension between Malaysia and China, which had up to 154 citizens on the Beijing-bound flight and is pushing for a significant role in the investigation. China&#8217;s Foreign Ministry urged Malaysia on Monday to step up its search efforts and start an investigation &#8220;as soon as possible and correctly&#8221;.</p>
<p>The deputy head of China&#8217;s civil aviation authority urged Malaysia to help a team of investigators it has said is ready to fly to the Southeast Asian nation to help with the probe. Governments usually step forward quickly after an accident to claim leadership of the investigation, based primarily on the territory where the plane crashed.</p>
<p>That crucial information remains unknown in this case, as navies, military aircraft, coastguard and civilian ships from 10 nations scour a huge swathe of the sea from the South China Sea to the Strait of Malacca off Malaysia&#8217;s western coast. The official familiar with the preliminary Malaysian investigation said the Malaysian government could not launch a formal probe until the crash site had been found, and that it planned to work closely with U.S. authorities and Australia.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we wait, we will lose precious time. We know that. That is why our guys have been gathering all of the records and data,&#8221; the official said. Under U.N. rules, if a plane crashes in international waters, the country where the aircraft is registered &#8211; in this case, Malaysia &#8211; is in charge of the investigation. So, for example, Air France quickly took control of the official investigation when its passenger jet crashed in waters far out into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, even though no wreckage had yet been found.</p>
<p><strong>LEGAL PROTECTION</strong><br />
Vietnam would have jurisdiction if the plane crashed in its territory, but it does not have the resources to lead an investigation and would likely have to get outside help, two regional aviation officials said. Under rules governed by ICAO, setting up an investigation grants &#8220;unhampered access&#8221; to all relevant materials including wreckage and data and &#8220;unrestricted control&#8221; over the evidence and public communications.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parties don&#8217;t relish the idea of their officials or employees being queried or formally interviewed in these accident investigations,&#8221; Ellett said. &#8220;If there&#8217;s any question about who has the authority to do it, the parties involved could say we&#8217;re not going to participate until we know who&#8217;s really in charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>With lawsuits potentially swirling, the investigation is meant to encourage witnesses to speak freely about the incident in the interests of airline safety. Investigators will typically &#8220;freeze&#8221; documents and records, especially the maintenance records of the aircraft, and acquire radar images and air traffic control recordings. Groups specialising in operations, maintenance and sometimes human factors are set up to sift through each scrap of evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t remember anything like this. Usually it is pretty clear who is responsible for the investigation and they get to work straight away,&#8221; said one European air safety official, who asked not to be identified. &#8220;It is very important to get all the factual information as soon as possible.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006731&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Malaysia&#8217;s military believes the jetliner missing for almost four days turned and flew hundreds of kilometres to the west after it last made contact with civilian air traffic control off the country&#8217;s east coast, a senior officer told Reuters on Tuesday. In one of the most baffling mysteries in recent aviation history, a massive search operation for the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER has so far found no trace of the aircraft or the 239 passengers and crew.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysian-plane-malaysia-plane-crash-legal-trouble/" target="_blank">Lack of legal power hampers probe into missing Malaysian Airlines jet</a></p>
<p>Malaysian authorities have previously said flight MH370 disappeared about an hour after it took off from Kuala Lumpur for the Chinese capital Beijing. &#8220;It changed course after Kota Bharu and took a lower altitude. It made it into the Malacca Strait,&#8221; the senior military officer, who has been briefed on investigations, told Reuters.</p>
<p>That would appear to rule out sudden catastrophic mechanical failure, as it would mean the plane flew around 500 km (350 miles) at least after its last contact with air traffic control, although its transponder and other tracking systems were off.  A non-military source familiar with the investigations said the report was one of several theories and was being checked.</p>
<p><strong>LOST CONTACT</strong><br />
At the time it lost contact with civilian air traffic control, the plane was roughly midway between Malaysia&#8217;s east coast town of Kota Bharu and the southern tip of Vietnam, flying at 35,000 ft (10,670 metres). The Strait of Malacca, one of the world&#8217;s busiest shipping channels, runs along Malaysia&#8217;s west coast.</p>
<p>Malaysia&#8217;s Berita Harian newspaper quoted air force chief Rodzali Daud as saying the plane was last detected at 2.40 a.m. by military radar near the island of Pulau Perak at the northern end of the Strait of Malacca. It was flying about 1,000 metres lower than its previous altitude, he was quoted as saying. There was no word on what happened to the plane thereafter.</p>
<p>The effect of turning off the transponder is to make the aircraft inert to secondary radar, so civil controllers cannot identify it. Secondary radar interrogates the transponder and gets information about the plane&#8217;s identity, speed and height. It would however still be visible to primary radar, which is used by militaries.</p>
<p>Police had earlier said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might explain its disappearance, along with the possibility of a hijack, sabotage or mechanical failure. There was no distress signal or radio contact indicating a problem and, in the absence of any wreckage or flight data, police have been left trawling through passenger and crew lists for potential leads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe somebody on the flight has bought a huge sum of insurance, who wants family to gain from it or somebody who has owed somebody so much money, you know, we are looking at all possibilities,&#8221; Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told a news conference. &#8220;We are looking very closely at the video footage taken at the KLIA (Kuala Lumpur International Airport), we are studying the behavioural pattern of all the passengers.&#8221;</p>
<p>A huge search operation for the plane has been mostly focused on the shallow waters of the Gulf of Thailand off Malaysia&#8217;s east coast, although the Strait of Malacca has been included since Sunday. Navy ships, military aircraft, helicopters, coastguard and civilian vessels from 10 nations have criss-crossed the seas off both coasts of Malaysia without success. The massive search for the plane has drawn in navies, military aircraft, coastguard and civilian vessels from 10 nations.</p>
<p><strong>STOLEN PASSPORTS</strong><br />
The fact that at least two passengers on board had used stolen passports has raised suspicions of foul play. But Southeast Asia is known as a hub for false documents that are also used by smugglers, illegal migrants and asylum seekers. Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble named the two men as Iranians aged 18 and 29, who had entered Malaysia using their real passports before using the stolen European documents to board the Beijing-bound flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more information we get, the more we are inclined to conclude it is not a terrorist incident,&#8221; Noble said. Malaysian police chief Khalid said the younger man, who he said was 19, appeared to be an illegal immigrant. His mother was waiting for him in Frankfurt and had been in contact with authorities, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terrorist group, and we believe he was trying to migrate to Germany,&#8221; Khalid said. Asked if that meant he ruled out a hijack, Khalid said:    &#8220;(We are giving) same weightage to all (possibilities) until we complete our investigations.&#8221; Both men entered Malaysia on Feb 28, at least one from Phuket, in Thailand, eight days before boarding the flight to Beijing, Malaysian immigration chief Aloyah Mamat told the news conference. Both held onward reservations to Western Europe.</p>
<p>Police in Thailand, where the Italian and Austrian passports were stolen and the tickets used by the two men were booked, said they did not think they were linked to the disappearance of the plane. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t ruled it out, but the weight of evidence we&#8217;re getting swings against the idea that these men are or were involved in terrorism,&#8221; Supachai Puikaewcome, chief of police in the Thai resort city of Pattaya, told Reuters.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew now presumed to have died aboard the plane were Chinese. Other nationalities included 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French and three Americans. China has deployed 10 satellites using high-resolution earth imaging capabilities, visible light imaging and other technologies to &#8220;support and assist in the search and rescue operations&#8221;, the People&#8217;s Liberation Army Daily said.</p>
<p>The Boeing 777 has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft in service. Its only previous fatal crash came on July 6 last year when Asiana Airlines Flight 214 struck a seawall on landing in San Francisco, killing three people. U.S. planemaker Boeing has declined to comment beyond a brief statement saying it was monitoring the situation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006725&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Crimean parliament voted on Tuesday that the Black Sea peninsula will declare itself an independent state if its residents agree to split off from Ukraine and join Russia in a referendum. Crimea&#8217;s regional legislature today adopted a &#8220;declaration of independence of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.&#8221; The document specified that Crimea will become an independent state if its residents vote on Sunday in favour of joining Russia in the referendum.</p>
<p>Western nations have said they will not recognise the vote as legitimate. But the move might be used as an attempt to ease tensions with Crimea existing as a self-proclaimed state without Russia moving quickly to incorporate it into its territory.</p>
<p>After a brief war between Russia and Georgia in 2008, some leaders sin Georgia&#8217;s breakaway provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia also asked to join Russia, but their request was never granted. Meanwhile, Ukraine&#8217;s acting president today called for the formation of a national guard and for the mobilisation of reserves and volunteers into the country&#8217;s armed forces.</p>
<p>Oleksandr Turchynov asked the national parliament to approve turning the country&#8217;s Interior Ministry troops into a National Guard &#8220;to defend the country and citizens against any criminals, against external and internal aggression.&#8221; Turchynov said that the mobilisation will include those who have previously served in the army and volunteers. Russian forces have strengthened their control over Ukraine&#8217;s Crimea region in the run-up to a referendum set for Sunday on whether to split off and become part of Russia.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, who will fly to Washington to meet with Barack Obama tomorrow, called on Western nations to defend Ukraine against a nation &#8220;that is armed to the teeth and that has nuclear weapons.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006715&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/polio-med.jpg"><img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/polio-med.jpg" alt="Though the requirement was supposed to come into effect from January, India extended the deadline to allow Pakistan to set up necessary infrastructure." class="size-full wp-image-2006708" /></a> Though the requirement was supposed to come into effect from January, India extended the deadline to allow Pakistan to set up necessary infrastructure.<br />
India on Tuesday announced that proof of vaccination against polio would be mandatory after March 15 for everyone entering India from Pakistan to safeguard the country&#8217;s polio-free status.</p>
<p>Travellers from Pakistan will have to carry vaccination certificate, which would be later returned to them along with their visa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pakistani nationals resident in Pakistan and planning to travel to India after March 15, 2014 will be required to submit along with their visa applications a certificate of vaccination for one dose of Oral Polio Vaccination received at least four weeks prior to departure to India,&#8221; a statement released by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad said.</p>
<p>India had earlier announced that starting March 15, it would be mandatory for all persons – adults or children – travelling to the country from Pakistan to furnish proof of vaccination against the crippling disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;The step is being taken to safeguard India&#8217;s polio-free status attained after sustained efforts and investment,&#8221; an Indian High Commission official said.</p>
<p>Though the requirement was supposed to come into effect from January, India extended the deadline to allow Pakistan to set up necessary infrastructure.</p>
<p>The measure is applicable to all travellers from all countries where polio disease is endemic or where cases of polio are reported.</p>
<p>The number of polio cases in Pakistan, one of the only three countries where the disease is endemic, crossed over 90 last year. A number of fresh cases have also come to light this year.</p>
<p>Militants and gunmen frequently attack vaccination teams, accusing them of being Western spies and part of a plot to &#8220;sterilise&#8221; Muslims.</p>
<p>The announcement came on a day when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif chaired a meeting on polio at his residence.</p>
<p>Sharif said it is a matter of grave concern that there is a possibility of travel restrictions being imposed on Pakistanis since virus from Pakistan has been found linked to polio cases in other countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since it is a question of honour, image and prestige of our country, we must redouble our efforts to eradicate polio from our country,&#8221; Sharif was quoted as saying in an official statement. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006693&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A British terror convict has told a New York trial he met Osama bin Laden up to 50 times and was recruited by al-Qaeda to blow up a passenger jet. Saajid Badat was sentenced in 2005 to 13 years in jail as a co-conspirator in the notorious shoe bombing plot in December 2001, a time of worldwide concern over air travel after the September 11 attacks in the United States.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old has been dubbed a &#8220;supergrass,&#8221; slang for informant, by the British media for agreeing to testify against a slew of former associates. He was released early from prison in Britain, where authorities have given him accommodation and financial help, and he gave evidence from an undisclosed location on Monday because he faces arrest in America.</p>
<p>Badat is the second US government witness to appear at the trial of Suleiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of bin Laden and former al-Qaeda spokesman, who is on trial in Manhattan for conspiracy to kill Americans, conspiracy to provide support and providing material support to terrorists.</p>
<p>The prosecution showed the jury two videos of the defendant in October 2001 threatening Americans with a &#8220;storm of airplanes,&#8221; which they say implicates him in the shoe bomb plot. &#8220;The storm shall not lessen especially the storm of the airplanes,&#8221; Abu Ghaith shouted in one of the propaganda clips.</p>
<p>But the defense says there is no evidence tying Abu Ghaith, 48, to the conspiracy and brands Badat, who looked worried and unhappy throughout more than two hours of testimony, the real terrorist.</p>
<p>Asked how many times he met bin Laden in Afghanistan, where he says he spent three years training and fraternizing with top al-Qaeda leaders, Badat replied: &#8220;Around 20 times, maybe up to 50 times.&#8221; Fluent in English, Arabic, Urdu and Gujarati, Badat said he smuggled explosives from Afghanistan to Britain in late 2001 after being recruited by al-Qaeda to blow up jetliners with bombs hidden in shoes.</p>
<p>Fellow British recruit Richard Reid, known as the shoe bomber, is serving a life sentence in the United States for trying to blow up a Paris to Miami flight in December. Badat, then 21, said he worked directly with Reid from October to December that year in Afghanistan, and testified that they were supposed to blow up different planes. He said he &#8220;brainstormed for ideas&#8221; with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-declared 9/11 plotter, and planned with Mohammed&#8217;s nephew in Karachi to bomb a US, transatlantic or intra-Europe flight.</p>
<p>The witness, who grew up in a pious Muslim family in the English town of Gloucester, said he was introduced to the idea of violent jihad in London in 1997. In 1998 he went to Bosnia, where he met veterans of the Balkans war and was taught how to use weapons. In 1999, as a 19-year-old he traveled to Afghanistan, via Dubai and Pakistan, to train for jihad.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006654&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unmanned aircraft of the sort Israel uses for surveillance and missile strikes in Gaza crashed in the south of the territory early Tuesday, sources on both sides said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Sky Rider drone crashed in the southern Gaza Strip due to a technical malfunction,&#8221; an Israeli army spokeswoman said. &#8220;An investigation is under way.&#8221;</p>
<p>A news agency, run by the territory&#8217;s Islamist rulers, Hamas, said the drone came down east of the southern city of Khan Yunis.</p>
<p>Hamas&#8217;s armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, said its fighters had retrieved the drone.</p>
<p>The incident was followed by an Israeli air strike, also east of Khan Yunis, which killed three Islamic Jihad fighters, the militant group said.</p>
<p>It was unclear if the two incidents were related. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006673&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Malaysia&#8217;s military believes it tracked the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner by radar over the Strait of Malacca, far from where it last made contact with civilian air traffic control off the country&#8217;s east coast, a military source siad.</p>
<p>The Strait of Malacca, one of the world&#8217;s busiest shipping channels, runs along Malaysia&#8217;s west coast. The airline said on Saturday that the flight carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew last had contact off the east coast Malaysian town of Kota Bharu.</p>
<p>&#8220;It changed course after Kota Bharu and took a lower altitude. It made it into the Malacca Strait,&#8221; the military official, who has been briefed on investigations, told Reuters.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006605&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 27-year-old Indian-origin woman in the US state of Texas has been found guilty of causing arson that killed her husband two years ago.</p>
<p>Shriya Bimal Patel was convicted on Monday of dousing her husband Biman Patel in gasoline and setting him on fire in 2012. Bimal, 29, died at the burn centre of the San Antonio Military Medical Center, nearly five months after the April 17 incident.</p>
<p>She faces five up to 99 years in prison.</p>
<p>In closing arguments yesterday, the state asked jurors to recommend a life sentence for Shriya, who witnesses have said intentionally ignited an explosion that killed Bimal.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers, however, sought probation for her. They said Shriya would be deported to India should she receive community supervision.</p>
<p>Testimonies ended on Friday when defence attorneys called their only witness, an associate professor of Indian culture from the University of Texas. Her lawyers have argued that her husband killed himself and forced her to help. Prosecutors said Shriya, who had studied in London and lived in Dubai was used to an upper-class lifestyle, was upset because Bimal did not lived up to her expectations.</p>
<p>They said she was disappointed that Bimal had been laid off from a telemarketing job and was struggling to pay his rent. Bimal and Shriya had met via an arranged marriage service in India.</p>
<p>Arson investigators testified that burn patterns on Bimal&#8217;s body showed he was lying in the tub when Shriya used a cup to throw the gasoline on him.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006515&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A terrified UK family fled their home after hundreds of deadly spiders swarmed out of a pack of bananas they had bought from a local shop.</p>
<p>Jamie and Crystal Roberts in Staffordshire were horrified when they found the creepy crawlies, believed to be Brazilian Wandering Spiders which are the world&#8217;s deadliest spiders, in the bananas they had bought from a local corner shop.</p>
<p>Jamie, 31, had spotted white patches covering the fruit and assumed it was harmless mould.</p>
<p>But when he took a closer look later he realised the bananas were infested with a spider nest containing hundreds of spiders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like something out of a horror film because suddenly the window sill was moving with hundreds of these spiders,&#8221; Jamie said.</p>
<p>Jamie fled his home, along with his wife Crystal, 30, and two children on the advice of the pest controllers, &#8216;mirror.co.uk&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The house was fumigated and the family was allowed to go back only after three days.</p>
<p>Pest controllers told the family they suspected the creatures were the deadly Brazilian Wandering Spiders.</p>
<p>They are considered the most toxic spiders on Earth and their venom is said to be 30 times more powerful than that of a rattlesnake.</p>
<p>Humans bitten by one can suffer an irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, vomiting and eventual death.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006547&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/crime-480.jpg" /></a> In a gruesome incident, a Chinese woman kills her boyfriend after being raped. (Reuters)
<p>A Chinese woman chopped off her former boyfriend&#8217;s penis with scissors and then killed him with a hammer after he raped her, a Hong Kong court heard, according to a report on Tuesday. Yeung Ki, 41, on trial in the city, has admitted killing 32-year-old piano teacher Zhou Hui on Boxing Day 201,2 but denies murder, the South China Morning Post reported.</p>
<p>Yeung, a Chinese mainlander and Hong Kong resident, killed Zhou after an affair with the married man lasting years, during which he had deserted her while pregnant and borrowed money without paying it back on numerous occasions, it said.</p>
<p>On the night of the killing, Zhou &#8220;beat her, pushed her to the floor, and slapped their daughter&#8221;, then &#8220;forcibly had sex with her&#8221;, the High Court heard, according to the newspaper. Afterwards, she drugged him with soup laced with sleeping pills, cut off his penis and flushed it down the toilet, then when he was awakened by the pain, beat him to death with &#8220;almost uncountable&#8221; blows from a hammer, the paper reported the prosecution as saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeung Ki has been charged with murder. The trial will last 11 days,&#8221; a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong judiciary told AFP. Zhou had also told Yeung he had nude pictures of her which he would post on the internet unless she gave him USD 25,800 to buy a car, the South China Morning Post reported, citing prosecutors who appeared in court on Monday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006548&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/usarmy-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006519" alt="Sikhs are also able to wear protective equipment, including helmets and gas masks, in conformity with safety requirements, said US lawmakers." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/usarmy-main.jpg" /></a> Sikhs are also able to wear protective equipment, including helmets and gas masks, in conformity with safety requirements, said US lawmakers.
<p>A group of 105 US lawmakers has urged the Pentagon to lift the presumptive ban on the Sikhs serving in the military by easing restrictions on beard, turbans, and other religious accoutrements.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the achievements of these soldiers and their demonstrated ability to comply with operational requirements while practising their faith, we believe it is time for our military to make inclusion of practicing Sikh Americans the rule, not the exception,&#8221; the lawmakers said in a letter to US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel.</p>
<p>Led by Congressmen Joe Crowley, vice chair of the Democratic Caucus, and Rodney Frelinghuysen, Chairman of the House Defence Appropriations Subcommittee, the 105 members of the US House of Representatives requested that the US armed forces update their appearance regulations to once again allow Sikh Americans to serve while abiding by their articles of faith, such as wearing a turban or beard.</p>
<p>They said the Sikhs have served in the US army since World War I, and are permitted to serve in the armed forces of Canada and the UK, as well as key partner India.</p>
<p>The three Sikh Americans who have been granted individualised accommodations to serve in the US army wear turbans and maintain beards in a neat and conservative manner, both in accordance with operational requirements and their Sikh religious beliefs.</p>
<p>They are also able to wear protective equipment, including helmets and gas masks, in conformity with safety requirements.</p>
<p>Sikh Coalition applauded lawmaker&#8217;s move calling for an end to the presumptive ban on devout Sikh service in the US military.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s letter from Congress is a big step forward in our campaign to ensure equal opportunity for Sikh Americans in the  US military,&#8221; said Rajdeep Singh, director of Law and Policy for the Sikh Coalition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sikhs have proven time and again around the world that they are excellent soldiers. It&#8217;s time for the Pentagon to realise that Sikh Americans are here to stay and that policies of exclusion are inevitably going to fail,&#8221; Singh said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006506&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/musharaf-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006509" alt="This is the first time in Pakistan's history that a former military chief is facing trial for treason. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/musharaf-med.jpg" /></a> This is the first time in Pakistan&#8217;s history that a former military chief is facing trial for treason. (Reuters)
<p>Embattled former Pakistani military ruler Pervez Musharraf on tuesday failed to turn up for his indictment in a special court conducting his treason trial citing security reasons and was summoned on Friday.</p>
<p>High drama was witnessed at the hearing as the court was due to indict Musharraf over his 2007 imposition of emergency rule.</p>
<p>One of Musharraf&#8217;s lawyers Rana Ijaz was ordered out of the courtroom by Justice Faisal Arab, heading the three-man bench, after he called the judges &#8220;contract killers&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the start of the hearing, Ahmed Raza Kasuri, another lawyer of Musharraf, presented a leaked secret letter written by an official of the Interior Ministry warning against a possible terror attack on the 70-year-old former army chief.</p>
<p>He said Musharraf will appear when the court summons him, however, the court will be responsible for any untoward incident with his client.</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;History will hold you (the court) responsible&#8221;. Justice Arab countered that history itself would decide and asked the counsel not to cross professional limits.</p>
<p>Titled &#8220;Threat alert: 239&#8243;, the letter claimed that TTP and al-Qaeda fighters might target Musharraf.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that the terrorists have sympathisers in the security/cavalcade of Musharraf in order to assassinate him.</p>
<p>The plan may materialise either using IEDs/VBIED or inside/outside the courts similar to the incident of (slain Punjab governor) Salman Taseer,&#8221; stated the document.</p>
<p>Countering this argument, prosecutor Akram Sheikh expressed surprise that a secret letter was with the defence team even though the prosecution was not aware of it.</p>
<p>He said that Musharraf is a free man and the court should order that he be taken into custody so that security could be the government&#8217;s responsibility.</p>
<p>He said the government will ensure three-tier security and that the number of personnel on duty to guard Musharraf would be doubled.</p>
<p>Currently about 1,200 security personnel are put on duty to ensure Musharraf&#8217;s safe travel to the special court.</p>
<p>Kasuri said on Monday that Musharraf will not appear in court.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can he appear before the court when the court itself is not safe,&#8221; Kasuri had said. Citing the leaked letter, he said Musharraf&#8217;s life was under serious threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Ministry of Interior is the complainant in the case. This time we are not saying he is under threat. The complainant is saying so. The letter clearly says that he may be attacked on his way from the AFIC (Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology) to court,&#8221; Kasuri said.</p>
<p>This is the first time in Pakistan&#8217;s history that a former military chief is facing trial for treason.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006503&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ukraine will raise a new national guard force among military veterans in response to Russian attempts to annex Crimea, the acting president told parliament on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Oleksander Turchinov said mismanagement of the armed forces under his ousted predecessor meant that the Ukrainian military had to be rebuilt &#8220;effectively from scratch&#8221;. The acting defence minister said the country had only 6,000 combat-ready infantry compared to over 200,000 Russian troops on its eastern borders.</p>
<p>Turchinov, who warned against provoking further Russian action, said the National Security and Defence Council decided to establish a National Guard, using the existing Interior Ministry forces as a base. The goal would be &#8220;to defend citizens from criminals and from internal or external aggression&#8221;.</p>
<p>A partial mobilisation of volunteers drawn from those with previous military experience would begin, he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006483&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/south-china-sea.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006477" alt="Philippines and China have been locked in a dispute over South China Sea resources. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/south-china-sea.jpg" /></a> Philippines and China have been locked in a dispute over South China Sea resources. (Reuters)
<p>The Philippines protested on Tuesday actions by the Chinese coast guard that prevented delivery of supplies to a small group of Filipino soldiers guarding a shoal in a disputed area in the South China Sea.Manila calls China action in disputed waters an &#8220;urgent threat&#8221;</p>
<p>Manila protested on Tuesday against Beijing&#8217;s blockade of civilian supply ships in disputed waters of the South China Sea, saying China&#8217;s latest actions &#8220;constitute a clear and urgent threat to the rights and interests of the Philippines&#8221;. China&#8217;s coast guard ships had driven away two Philippine vessels, which had tried to approach a shoal in the South China Sea on Sunday, sparking the latest flare-up in a long-running territorial dispute.</p>
<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs summoned China&#8217;s charge d&#8217; affaires Sun Xiangyang on Tuesday to hand over a strongly worded protest over the incident in the waters around the Second Thomas Shoal, which the Philippines refers to as the Ayungin Shoal.</p>
<p>In a statement, the foreign ministry &#8220;urged China to desist from any further interference with the efforts of the Philippines to undertake rotation and resupply operations at the Ayungin Shoal.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Ayungin Shoal is part of the continental shelf of the Philippines and (it) is therefore entitled to exercise sovereignty rights and jurisdiction in the area without the permission of other states,&#8221; the foreign ministry said.</p>
<p>The shoal, known in China as the Ren&#8217;ai reef. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the Chinese patrol ships warned the Philippine vessels, carrying construction materials, not to intrude further into the waters around the reef and they left the area. China&#8217;s claim over islands, reefs and atolls that form the Spratlys, a group of 250 uninhabitable islets spread over 165,000 square miles, has set it directly against Vietnam and the Philippines, while Brunei, Taiwan and Malaysia also lay claim to parts.</p>
<p>The South China Sea provides 10 percent of the global fish catch, carries $5 trillion in ship borne trade a year and its seabed is believed to be rich with energy reserves. Manila ran aground an old transport ship on the reef in 1999 to mark its territory, and has stationed marines in abject conditions on the rusting ship. The Philippines also occupies eight other features in the disputed Spratlys.</p>
<p>The Second Thomas Shoal, a strategic gateway to Reed Bank, believed to be rich in oil and natural gas, is one of several possible flashpoints in the South China Sea that could prompt the United States to intervene in defence of its Southeast Asian allies.</p>
<p>In 2010, Manila awarded an Anglo-Filipino consortium a licence to explore for gas on Reed Bank, but drilling stalled in 2012, because of the presence of Chinese ships. Manila says Reed Bank, about 80 nautical miles west of Palawan island at the southwestern end of the Philippine archipelago, is within the country&#8217;s 200-nautical mile (370 km) exclusive economic zone.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006474&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/iran.jpg" /></a> An Iranian identified as Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad who travelled on the stolen passport . (AP)
<p>Investigators probing the baffling disappearance of a Malaysian plane with 239 people aboard on Saturday identified a 19-year-old Iranian man as one of the two persons who travelled on stolen passports but said he is &#8220;not likely&#8221; to have terrorist links.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have identified (one of the two persons travelling on stolen passports as) an Iranian by the name of Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad. He is 19-years-old and he is an Iranian, we believe that he is an Iranian,&#8221; Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been checking his background. We have also checked him with other police organisation on his profile and we believe that he is not likely to be a member of any terrorist group. We believe that he was trying to migrate to Germany,&#8221; he was quoted as saying by BBC.</p>
<p>Authorities were in contact with the Iranian&#8217;s mother in Germany, who has been expecting her son to arrive in the city of Frankfurt, he said.</p>
<p>The investigation into the fate of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 widened with authorities questioning travel agents about the two men who boarded the plane with stolen passports of an Italian and an Austrian.</p>
<p>The<a title="How can jet disappear? In the ocean, it’s not hard" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/how-can-jet-disappear-in-the-ocean-its-not-hard/" target="_blank"> Beijing-bound Boeing 777-200 plane</a> had 227 passengers on board, including five Indians and one Indian-origin Canadian, and 12 crew members.</p>
<p>The police chief said that they had not finalised their probe on the other passenger who used a stolen passport. &#8220;On the other person who travelled on the stolen passport, we are still conducting our investigation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Another Iranian man named Kazem Ali bought one-way tickets for the two men, describing them as friends who wanted to return home to Europe, CNN reported citing Thai police.</p>
<p>While Ali made the initial booking by telephone, either he or someone acting on his behalf paid for the tickets in cash, police said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to look further into this Mr Ali&#8217;s identity because it&#8217;s almost a tradition to use an alias when doing business around here,&#8221; Police Lt Colonel Ratchthapong Tia-sood said.</p>
<p>The travel agency&#8217;s owner, Benjaporn Krutnait, told The Financial Times she believed Ali was not connected to terrorism because he had asked for cheapest tickets to Europe and did not specify the Kuala Lumpur to Beijing flight.</p>
<p>The search for the missing plane entered the fourth day, as 34 planes, 40 ships and teams from ten countries were involved in search operations that were widened to a 100 nautical mile (185 km) radius from the point the plane was last detected.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006449&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;" align="LEFT">US President Barack Obama and other top leaders continued to mobilise international support to isolate Russia for its action against Ukraine and for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;" align="LEFT">Obama called Kazakhstan&#8217;s President Nursultan Nazarbayev and the Spanish President Mariano Rajoy. In less than a fortnight, after the breakout of the <a title="Clashes in Ukraine as rival rallies raise tensions" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/clashes-in-ukraine-as-rival-rallies-raise-tensions/">Ukrainian crisis</a>, Obama has spent several hours over phone, reaching out to the world leaders including those from Britain, Germany, Poland, France, Canada, Italy, Japan and China.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;" align="LEFT">He has had long telephonic conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. US Vice President Joe Biden, who spoke with the Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades to discuss issues of regional concern, including the situation in Ukraine, has played an active role in the America&#8217;s global outreach on this issue. Biden has spoken several times with the Ukrainian leadership and those of Russia.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;" align="LEFT">Secretary of State John Kerry has been active in rallying world support on Ukraine. He has been holding series of meetings with his Russian counterpart and spending hours over the phone to convince the international community that the Russian military action in Ukraine is unjustified. Kerry among others has called UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Turkey, Britain, Poland, European Union, Canada and Japan.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;" align="LEFT">In his conversation with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov, Kerry made clear that the US wants to see a cessation of Russian military advances in Ukraine, including Crimean Peninsula, a halt in the drive for annexation of Crimea, and the end of provocative steps to provide space for diplomacy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;" align="LEFT">&#8220;The United States needs to see concrete evidence that Russia is prepared to engage on the diplomatic proposals we have made to facilitate direct dialogue between <a title="Russia preparing counterproposals over Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/russia-preparing-counterproposals-over-ukraine/">Ukraine and Russia</a> and to use international mechanisms like a contact group to de-escalate the conflict,&#8221; State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki said.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;" align="LEFT">&#8220;We are still awaiting a Russian response to the concrete questions that Secretary Kerry sent Foreign Minister Lavrov on Saturday in this regard,&#8221; she said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters that the conversations Obama has been having with leaders across the world have focused not just on the referendum but on the broader effort to be united in calling for de-escalation and for a peaceful resolution to this crisis.</p>

<p>North Korea has developed sophisticated counter measures to circumvent UN sanctions, including the suspected use of its embassies to facilitate the illegal trade in weapons, according to a United Nations report.</p>
<p>North Korean embassies in Cuba and Singapore were suspected by the eight member UN panel of experts of facilitating the country&#8217;s banned arms trade, including a shipment of fighter jets and missile parts that were seized in Panama last July.</p>
<p>The report also pointed to the use of more developed financial counter measures used to mask the purchase of both banned and permitted goods.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006325&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russia has said it is drafting counterproposals to a US plan for a negotiated solution to the <a title="Ukraine crisis: Crimea sets referendum on whether to join Russia" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-others/ukraine-crisis-crimea-sets-referendum-on-whether-to-join-russia/" target="_blank">Ukraine crisis</a>, denouncing the new Western-backed government as an unacceptable &#8220;fait accompli&#8221; and claiming that Russian-leaning parts of the country have been plunged into lawlessness.</p>
<p>The Kremlin moves came as Russian forces strengthened their control over Crimea, less than a week before the strategic region is to hold a contentious referendum on whether to split off and become part of Russia.</p>
<p>In a televised briefing with President Vladimir Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said proposals made by US Secretary of State John Kerry are &#8220;not suitable&#8221; because they take &#8220;the situation created by the coup as a starting point,&#8221; referring to the ouster of Ukraine&#8217;s pro-Kremlin president, Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
<p>Referring to a document he received from Kerry explaining the US view of the situation in Ukraine, Lavrov said: &#8220;To be frank, it raises many questions on our side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything was stated in terms of allegedly having a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and in terms of accepting the fait accompli,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lavrov said Kerry delayed a visit to Moscow to discuss the situation, and Russia had decided to prepare new proposals of its own, though he did not say what they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;We suggested that he come today &#8230; and we were prepared to receive him. He gave his preliminary consent. He then called me on Saturday and said he would like to postpone it for a while,&#8221; the minister said. But in Washington, State Department officials said that it was Russia&#8217;s refusal to discuss the American proposals that was hurting prospects for a negotiated solution in particular, the idea of direct talks between Russian officials and those of the new<a title="British government boycotts Sochi Paralympics over Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/british-government-boycotts-sochi-paralympics-over-ukraine/" target="_blank"> Ukrainian government</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are still awaiting a Russian response to the concrete questions that Secretary Kerry sent Foreign Minister Lavrov on Saturday in this regard,&#8221; State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secretary Kerry made clear to Foreign Minister Lavrov that he would welcome further discussions focused on how to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine if and when we see concrete evidence that Russia is prepared to engage on these proposals,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The statement said Kerry, in weekend discussions with Lavrov, reiterated Washington&#8217;s demand that Moscow pull back its troops from Ukraine and end attempts to annex the Crimean peninsula. Kerry also called on Russia to cease what the statement described as &#8220;provocative steps&#8221; to allow diplomatic talks to continue.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006237&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/osama-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006304" alt="The government witness, Saajid Badat, testified that he met with Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders regarding a plan to explode devices on airplanes. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/osama-main.jpg" /></a> The government witness, Saajid Badat, testified that he met with Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders regarding a plan to explode devices on airplanes. (AP)
<p>Jurors in the trial of alleged Al Qaeda operative Suleiman Abu Ghaith on Monday watched videos of the defendant warning of  a &#8220;storm&#8221; of <a title="Before 9/11 aniv,US warns of small airplane threats" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/before-9-11-aniv-us-warns-of-small-airplane-threats/" target="_blank">airplane attacks</a> a month after Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith, 48, is on trial in Manhattan federal court for conspiring to <a title="US probing al Qaeda link to airplane incident" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/us-probing-al-qaeda-link-to-airplane-incident/" target="_blank">kill Americans</a>, among other charges. Prosecutors contend he was a top-tier member of Al Qaeda and knew of various terrorist plots. On Monday, prosecutors played two videos from October 2001  in which Abu Ghaith, a Kuwaiti and son in law of Osama Bin Laden, is seen warning of further attacks in the wake of 9/11.&#8221;There are thousands of young Muslims who look forward to die for the sake of Allah,&#8221; Abu Ghaith said in one video. &#8220;The storm of airplanes will not stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>At another point, Abu Ghaith warns Muslims &#8220;not to board aircraft and we advise them not to live in high rises and tall buildings.&#8221; Also on Monday, prosecutors questioned via a video feed a convicted Al Qaeda operative linked to &#8220;shoe bomber&#8221; Richard Reid, who testified that he was planning shoe-bomb attacks on airplanes around the same time that Abu Ghaith was warning of additional attacks. The implication was that Abu Ghaith was aware of these planned attacks.</p>
<p>The government witness, Saajid Badat, testified that he met with Bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders regarding a plan to explode devices on airplanes. At the same time, he acknowledged that he never spoke to Abu Ghaith about the plot and said he did not know if Abu Ghaith was aware of it. Badat, 34, appeared via video from the United Kingdom, his head shaved and wearing a trim beard along with a gray suit.</p>
<p>From late October to December 2001, Badat said he plotted attacks with Reid, the man who became known as the shoe bomber after his attempt to detonate explosives on a flight to Miami in 2001. Reid, a British citizen, pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in a U.S. District Court in Boston.</p>
<p>Badat, also a British citizen, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the plot after pleading guity in Britain to conspiring to harm an aircraft. His sentence was later reduced for his cooperation with authorities and he has since been released from prison. Badat has testified in other terror cases, including the successful prosecution in Brooklyn federal court in 2012 of Adis Medunjanin, for planning a suicide bomb attack on New York City subways.</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith is one of the highest-ranking figures linked to Al Qaeda to face a civilian jury on terrorism-related charges since the attacks that destroyed New York&#8217;s World Trade Center, which stood just blocks from the courthouse where he is on trial. He faces life in prison if convicted. Abu Ghaith&#8217;s lawyers plan to cross-examine Badat on Tuesday. The trial is expected to last until the end of March.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006207&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rescue-t.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006215" alt="China has urged Malaysia to speed up the search for the plane. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rescue-t.jpg" /></a> China has urged Malaysia to speed up the search for the Malaysian plane Flight MH370. (Reuters)
<p>China has deployed 10 satellites to help in the massive air and sea search for a missing Malaysian airliner, the People&#8217;s Liberation Army Daily said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The satellites will use high-resolution earth imaging capabilities, visible light imaging and other technologies to &#8220;support and assist in the search and rescue operations for the Malaysian Airlines aircraft&#8221;, the newspaper said in an article that was also carried on the defence ministry&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>Dozens of ships and aircraft from 10 countries scoured the seas around Malaysia and south of Vietnam as questions mounted over possible security lapses and whether a bomb or hijacking attempt could have brought down the<a title="Timeline: Malaysia Airlines flight’s disappearance" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/timeline-malaysia-airlines-flights-disappearance/" target="_blank"> Boeing 777-200ER</a> which took off from the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>China has urged Malaysia to speed up the search for the plane. About two-thirds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew now presumed to have died aboard the plane were Chinese.</p>
<p>The <a title="Still no sign of Malaysia Airlines jet lost in “unprecedented mystery”" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/still-no-sign-of-malaysia-airlines-jet-lost-in-unprecedented-mystery/" target="_blank">Chinese satellites</a> will also help in weather monitoring, communication and search operations in the area where the plane disappeared, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China will also strengthen the Beidou navigation system&#8217;s satellite monitoring capabilities to &#8220;provide reliable navigation for the rescue operations and communication support&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006203&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiaairline_480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005752 " alt="The Beijing-bound Boeing 777-200 Flight MH370 of Malaysia Airlines had 227 passengers aboard. (AP Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiaairline_480.jpg" /></a> More than 1,000 people and at least 34 planes and 40 ships were searching for Flight MH370, said Azharuddin. (AP)
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:medium;">In an age when people assume that any bit of information is just a click away, the thought that a jetliner could simply disappear over the ocean for more than two days is staggering. But <a title="Missing Malaysia Airlines: ‘Fake’ passports mystery deepens" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/fake-passports-mystery-deepens/" target="_blank">Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370</a> is hardly the first reminder of how big the seas are, and of how agonizing it can be to try to find something lost in them.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:medium;">It took two years to find the main wreckage of an <a title="Air France jet crashed nose-up after 4-min ordeal" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/air-france-jet-crashed-noseup-after-4min-ordeal/" target="_blank">Air France jet</a> that plunged into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. Closer to the area between Malaysia and Vietnam where Saturday&#8217;s flight vanished, it took a week for debris from an Indonesian jet to be spotted in 2007. Today, the mostly intact fuselage still sits on the bottom of the ocean.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:medium;">&#8220;The world is a big place,&#8221; said Michael Smart, professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Queensland in Australia. &#8220;If it happens to come down in the middle of the ocean and it&#8217;s not near a shipping lane or something, who knows how long it could take them to find?&#8221; Amid the confusion, officials involved in the search say the Malaysian jet may have made a U-turn, adding one more level of uncertainty to the effort to find it. They even suggest that the plane could be hundreds of kilometers from where it was last detected. Aviation experts say the plane will be found eventually.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Since the start of the jet age in 1958, only a handful of jets have gone missing and not been found. &#8220;I&#8217;m absolutely confident that we will find this airplane,&#8221; Capt John M. Cox, who spent 25 years flying for US Airways and is now CEO of Safety Operating Systems, said yesterday. The modern pace of communications, where GPS features in our cars and smart phones tell us our location at any given moment, has set unreal expectations. &#8220;This is not the first time we have had to wait a few days to find the wreckage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Based on what he&#8217;s heard, Cox believes it&#8217;s increasingly clear that the plane somehow veered from its normal flight path. He said that after the plane disappeared from radar, it must have been &#8220;intact and flew for some period of time. Beyond that, it&#8217;s all speculation.&#8221; If it had exploded midair along its normal flight path, &#8220;we would have found it by now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Malaysian civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, whose agency is leading a multinational effort to find the Boeing 777, said more than 1,000 people and at least 34 planes and 40 ships were searching a radius of 100 nautical miles around the last known location of Flight MH370. No signal has been detected since early Saturday morning, when the plane was at its cruising altitude and showed no sign of trouble.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A device resembling a credit card swiper is revolutionising some of Egypt’s politically explosive bread lines and may help achieve the impossible — cutting crippling food import bills.</span></p>
<p>Authorities who hope to avoid protests over subsidised loaves sold for the equivalent of one US cent have turned to smart cards to try to manage the corrupt and wasteful bread supply chain that has been untouchable.</p>
<p>If it succeeds, the pilot project in the Suez Canal city of Port Said could be used as a model for food and fuel subsidy reform throughout Egypt, where bread, known in the local Arabic dialect as “life”, is the staple.</p>
<p>“This is an urgent project,” said Dr Ali Attria, an official from the Administrative Development Ministry who has helped manage the trial.</p>
<p>Egypt, the world’s largest importer of wheat, purchases around 10 million tonnes a year, draining its hard currency reserves to provide the poor the disc-shaped loaf. The government spends around $5 billion a year on food subsidies, which also cover items such as rice, oil and sugar. A slide in the Egyptian pound’s value since December 2012 is pushing up the bill.</p>
<p>Profiteers exploit the system, and many people feed bread to their livestock because it is cheaper than animal feed. Yet, one cash-strapped government after another has resisted attacking the problem, fearful that cutting subsidies could be political suicide.</p>
<p>President Anwar Sadat triggered riots when he cut the bread subsidy in 1977, while President Hosni Mubarak faced unrest in 2008 when the rising price of wheat caused shortages. When Egyptians rose up against Mubarak’s rule three years ago, one of their signature chants was: “Bread, freedom and social justice.”</p>
<p>Before he was deposed by the army last July, President Mohamed Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood began working to ensure that bread was delivered efficiently to those who truly need it. Mursi is now in jail but the programme is starting to yield results.</p>
<p>At a simple metal kiosk, a smart card scanner hangs on a wall between windows that open onto two orderly gender-segregated lines. Those who have complaints about the new system can call a hotline.</p>
<p>The scene was unthinkable just a year ago. “There was congestion, people were coming from outside Port Said to buy our good bread,” said bakery co-owner Adel Hassan Shater, 63, referring to a once thriving black market. “This is better for everyone.”</p>
<p>The now year-old programme in this city of 6,50,000 has enabled the government to keep tabs on individual consumption of bread via the electronic cards, already used for other subsidised goods such as rice and sugar. Smart card-holders are allowed five loaves per family member per day.</p>
<p>A parallel effort to issue smart cards to drivers in order to monitor fuel consumption is not yet operational, but is likewise aimed at gathering data the government can refer to when drafting its subsidy reforms.</p>
<p>Safwat Emar, the top Supplies Ministry official in Port Said, said that the project is hitting the people at the heart of the problem: dishonest bakers.</p>
<p>At Port Said’s Freedom Bakery, owner Mahmoud El Kefery says he works closely with government monitors who check data registered by his smart card readers and allocates his daily flour supply accordingly.</p>
<p>Customers seem satisfied. “We like systems, and we want things to be organised so there is security and everyone gets their share,” said Baseema El Bani, a 55-year-old government employee, folding her stack of loaves in a shopping bag. Before the “smart card” system was introduced, the bakery would often run out of loaves by midday, before the mother of five got off work.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006119&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Two weeks ago, Sergey Aksyonov was the leader of a tiny pro-Russia political party that could barely summon 4 per cent of the votes in Crimea. He was also a little-known businessman with a murky past and a nickname — ‘Goblin’ — left over from the days when criminal gangs flourished here after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Today, Aksyonov is the prime minister of Crimea’s regional government and the public face of Russia’s seizure of the Black Sea peninsula. He is, by all appearances, a man placed in power by Moscow.</span></p>
<p>He also leads a brand-new army, 30 men carrying AK-47s, who are still learning to march in formation. “Commander!” they greeted him Saturday, when they were sworn into service in a Simferopol park. Speaking at the ceremony, the former semi-professional boxer said that while Crimea’s March 16 referendum would make the peninsula a part of Russia, he holds no grudge against Ukraine. He is, he insisted, a peacemaker.</p>
<p>But the people of Simferopol remember Aksyonov by his 1990s name Goblin. Andriy Senchenko, now a member of Ukraine’s Batkivshchyna party, which was at the forefront of the Kiev protests that led last month to the downfall of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych, described Aksyonov as a “brigade leader” in a gang that was often involved in extortion rackets.</p>
<p>The editor of the region’s main pro-Russian newspaper, Crimean Truth, also accused Aksyonov of being in a criminal gang.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006109&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The disappearance of a <a title="Still no sign of Malaysia Airlines jet lost in “unprecedented mystery”" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/still-no-sign-of-malaysia-airlines-jet-lost-in-unprecedented-mystery/" target="_blank">Malaysian airliner</a> about an hour into a flight to Beijing is an “unprecedented mystery”, the country’s civil aviation chief said Monday, as a massive air and sea search now in its third day failed to find any trace of the plane or 239 people on board.</span></p>
<p>Dozens of ships and aircraft from 10 countries scoured the seas around Malaysia and south <span style="line-height:1.5em;">of Vietnam as questions mounted over possible <a title="Vietnam plane spots possible wreckage of missing Malaysia Airlines" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/vietnam-plane-spots-possible-wreckage-of-missing-malaysia-airlines/" target="_blank">security lapses</a> and whether a bomb or hijacking attempt could have brought down the Boeing 777-200ER which took off from Kuala Lumpur.</span></p>
<p>The area of the search would be widened from Tuesday, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the head of Malaysia’s <a title="Timeline: Malaysia Airlines flight’s disappearance" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/timeline-malaysia-airlines-flights-disappearance/" target="_blank">Civil Aviation Authority</a>, told reporters.</p>
<p>A senior police official told Reuters that people armed with explosives and carrying false identity papers had tried to fly out of Kuala Lumpur in the past, and that current investigations were focused on two passengers who were on the missing plane with stolen passports.</p>
<p>“We have stopped men with false or stolen passports and carrying explosives, who have tried to get past KLIA (airport) security and get on to a plane,” he said. “There have been two or three incidents, but I will not divulge the details.”</p>
<p>Interpol confirmed Sunday at least two passengers used stolen passports and said it was checking whether others aboard had used false identity documents.</p>
<p>Azharuddin said a hijacking attempt could not be ruled out as investigators explore all theories for the loss of Malaysia Airlines <a title="Hunt on for Malaysia Airlines: Stolen passports, missing debris fuel fears of foul play" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/hunt-on-for-malaysia-airlines-stolen-passports-missing-debris-fuel-fears-of-foul-play/" target="_blank">Flight MH370</a>.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately we have not found anything that appears to be objects from the aircraft, let alone the aircraft,” he told a news conference. “As far as we are concerned, we have to find the aircraft. We have to find a piece of the aircraft if possible.”</p>
<p>Azharuddin also said the two men with stolen passports did not look like Asians, but he did not elaborate. Airport CCTV footage showed they completed all security procedures, he said.</p>
<p>“We are looking at the possibility of a stolen passport syndicate,” he said.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew now presumed to have died aboard the plane were Chinese. The airline said other nationalities included 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French and three Americans.<br />
China urged Malaysia to speed up the search for the plane.</p>
<p>“This incident happened more than two days ago, and we hope that the Malaysians can fully understand the urgency of China, especially of the family members, and can step up the speed of the investigation and increase efforts on search and rescue,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing.</p>
<p>A senior source involved in preliminary investigations in Malaysia said the failure to find any debris indicated the plane may have broken up mid-flight, which could disperse wreckage over a very wide area.</p>
<p>“The fact that we are unable to find any debris so far appears to indicate that the aircraft is likely to have disintegrated at around 35,000 feet,” said the source.</p>
<p>Asked about the possibility of an explosion, the source said there was no evidence of foul play and that the aircraft could have broken up due to mechanical causes.</p>
<p>The United States extensively reviewed imagery taken by American spy satellites for evidence of a mid-air explosion, but saw none, a U.S. government source said. The source described U.S. satellite coverage of the region as thorough.</p>
<p>Hopes for a breakthrough rose briefly when Vietnam scrambled helicopters to investigate a floating yellow object it was thought could have been a life raft. But the country’s Civil Aviation Authority said on its website that the object turned out to be a “moss-covered cap of a cable reel”.</p>
<p>Flight MH370 disappeared from radar screens in the early hours of Saturday, about an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur, after climbing to a cruising altitude of 35,000 ft (10,670 metres).</p>
<p>The passenger manifest issued by the airline included the names of two Europeans &#8211; Austrian Christian Kozel and Italian Luigi Maraldi &#8211; who were not on the plane. Their passports had been stolen in Thailand during the past two years.</p>
<p>An Interpol spokeswoman said a check of all documents used to board the plane had revealed more “suspect passports”, which were being investigated.</p>
<p>“Whilst it is too soon to speculate about any connection between these stolen passports and the missing plane, it is clearly of great concern that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol’s databases,” Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said.</p>
<p>A European diplomat in Kuala Lumpur cautioned that the Malaysian capital was an Asian hub for illegal migrants, many of whom used false documents and complex routes including via Beijing or West Africa to reach a final destination in Europe.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t automatically think that the fact there were two people on the plane with false passports had anything to do with the disappearance of the plane,” the diplomat said.</p>
<p>“The more you know about the role of Kuala Lumpur in this chain, the more doubtful you are of the chances of a linkage.”</p>
<p>A Thai travel agent who arranged the tickets for the two passengers using the stolen passports said she had booked them on the flight via Beijing because they were the cheapest tickets, the Financial Times reported.</p>
<p>The travel agent in the resort of Pattaya said an Iranian business contact she knew only as “Mr Ali” had asked her to book tickets for the two men on March 1.</p>
<p>She had initially booked them on other airlines but those reservations expired and on March 6, Mr Ali had asked her to book them again. She told the newspaper she did not think Mr Ali, who paid her in cash and booked tickets with her regularly, was linked to terrorism.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006110&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Be it US or Russia, Kosovo or Syria, acceptability of regions breaking away depends on circumstances.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006097&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By: Peter Baker</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">They wanted to break away from a country they considered hostile. The government cried foul, calling it a violation of international law. But with the help of a powerful foreign military, they succeeded in severing ties.</span></p>
<p>The Kosovars’ secession from Serbia in 1999 drove a deep wedge between the United States and Russia. Washington supported Kosovo’s bid for independence, culminating in 2008, while Moscow saw it as an infringement of Serbia’s sovereignty.</p>
<p>Now the former Cold War rivals again find themselves at odds, but this time with sides switched: Russia proclaims Crimea’s right to break off from Ukraine while the US calls it illegitimate. The showdown has revived a centuries-old debate over the right of self-determination versus the territorial integrity of nation-states.</p>
<p>The clash in Crimea is hardly an exact parallel of the Kosovo episode, especially with Russian troops occupying the peninsula as it calls a March 16 referendum to dissolve ties with Ukraine and rejoin Russia. Though the US intervened militarily in Kosovo, it did not do so to take the territory for itself. But the current case underscores once again that for all of the articulation of grand principles, the acceptability of regions breaking away often depends on the circumstances.</p>
<p>It is a delicate subject in the West, where Britain wants to keep Scotland and Spain wants to keep Catalonia. The US, after all, was born in revolution, breaking away from London without consent of the national government — something the Obama administration insists Crimea must have. The American union later fought a civil war to keep the south from breaking away.</p>
<p>“No state has been consistent in its application of this,” said Samuel Charap, a Russia specialist at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. During a trip he took to Moscow last week, Charap said, Kosovo was the precedent cited repeatedly by Russians. “It’s like, ‘You do the same thing. You’re no better, no different’.”</p>
<p>The Kremlin has likewise cited Scotland. But US officials note that no foreign power sent troops into Edinburgh to replace its local government and stage a vote under the barrel of a gun.</p>
<p>“It’s apples and oranges,” said Benjamin J Rhodes, President Barack Obama’s deputy national security adviser. “You can’t ignore that this is taking place days after the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty. It’s not a permissive environment for people to make up their own minds.”</p>
<p>The concept of state sovereignty can be traced to the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648. Ukraine itself is the product of a break-up, that of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Although Woodrow Wilson championed self-determination after World War I, the US, like most powers, generally prefers stability and the status quo. During the first Russian war in Chechnya, Bill Clinton even likened Boris N Yeltsin to Abraham Lincoln, to regret later.</p>
<p>“Self-determination has been a controversial doctrine since Wilson, and hell to apply,” said Stephen Sestanovich, a former ambassador-at-large to the Soviet states. “One consistent point: It can’t be used as a cudgel by big states to break up their neighbours. Russia’s record here does not entitle it to the benefit of the doubt.”</p>
<p>Russia’s two wars in Chechnya since the 1990s were fought to prevent the very strain of separatism it now encourages in Crimea. In backing President Bashar Assad of Syria against rebels, Russia argues that state sovereignty should not be violated, an argument it has turned on its head in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Of course, the fractiousness that has chopped up the Soviet empire is not relegated only to that part of the world.</p>
<p>In September, for example, Scotland will hold a referendum on secession. In November, Catalonia plans its own vote on independence from Spain, although in that case the Madrid government has called it illegal. Quebec held unsuccessful referendums on independence from Canada in 1980 and 1995, and as recently as last week its separatist government was discussing whether another should be held.</p>
<p>But Kosovo is the case that deeply divided Europe. John B Bellinger III, who was the top lawyer at the State Department under Bush, said: “We were very careful to emphasise that Kosovo was a unique situation. We were fond of saying it was sui generis — and it did not create a precedent.”</p>
<p>That is not how the Kremlin sees it. Ever since, Russia has cited Kosovo to justify support for pro-Moscow separatist republics in places like Georgia, where it went to war in 2008, and to recognise the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia over Western objections.</p>
<p>“Kosovo is very much a legitimate precedent,” said Dimitri K Simes, president of the Center for the National Interest, a Washington research organisation. “Independence was accomplished despite strong opposition by a legitimate, democratic and basically Western-oriented government of Serbia.” By contrast, he said, the new pro-Western government in Kiev “lacks legitimacy”, since it came to power by toppling a democratically elected president.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006097&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/army.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005933" alt="Armed men, believed to be Russian servicemen, march outside an Ukrainian military base in the Crimean city of Simferopol Monday. Reuters" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/army.jpg" /></a> Armed men, believed to be Russian servicemen, march outside an Ukrainian military base in the Crimean city of Simferopol Monday. Reuters
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post in Crimea on Monday in the latest confrontation since Russian military groups seized control of the Black Sea peninsula.</span></p>
<p>With diplomacy at a standstill, Russia said the United States had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis, the worst East-West standoff since the Cold War.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, who said he would address the UN Security Council on Thursday, put the blame for the crisis on Russia and accused Moscow of undermining the global security system by taking control of Crimea.</p>
<p>Russian forces have in little more than a week taken over military installations across Crimea, home to the Russian Black Sea Fleet and Russian territory until Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in 1954.</p>
<p>Pro-Russian separatists have taken control of the regional parliament, declared Crimea part of the Russian Federation and announced a referendum for Sunday to confirm this.</p>
<p>President Vladimir Putin says Moscow is acting to protect the rights of ethnic Russians, who make up a majority of Crimea’s population, after Ukraine’s president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in what Russia says was an unconstitutional coup.</p>
<p>On Monday, a group of about 10 unidentified armed men fired in the air at a Ukrainian naval post in Crimea, a Ukrainian defence spokesman was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s Channel 5 television quoted Vladislav Seleznyov as saying the shooting took place at a motor pool base near Bakhchisaray. The men in two minibuses drove into the compound and demanded Ukrainian personnel there give them 10 trucks.</p>
<p>Earlier, Interfax Ukraine news agency quoted an unnamed Ukrainian official describing the men as Russian troops and saying none of the Ukrainians at the site was injured.</p>
<p>Russian forces, who have been in control of Crimea for more than a week, have not so far exchanged fire in anger with Ukrainian troops. Shots were fired over the heads of a group of Ukrainians during a standoff at a military airfield last week.</p>
<p>In other armed action, Russian forces took over a military hospital and a missile unit. Reuters correspondents also saw a big Russian convoy on the move just outside the port city of Sevastopol near a Ukrainian air defence base.</p>
<p>It comprised more than 100 vehicles, including around 20 armoured personnel carriers, plus mobile artillery.</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Putin that Russia’s position on Ukraine remained at odds with the West, but US Secretary of State John Kerry had declined an invitation to visit Russia Monday for talks. “It is all being formulated as if there was a conflict between Russia and Ukraine.,” Lavrov told Putin.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">‘Over 250 Ukrainians have gone missing since clashes last year’</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Volodymyr Danyluk was a Soviet Army veteran who joined demonstrations against Ukraine’s government last year. He was 55 years old, separated from his wife and mostly out of contact with his family.</span></p>
<p>Then came the authorities’ crackdown last month in Kiev, the capital. The riot police and demonstrators clashed, scores of people were killed and the government of President Viktor F Yanukovych fell. Danyluk disappeared from sight.</p>
<p>In the weeks since, Ukraine’s interim authorities have allowed opposition members to search prisons, morgues and hospitals for more than 250 missing Ukrainians.</p>
<p>After a season of political upheaval here, a gnawing worry persists: What happened to Ukrainians who seemingly vanished in their revolution’s fast-moving tides? Were they victims of state repression and criminal activity by the police, or had some of them just drifted back to quiet lives?</p>
<p>In all, 661 people have been reported missing since protests began last December, according to Euromaidan S O S, a group leading efforts to find the disappeared. The fates of 272 of them remained unknown late last week.</p>
<p>Many people were found in prison cells or hospitals, or resurfaced on their own.   NYT</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005928&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A senior Tibetan official has rebuffed any suggestion that a compromise could be reached between China and the Dalai Lama as proposed by the founder of Tibet&#8217;s Communist Party, Bapa Phuntso Wangye.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no change in our thinking on the Dalai Lama problem, and we can not make any change on that thinking,&#8221; said Padma Choling, chairman of the Standing Committee of the People&#8217;s Congress of the Tibet autonomous region. Authorities have not changed their policy towards the 14th Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 during an abortive uprising against Chinese rule, state-run China Daily quoted Choling as saying.</p>
<p>Relations between Han and Tibetan people are close and the Dalai Lama manipulated and sabotaged ties, he claimed on the sidelines of the legislature the National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC) here.</p>
<p>Wangye, who worked with Mao Zedong during the formation of People&#8217;s Republic of China, had appealed Chinese leadership to allow the Dalai Lama to return to his homeland and end the strife in Tibet. The 92-year-old guerrilla leader asked the Chinese government to consider a compromise with Dalai Lama in his autobiography &#8220;A Long Way to Equality and Unity&#8221; being published in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wangye, also known as Phunwang, had appealed to former President Hu Jintao and several members of the Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee to &#8220;allow the hundreds of thousands of exiled Tibetan compatriots headed by the Dalai Lama to return home, live and work in peace. &#8220;But Wangye&#8217;s advise has been ignored, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, which quoted excerpts from the book said in its report.</p>
<p>In a chapter titled &#8220;We cannot walk the road towards a Chinese Empire&#8221;, Wangye warned the government in Beijing that it should not rely on violence and economic development to cement its rule over its Tibetan population. He accused the central government of having exacerbated tensions between China&#8217;s Han-majority population and ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The publication of the book coincides with the first annual plenum of the NPC in Beijing. Wangye founded Tibet&#8217;s Communist Party in the 1940s before merging it with Mao Zedong&#8217;s in 1949. He assisted Mao in his early negotiations with the Dalai Lama but was incarcerated in 1958. He was rehabilitated only after Mao&#8217;s death and Deng Xiaoping&#8217;s rise to power in 1978. Wangye has since lived in Beijing.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005878&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A previously-unpublished letter written by physicist Albert Einstein in 1945 to a US soldier where he explains that &#8220;space should be looked at as a four-dimensional continuum&#8221; is up for sale for $ 40,000.</p>
<p>The typed, one-page letter was Einstein&#8217;s reply to Sergeant Frank K Pfleegor and his friends who were puzzled by a scientific article they read and sought to clear up their confusion with the help of the 20th Century genius.</p>
<p>Less than a month after the group wrote a letter to Einstein, he replied. The original letter to Einstein, dated April 17, 1945, has been published and remains in the Einstein Papers at Jerusalem University, FoxNews.com reported.</p>
<p>It was assumed Einstein simply never replied; the letter&#8217;s existence was known only to the Pfleegor family, which has now put it up for sale through the Pennsylvania-based historical document specialists The Raab Collection.</p>
<p>In the letter Einstein wrote, &#8220;Dear Sir: I see from your letter of April 17th that the attempt of my last publication was not reported in an adequate way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not questioned there that space should be looked at as a four-dimensional continuum. The question is only whether the relevant theoretical concepts describing physical properties of this can or will be functions of four variables,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>Einstein&#8217;s letter enlightened Pfleegor and his friends who while in the Philippines during World War II had interpreted a late 1944 article in &#8216;Science Digest&#8217; to suggest the physicist was rethinking his 1915 theory of a four-dimensional universe to say there were as many as eight.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005821&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Taiwan&#8217;s spy chief said on Monday that the island had received a warning of possible terrorist attacks in China as the mainland hold its annual parliamentary session. National Security Bureau head Tsai De-sheng told a legislative committee today that the NSB passed on a warning of planned attacks against the Beijing airport and the city&#8217;s subway system to Chinese authorities following its receipt on March 4.</p>
<p>It comes as China&#8217;s National People&#8217;s Congress holds its annual session, which opened March 5 and closes Thursday. It also came three days after a knife attack by a group of people at a railway station in Kunming, China, left 29 people dead. Police also shot dead four of the attackers.</p>
<p>Tsai said the receipt of the warning prompted stepped up security measures at Taiwanese airports, particularly on Beijing-bound flights.He said it had no connection to a Malaysia Airlines flight bound for Beijing that has been missing since early Saturday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005721&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The ousted president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, is to speak in southern Russia on Monday in his first public statement in over a week, Russian news agencies reported. &#8220;The statement will be made in Rostov-on-Don. The exact time and place will be announced later,&#8221; the agencies cited an unnamed source in his entourage as saying Monday.</p>
<p>There were no further details. The Russian media had printed rumours that Yanukovych, who fled Ukraine after three months of street protests in Kiev turned deadly, was seriously ill in a Moscow hospital after a heart attack. During his last public appearance, at a press conference on February 28 in the same Russian city, a feisty Yanukovych insisted that he was still the legitimate leader of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Puptial knot! A 47-year-old divorced woman in the UK has &#8216;married&#8217; her pet dog because the canine had all the qualities she needed in a life partner. Apparently dismayed by men, Amanda Rodgers, from south London, married her loyal pet terrier called Sheba. The wedding ceremony took place in front of 200 people in Split, Croatia in August 2012, &#8216;Metro&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sheba had been in my life for years, making me laugh and comforting me when I was feeling low,&#8221; Rodgers said. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think of anything more I&#8217;d need from a life partner,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Rodgers had married a man 20 years ago but the relationship ended within a few months, the report said. &#8220;I got down on one knee and proposed. I could tell by her tail wagging that she said &#8216;yes&#8217;,&#8221; Rodgers said, adding she wanted things to be just right this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d dreamed of a perfect wedding dress since I was small, I made it myself for the ceremony. The day was wonderful, more fun than the marriage. I gave her a kiss to seal the deal and then everyone threw confetti. It was a wonderful moment,&#8221; Rodgers added.</p>
<p>Rodgers said the wedding to Sheba may not have been real in the legal sense &#8220;but it was a nice way to mark what Sheba means to me&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005712&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiacryingm.jpg" /></a> Inconsolable relatives of passengers aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines plane. (AP)
<p>The disappearance of a <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/hunt-on-for-malaysia-airlines-stolen-passports-missing-debris-fuel-fears-of-foul-play/" target="_blank">Malaysian jetliner</a> is an &#8220;unprecedented aviation mystery&#8221;, a senior official said on Monday, with a massive air and sea search now in its third day failing to find any confirmed trace of the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/vietnam-plane-spots-possible-wreckage-of-missing-malaysia-airlines/">plane</a> or 239 people aboard.</p>
<p>The head of Malaysia&#8217;s Civil Aviation Authority, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said a hijacking could not be ruled out as investigators explore all theories for the loss of <a title="Malaysia Airlines plane may have turned back before vanishing, says Air force chief" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-plane-may-have-turned-back-before-vanishing-says-air-force-chief/">Malaysia Airlines</a> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/why-malaysia-airlines-jet-might-have-disappeared/">flight MH370</a> en route to Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately we have not found anything that appears to be objects from the aircraft, let alone the aircraft,&#8221; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as we are concerned, we have to find <a title="Timeline of worst plane crashes in recent years" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/world-others/timeline-of-worst-plane-crashes-in-recent-years/" target="_blank">the aircraft</a>, we have to find a piece of the aircraft if possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>As dozens of ships and aircraft from seven countries scour the seas around Malaysia and south of Vietnam, questions mounted over possible security lapses and whether a bomb or hijacking could have brought down the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/timeline-malaysia-airlines-flights-disappearance/">Boeing airliner</a>.</p>
<p>Interpol confirmed on Sunday at least two passengers used stolen passports and said it was checking whether others aboard had used false identity documents.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-has-one-of-asias-best-safety-records/">Flight MH370 </a>disappeared from radar screens in the early hours of Saturday, about an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur, after climbing to a cruising altitude of 35,000 ft (10,670 metres).</p>
<p>A Vietnamese navy plane reported seeing what could have been a piece of the aircraft as darkness fell across the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea on Sunday, but ships and aircraft returning in daylight have so far found nothing.</p>
<p>Underlining the lack of hard information about the plane&#8217;s fate, a US Navy P-3 aircraft capable of covering 1,500 sq miles every hour was sweeping the northern part of the Strait of Malacca on Monday, on the other side of the Malay peninsula from where the last contact with MH370 was made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our aircraft are able to clearly detect small debris in the water, but so far it has all been trash or wood,&#8221; said US 7th Fleet spokesman Commander William Marks in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>Shares in Malaysia Airlines fell as much as 18 percent to a record low on Monday morning.</p>
<p><strong>NO DISTRESS SIGNAL</strong></p>
<p>No distress signal was sent from the lost plane, which experts said suggested a sudden catastrophic failure or explosion, but Malaysia&#8217;s air force chief said radar tracking showed it may have turned back from its scheduled route before it disappeared.</p>
<p>A senior source involved in preliminary investigations in Malaysia said the failure to quickly find any debris indicated the plane may have broken up mid-flight, which could disperse wreckage over a very wide area.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that we are unable to find any debris so far appears to indicate that the aircraft is likely to have disintegrated at around 35,000 feet,&#8221; said the source.<br />
Asked about the possibility of an explosion, such as a bomb, the source said there was no evidence yet of foul play and that the aircraft could have broken up due to mechanical causes.</p>
<p>Still, the source said the closest parallels were the explosion on board an Air India jetliner in 1985 when it was over the Atlantic Ocean and the Lockerbie air disaster in 1988. Both planes were cruising at around 31,000 feet when bombs exploded on board.</p>
<p>The United States extensively reviewed imagery taken by American spy satellites for evidence of a mid-air explosion, but saw none, a US government source said. The source described U.S. satellite coverage of the region as thorough.</p>
<p>Boeing declined to comment and referred to its brief earlier statement that said it was monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>The Boeing 777 has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft in service. Its only previous fatal crash came on July 6 last year when Asiana Airlines flight 214 struck a seawall on landing in San Francisco, killing three people.</p>
<p><strong>MASSIVE SEARCH</strong></p>
<p>About two-thirds of the 227 passengers and 12 crew now presumed to have died aboard the plane were Chinese. The airline said other nationalities included 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French and three Americans.</p>
<p>The passenger manifest issued by the airline included the names of two Europeans &#8211; Austrian Christian Kozel and Italian Luigi Maraldi &#8211; who were not on the plane. Their passports had been stolen in Thailand during the past two years.</p>
<p>An Interpol spokeswoman said a check of all documents used to board the plane had revealed more &#8220;suspect passports&#8221;, which were being investigated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whilst it is too soon to speculate about any connection between these stolen passports and the missing plane, it is clearly of great concern that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol&#8217;s databases,&#8221; Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said.</p>
<p>Malaysia&#8217;s state news agency quoted Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi as saying the two passengers using the stolen European passports were of Asian appearance, and criticised the border officials who let them through.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am still perturbed. Can&#8217;t these immigration officials think? Italian and Austrian but with Asian faces,&#8221; he was quoted as saying late on Sunday.</p>
<p>A European diplomat in Kuala Lumpur cautioned that the Malaysian capital was an Asian hub for illegal migrants, many of whom used false documents and complex routes including via Beijing or West Africa to reach a final destination in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t automatically think that the fact there were two people on the plane with false passports had anything to do with the disappearance of the plane,&#8221; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more you know about the role of Kuala Lumpur in this chain, the more doubtful you are of the chances of a linkage.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005575&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kimjongunm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005544" alt="This is first time the election had been held since Kim Jong Un inherited power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kimjongunm.jpg" /></a> This is first time the election had been held since Kim Jong Un inherited power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011. (AP)
<p>With no one else on the ballot, state media reported Monday that supreme leader Kim Jong Un was not only elected to the highest legislative body in North Korea, he won with the unanimous approval of his district, which had 100 percent turnout.</p>
<p>North Koreans went to the polls on Sunday to approve the new roster of deputies for the Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly, the country&#8217;s legislature. The vote, more a political ritual than an election by Western standards, is generally held once every five years.</p>
<p>Though results for the other seats in the assembly had not yet been announced, North Korea&#8217;s media quickly reported Kim had won in his district located on the symbolic Mount Paekdu without a single dissenting ballot.</p>
<p>In the previous elections, 687 deputies were chosen. This is first time the election had been held since Kim inherited power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011.</p>
<p>This is an expression of all the service personnel and people&#8217;s absolute support and profound trust in supreme leader Kim Jong Un as they single-mindedly remain loyal to him,&#8221; the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.</p>
<p>Voters in the election have no choice who to vote for  there is only one candidate&#8217;s name on the ballot for each district. Instead, they have the choice of voting yes or no, and according to official accounts virtually all choose yes. North Korea also typically puts turnout nationwide at over 99 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts will be closely watching to see if the deputies this time around reflect a generational change as Kim looks to solidify his power and replace older cadres with younger, more loyal ones.</p>
<p>The Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly usually meets only rarely, often only once a year. In practice it has little power and when it is not in session, its work is done by a smaller and more powerful body called the Presidium.</p>
<p>The new parliament was expected to meet next month. No date has been officially announced.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005369&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Officials say a powerful magnitude-6.9 earthquake struck on Sunday night off the coast of northern California, but there was no danger of a tsunami.</p>
<p>The US Geological Survey says the temblor struck at 5:18 GMT about four miles (6 kilometers) beneath the Pacific seabed and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Eureka.</p>
<p>The Humboldt County Sheriff&#8217;s Department, which oversees most of the populated areas near the quake, says there have been no calls about damage or injuries.</p>
<p>USGS seismologist Susan Hoover says more than 300 people have reported feeling the temblor on their website.</p>

<p>Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is back in elected office &#8211; this time in the Senate.</p>
<p>Uribe&#8217;s party was the top vote-getter in the Senate in congressional elections on Sunday in which President Juan Manuel Santos&#8217; governing coalition lost some ground.</p>
<p>Uribe has been a vehement opponent of peace talks with leftist rebels that Santos initiated and hopes to soon conclude successfully.</p>
<p>Uribe&#8217;s new Centro Democratico party looks to have 20 of the Senate&#8217;s 102 seats against at least 47 for Santos&#8217; weakened coalition.</p>
<p>The coalition&#8217;s fate will depend on the Conservatives, who are expected to win 17 seats. It is not yet clear if the Conservatives will stay with Santos or join Uribe.</p>
<p>The left lost ground, meanwhile. It slid from eight Senate seats to five. The Green Alliance held at five seats.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005322&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Here is a timeline of events in the disappearance of a <a title="Vietnam plane spots possible wreckage of missing Malaysian Airline" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/vietnam-plane-spots-possible-wreckage-of-missing-malaysian-airline/" target="_blank">Malaysia Airlines</a> jetliner which vanished from radar screens on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing early on Saturday:</p>
<p><a title="Hunt on for Malaysian Airlines: Stolen passports, missing debris fuels fears of foul play" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/hunt-on-for-malaysian-airlines-stolen-passports-missing-debris-fuel-fears-of-foul-play/" target="_blank">Malaysia Airlines</a> Flight MH370 Flight departs at 12:21 a.m. (1421 GMT Friday), and is due to land in Beijing at 6:30 a.m. (2230 GMT) the same day On board the Boeing 777-200ER are 227 <a title="Kin of Malaysia flight passenger clutch on to hope" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/kin-of-malaysia-flight-passenger-clutch-on-to-hope/" target="_blank">passengers</a> and 12 crew. Airline loses contact with plane between 1-2 hours after takeoff.</p>
<p>No distress signal is given, and weather is clear at the time.</p>
<p><a title="Malaysia Airlines plane may have turned back before vanishing, says Air force chief" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-plane-may-have-turned-back-before-vanishing-says-air-force-chief/" target="_blank">Missing plane</a> last has contact with air traffic controllers 120 nautical miles off the east coast of the Malaysian town of Kota Bharu.</p>
<p>Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) says plane failed to check in as scheduled at 1721 GMT while flying over sea between Malaysia and Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p>Flight tracking website flightaware.com shows <a title="Why Malaysia Airlines jet might have disappeared" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/why-malaysia-airlines-jet-might-have-disappeared/" target="_blank">plane flew</a> northeast over Malaysia after takeoff and climbed to altitude of 35,000 feet. The flight vanished from website&#8217;s tracking records a minute later while still climbing.</p>
<p>Malaysia and Vietnam conduct joint search and rescue operation. China says dispatches two maritime rescue ships to the South China Sea to help in search and rescue. US says also sends ships and plane to help.</p>
<p>Malaysia search ships see no sign of wreckage in area where flights last made contact.</p>
<p>Airline says flight was carrying 154 people from China and Taiwan, 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians and six Australians. Manifest shows other nationalities as being from: India, France, United States, New Zealand, Ukraine, Canada, Russia, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria.</p>
<p>Chinese Premier Li Keqiang calls Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, urges Malaysia quickly and vigorously push search and rescue work. Vietnam says giant oil slick and column of smoke seen in its waters.</p>
<p>Two men from Austria and Italy, listed among the passengers on a missing Malaysia Airlines flight, are not in fact on board. They say their passports were stolen.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines says fears worst and is working with  US company that specialises in disaster recovery.<br />
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board dispatches  team to Asia to help investigate incident. Technical advisers from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing also fly to Asia.</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities investigate identities of at least two other passengers in addition to two who were found to be using stolen passports. Malaysian Transport and Defence Minister says Malaysian investigators meet counterparts from the US FBI.</p>
<p>Radar indicates flight may have turned back from its scheduled route to Beijing before disappearing. Malaysian rescue teams expand their search to the country&#8217;s western coast.</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities pore over CCTV footage and question immigration officers and guards at Kuala Lumpur&#8217;s international airport, concerned that a security breach may be connected to incident.</p>
<p>Interpol says at least two passports recorded as lost or stolen in its database were used by passengers, and it is &#8220;examining additional suspect passports&#8221;.</p>
<p>Malaysia&#8217;s state news agency quotes Home Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi as saying the passengers using the stolen European passports were of Asian appearance.</p>
<p>Investigators narrow focus of inquiries on possibility plane disintegrated in mid-flight, a source who is involved in the investigations in Malaysia tells Reuters.</p>
<p>Vietnamese navy plane spots an object suspected of belonging to the airliners. Too dark to be certain the object is part of plane. More aircraft to be dispatched to investigate the site, in waters off southern Vietnam, in the morning.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005281&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiamourningm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005285 " alt="Family members comfort the parents of Firman Siregar, one of the Indonesian citizens onboard the Malaysia Airlines jetliner flight MH370 that went missing. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiamourningm.jpg" /></a> Family members comfort the parents of Firman Siregar, one of the Indonesian citizens onboard the Malaysia Airlines jetliner flight MH370 that went missing. (AP)
<p>Vietnamese aircraft spotted what they suspected was one of the doors of a missing <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/timeline-malaysia-airlines-flights-disappearance/">Boeing 777</a> on Sunday, while questions emerged about how two<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/anxious-wait-for-kin-of-indians-on-missing-malaysian-plane/"> passengers</a> managed to board the ill-fated aircraft using <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysian-airlines-might-have-disintegrated-mid-air-source/">stolen passports</a>.</p>
<p>Interpol confirmed it knew about the stolen passports but said no authorities checked its vast databases on stolen documents before the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/why-malaysia-airlines-jet-might-have-disappeared/">Boeing jetliner</a> departed Saturday from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people on board.</p>
<p>Warning &#8220;only a handful of countries&#8221; routinely make such checks, Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble chided authorities for &#8220;waiting for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than two days after <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-has-one-of-asias-best-safety-records/">Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370</a> went missing, the final minutes before its disappearance remained a mystery. The plane lost contact with ground controllers somewhere between Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>However, searchers in a low-flying plane spotted an object that appeared to be one of the plane&#8217;s doors, the state-run Thanh Nien newspaper said, citing the deputy chief of staff of Vietnam&#8217;s army, Lt. Gen. Vo Van Tuan.</p>
<p>Two ships from the maritime police were headed to the site about 60 miles (90 kilometers) south of Tho Chu island in the Gulf of Thailand, the same area where oil slicks were spotted Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;From this object, hopefully (we) will find the missing plane,&#8221; Tuan said.</p>
<p>The jetliner apparently fell from the sky at cruising altitude in fine weather, and the pilots were either unable or had no time to send a distress signal &#8211; unusual circumstances under which a modern jetliner operated by a professional airline would crash.</p>
<p>Authorities were checking on the identities of the two passengers who boarded the plane with stolen passports. On Saturday, the foreign ministries in Italy and Austria said the names of two citizens listed on the flight&#8217;s manifest matched the names on two passports reported stolen in Thailand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can confirm that we have the visuals of these two people on CCTV,&#8221; Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference late Sunday, adding that the footage was being examined.  &#8220;We have intelligence agencies, both local and international, on board.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thefts of the two passports &#8211; one belonging to Austrian Christian Kozel and the other to Luigi Maraldi of Italy &#8211; were entered into Interpol&#8217;s database after they were stolen in Thailand in 2012 and last year, the police body said.</p>
<p>Electronic booking records show that one-way tickets with those names were issued Thursday from a travel agency in the beach resort of Pattaya in eastern Thailand. A person who answered the phone at the agency said she could not comment.</p>
<p>But no authorities in Malaysia or elsewhere checked the passports against the database of 40 million stolen or lost travel documents before the Malaysian Airlines plane took off.</p>
<p>In a forceful statement, the Interpol chief said he hoped &#8220;that governments and airlines worldwide will learn from the tragedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, we have a real case where the world is speculating whether the stolen passport holders were terrorists,&#8221; Noble said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Details also emerged Sunday about the itineraries of the two passengers traveling on the stolen passports.</p>
<p>A telephone operator on a China-based KLM hotline confirmed Sunday that passengers named Maraldi and Kozel had been booked on one-way tickets on the same KLM flight, flying from Beijing to Amsterdam on Saturday.</p>
<p>Maraldi was to fly on to Copenhagen, Denmark, and Kozel to Frankfurt, Germany.</p>
<p>She said the pair booked the tickets through China Southern Airlines, but she had no information on where they bought them.</p>
<p>As holders of EU passports with onward flights to Europe, the passengers would not have needed visas for China.</p>
<p>Interpol said it and national investigators were working to determine the true identities of those who used the stolen passports to board the flight.</p>
<p>White House Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said the U.S. was looking into the stolen passports, but that investigators had reached no conclusions.</p>
<p>Interpol has long sounded the alarm that growing international travel has underpinned a new market for identity theft: Bogus passports are mostly used by illegal immigrants, but also pretty much anyone looking to travel unnoticed such as drug runners or terrorists.</p>
<p>More than 1 billion times last year, travelers boarded planes without their passports being checked against Interpol&#8217;s database of 40 million stolen or lost travel documents, the police agency said.</p>
<p>Possible causes of the crash included some sort of explosion, a catastrophic failure of the plane&#8217;s engines, extreme turbulence, or pilot error or even suicide.</p>
<p>Establishing what happened with any certainty will need data from flight recorders and a detailed examination of any debris, something that will take months if not years.</p>
<p>Malaysia&#8217;s air force chief, Rodzali Daud, said radar indicated that before it disappeared, the plane may have turned back, but there were no further details on which direction it went or how far it veered off course.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to make sense of this, &#8220;Daud said at a news conference. &#8220;The military radar indicated that the aircraft may have made a turn back, and in some parts this was corroborated by civilian radar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said pilots are supposed to inform the airline and traffic control authorities if the plane does a U-turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;From what we have, there was no such distress signal or distress call per se, so we are equally puzzled,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A total of 34 aircraft and 40 ships from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Singapore, Indonesia, China and the United States were deployed to the area where ground controllers lost contact with the plane on the maritime border between Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board, two-thirds were Chinese, while the rest were from elsewhere in Asia, Europe and North America, including three Americans.</p>
<p>Family members of Philip Wood, a 50-year-old IBM executive who was on board the plane, said they saw him a week ago when he visited them in Texas after relocating to Kuala Lumpur from Beijing, where he had worked for two years.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a shock, a very surreal moment in your life,&#8221; said Wood&#8217;s brother, James Wood.</p>
<p>The other two Americans were identified on the passenger manifest as 4-year-old Nicole Meng and 2-year-old Yan Zhang. It was not known with whom they were traveling.</p>
<p>After more than 30 hours without contact with the aircraft, Malaysia Airlines told family members they should &#8220;prepare themselves for the worst,&#8221; Hugh Dunleavy, the commercial director for the airline, told reporters.</p>
<p>Finding traces of an aircraft that disappears over sea can take days or longer, even with a sustained search effort. Depending on the circumstances of the crash, wreckage can be scattered over a large area. If the plane enters the water before breaking up, there can be relatively little debris.</p>
<p>A team of American experts was en route to Asia to be ready to assist in the investigation into the crash. The team includes accident investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, as well as technical experts from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing, the safety board said in a statement.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines has a good safety record, as does the 777, which had not had a fatal crash in its 19-year history until an Asiana Airlines plane crashed last July in San Francisco, killing three passengers, all Chinese teenagers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005280&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/acc.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005244" alt="Family members comfort the parents of an Indonesian citizen aboard the flight. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/acc.jpg" /></a> Family members comfort the parents of an Indonesian citizen aboard the flight. (AP)
<p>Numbered 1 to 227, the passenger manifest for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet is an outwardly unremarkable document.</p>
<p>But behind the columns of capitalised names, nationalities and ages are 227 unique stories, part of a rich human tapestry that assembles every time a flight departs. There were middle-aged Australians with wanderlust, an acclaimed Chinese calligrapher, a young Indonesian man heading to begin a new career, and two people travelling on stolen passports.</p>
<p>More than a day and a half has passed since the Boeing 777 disappeared from radar screens in the first hour of a six-hour flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. From France to Australia and China, families and friends are enduring an agonising wait for news about Flight MH370.</p>
<p>The flight had a crew of 12, all from Malaysia, a melting pot nation of ethnic Malays, Chinese and Indians. Passengers on the popular business and tourist route were mostly from China and Malaysia, along with smatterings of people from other corners of the world: Americans, Australians, Indians, French, Indonesians, Ukrainians and other nationalities.</p>
<p>Some travelled alone, some in groups. They were young sweethearts and wrinkled older couples. Some had business in mind, others thought of art. Seventy-four years separates the youngest, 2-year-old Moheng Wang, and the oldest, 76-year-old Rusheng Liu.</p>
<p>“I can only pray for a miracle,’’ said Daniel Liau, the organiser of a calligraphic and painting exhibition in Malaysia attended by acclaimed Chinese calligrapher Meng Gaosheng, who boarded the flight with 18 other artists plus six family members and four staff.  “I feel very sad. Even though I knew them for a short time, they have become my friends,’’ Liau said.</p>
<p>Also travelling as a group were eight Chinese and 12 Malaysian employees of Austin, Texas, semiconductor company Freescale, which said it was assembling “around-the-clock support’’ for their families.</p>
<p>For seasoned Australian travellers Robert Lawton, 58, and his wife, Catherine, 54, the seemingly routine takeoff of flight MH370 was the beginning of another adventure. “They mentioned in passing they were going on another big trip and they were really excited,’’ Caroline Daintith, a neighbor, told Australian Broadcasting Corp television of the couple described as doting grandparents.</p>
<p>Sharing their adventure was another 50-something Australian couple, Rodney and Mary Burrows. Neighbour Don Stokes said the trip was intended as the beginning of the “next step in their life.’’</p>
<p>Among the family groups on board were teenage sweethearts Hadrien Wattrelos, 17, and Zhao Yan, 18, students at a French school in Beijing who were returning from the Malaysian leg of a two-week holiday along with Hadrien’s mother and younger sister.</p>
<p>In December, Zhao changed her Facebook profile photo to one of her and Hadrien. He had commented: “Je t’aime,’’ followed by a heart, and she had “liked’’ his comment.<br />
Some boarded the plane with more serious purposes in mind.</p>
<p>Colleagues of Chandrika Sharma said the 50-year-old director of the Chennai chapter of an organisation that works with fishermen was on her way from the southern Indian city to Mongolia for a Food and Agriculture Organization conference.  “There must still be hope,’’ said a colleague.</p>
<p>For 24-year-old Firman Chandra Siregar from Medan, Indonesia, the flight was a new chapter. In Beijing, he was to start a three-year contract with Schlumberger, an oilfield services company.</p>
<p>Dozens of relatives and neighbours gathered at his family’s home, some tearful, praying or watching news of the search and rescue operation. Like Sharma’s colleagues, they were forced to let hope ebb away.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005240&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Officials investigating the disappearance of a <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-plane-may-have-turned-back-before-vanishing-says-air-force-chief/">Malaysia Airlines jetliner</a> with 239 people on board suspect it may have disintegrated in mid-flight, a senior source said Sunday, as <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/vietnam-plane-spots-possible-wreckage-of-missing-malaysian-airline/">Vietnam </a>reported a possible sighting of one of the plane’s doors.</span></p>
<p>International police agency Interpol confirmed that at least two passports recorded in its database as lost or stolen were used by <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/anxious-wait-for-kin-of-indians-on-missing-malaysian-plane/">passengers</a> on the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-has-one-of-asias-best-safety-records/">flight</a>, raising suspicions of foul play.</p>
<p>An Interpol spokeswoman said a check of all documents used to board the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/timeline-malaysia-airlines-flights-disappearance/">plane</a> had revealed more “suspect passports” that were being further investigated. She was unable to say how many, or from which country or countries.</p>
<p>Nearly 48 hours after the last contact with <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/why-malaysia-airlines-jet-might-have-disappeared/">Flight MH370</a>, mystery still surrounded its fate. Malaysia’s air force chief said the Beijing-bound airliner may have turned back from its scheduled route before it vanished from radar screens.</p>
<p>Searchers in a low-flying Vietnamese plane spotted what appeared to be a door from the missing jet, the deputy chief of staff of Vietnam’s army, Lt Gen Vo Van Tuan, was quoted as saying by the state-run Thanh Nien newspaper. It was found in waters about 90 km south of Tho Chu island, in the same area where oil slicks were spotted Saturday. “From this object, hopefully (we) will find the missing plane,” Tuan said.</p>
<p>“The fact that we are unable to find any debris so far appears to indicate that the aircraft is likely to have disintegrated at around 35,000 feet,” a source involved in the investigations in Malaysia told Reuters.</p>
<p>If the plane had plunged intact from close to its cruising altitude, breaking up only <span style="line-height:1.5em;">on impact with the water, search teams would have expected to find a fairly concentrated pattern of debris, said the source.</span></p>
<p>Asked about the possibility of an explosion, such as a bomb, the source said there was no evidence yet of foul play and the aircraft could have broken up due to mechanical causes.</p>
<p>Dozens of military and civilian vessels have been criss-crossing waters beneath the aircraft’s flight path, but have found no confirmed trace of the lost plane, although oil slicks have been reported in the sea south of Vietnam and east of Malaysia.</p>
<p>Late on Sunday, the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam said on its website that a Vietnamese navy plane had spotted an object in the sea suspected of being part of the plane, but that it was too dark to be certain. Search planes were set to return to investigate the suspected debris at daybreak.</p>
<p>“The outcome so far is there is no sign of the aircraft,” Malaysian civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman told reporters. “On the possibility of hijack, we are not ruling out any possibility.”</p>
<p>Malaysian authorities said they were widening the search to cover vast swathes of sea around Malaysia and off Vietnam, and were investigating at least two passengers who were using false identity documents.</p>
<p>The passenger manifest issued by the airline included the names of two Europeans — Austrian Christian Kozel and Italian Luigi Maraldi — who, according to their foreign ministries, were not on the plane. Both had apparently had their passports stolen in Thailand during the past two years.</p>
<p>The BBC reported that the men falsely using their passports had purchased tickets together and were due to fly on to Europe from Beijing, meaning they did not have to apply for a Chinese visa and undergo further checks.</p>
<p>An employee at a travel agency in Pattaya, in Thailand, told Reuters the two had purchased the tickets there.</p>
<p>Interpol maintains a vast database of more than 40 million lost and stolen travel documents, and has long urged member countries to make greater use of it to stop people crossing borders on false papers.</p>
<p>The global police organisation confirmed that Kozel’s and Maraldi’s passports had both been added to the database after their theft in 2012 and 2013 respectively. But it said no country had consulted the database to check either of them since the time they were stolen.</p>
<p>“Whilst it is too soon to speculate about any connection between these stolen passports and the missing plane, it is clearly of great concern that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol’s databases,” Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble said in a statement.</p>
<p>In a sign that Malaysia’s airport controls may have been breached, Prime Minister Najib Razak said security procedures were being reviewed.</p>
<p>Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein said authorities were also checking the identities of two other passengers. He said help was also being sought from the US FBI. “We are looking at all possibilities,” he said. “We cannot jump the gun. Our focus now is to find the plane.”</p>
<p>The 11-year-old Boeing 777-200ER, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent engines, took off at 12.40 am on Saturday from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, with 227 passengers and 12 crew on board. It last had contact with air traffic controllers 120 nautical miles off the east coast of the Malaysian town of Kota Bharu. Flight tracking website flightaware.com showed it flew northeast after takeoff, climbed to 35,000 ft and was still climbing when it vanished from tracking records.</p>
<p>There were no reports of bad weather.</p>
<p>“What we have done is actually look into the recording on the radar that we have and we realised there is a possibility the aircraft did make a turnback,” Rodzali Daud, the Royal Malaysian Air Force chief, told reporters.</p>
<p>The airline has said 14 nationalities were among the passengers, including at least 152 Chinese, 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French and three Americans.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004912&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>As separatists in Crimea kept up pressure for unification with Moscow, Ukraine on Sunday solemnly commemorated the 200th anniversary of the birth of its greatest poet, with the prime minister vowing not to give up &#8220;a single centimetre&#8221; of Ukrainian territory.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our land,&#8221; Arseniy Yatsenyuk told a crowd gathered at the Kiev statue to writer and nationalist Taras Shevchenko. &#8220;Our fathers and grandfathers have spilled their blood for this land. And we won&#8217;t budge a single centimetre from Ukrainian land. Let Russia and its president know this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are one country, one family and we&#8217;re here together with our kobzar (bard) Taras,&#8221; said acting President Oleksandr  Turchynov. A choir sang, and people laid bouquets at the monument to the son of peasant serfs who is considered the father of modern Ukrainian literature and is a national hero.</p>
<p>Later on Sunday, following an extraordinary meeting of the Ukrainian government, Yatsenyuk announced he would be flying this week to the United States for high-level talks on &#8220;resolution of the situation in Ukraine,&#8221; the Interfax news agency reported.</p>
<p>Crimea, a strategic peninsula in southern Ukraine, has become the flashpoint in the battle for Ukraine, where three months of protests sparked by President Victor Yanukovych&#8217;s decision to ditch a significant treaty with the 28-nation European Union after strong pressure from Russia led to his downfall.</p>
<p>A majority of people in Crimea identify with Russia, and Moscow&#8217;s Black Sea Fleet is based in Sevastopol, as is Ukraine&#8217;s. This weekend, Russia reinforced its armed presence on the peninsula. Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s foreign minister ruled out any dialogue with Ukraine&#8217;s new authorities, whom he dismissed as the puppets of extremists.</p>
<p>The regional parliament in Crimea has set a March 16 referendum on leaving Ukraine to join Russia. Senior lawmakers in Moscow have said they would support the move, ignoring sanctions threats and warnings from President Barack Obama that the vote would violate international law.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004906&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russian activists Sunday attacked a pro-Kiev rally in Crimea with clubs and whips as thousands took to the streets across Ukraine in rival demonstrations, escalating separatist tensions in the troubled ex-Soviet state.</p>
<p>Interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk vowed Ukraine would not cede &#8220;an inch&#8221; of its territory to Moscow after Russian forces and pro-Kremlin gunmen took over the Black Sea peninsula.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our land,&#8221; Yatsenyuk told a crowd of several thousand in the capital that was also attended by Russian former oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent a decade in prison in Russia and is a top critic of President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>The standoff in Crimea has set Europe and the United States against Russia over Ukraine&#8217;s future in the worst East-West confrontation since the Cold War.</p>
<p>Illustrating the divisions in Ukraine, interim president Oleksandr Turchynov led a minute of silence at the Kiev rally for demonstrators killed in three months of protests that led to the ouster of pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the eastern city of Donetsk pro-Moscow activists paid tribute to a feared riot police unit accused of shooting at protesters in clashes in Kiev that left around 100 dead late last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia! Russia!&#8221; the activists waving Russian flags shouted in Donetsk, the heartland of the former president, who fled to Russia after his overthrow.</p>
<p>In the Crimean capital Simferopol, hundreds of protesters took part in separate rallies for Ukrainian unity and for joining Russia that passed off peacefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;They cannot seize Crimea, (it&#8217;s an) illegal occupation,&#8221; said Svyatoslav Regushevsky, a 46-year-old who attended the unity rally with his two-year-old son, wearing a ski jacket in the colours of the Ukrainian flag.</p>
<p>Around 1,000 people were at that demonstration, while some 10,000 turned out for the rival one on Lenin Square across town where a sea of Russian tricolours could be seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be with those Ukrainian fascists any more,&#8221; said Olga, 60, who declined to give her surname, while around her placards read &#8220;Crimea is not in Ukraine&#8221; and &#8220;With Russia, Peace in Crimea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pro-Russian lawmakers in the region are planning a referendum next Sunday on becoming part of the Russian Federation, a move that has been dismissed as &#8220;illegitimate&#8221; by the new Western-backed government in Kiev.</p>
<p>The rallies come after a new marathon round of phone calls by US President Barack Obama seeking to defuse the standoff with Russia, with each side imposing sanctions or warning of further prohibitive measures to force the other to back down.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004889&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sergey-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004828" alt="Crimean Premier Sergei Aksyonov, right, attends the swearing in ceremony for the first unit of a pro-Russian armed force, dubbed the &quot;military forces of the autonomous republic of Crimea&quot; in Simferopol, Ukraine.

(AP) 
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Two weeks ago, Sergey Aksyonov was a small-time Crimean politician, the leader of a tiny pro-Russia political party that could barely summon 4 percent of the votes in the last regional election. He was a little-known businessman with a murky past and a nickname — &#8220;Goblin&#8221; — left over from the days when criminal gangs flourished here after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</span></p>
<div>
<p>Times have changed.</p>
<p>Today, Aksyonov is the prime minister of Crimea&#8217;s regional government and the public face of Russia&#8217;s seizure of the Black Sea peninsula. He is, by all appearances, a man placed in power by Moscow who is now working hard to make Crimea a part of Russia.</p>
<p>He also leads a brand-new army, 30 men carrying AK-47s who are still learning to march in formation. &#8220;Commander!&#8221; they greeted him Saturday, when they were sworn into service in a Simferopol park.</p>
<p>Speaking at the ceremony, the former semi-professional boxer said that while Crimea&#8217;s March 16 referendum would make the peninsula a part of Russia, he holds no grudge against Ukraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not enemies with those soldiers who pledged loyalty to the Ukrainian state,&#8221; he said, referring to the soldiers now barricaded into bases across Crimea, unsure what will happen to them. They will be allowed to leave for Ukraine if they wish, he said.</p>
<p>He is, he insisted, a peacemaker.</p>
<p>But the people of Simferopol remember Aksyonov by his 1990s name, &#8220;Goblin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t a criminal big shot,&#8221; said Andriy Senchenko, now a member of Ukraine&#8217;s Batkivshchyna party, which was at the forefront of the Kiev protests that led last month to the downfall of pro-Russia President Viktor Yanukovych. Senchenko described Aksyonov as a &#8220;brigade leader&#8221; in a gang that was often involved in extortion rackets.</p>
<p>While Senchenko is not unbiased — his party opposes Aksyonov&#8217;s push for Crimea to become part of Russia — the editor of the region&#8217;s main pro-Russian newspaper, Crimean Truth, also accused Aksyonov of being in a criminal gang. Mikhail Bakharev made the allegations five years ago, when Aksyonov first emerged on Crimea&#8217;s political scene.</p>
<p>Aksyonov, who denies the allegations, sued Bakharev for defamation and won, but a higher court later dismissed the case against the editor.</p>
<p>Today, with Aksyonov at the center of Crimean politics, and with the Russian soldiers who back him deployed across the peninsula, Bakharev now insists he was mistaken.</p>
<p>The stories about a criminal past &#8220;were just his enemies attacking him,&#8221; Bakharev said during an interview, shifting nervously and clearly unhappy to be discussing the topic. He said further investigations showed Aksyonov had no ties to criminal gangs.</p>
<p>He now counts himself as an ardent Aksyonov supporter, calling him &#8220;a confident and brave person who is not afraid to take responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crimea has been swept into turmoil over the past two weeks, as Moscow, furious over the fall of Yanukovych and the pro-Western outlook of the new government, used hundreds of Russian soldiers to seize political control of the peninsula. The Russian soldiers — who Moscow insists are members of a Crimean self-defense force that Aksyonov created last year — ringed the regional parliament. Then, with armed soldiers inside the chamber, Aksyonov was named prime minister.</p>
<p>His critics say it&#8217;s clear that Aksyonov is simply a puppet, someone installed by Moscow to ease what has become, in effect, a Russian takeover of its former territory.</p>
<p>&#8220;If six months ago someone would have told me that Aksyonov would become prime minister, I would have laughed,&#8221; said Valentina Tsamar, a prominent Simferopol journalist with the TV channel Chernomorskaya.</p>
<p>It was a sudden rise to power for Aksyonov, who didn&#8217;t go into politics until 2009 when he united three pro-Russian organizations into the Russian Unity party.</p>
<p>The party reached out to Crimea&#8217;s large Russian-speaking population with political advertisements that compared anti-Yanukovych protesters to Nazis and promised a golden age for Crimea replete with vineyards, jobs and well-off tourists.</p>
<p>He also insisted he had no intention of splitting off from Ukraine. Just three weeks ago, he told The Associated Press in an interview that the party &#8220;has never wanted Crimea to separate from Ukraine.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the advertisements did little good. Russian Unity&#8217;s rallies were notable for their paltry turnouts, and it took just 4 percent of the votes in the 2010 elections.</p>
<p>Local journalists say Aksyonov first emerged on the political scene with the backing of Vladimir Konstantinov, the speaker of Crimea&#8217;s parliament and a prominent builder now embroiled in scandals over unpaid bank loans and failed construction projects. Konstantinov&#8217;s company, Konsul, collected money from Ukrainians to build homes but never finished the projects, according to reporters who have looked into the deals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now these people have no apartment, and no money,&#8221; said Sergey Mokrushin, an investigative journalists with Chernomorskaya who spent months examining Konstantinov&#8217;s finances.</p>
<p>Official investigations, though, never apparently began. Members of the parliament are immune from prosecution, and Konstantinov&#8217;s powerful ties to the now-ousted Ukrainian ruling party meant investigations could be easily stalled.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s untouchable,&#8221; Mokrushin said.</p>
<p>He does, however, have supporters.</p>
<p>Gennady Ivanchenkov, a 56-year-old Simferopol economist, said he&#8217;s impressed with Aksyonov&#8217;s leadership in such a tumultuous time. As for Aksyonov&#8217;s past, he isn&#8217;t sure the &#8220;Goblin&#8221; stories are true, and even if they are he isn&#8217;t worried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those pages of his life, they are not relevant,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You know, the &#8217;90s were such dark times and now I can only judge him by what he&#8217;s doing now.&#8221;</p>

(Indian Express)
<p>A senior Pakistani prosecutor, who is in-charge of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks case and the Benazir Bhutto murder case, has sought security as his life is under threat.</p>
<p>Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) special prosecutor Mohammad Azhar Chaudhry did not turn up on Saturday for a hearing in the case related to the killing of the former prime minister citing security concerns.</p>
<p>The case, hearing of which has been postponed to March 22, was being heard by Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) judge Pervez<br />
Joya within the premises of the Adiyala prison in Rawalpindi.</p>
<p>Court officials told PTI that Chaudhry has moved an application seeking security arrangements for himself. They, however, did not elaborate on the exact kind of threats. The News daily on Sunday reported that in the last hearing, Azhar had told the court that the Punjab government had &#8220;withdrawn&#8221; his security despite being aware that he had received life threats.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am facing security threats. If I am not provided with the required security, I will disassociate myself from this case,&#8221; he had informed the court. The FIA prosecutor told the court that he was contesting a high-profile case on behalf of the State, but the State was not providing him with any security.</p>
<p>Azhar, who took over as special prosecutor in the case last year, assumed the position after his predecessor Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali was shot dead in Islamabad in May. The lawyer is also the prosecution chief in the Mumbai terror attacks case, in which LeT commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi is one of the seven accused.</p>
<p>In Pakistan&#8217;s high-profile criminal and terror-related cases, the job of prosecutors as well as of the defence counsels is perilous. The recent terror attack on the Islamabad Local Court has raised concerns among the lawyer community.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Mumbai case court is also based in the same premises though the hearings are mostly held at the Adiyala jail.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004811&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/taxi-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004802 " alt="Meera Joshi had most recently served as the agency's General Counsel under former mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/taxi-480.jpg" /></a> Meera Joshi had most recently served as the agency&#8217;s General Counsel under former mayor Michael Bloomberg. (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">An Indian-origin woman has been nominated by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio to lead the city&#8217;s crucial taxi and limousine agency, which regulates the city&#8217;s expansive network of yellow and green taxis and livery cabs.</span></p>
<p>Meera Joshi, nominated to serve as Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of the New York City Taxi and Limousine<br />
Commission (TLC), had most recently served as the agency&#8217;s General Counsel under former mayor Michael Bloomberg&#8217;s<br />
administration, a statement issued by the mayor&#8217;s office said.</p>
<p>Her nomination has to be approved by the City Council. A University of Pennsylvania alumnus, Joshi has worked in the city government for more than a decade. As General Counsel at the TLC, she supported the regulation of more than 160,000 licensees and personally oversaw a portfolio of initiatives that have brought new cab services to New Yorkers.</p>
<p>She has also prosecuted financial injustices against victimised taxi drivers. Joshi was also instrumental in the city’s commitment to 50 per cent wheelchair accessibility by 2020, and the requirement that all taxicabs be crash-tested to federal standards by the end of 2014.</p>
<p>The Mayor described Joshi as a &#8220;dedicated public servant&#8221; with the experience and energy to move the city&#8217;s Taxi and<br />
Limousine Commission in a progressive direction, &#8220;ensuring we prioritise New Yorkers&#8217; safety.&#8221; Joshi termed her nomination an &#8220;honour&#8221; and said she is committed to the de Blasio administration&#8217;s agenda of providing equitable taxi and for-hire transportation services and safe streets for all New Yorkers.</p>
<p>Joshi&#8217;s nomination got support from the city&#8217;s taxi workers&#8217; unions. The New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers expressed confidence that the group would work with Joshi in &#8220;ensuring the city’s thousands of drivers are treated fairly and that the taxi industry continues to be a beacon of economic opportunity for New Yorkers and their families.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meera Joshi&#8217;s sense of justice was evident in everything the TLC did to protect drivers from financial predators,&#8221; said<br />
New York Taxi Workers Alliance Organizer Bhairavi Desai. Joshi is the latest Indian-origin official to be named to<br />
serve in de Blasio&#8217;s administration.</p>
<p>Earlier, Indian-origin lawyer Nisha Agarwal had been appointed as head of immigrant affairs in Mayor&#8217;s office. Last month eminent Indian-American physician Ramanathan Raju was appointed by de Blasio as New York City&#8217;s Commissioner of Health and Hospitals Corporation, a network which has a dozen hospitals.</p>
<p>Rahul Merchant is New York City’s first Citywide Chief Information and Innovation Officer (CIIO). Meenakshi Srinivasan is the Chair of the Board of Standards and Appeals.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004797&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/iraq-blast-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004794" alt="People inspect the site of a car bomb explosion in Baghdad's northern Qahirah neighborhood, Iraq.

<p>A suicide car bomber set off his explosive-laden vehicle at a security checkpoint Sunday in southern Iraq, the deadliest of a series of attacks that killed 42 people, officials said. The violence, which comes a few weeks before scheduled elections, is the latest by insurgents bent on destabilizing the country.</p>
<p>The blast struck the entrance of the city of Hillah during morning rush hour as dozens of cars waited to be searched. The explosion killed 21 civilians, including a woman and 12 year old, and 15 security personnel, two police officers said. It wounded at least 115, they said.</p>
<p>The bombing set dozens of cars ablaze, killing those trapped inside. Debris littered the ground, covered by foam sprayed by firefighters trying to extinguish the fire.</p>
<p>Police say the victims&#8217; burns suggested the bomber packed his car with liquid fuel, probably gasoline.</p>
<p>Hillah, a Shiite-dominated city, is located about 60 miles (95 kilometers) south of the capital, Baghdad.</p>
<p>Elsewhere Sunday, militants launched attacks just outside the capital against security forces and employees of the state-run oil company, killing six people, police said. They said the assaults wounded 16.</p>
<p>Medical officials confirmed the casualty figures for all the attacks. All officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release the information.</p>
<p>Iraq has seen a spike in violence since last April, with the death toll climbing to its highest levels since the worst of the country&#8217;s sectarian bloodletting in 2006-2008. The U.N. says 8,868 people were killed in 2013, and more than 1,400 people were killed in January and February of this year.</p>
<p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but they bore the hallmarks of an al-Qaida breakaway group that frequently uses car bombs and suicide attacks to target public areas and government buildings in their bid to undermine confidence in the government.</p>
<p>Iraq is to hold its first parliamentary elections since the U.S. troops&#8217; withdrawal in late 2011 in April.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004792&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Afghan Vice President Marshal Mohammad Qasim Fahim, formerly one of the country&#8217;s much-feared warlords, has died of natural causes, officials said on Sunday, adding that three days of national mourning would be held.</span></p>
<p>Fahim, a leader of the Tajik ethnic minority, served as senior vice president to President Hamid Karzai, who is due to step down at elections next month as NATO combat forces pull out of Afghanistan after 13 years of fighting the Taliban.</p>
<p>Aged 56, Fahim was accused of being a ruthless strongman who maintained his own militia forces, but he also received<br />
American support as Afghanistan sought stability after the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. &#8220;With deep sadness, the 1st vice president, Marshal M Q Fahim has passed away. May his soul rest in peace,&#8221; presidential spokesman Aimal Faizi said on his Twitter account.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government of Afghanistan has called for a three-day national mourning, during which the national flag will be<br />
half-hoisted for his demise.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004783&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Military radar indicates that the missing <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-signals-missing-plane-carrying-239-including-5-indians-has-crashed/">Boeing 777</a> jet turned back before vanishing, Malaysia&#8217;s air force chief said Sunday as authorities were investigating up to four <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/mumbai-family-on-ill-fated-flight-was-headed-to-china-for-sons-convocation/">passengers</a> with suspicious identifications who may have boarded the flight.</p>

<p>The revelations add to the uncertainties surrounding the final minutes of <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/why-malaysia-airlines-jet-might-have-disappeared/">flight MH370</a>, which was carrying 239 people when it lost contact with ground controllers somewhere between Malaysia and Vietnam after leaving Kuala Lumpur early Saturday morning for Beijing.</p>
<p>A massive international sea search has so far turned up no trace of the<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-has-one-of-asias-best-safety-records/"> plane</a>, which lost contact with the ground when  the weather was fine, the plane was already cruising and the pilots didn&#8217;t send a distress signal &#8211; unusual circumstance for a modern jetliner operated by a professional airline to crash.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiaprayers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004778" alt="MALAYSIAPRAYERS" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiaprayers.jpg?w=475&#038;h=263" width="475" height="263" /></a></p>
<p>Vietnamese air force jets spotted two large oil slicks Saturday, but it was unclear if they were linked to the missing plane, and no debris was found nearby.</p>
<p>Air force chief Rodzali Daud didn&#8217;t say which direction the plane might have taken or how long for when it apparently went off route.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiarescue.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004782" alt="MALAYSIARESCUE" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiarescue.jpg?w=475&#038;h=315" width="475" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to make sense of this,&#8221; he told a media conference. &#8220;The military radar indicated that the aircraft may have made a turn back and in some parts, this was corroborated by civilian radar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said pilots were supposed to inform the airline and traffic control authorities if the plane does a U-turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;From what we have, there was no such distress signal or distress call per se, so we are equally puzzled,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the jet&#8217;s passengers were Chinese. The rest were from elsewhere in Asia, North America and Europe.</p>
<p>After more than 30 hours without contact with the aircraft, Malaysia Airlines told family members they should &#8220;prepare themselves for the worst,&#8221; Hugh Dunleavy, the commercial director for the airline told reporters.</p>
<p>Authorities were checking on the suspect identities of at least two passengers who appear to have boarded with stolen passports. On Saturday, the foreign ministries in Italy and Austria said the names of two citizens listed on the flight&#8217;s manifest matched the names on two passports reported stolen in Thailand.</p>
<p>This, and the sudden disappearance of the plane that experts say is consistent with a possible onboard explosion, strengthened existing concerns about terrorism as a possible cause for the disappearance. Al-Qaida militants have used similar tactics to try and disguise their identities.</p>
<p>Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said that authorities were looking at two more possible cases of suspicious identities. He said Malaysian intelligence agencies were in contact with their international counterparts, including the FBI. He gave no more details.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the four names are with me and have been given to our intelligence agencies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We are looking at all possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>A total of 22 aircraft and 40 ships have been deployed to the area by Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, China and the United States, not counting Vietnam&#8217;s fleet.</p>
<p>Finding traces of an aircraft that disappears over sea can take days or longer, even with a sustained search effort. Depending on the circumstances of the crash, wreckage can be scattered over many square kilometers (miles). If the plane enters the water before breaking up, there can be relatively little debris.</p>
<p>A team of American experts was en route to Asia to be ready to assist in the investigation into the crash. The team includes accident investigators from National Transportation Safety Board, as well as technical experts from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing, the safety board said in a statement.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines has a good safety record, as does the 777, which had not had a fatal crash in its 19-year history until an Asiana Airlines plane crashed last July in San Francisco, killing three passengers, all Chinese teenagers.</p>
<p>Investigators will need access to the flight data recorders to determine what happened.</p>
<p>Aviation and terrorism experts said revelations about stolen passports would strengthen speculation of foul play. They also acknowledged other scenarios, including some catastrophic failure of the engines or structure of the plane, extreme turbulence or pilot error or even suicide, were also possible.</p>
<p>Jason Middleton, the head of the Sydney-based University of New South Wales&#8217; School of Aviation, said terrorism or some other form of foul play seemed a likely explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking at some highly unexpected thing, and the only ones people can think of are basically foul play, being either a bomb or some immediate incapacitating of the pilots by someone doing the wrong thing and that might lead to an airplane going straight into the ocean,&#8221; Middleton said.</p>
<p>&#8220;With two stolen passports (on board), you&#8217;d have to suspect that that&#8217;s one of the likely options.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just 9 percent of fatal accidents happen when a plane is at cruising altitude, according to a statistical summary of commercial jet accidents done by Boeing. Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said Saturday there was no indication the pilots had sent a distress signal.</p>
<p>The plane was last inspected 10 days ago and found to be &#8220;in proper condition,&#8221; Ignatius Ong, CEO of Malaysia Airlines subsidiary Firefly airlines, said at a news conference.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004741&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">An Art of Living yoga centre on the outskirts of the Pakistani capital has been set afire, allegedly by unknown miscreants, police said. The centre, which is based in Peace Street in Bani Gala area, was set on fire last evening after some people reportedly entered the premises asking for money, Islamabad police sources told PTI.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There were just two guards there. Around eight people came and asked where the money was kept. On told that they didn&#8217;t know, the guards were tied up and the building was set on fire,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>The culprits fled the scene after the incident. However, Meena Gabeena, an official at the centre said, as per her information, the attackers did not speak a word. &#8220;They just tied the guards and set the building on fire,&#8221; she told PTI.</p>
<p>Gabeena also drew attention to a recent programme aired by a news channels, which had made some allegations against the centre. Spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar had visited Pakistan in 2012 and inaugurated the centre for his Art of Living movement.</p>
<p>He had also offered to hold talks with the Taliban to usher in peace in the region, saying it would help foster understanding among people with divergent views. &#8220;I am ready to go and talk to the Taliban. I want to talk to them, understand them and give them my opinion. So we can definitely make a difference. We should try it again and again even if we have to try it 100 times,&#8221; Shankar had said.</p>
<p>Art of Living operates globally in 152 countries.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004763&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiaplanem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004692" alt="In this file photo Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200ER that disappeared from air traffic control screens Saturday, taking off from Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport in France.

(AP)
<p>The most dangerous parts of a flight are takeoff and landing. Rarely do incidents happen when a plane is cruising seven miles above the earth.</p>
<p>So the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jet well into its flight Saturday morning over the South China Sea has led aviation experts to assume that whatever happened was quick and left the pilots no time to place a distress call.</p>
<p>It could take investigators months, if not years, to determine what happened to the Boeing 777 flying from Malaysia&#8217;s largest city of Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this early stage, we&#8217;re focusing on the facts that we don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Todd Curtis, a former safety engineer with Boeing who worked on its 777 jumbo jets and is now director of the Airsafe.com Foundation.</p>
<p>If there was a minor mechanical failure _ or even something more serious like the shutdown of both of the plane&#8217;s engines &#8211; the pilots likely would have had time to radio for help. The lack of a call &#8220;suggests something very sudden and very violent happened,&#8221; said William Waldock, who teaches accident investigation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz.</p>
<p>It initially appears that there was either an abrupt breakup of the plane or something that led it into a quick, steep dive. Some experts even suggested an act of terrorism or a pilot purposely crashing the jet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Either you had a catastrophic event that tore the airplane apart, or you had a criminal act,&#8221; said Scott Hamilton, managing director of aviation consultancy Leeham Co. &#8220;It was so quick and they didn&#8217;t radio.&#8221;</p>
<p>No matter how unlikely a scenario, it&#8217;s too early to rule out any possibilities, experts warn. The best clues will come with the recovery of the flight data and voice recorders and an examination of the wreckage.</p>
<p>Airplane crashes typically occur during takeoff and the climb away from an airport, or while coming in for a landing, as in last year&#8217;s fatal crash of an Asiana Airlines jet in San Francisco.  Just 9 percent of fatal accidents happen when a plane is at cruising altitude, according to a statistical summary of commercial jet airplane accidents done by Boeing.</p>
<p>Capt. John M. Cox, who spent 25 years flying for US Airways and is now CEO of Safety Operating Systems, said that whatever happened to the Malaysia Airlines jet, it occurred quickly. The problem had to be big enough, he said, to stop the plane&#8217;s transponder from broadcasting its location, although the transponder can be purposely shut off from the cockpit.</p>
<p>One of the first indicators of what happened will be the size of the debris field. If it is large and spread out over tens of miles, then the plane likely broke apart at a high elevation. That could signal a bomb or a massive airframe failure. If it is a smaller field, the plane probably fell from 35,000 feet intact, breaking up upon contact with the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know the airplane is down. Beyond that, we don&#8217;t know a whole lot,&#8221; Cox said.</p>
<p>The Boeing 777 has one of the best safety records in aviation history. It first carried passengers in June 1995 and went 18 years without a fatal accident. That streak came to an end with the July 2013 Asiana crash. Three of the 307 people aboard that flight died. Saturday&#8217;s Malaysia Airlines flight carrying 239 passengers and crew would only be the second fatal incident for the aircraft type.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the most reliable airplanes ever built,&#8221; said John Goglia, a former member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the possible causes for the plane disappearing include:  </strong></p>
<p>- A catastrophic structural failure of the airframe or its Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. Most aircraft are made of aluminum which is susceptible to corrosion over time, especially in areas of high humidity. But given the plane&#8217;s long history and impressive safety record, experts suggest this is unlikely.</p>
<p>More of a threat to the plane&#8217;s integrity is the constant pressurization and depressurization of the cabin for takeoff and landing. In April 2011, a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff from Phoenix after the plane&#8217;s fuselage ruptured, causing a 5-foot tear. The plane, with 118 people on board, landed safely. But such a rupture is less likely in this case. Airlines fly the 777 on longer distances, with many fewer takeoffs and landings, putting less stress on the airframe.</p>
<p>&#8221; It&#8217;s not like this was Southwest Airlines doing 10 flights a day,&#8221; Hamilton said. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to suggest there would be any fatigue issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>- Bad weather. Planes are designed to fly through most severe storms. However, in June 2009, an Air France flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed during a bad storm over the Atlantic Ocean. Ice built up on the Airbus A330&#8242;s airspeed indicators, giving false readings. That, and bad decisions by the pilots, led the plane into a stall causing it to plummet into the sea. All 228 passengers and crew aboard died. The pilots never radioed for help.</p>
<p>In the case of Saturday&#8217;s Malaysia Airlines flight, all indications show that there were clear skies.</p>
<p>- Pilot disorientation. Curtis said that the pilots could have taken the plane off autopilot and somehow went off course and didn&#8217;t realize it until it was too late. The plane could have flown for another five or six hours from its point of last contact, putting it up to 3,000 miles away. This is unlikely given that the plane probably would have been picked up by radar somewhere. But it&#8217;s too early to eliminate it as a possibility.</p>
<p>- Failure of both engines. In January 2008, a British Airways 777 crashed about 1,000 feet short of the runway at London&#8217;s Heathrow Airport. As the plane was coming in to land, the engines lost thrust because of ice buildup in the fuel system. There were no fatalities.</p>
<p>Loss of both engines is possible in this case, but Hamilton said the plane could glide for up to 20 minutes, giving pilots plenty of time to make an emergency call. When a US Airways A320 lost both of its engines in January 2009 after taking off from LaGuardia Airport in New York it was at a much lower elevation. But Capt. Chesley B. &#8220;Sully&#8221; Sullenberger still had plenty of communications with air traffic controllers before ending the six-minute flight in the Hudson River.</p>
<p>- A bomb. Several planes have been brought down including Pan Am Flight 103 between London and New York in December 1988. There was also an Air India flight in June 1985 between Montreal and London and a plane in September 1989 flown by French airline Union des Transports Aériens which blew up over the Sahara.</p>
<p>- Hijacking. A traditional hijacking seems unlikely given that a plane&#8217;s captors typically land at an airport and have some type of demand. But a 9/11-like hijacking is possible, with terrorists forcing the plane into the ocean.</p>
<p>- Pilot suicide. There were two large jet crashes in the late 1990s _ a SilkAir flight and an EgyptAir flight_ that are believed to have been caused by pilots deliberately crashing the planes. Government crash investigators never formally declared the crashes suicides but both are widely acknowledged by crash experts to have been caused by deliberate pilot actions.</p>
<p>- Accidental shoot-down by some country&#8217;s military. In July 1988, the United States Navy missile cruiser USS Vincennes accidently shot down an Iran Air flight, killing all 290 passengers and crew. In September 1983, a Korean Air Lines flight was shot down by a Russian fighter jet.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004687&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>China will toughen its environmental protection laws to target polluters, according to a high-level policy report released on Sunday, paving the way for possibly unlimited penalties for polluting and the suspension or shutdown of polluters.</p>
<p>The revised law would hold &#8220;polluters accountable for the damage they cause and having them compensate for it&#8221;, said the report, delivered by Zhang Dejiang, who sits on the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee as one of the country&#8217;s most powerful politicians.</p>
<p>Premier Li Keqiang declared a &#8220;war on pollution&#8221; in a report during the country&#8217;s annual parliamentary session on Wednesday, but critics say the statement amounts to mere rhetoric without legal reforms to back it up.</p>
<p>The environment has emerged as one of Beijing&#8217;s key priorities amid growing public disquiet about urban smog, dwindling and polluted water supplies and the widespread industrial contamination of farmland.</p>
<p>Sources with ties to the leadership said in February that amendments to China&#8217;s 1989 environmental law would expand the environment ministry&#8217;s powers significantly and allow regulators to suspend and shut down repeat offenders.</p>
<p>Sunday&#8217;s policy report did not give specific details on how enforcement would be toughened. China&#8217;s environment ministry has historically been unable to enforce anti-pollution laws effectively.</p>
<p>Almost all Chinese cities monitored for pollution last year failed to meet state standards.</p>
<p>China tested a domestically-produced drone aircraft that disperses smog by releasing a chemical catalyst, state media reported on Sunday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004688&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>North Koreans went to polling stations on Sunday to approve a new national legislature.</p>
<p>The vote for the Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly is the first in five years and the first under leader Kim Jong Un. The last elections were held in March 2009, when 687 deputies were elected to the assembly. It is the most powerful body under North Korea&#8217;s constitution, but which in reality has little political power.</p>
<p>Instead of choosing who they support, voters are given the choice of a yes or no for the single candidate on their ballot. Virtually all choose yes.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of drama, the voting was being held in a holiday atmosphere, with national flags hoisted along the streets, women decked out in colorful traditional clothing and dancing events held in parks, schools and riversides.</p>
<p>Voting in authoritarian North Korea is considered to be obligatory. Outside observers say that this makes elections in North Korea an opportunity for the authorities to check up on the population and tighten control.</p>
<p>Hyon Byong Chol, the chairman of a preparatory committee for one of the sub-districts in the election, called the vote &#8220;meaningful&#8221; because it is the first under Kim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through this election we will fully display the might of the single-hearted unity of our army and people who are firmly united behind our respected marshal,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Supreme People&#8217;s Assembly usually runs five-year sessions. It meets only rarely, often only once a year. When it is not in session,its work is done by a smaller and more powerful body called the Presidium.</p>
<p>Kim is also a candidate. State media announced that his constituency is a remote mountain area on the border with China. Mount Paekdu is venerated in North Korea&#8217;s official history as the birthplace of Kim Jong Il, although historians outside the country agree that he was born in the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Election results are normally announced the following day.</p>
<p>The new parliament was expected to meet next month. No date has been officially announced.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004650&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004586" alt="A Chinese relative of passengers aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines plane, cries in Beijing. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiam.jpg" /></a> A Chinese relative of passengers aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines plane, cries in Beijing. (AP)
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-has-one-of-asias-best-safety-records/">Malaysia Airlines</a> said it was &#8220;fearing the worst&#8221; on Sunday for a plane carrying 239 people that went missing more than 24 hours ago, as the government said it was investigating four <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/mumbai-family-on-ill-fated-flight-was-headed-to-china-for-sons-convocation/">passengers</a> who may have held false identity documents.</p>
<p>There were no reports of bad weather and no sign of why <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/5-indians-onboard-malaysian-airlines-identified/">Flight MH370</a> would have vanished from radar screens off the coast of Vietnam about an hour after it took off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing early on Saturday morning.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia12.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004591" alt="MALAYSIA1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia12.jpg?w=475&#038;h=332" width="475" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>European officials said it appeared two people on board were using stolen passports and Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein said authorities were also checking the identities of two other passengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the four names are with me,&#8221; said Hishamuddin, who is also defence minister. &#8220;I have indicated to our intelligence agencies and I have also spoken to international intelligence agencies for assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004592" alt="MALAYSIA2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia21.jpg?w=475&#038;h=317" width="475" height="317" /></a></p>
<p>He said help was also being sought from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). However, an attack was only one of the possibilities being investigated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking at all possibilities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We cannot jump the gun. Our focus now is to find the plane.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004593" alt="MALAYSIA3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia3.jpg?w=475&#038;h=330" width="475" height="330" /></a></p>
<p>The Chinese official Xiamen Daily reported that one of the passengers who was supposed to be on the<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/why-malaysia-airlines-jet-might-have-disappeared/"> flight</a>, according to the manifest, was at home in China. The name on the passport and the passport number did not match, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if the Chinese person&#8217;s identity was among those being investigated.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004594" alt="MALAYSIA4" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia4.jpg?w=475&#038;h=341" width="475" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>There were no confirmed signs of the plane or any wreckage on Sunday, well over 24 hours after it went missing. Search operations continued through the night, officials said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fearing for the worst, a disaster recovery management specialist from Atlanta, USA, will be assisting Malaysia Airlines in this crucial time,&#8221; the airline said in a statement.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004595" alt="MALAYSIA5" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia5.jpg?w=475&#038;h=366" width="475" height="366" /></a></p>
<p><strong>STOLEN PASSPORTS</strong></p>
<p>Vietnamese naval boats sent from the holiday island of Phu Quoc patrolled stretches of the Gulf of Thailand, searching for any wreckage, scouring the area where an oil slick was spotted by patrol jets just before nightfall on Saturday.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004596" alt="MALAYSIA6" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia6.jpg?w=475&#038;h=316" width="475" height="316" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Our two rescue boats have approached the two oil spills since 3 am today but we haven&#8217;t found any sign of the Malaysian plane yet. Other boats are ready to go to support if needed,&#8221; Admiral Ngo Van Phat told Reuters.</p>
<p>There were no indications of sabotage nor claims of an attack. But the passenger manifest issued by the airline included the names of two Europeans &#8211; Austrian Christian Kozel and Italian Luigi Maraldi &#8211; who, according to their foreign ministries, were not on the plane.</p>
<p>A foreign ministry spokesman in Vienna said: &#8220;Our embassy got the information that there was an Austrian on board. That was the passenger list from Malaysia Airlines. Our system came back with a note that this is a stolen passport.&#8221;</p>
<p>Austrian police had found the man safe at home. The passport was stolen two years ago while he was travelling in Thailand, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The foreign ministry in Rome said no Italian was on the plane either, despite the inclusion of Maraldi&#8217;s name on the list. His mother, Renata Lucchi, told Reuters his passport was lost, presumed stolen, in Thailand in 2013.</p>
<p>US and European security officials said that there was no proof of foul play and there could be other explanations for the use of stolen passports.</p>
<p>A Malaysian official with knowledge of the investigation said the passengers being checked had all bought their tickets through China Southern Airlines, which was code-sharing the flight with Malaysia Airlines, the official said.</p>
<p>Passengers on board the flight included 20 employees of Austin, Texas-based chip maker Freescale Semiconductor Ltd . Twelve of the employees were from Malaysia and eight from China, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>NO MAYDAY</strong></p>
<p>The 11-year-old Boeing 777-200ER, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent engines, took off at 12:40 am (1640 GMT Friday) from Kuala Lumpur International Airport when it went missing without a distress call. Aboard were 227 passengers and 12 crew.</p>
<p>Flight MH370 last had contact with air traffic controllers 120 nautical miles off the east coast of the Malaysian town of Kota Bharu. Flight tracking website flightaware.com showed it flew northeast after takeoff, climbed to 35,000 ft (10,670 metres) and was still climbing when it vanished from tracking records.</p>
<p>A crash would likely mark the 777&#8242;s second fatal incident in less than a year, and its deadliest since entering service 19 years ago. An Asiana Airlines Boeing 777-200ER crash-landed in San Francisco in July 2013, killing three passengers and injuring more than 180.</p>
<p>Boeing said it was monitoring the situation but had no further comment.</p>
<p>Paul Hayes, director of safety at Flightglobal Ascend aviation consultancy, said the flight would normally have been at a routine stage, having reached initial cruise altitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a sudden disappearance would suggest either that something is happening so quickly that there is no opportunity to put out a mayday, in which case a deliberate act is one possibility to consider, or that the crew is busy coping with what whatever has taken place,&#8221; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>A large number of planes and ships from several countries were scouring the area where the plane last made contact, about halfway between Malaysia and the southern tip of Vietnam.<br />
&#8220;The search and rescue operations will continue as long as necessary,&#8221; Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told reporters. He said his country had deployed 15 air force aircraft, six navy ships and three coastguard vessels.</p>
<p>Besides the Vietnamese vessels, China and the Philippines also sent ships to the region to help, while the United States, the Philippines and Singapore dispatched military planes. China also put other ships and aircraft on standby.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;BIG RED FLAG&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>The disappearance of the plane is a chilling echo of an Air France flight that crashed into the South Atlantic on June 1, 2009, killing all 228 people on board. It vanished for hours and wreckage was found only two days later.</p>
<p>John Goglia, a former board member of the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. agency that investigates plane crashes, said the lack of a distress call suggested that the plane either experienced an explosive decompression or was destroyed by an explosive device.</p>
<p>&#8220;It had to be quick because there was no communication,&#8221; Goglia said. He said the false identities of the two passengers was &#8220;a big red flag&#8221;.</p>
<p>If there were passengers on board with stolen passports, it was not clear how they passed through security checks.</p>
<p>International police body Interpol maintains a database of more than 39 million travel documents reported lost or stolen by 166 countries, and says on its website that this enables police, immigration or border control officers to check the validity of a suspect document within seconds. No comment was immediately available from the organisation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004582&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>A 12-MILE-long streak of oil across the surface waters of the Gulf of Thailand was an early clue to the mysterious disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jet with 239 aboard that vanished in pre-dawn darkness Saturday morning during a flight from Kuala Lumpur that was supposed to end in Beijing.</p>
<p>But as the sun set over the gulf and the adjacent South China Sea Saturday, the disappearance of the plane was a reminder that even the most modern planes can suddenly and disconcertingly disappear with few traces. In 2009, an Air France Airbus 330 slipped off radar screens into the deep waters of the Atlantic off Brazil, another case in which the wreckage proved difficult to find.</p>
<p>As of Saturday evening, the Malaysian plane, a Boeing 777-200 on Flight MH370, had not yet been confirmed to have crashed, though the limits of its fuel tanks mean that it came down somewhere instead of reaching Beijing at dawn on Saturday. The Gulf of Thailand, if that is where the plane ended up, has one advantage for rescuers in that it is a shallow arm of the South China Sea, with no comparison to the inky depths of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Malaysia’s deputy minister of transport, Aziz bin Kaprawi, said authorities had not received any distress signals from the aircraft.</p>
<p>In a development that raised fears of foul play, foreign ministry officials in Vienna and Rome confirmed that the names of two citizens, an Italian and an Austrian, listed on the manifest of the missing flight matched the names on two passports reported stolen in Asia, news reports said.</p>
<p>“We are not ruling out anything,” the chief executive of Malaysia Airlines, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, told reporters at Kuala Lumpur International Airport Saturday night. “As far as we are concerned right now, it’s just a report.”</p>
<p>A senior American intelligence official said law enforcement and intelligence agencies were investigating the matter. But so far, they had no leads.</p>
<p>One uncertainty about the flight involved the timing of its disappearance from radar. Malaysia Airlines said it took off at 12:41 am Malaysia time and disappeared from air traffic control radar in Subang, a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, at 2:40 am. That timeline seemed to suggest that the plane stayed in the air for two hours &#8211; long enough to fly not only across the Gulf of Thailand but also far north across Vietnam.</p>
<p>Malaysia, the US and Vietnam dispatched ships and aircraft to the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand Saturday to join an intensive search.</p>
<p>Relatives of those on the flight who were waiting at Beijing Capital International Airport were taken to a hotel and kept waiting in a room for hours, prompting complaints. One woman said no one from Malaysia Airlines had come to the room to talk to relatives.</p>
<p>At the Kuala Lumpur airport, a grief-stricken relative of a passenger aboard MH370 screamed uncontrollably as he was escorted out of the terminal by airline employees. Be truthful about this!” said the man, Koon Chim Wa, whose booming voice echoed through the cavernous terminal. “They say they don’t know where the plane is,” Koon said, his hands and body shaking. “Is this a joke?”     NYT</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004371&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Archie Comic Publications picks a film and TV writer for its top creative post to add maturity to the comic books.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The playwright Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa is adding a feather to his cap: chief creative officer of Archie Comic Publications. Aguirre-Sacasa, who has also written for film and television, will be working closely with the Archie team in Mamaroneck, New York, to figure out the best way to exploit the company’s characters in comics, of course, but also in other media.</span></p>
<p>“Educating the film and television community about Archie and its properties” is a big part of the job, said Aguirre-Sacasa, who is primarily based in Los Angeles. Besides Archie and the gang, there are Josie and her bandmates, the Red Circle line of superheroes, Sabrina the teenage witch and others.</p>
<p>Jon Goldwater, the publisher and co-chief executive of Archie, says he is determined to give his new creative officer the freedom to develop the characters. “My marching order, so to speak, is you have a blank canvas,” he said.</p>
<p>The men already have worked together. In 2013, the company published a four-part comic book story, drawn by Dan Parent, which featured the characters from Glee, a television series that Aguirre-Sacasa works on, meeting the gang from Riverdale. The first issue sold about 4,500 copies.</p>
<p>A much bigger success is Afterlife With Archie, a continuing series, illustrated by Francesco Francavilla, in which Archie’s hometown is overrun with zombies. Its first issue sold nearly 42,000 copies. “I don’t think any of us were prepared for the weird lightning-in-a-bottle response. Teenagers and horror: what a great combination,” said Aguirre-Sacasa, the writer for both series and a coming one, set in the 1960s, starring Sabrina.</p>
<p>Aguirre-Sacasa has a long history with comics and Archie, some of it bumpy. His 2003 play, Weird Comic Book Fantasy, was initially named Archie’s Weird Fantasy, and featured the main character struggling with coming out. Archie Comic Publications was uncomfortable with that depiction and threatened legal action. Times had changed considerably by 2010 when Archie introduced Kevin Keller, Riverdale’s first openly gay resident, to critical acclaim.</p>
<p>The playwright has also worked for Marvel Entertainment, including a series starring the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man, as well as an adaptation of Stephen King’s The Stand.</p>
<p>Aguirre-Sacasa says he is particularly proud of Afterlife With Archie, a boldly dark and violent tale aimed at more mature readers. The series has also hinted at an affair between Ginger Lopez and Nancy Woods and an incestuous relationship between the siblings Cheryl and Jason Blossom.</p>
<p>While Aguirre-Sacasa is writing several series, that will not always be the case. Part of his responsibility is to match the characters to the right writing and artistic talent. To develop The Black Hood and Hangman, he wants to find the best superhero or crime writers and artists for the job.</p>
<p>Sometimes, opportunities will present themselves. That was the case when, in November, Lena Dunham, the creator and star of the HBO series Girls, expressed her love of Archie during a conversation with filmmaker J J Abrams and novelist Doug Dorst in New York. Dunham said she owned the first Archie comic and remarked, “You really haven’t lived till you’ve been to an Archie convention.”</p>
<p>The information went from stage, to audience, to text (a friend sent the line to Goldwater’s son), to Archie’s publisher, to its new chief creative director, who is friends with Dunham. “As his first initiative, Roberto really brought together the whole Lena project,” Goldwater said.</p>
<p>“It has so much cultural significance but also so much personal significance, and to get to play with these beloved characters is a wild creative opportunity,” Dunham said in a statement.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004309&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Why Sunny Pharrell Williams has been one of the most transformative music figures of 2013.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It can probably all be explained by the hat, the indelible success of Pharrell Williams.</span></p>
<p>The hat, of course, is the signature Vivienne Westwood mountain hat that he wore to the Grammys in January. Sitting atop his head as if it were pasted on with adhesive, the hat — part cowboy, part park ranger — added several inches to his height and several months to his cultural relevance. With one small stroke — almost an afterthought, given that he’d bought the hat several years before — Williams managed to redraw himself completely. That night, he was a performer, a winner several times over, including for producer of the year.</p>
<p>But that is Williams in a nutshell: taking an old idea, and, with a touch of panache, make it seem utterly new. He makes the familiar seem idiosyncratic.</p>
<p>Now 40, Williams has been producing and writing songs for more than two decades, first a force in hip-hop and R&amp;B, and later in pop. He’s been one of the most transformative music figures of the last year, with his hands on two of 2013’s biggest singles, Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines and Daft Punk’s Get Lucky.</p>
<p>And now there’s G I R L, his second album as a solo performer. It’s intensely catchy and harmlessly empty, and succeeds largely because of Williams’s bravery at standing firm on territory no one else is trying to claim.</p>
<p>The sunny G I R L — which Williams wrote, produced and sung almost in its entirety —reaches back to the utopian black pop of the ’70s and early ’80s, full of soft funk and cushy soul. It’s an overwhelmingly positive album, cheery in mood and instrumentation, as if Williams knows something the rest of us do not.</p>
<p>Take Happy, which first appeared on the soundtrack of Despicable Me 2 and was nominated for best original song at the Oscars, where Williams also performed. The song is unrelentingly bright, like a peek of unfiltered sun between clouds on an overcast day.</p>
<p>Williams may be the most prominent pop music figure to have identified a shift away from cynicism in youth culture, or he may be the first person to make adult-contemporary pop that actually sounds contemporary.</p>
<p>Either way, he manages to tap into broad pleasures while coming off like a minimalist or an aesthete. There are moments of musical ostentation on G I R L, but they are few. Instead, Williams delivers a gut check of pared-down R&amp;B and disco. Lost Queen is among the highlights — with nods to The Lion Sleeps Tonight. I Know Who You Are has Alicia Keys singing dully about empowerment. Brand New, with its wanton Jackson 5 homage, shows that Williams hasn’t been too troubled by the lawsuit filed by the heirs of Marvin Gaye, who alleged that Blurred Lines was too derivative of Gaye’s work.</p>
<p>None of the ideas on these songs is original, but they are for the most part out of fashion, and therefore Williams’s boldness and facility with them feels refreshing.</p>
<p>Williams has always been a believer in sketches. Most of the genre-shifting beats he made — Clipse’s Grindin’, Snoop Dogg’s Drop It Like It’s Hot, and so many more — were mere outlines. Williams is an expert at pointing a listener in a direction, then stepping out of the way, confident that the rest of the path is clear.</p>
<p>As a performer, Williams is a true chameleon. He has a neutral, almost ahistoric voice. He’s not a powerful singer — so many times on this album, his vocals are thickened, bolstered with harmonies.</p>
<p>Instead, where Williams excels is in pacing and rhythm, and finding pockets of delivery that feel intuitive, or at least lined so deeply with historical memory that they’re instantly familiar and comforting.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004306&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Academy award-winning Jennifer Lawrence, the youngest three-time nominee, keeps displaying the personal qualities which add to her star power.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004305&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Academy award-winning Jennifer Lawrence, the youngest three-time nominee, keeps displaying the personal qualities which add to her star power.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It was at the 2008 Venice Film Festival that Jennifer Lawrence — future Oscar winner, squirrel skinner, American warrior — signalled that she was no ordinary starlet. She wasn’t yet famous then, just a paparazzi afterthought to Charlize Theron, her co-star in The Burning Plain.</span></p>
<p>During an event for the movie, Theron showered praise on co-star, Kim Basinger, who wasn’t there. Lawrence apparently silenced the room by joking that Basinger had died. The girl can’t help it!</p>
<p>What Lawrence then said was funnier and so blunt that only The Daily Telegraph appears to have carried it. “Working with Kim was one of the most amazing moments of my life,” Lawrence said. “She’s so focused and nice — everything you don’t expect when you hear you’re going to be working with Kim Basinger.”</p>
<p>Was that a ditzy gaffe or a sly, funny dig of the kind that once might have come out of Judy Holliday? Or was Jennifer Lawrence just being Jennifer Lawrence, the best actress winner who tripped on her way to grab her Oscar for David O Russell’s Silver Linings Playbook and then — in what was the perfect capper to the inanity of the awards season — flipped the bird at someone in the press room?</p>
<p>Silver Linings Playbook is the movie that turned many around on Lawrence, 23, transforming them from sceptics into admirers. Even her roles as an Ozarks scrapper in Winter’s Bone and as the blue bombshell Mystique in the 2011 action film X-Men: First Class had not convinced most critics. What changed?</p>
<p>As Tiffany, the randy widow turned dancing stalker in Silver Linings, Lawrence inhabited a deceptively tricky role with such transparency that it felt as if she had collapsed the space between her and the character. Tiffany doesn’t make much story sense — she cajoles Bradley Cooper’s character into partnering with her for a dance contest, though neither can really dance — but Russell’s film is irresistible, and Lawrence’s performance so likable that it makes the narrative contrivances irrelevant.</p>
<p>Like all of Lawrence’s signature characters, she can’t be denied, whether chasing down Cooper’s wreck in Silver Linings or landing a kiss on Amy Adams that feels like a sucker punch in Russell’s latest, American Hustle.</p>
<p>In that film, Lawrence plays Rosalyn, the neglected wife of a con man (Christian Bale) who’s fallen for Adams’s character. She doesn’t have all that much screen time, but is a dominating, palpably physical presence.</p>
<p>It’s a delectable, juicy, surprising performance. You never know what Rosalyn wants, but that makes the character a woozy, a delight in a film that makes virtue out of chaos.</p>
<p>Yet while all actors act, stars give more than performances: They deliver identifiable, commodifiable personalities that often blur the lines between their on-screen and off-screen worlds. From Lawrence’s interviews, her offscreen mugging and photo bombing, she doesn’t appear especially interested in playing the star; being human seems enough for now. That isn’t as easy as it sounds given how difficult it has become for stars to have a private life — to walk to a yoga class or pass out drunk in a friend’s car — without becoming fodder for tabloids and gossip sites.</p>
<p>Lawrence may come across like a natural, but her talent has been honed by almost a decade of experience. At 14, while visiting New York, she was tapped by a modelling scout.</p>
<p>In 2008, she added three movies to her résumé, including The Burning Plain and Garden Party. There was also the leading role in The Poker House.</p>
<p>By May 2011, Lawrence had already been nominated for best actress for Winter’s Bone and cast as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games.</p>
<p>In January 2013, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire broke a couple of records, first by overtaking Iron Man 3 to become the highest domestic grosser. That same month, industry observer Mark Harris noticed that the film had reached an even more startling benchmark: It was the first film with a lone female lead to top an annual box-office chart since The Exorcist 40 years earlier.</p>
<p>Even so, media types continue, with smiles and rank condescension, to label Lawrence “awkwardly charming” — a headline recently said she made the Golden Globes “more awesome, in her great goofy way” — which suggests how anomalous she registers, how confusing and unclassifiable she is amid the bland and the blonde.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004305&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[A controlled trial of the drug on patients with terminal cancer shows it eased the existential gloom of their last days<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004302&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>A controlled trial of the drug on patients with terminal cancer shows it eased the existential gloom of their last days.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">He heard about the drug trial from a friend in Switzerland and decided it was worth volunteering, even if it meant long, painful train journeys from his native Austria and the real possibility of a mental meltdown. He didn’t have much time, after all, and traditional medicine had done nothing to relieve his degenerative spine condition.</span></p>
<p>“I’d never taken the drug before, so I was feeling&#8230; well, I think the proper word for it in English is dread,” said Peter, 50, an Austrian social worker, who didn’t reveal his last name. “There was this fear that it could all go wrong, that it could turn into a bad trip.”</p>
<p>The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease has posted online results from the first controlled trial of LSD in more than 40 years. The study, conducted in the office of a Swiss psychiatrist near Bern, tested the effects of the drug as a complement to talk therapy for 12 people nearing the end of life, including Peter.</p>
<p>Most of the subjects had terminal cancer, and several died within a year after the trial — but not before having a mental adventure that appeared to have eased the existential gloom of their last days.</p>
<p>“Their anxiety went down and stayed down,” said Dr Peter Gasser, who conducted the therapy and followed up with his patients a year after the trial concluded.</p>
<p>The new publication marks the latest in a series of baby steps by a loose coalition of researchers and fund-raisers who are working to bring hallucinogens back into the fold of mainstream psychiatry. Before research was banned in 1966 in the US, doctors tested LSD’s effect for a variety of conditions, including end-of-life anxiety. But in the past few years, psychiatrists in the US and abroad — working with state regulators as well as ethics boards — have tested Ecstasy-assisted therapy for post-traumatic stress; and other trials with hallucinogens are in the works.</p>
<p>“The effort is both political and scientific,” said Rick Doblin, executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a foundation that has financed many of the studies. “We want to break these substances out of the mould of the counterculture and bring them back to the lab as part of a psychedelic renaissance.”</p>
<p>Before taking LSD, the 12 patients in the Swiss study met with Dr Gasser to get acquainted. The trial called for two drug-assisted courses of therapy, separated by a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The drug’s effects would last up to 10 hours, after which the patient would sleep on a couch in Dr Gasser’s office, attended at all times by the therapist or an assistant. “I told them that each session would be right here, and I am part of it,” Dr Gasser said. “I said, ‘I can’t guarantee you won’t have intense distress, but I can tell you that if you do, it will pass’.”</p>
<p>Indeed it passed, though not always easily. Many wept, most squirmed; one 67-year-old man said he met his long-dead, estranged father somewhere out in the cosmos, nodding in approval.</p>
<p>All talked for periods with Dr Gasser. In the jargon of the profession, the therapy was patient-centered, open-ended and “integrative”, in that it focused on current habits of thought as well as on long-ago childhood scenes.</p>
<p>“I had what you would call a mystical experience, I guess, lasting for some time, and the major part was pure distress at all these memories I had successfully forgotten,” Peter said. “These painful feelings, regrets, this fear of death. I remember feeling very cold for a long time. It was a mental coldness, I think, a memory of neglect.”</p>
<p>He was also doing something with those sensations, something he had almost never done before. He was talking about them. “I didn’t know I was talking away until Dr Gasser made me notice,” Peter said.</p>
<p>After two months of weekly therapy, the eight participants who received full doses of LSD improved by about 20 per cent on standard measures of anxiety, and the four subjects who took a much weaker dose got worse. (After the trial, those patients were allowed to “cross over” and try the full dose.) Those findings held up for a year in those who have survived.</p>
<p>The trial was far too small to be conclusive, said Dr Gasser, whose co-authors include Dr Doblin, Dominique Holstein of University Hospital Zurich and Rudolf Brenneisen of the University of Bern. But the researchers see the results as a beginning.</p>
<p>The participants also considered the therapy worthwhile. “It’s a proof of concept,” Dr Doblin said. “It shows that this kind of trial can be done safely, and that it’s very much worth doing.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The ambition to be the fastest man on four wheels had modest beginnings in 1898, at a village on what were then the outskirts of Paris.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004296&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The drive to be the fastest man on land takes shape, powered by $70 mn, supercomputers, and six times the power of all F1 cars in a Grand Prix.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The ambition to be the fastest man on four wheels had modest beginnings in 1898, at a village on what were then the outskirts of Paris.</span></p>
<p>A Frenchman, Count Gaston de Chasseloup-Laubat, driving what was little more than a streamlined horsecart with an electrically powered motor, achieved 39.2 mph. Chroniclers in the Paris newspapers wondered if he had gone “fou furieux”, or raving mad.</p>
<p>Richard Noble, of Avonmouth, England, knows all about de Chasseloup-Laubat and others who have followed in the quixotic and sometimes deadly annals of the world land speed record. Noble raised the record to 633.4 mph with a jet-powered car, Thrust SSC, in 1983 — he has bankable credentials in his bid to raise the record to 1,000 mph by the end of 2016.</p>
<p>Noble’s plan involves a dart-shaped missile of a car called Bloodhound, named for a British-built missile, which comes with a $70 million price, by far the most costly attempt on record.</p>
<p>At times, Noble, 67, seems puzzled by the crackpot nature of it all. After decades of chasing the record, and starting again when some usurper — especially an American — hijacks the mark, he admits to an element of exhaustion.</p>
<p>“People often say to me, ‘It must be exciting’, and I tell them, ‘It’s a bloody nightmare’,” he said. Quickly recovering his passion, he added: “You know, we Brits have always been good at this kind of caper. And it’s the most exciting thing you can do on earth.”</p>
<p>An English-educated Scot with a taste for London’s most upscale clubs, Noble has been compared by British commentators to polar explorer Robert Falcon Scott and Everest mountaineer George Leigh Mallory.</p>
<p>The Bloodhound team declared its undertaking to be primarily motivated by a desire to inspire a new generation of engineers. The approach helped secure the government’s backing — crucial in acquiring the state-of-the-art combat jet engines indispensable to the project.</p>
<p>Science classes at more than 5,000 British secondary schools are now linked into the project via the Bloodhound website, BloodhoundSSC.co.uk.</p>
<p>Since setting his record two decades ago, Noble has handed the driving responsibilities to a Royal Air Force fighter pilot, Andy Green, an Oxford-educated mathematician and wing commander.</p>
<p>Green, 51, holds the current speed record, 763 mph, making him the only man to exceed the speed of sound on land. He set the mark aboard Noble’s second jet-powered vehicle, also called Thrust, in 1997. Now he has teamed with Noble to raise the record by 250 mph, which would be by far the biggest single jump in the record’s history.</p>
<p>Green will make the bid without an ejector seat, or much else in the way of inbuilt survivability; the engineers have decided that a catastrophic failure at 1,000 mph would be inescapably fatal.</p>
<p>Instead, they decided that Green’s safety will be assured, as far as it can be, by the design of Bloodhound and hours spent on computer simulations.</p>
<p>Still, he acknowledged, “Not everything works in the real world exactly as you expect it to from computer simulations.” That, he said, was one of the lessons emphasised by Neil Armstrong when he visited the team in 2012.</p>
<p>The Bloodhound team aims to achieve the 1,000-mph target in August or September 2016 at the Hakskeen Pan, a vast, dried-up lake bed in the Kalahari desert in South Africa. Hundreds of villagers recruited by the local government have been readying the stretch, 12 miles long and nearly 600 yards wide, by removing more than 6,000 tonnes of surface stones.</p>
<p>The 7-tonne vehicle, 44-feet-long and 6-feet-wide, will be powered by three engines: a Rolls-Royce jet engine developed for the RAF’s front-line fighter; an adapted version of an American-made Nammo rocket engine; and a V8 Formula One engine. On the record run, the jet and rocket engines are expected to generate 21 tonnes of thrust, more than six times the power of all the F1 cars that line up for Grand Prix races.</p>
<p>Noble is confident that his team of 60 designers and engineers working at Avonmouth, just south of Bristol, will meet the 2016 deadline.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004296&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Siberia fills the heads of scientists with dreams of resurrection. For millions of years, its tundra has gradually turned to permafrost, entombing animals and other organisms in ice. Some of their remains are exquisitely well preserved — so well, in fact, that some scientists have nibbled on the meat of woolly mammoths. Some researchers even hope to find viable mammoth cells that they can use to clone the animals back from extinction. And in 2012, Russian scientists reported coaxing a seed buried in the permafrost for 32,000 years to sprout into a flower.</span></p>
<p>Now a team of French and Russian researchers has performed a resurrection of a more sinister nature. From Siberian permafrost more than 30,000 years old, they have revived a virus that’s new to science.</p>
<p>“To pull out a virus that’s 30,000 years old and actually grow it, that&#8217;s pretty impressive,” said Scott O Rogers of Bowling Green State University who was not involved in the research.</p>
<p>The thawed virus, which infects amoebae, is not a threat to humans. But if the new study holds up to scrutiny, it raises the possibility that disease-causing viruses may also be lurking in the permafrost.</p>
<p>The new virus was discovered by a group of researchers led by Chantal Abergel and Jean-Michel Claverie, a wife-and-husband team at Aix-Marseille University in France. Dr Abergel and Dr Claverie are veteran virus hunters, specialising in finding new species of so-called giant viruses.</p>
<p>Familiar viruses are tiny and have few genes. The influenza virus, for example, has 13 genes and is about 100 nanometres across. But giant viruses, which typically infect amoebae, can be 1,000 times bigger and have more than 2,500 genes.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Russian Academy of Sciences sent Dr Abergel and Dr Claverie small pieces of permafrost extracted from a Siberian riverbank.</p>
<p>To search for giant viruses, the French researchers added bits of the permafrost to colonies of amoebae. The amoebae began to die. When the scientists examined the colonies, they discovered that giant viruses were multiplying inside the amoebae.</p>
<p>Measuring 1.5 micrometres long, the viruses are 25 per cent bigger than any virus previously found. Their oddly long, narrow shape inspired the scientists to call them pithoviruses — “pithos” referring to ancient Greek earthenware jars.</p>
<p>“Sixty per cent of its gene content doesn’t resemble anything on earth,” Dr Abergel said. She and her colleagues suspect that pithoviruses may be parasitic survivors of life forms that were very common early in the history of life.</p>
<p>The scientists describe the pithoviruses in the recent Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “Its potential implications for evolutionary theory and health are quite astonishing,” said Eske Willerslev, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Copenhagen. Nonetheless, he said he didn’t think the scientists had fully ruled out the possibility that their samples had been contaminated with young viruses.</p>
<p>Dr Abergel and Dr Claverie acknowledged the possibility of contamination. But they noted that they had performed the experiment three times and obtained the same virus from the permafrost each time.</p>
<p>It’s even possible that some of those viruses could infect humans. Dr Abergel and Dr Claverie consider it a worrying possibility.</p>
<p>Dr Rogers considered the risk of an outbreak of resurrected viruses “extremely low”, pointing out that scientists have been excavating permafrost and ice for decades without any known infections.</p>
<p>“But there’s always the first instance, right?” he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004294&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/riot-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004230" alt="Ukrainian riot police stand at the entrance of the regional administrative building during a pro Russian rally in Donetsk, Ukraine.

<p>Dozens of military trucks transporting heavily armed soldiers rumbled over Crimea&#8217;s rutted roads Saturday as Russia reinforced its armed presence on the disputed peninsula in the Black Sea. Moscow&#8217;s foreign minister ruled out any dialogue with Ukraine&#8217;s new authorities, whom he dismissed as the puppets of extremists.</p>
<p>The Russians have denied their armed forces are active in Crimea, but an Associated Press reporter trailed one military convoy Saturday afternoon from 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Feodosia to a military airfield at Gvardeiskoe north of Simferopol, over which a Russian flag flew.</p>
<p>Some of the army green vehicles had Russian license plates and numbers indicating that they were from the Moscow region. Some towed mobile kitchens and what appeared to be mobile medical equipment.</p>
<p>Vladislav Seleznyov, a Crimean-based spokesman for the Ukrainian armed forces, told AP that witnesses had reported seeing amphibious military ships unloading around 200 military vehicles in eastern Crimea on Friday night after apparently having crossed the Straits of Kerch, which separates Crimea from Russian territory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither the equipment, nor the paratroopers have insignia that identify them as Russian, but we have no doubt as to their allegiance,&#8221; Seleznyov said.</p>
<p>The amphibious operation appeared to be one of the largest movements of Russian military forces since they appeared in Crimea a week ago.</p>
<p>Seleznyov also said a convoy of more than 60 military trucks was spotted Saturday heading from Feodosia toward Simferopol, the regional capital. An AP reporter caught up with the convoy and trailed it to Russian-controlled airfield. In the rear of the vehicles, heavily armed soldiers could be seen, though none appeared to have identifying badges or insignia. Soldiers spat at the reporters following them.</p>
<p>The regional parliament in Crimea has set a March 16 referendum on leaving Ukraine to join Russia, and senior lawmakers in Moscow said they would support the move, ignoring sanctions threats and warnings from President Barack Obama that the vote would violate international law.</p>
<p>The strategic peninsula in southern Ukraine has become the flashpoint in the battle for Ukraine, where three months of protests sent President Viktor Yanukovych fleeing to Russia. A majority of people in Crimea identify with Russia, and Moscow&#8217;s Black Sea Fleet is based in Sevastopol, as is Ukraine&#8217;s.</p>
<p>While the U.S. and the EU urged Russia to engage in dialogue with new Ukrainian authorities, the Kremlin has refused to do so, denouncing the change of power in Ukraine as an &#8220;unconstitutional coup.&#8221;</p>
<p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow sees no sense in having a dialogue with Ukraine&#8217;s new authorities because, in his view, they kowtow to radical nationalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;The so-called interim government isn&#8217;t independent, it depends, to our great regret, on radical nationalists who have seized power with arms,&#8221; he said at a news conference. He said that nationalist groups use &#8220;intimidation and terror&#8221; to control Ukraine.</p>
<p>Despite that tough talk, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Grigory Karasin met Saturday with Ukrainian Ambassador Volodymyr Yelchenko, the first such diplomatic contact since the crisis began. In a terse statement, the ministry said only that they discussed issues related to Russian-Ukrainian ties in a &#8220;sincere atmosphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>At a news conference in Kiev, Ukraine&#8217;s new foreign minister, Andrii Deshchytsi spoke hopefully about creation of a contact group made up of foreign ministers of various countries to mediate the crisis. Forming the group was an idea discussed during meetings between Ukraine&#8217;s prime minister and European Union leaders in Brussels on Thursday.</p>
<p>Deshchytsi said that he learned from mediators that Russia hasn&#8217;t &#8220;categorically&#8217; refused the idea of permitting a contact group to help broker an end to the dispute.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Russians are thinking,&#8221; Deshchytsi said, so there is &#8220;reason to hope.&#8221; He reiterated that the new Ukrainian government understands it is vital to need to establish good relations with all neighbors, including Russia.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow has no intention of annexing Crimea, but that its people have the right to determine the region&#8217;s status in a referendum.</p>
<p>The Crimean referendum has been denounced by Ukraine&#8217;s new government, and Obama has said it would violate international law. The U.S. moved Thursday to impose its first sanctions on Russians involved in the military occupation of Crimea.</p>
<p>Speaking on BBC on Saturday, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that while there is no military response to the recent events of Crimea, the crisis was a reminder of threats to European security and stability.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe that politicians all over NATO will now rethink the whole thing about investment in security and defense,&#8221; he told the BBC. &#8220;Obviously, defense comes at a cost but insecurity is much more expensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>An international military mission composed of officers from the U.S. and 28 other nations tried again Saturday to enter Crimea, but it was turned back around the town of Armiansk by armed men.</p>
<p>An AP reporter traveling with the 54 observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said that after the group had stopped, the armed men fired bursts of automatic weapons fire to halt other unidentified vehicles. No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>In Simferopol, meanwhile, a public ceremony was held for the swearing-in of the first unit in the pro-Russia &#8220;Military Forces of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea.&#8221; About 30 men armed with AK-47s, and another 20 or so unarmed, turned out. They ranged in age from teenagers to a man who looked to be about 60. They were sworn in at a park in front of an eternal flame to those killed in World War II.</p>
<p>Sergei Aksyonov, the Crimean prime minister, came to the ceremony and was greeted by the soldiers with shouts of &#8220;Commander!&#8221;</p>
<p>He said their main role, at least until the referendum, would be to &#8220;keep the peace.&#8221; He said he didn&#8217;t foresee any fighting with the Ukrainian soldiers still at bases in Crimea.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not enemies with those soldiers who pledged loyalty to the Ukrainian state. They are not our enemies,&#8221; Aksyonov said. He said they would be given the chance to go safely back to Ukraine if they want.</p>
<p>In the week since Russia seized control of Crimea, Russian troops have been neutralizing and disarming Ukrainian military bases here. Some Ukrainian units, however, have refused to give up. Aksyonov has said pro-Russian forces numbering more than 11,000 now control all access to the region and have blockaded all military bases that haven&#8217;t yet surrendered.</p>
<p>On Friday evening, pro-Russia soldiers tried to take over another Ukrainian base in Sevastopol, resulting in a tense standoff ensued that lasted for several hours.</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Vitaly Onishchenko, deputy commander of the base, said three dozen men wearing unmarked camouflage uniforms arrived late Friday. While one group climbed over a wall on one side of the base, another crashed a heavy military truck through the gates, Onishchenko said.</p>
<p>He said Saturday that they turned off power, cut telephone lines and demanded that about 100 Ukrainian troops, who barricaded themselves into one of the base buildings, surrender their weapons and swear allegiance to Russia. The invaders left around midnight.</p>
<p>No shots were fired in and no injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Russia has described the troops who wear green uniforms without insignia as local &#8220;self-defense forces.&#8221; But Onishchenko said the troops who tried to overrun his base were clearly Russian.</p>
<p>&#8220;These were Russian servicemen specially ordered,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Their watches were set to Moscow time. They spoke with Russian accents and they didn&#8217;t hide their allegiance to the Russian Federation.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004229&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Five Indians, including three from a family, were among the 239 people on board the Malaysia Airlines plane that went missing on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Ministry of External Affairs said the five have been identified as Chetna Kolekar, 55, Swanand Kolekar, 23, Vinod Kolekar, 59, Chandrika Sharma, 51, and Kranti Shirsath, 44. An Indian-origin Canadian, Muktesh Mukherjee, was also on board the flight. Sources said the Kolekar family is from Mumbai, Sharma from Chennai, and Shirsath from Pune.</p>
<p>Sharma, executive secretary of the International Collective In Support of Fishworkers, was en route to Mongolia to attend an Asia Pacific regional conference organised by the Food and Agriculture Organisation.</p>
<p>She originally hails from Haryana. She has been a resident of Chennai since 1993, having married a Tamil, said her colleague N Venugopal. Sharma and her husband K S Narendran have a daughter, Meghna, who studies in Delhi.

(AP)
<p>Syrian government forces seized a town from rebels near the Lebanese border on Saturday, their latest attempt to cut off opposition fighters&#8217; fluid supply lines, state media and activists said.</p>
<p>Fighting lasted weeks around Zara, which rebels used as a base to attack pro-regime communities in the area, said Rami Abdurrahman of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. His group obtains its information from a network of activists on the ground.</p>
<p>Another activist who identified himself as Samy al-Homsi said the town was one of two last strongholds for rebels along the Lebanese border leading to the city of Homs, the other being the nearby village of al-Hosn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without al-Hosn and Zara, it will be the end of the revolution to the west of Homs,&#8221; al-Homsi said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the only two areas left to the rebels there.&#8221;</p>
<p>In previous fighting in the area, Syrian forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad fired well into Lebanon, apparently to push back rebels trying to sneak across on well-trodden smuggling routes.</p>
<p>Abdurrahman and the Lebanon-based al-Mayadeen channel said Syrian forces were now advancing into the nearby area of Hasarijiyeh.</p>
<p>Government troops have struggled to stem the flow of arms and fighters entering from Syria&#8217;s smaller neighbor. In the town of Yabroud &#8211; another rebel logistics hub near the capital &#8211; activists say its forces have been pummeling rebels for weeks with crude barrel bombs dropped by aircraft.</p>
<p>Death tolls from the reported strikes vary widely, as has often been the case during the three-year-long conflict. The Observatory said 16 civilians and 14 fighters died strikes on Friday, while an activist, who uses the name Amer, said in a Skype interview that four civilians were killed. Hundreds of civilians have died from the powerful but inaccurate weapons.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Syria&#8217;s main Western-backed coalition confirmed Saturday that it has chosen a new army chief following an embarrassing episode in which their former leader refused to step down.</p>
<p>The statement insisted that despite some confusion,&#8221; Brig. Gen. Abdul-Ilah al-Bashir would assume leadership of the coalition&#8217;s military council.</p>
<p>The body originally issued the announcement appointing al-Bashir on Feb. 17. But two days later, Maj. Gen. Salim Idris rejected his dismissal. Then Idris, along with more than a dozen senior insurgent commanders, severed ties with the political opposition-in-exile, further fragmenting the notoriously divided rebel movement.</p>
<p>Idris was ousted by colleagues who blamed him for the waning influence of the coalition-backed Free Syrian Army, as Islamic-orientated brigades grew in power.</p>

<p>An Associated Press reporter says pro-Russian forces refused to let a foreign military mission enter Crimea on Saturday. After the officers had stopped, the armed men fired warning bursts of automatic weapons fire into the air to make other unidentified vehicles halt. No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>The multinational group of military officers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe was attempting to enter the embattled peninsula from the north. The armed men told them they had no authorization to enter Crimea.</p>
<p>The OSCE mission will likely return to the Ukrainian city of Kherson where it had spent the night, the AP reporter said. Russia and Ukraine are locked in a tense standoff over Crimea.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004178&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a stern message to its neighbours, China on Saturday said it is determined to defend &#8220;every inch&#8221; of its territory and there was &#8220;no room for compromise&#8221; with Japan over territorial or historical disputes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not take anything that is not ours, but we will defend every inch of territory that belongs to us,&#8221; Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told mediapersons here in his annual press conference on the sidelines of the ongoing National People&#8217;s Congress (NPC) session.</p>
<p>There was no direct reference to India in his press conference, while he launched a frontal attack on Japan and made strong comments about smaller maritime neighbours who contest China&#8217;s claims over the South China Sea. There have been frequent border incursions by Chinese troops into Indian territory and China also claims Arunachal Pradesh as Southern Tibet, part of the dispute over the 4,000-km Line of Actual Control between the two countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will never bully smaller countries, yet we will not accept unreasonable denunciation from smaller countries,&#8221; he said regarding China&#8217;s neighbourhood diplomacy, especially in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei question China&#8217;s claims of sovereignty over a host of islands in the South China Sea which in recent months has escalated with the US lending its voice to their demands. Wang said that the general situation in China&#8217;s neighbourhood remains &#8220;stable and positive&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said that China would like to carry out equal-footed consultation and negotiation, and properly handle its territorial and maritime disputes with some countries by peaceful means on the basis of historical facts and the international law.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will not be any change to this position,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will more actively practise our neighbourhood diplomacy guideline of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness.&#8221; He said China would also allow more of its neighbours and peoples to benefit from the reform and opening up of the world&#8217;s second largest economy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also willing to listen to the voices from our neighbouring countries and respond to the doubts about China&#8217;s neighbourhood diplomacy,&#8221; Wang added. Referring to Sino-Japanese relations damaged by the raging dispute over the islands in the East China Sea, Wang said, &#8220;On the two issues of principle, history and territory, there is no room for compromise&#8221;.</p>
<p>The minister&#8217;s remarks highlight the mounting tension between China and Japan over territorial and historical rows. Relations between the two East Asian giants have hit a new low since Japan&#8217;s &#8220;purchase&#8221; of the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands in September 2012.</p>
<p>The dispute with Tokyo is particularly tense given historical animosities between the two nations over Japan&#8217;s invasion of China during the second world war. Wang said that if Japan insists on overturning the history of its past aggression, the international community would not tolerate or condone it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004168&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/putin-4801.jpg" /></a> President Vladimir Putin listens to journalists&#8217; questions on current situation in Ukraine at the Novo-Ogaryovo presidential residence outside Moscow. (AP)
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has seemingly been in &#8220;deep freeze&#8221; since the Cold War and is applying its outdated KGB mentality in Ukraine, Britain&#8217;s deputy prime minister said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Guardian newspaper, Nick Clegg said Putin was applying &#8220;yesterday&#8217;s divisions and arguments to today&#8217;s problems&#8221;. Clegg acknowledged there was a &#8220;pronounced Russian imprint&#8221; in the Crimean peninsula, which meant it could not be viewed the same way as other parts of Ukraine.</p>
<p>The British deputy premier urged Putin to engage in a &#8220;civilised discussion&#8221; with the new government in Kiev. &#8220;Putin&#8217;s reaction is very revealing. It&#8217;s as if he&#8217;s been in a sort of deep freeze since the Cold War and hasn&#8217;t moved with the times,&#8221; Clegg said.</p>
<p>Former KGB spy Putin headed its successor, the Federal Security Service, shortly before he first became president in 2000. &#8220;He gives every appearance of applying a KGB mentality rooted in the Cold War to new realities in 21st-century Europe,&#8221; Clegg said.</p>
<p>&#8220;To regard closer ties between Ukraine and a non-military organisation like the European Union as the equivalent to American tanks on your lawn at the height of the Cold War suggests to me that we&#8217;re dealing with a man who&#8217;s applying yesterday&#8217;s divisions and arguments to today&#8217;s problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clegg acknowledged Moscow&#8217;s special links to Crimea, which was transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 when they were<br />
both in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crimea already has a semi-autonomous status within Ukraine and clearly has a different history to other parts of Ukraine and has a very pronounced Russian imprint on it, not least because of the presence of the Russian Black Sea naval operation,&#8221; which is based there, said Clegg. &#8220;So it is already in a different category and I don&#8217;t think anyone wants to deny that.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004149&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A militant group has issued an unusual apology for a twin suicide bombing in Beirut that killed four people and wounded dozens, including children from a nearby orphanage.</p>
<p>The al-Qaida-linked Abdallah Azzam Brigades issued a statement published Saturday apologising for civilian deaths. It said a &#8220;technical fault&#8221; affected the second of two Feb. 19 suicide bombings targeting an Iranian cultural center in Beirut.</p>
<p>The group said the bombs were meant to be detonated in a way that their shrapnel wouldn&#8217;t reach a main road nearby, but didn&#8217;t specify the technical fault. The Brigades said their target was the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah and Iranian interests in Lebanon, not Shiites in general.</p>
<p>The group has claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in Lebanon.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004125&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>Russia is open to having an &#8220;honest, equal&#8221; dialogue with foreign states on the crisis in Ukraine, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday. &#8220;We are open to an honest, equal and objective dialogue with our foreign partners to find a way to help all of Ukraine come out of the crisis,&#8221; Lavrov said at a televised news conference in Moscow with his Tajik counterpart, in a clear reference to the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are ready to continue dialogue on the understanding that this dialogue should be honest and partner-like, without attempts to portray us as one of the sides in the conflict.&#8221; Lavrov added: &#8220;This crisis was not created by us (Russia). All the more, it was created in defiance of our repeated and longstanding warnings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tensions between Moscow and the West have surged in recent days as pro-Moscow forces took over the Ukrainian Black Sea<br />
peninsula of Crimea, which then announced plans to hold a referendum on becoming part of Russia. Lavrov has held talks with Western officials including US Secretary of State John Kerry, but without reaching any breakthrough.</p>
<p>The Russian foreign minister launched a new attack on the Ukrainian government that took power after the overthrow of<br />
President Viktor Yanukovych and said terror and chaos were reigning in the country. &#8220;The so-called temporary government is not independent and depends very unfortunately on radical nationalists who carried out an armed seizure of power,&#8221; Lavrov said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no kind of de facto state control for law and order,&#8221; he said. Lavrov said far-right radicals of the Pravy Sektor (Right Sector) group were &#8220;playing the tune&#8221; and accused them of using methods of &#8220;terror and intimidation&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004104&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Six suspected drug dealers were shot dead during a firefight with Thai security forces who seized illegal amphetamines at the scene, police said on Saturday. The clash occurred on Friday in a mountainous border area in the Mae Sai district of northernmost Chiang Rai province &#8211; part of the Golden Triangle region.</p>
<p>&#8220;Six bodies were found at clash site along with seven bags of methamphetamines,&#8221; Colonel Nattawut Yuwan, commander of the<br />
Mae Sai police, told AFP by telephone. &#8220;We suspect they were hilltribe (Muser) people,&#8221; he said, adding the suspects had been travelling by foot and the clash happened quite close to the border with Myanmar.</p>
<p>There were no reports of any casualties among security forces. Clashes between police and drug traffickers are fairly<br />
common in Thailand&#8217;s remote border regions. Thailand has seen a marked increase in seizures of methamphetamine &#8211; which is relatively cheap and easy to make &#8211; often smuggled from neighbouring Myanmar where armed rebels use profits from narcotics to fund their campaigns.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004083&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Malaysia Airlines, operator of Flight MH370 that went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on Saturday, has established a record as one of the Asia-Pacific&#8217;s best full-service carriers in terms of safety and service despite some recent financial problems.</p>
<p>The Kuala Lumpur-based carrier competes with AirAsia  domestically, and with the likes of AirAsia X , Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways and Cathay Pacific on international routes.</p>
<p>The airline, part of the Oneworld alliance that includes British Airways and Qantas, has 88 aircraft in its fleet, including Airbus A330s and A380s, and Boeing  777-200s and 737s, according to its website.</p>
<p>They include 15 777-200ERs, one of which was involved in Saturday&#8217;s disappearance. These aircraft are deployed on its long-range services within the Asia-Pacific and to Europe.</p>
<p>Its fleet of 777-200ERs has an average age of 14.2 years, according to airfleets.com, an authoritative website that tracks airline fleets, making it one of the oldest such fleets of 777-200s in the world.</p>
<p>It was unclear if the age of the plane had any bearing on its disappearance, given authorities were still trying to determine the flight&#8217;s presumed crash site in the South China Sea on Saturday.</p>
<p>The airline was set to order Airbus A330 or A350 aircraft to start replacing some of its older 777s from 2016, with the management having identified fleet replacement as a key plank of its plan to turn around the loss-making airline.</p>
<p>In February, the airline reported a net loss of 343.4 million ringgit ($104 million) for the three months ended December 2013, its fourth consecutive quarterly loss.</p>
<p>Its full-year loss of 1.17 billion ringgit was nearly three times higher than in 2012.</p>
<p>The last fatal incident involving a Malaysia Airlines aircraft took place on Sept. 15, 1995, when 34 people died after a Fokker 50 crashed on approach to Tawau, a town in the Eastern Malaysian state of Sabah.</p>
<p>Before that, in 1977, a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 737-200 crashed in Tanjung Kupang, in Johor state, killing all 100 people on board. That was the deadliest crash to date involving a Malaysian aircraft.</p>
<p>The Boeing 777 is the U.S. plane maker&#8217;s most popular wide-body aircraft. The first models to be produced were the 777-200 in 1995 and the 777-200ER two years later, followed by the 777-300 in 1998. Boeing then produced the longer-range 777-300ER and 777-200LR variants in 2004 and 2006 respectively.</p>
<p>The Boeing 777-200ER has a range of 7,725 miles (14,305 km) and a cruising speed of Mach 0.84, or about 640 miles per hour, according to Boeing.</p>
<p>The Boeing 777 has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft in service.</p>
<p>The first serious incident took place in January 2008, when a British Airways 777-200ER crash-landed just short of London&#8217;s Heathrow airport, injuring 45 people.<br />
In July 2011, an Egypt Air 777-200ER had a fire in the cockpit while parked at a gate in Cairo and was evacuated without injuries.<br />
Both aircraft were written off.</p>
<p>The only fatal crash so far came on July 6 last year when Asiana Airlines flight 214 struck a seawall on landing in San Francisco. Of 307 people aboard, three died and more than 180 were injured.</p>
<p>The crash investigation, while still ongoing, has so far indicated no mechanical failure and focused on the pilots&#8217; failure to recognize that the plane was flying too low and too slowly as it approached the runway.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004076&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Indian jetliner with 170 people on board caught fire while landing in Nepal&#8217;s capital on Saturday, but there were no casualties reported.</p>
<p>The right wheels of the Airbus 320 operated by budget airline Indigo caught fire during the landing and passengers were quickly evacuated through emergency doors, said Rishikesh Sharma, chief of Tribhuwan International Airport in Katmandu.</p>
<p>Sharma said emergency workers responded quickly to control the fire. Officials were investigating the incident. The flight originated in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Nepalese businessman Satish Shrestha, who was aboard the plane and regularly flies the route, said passengers were complaining of a &#8220;rubber burning-like smell&#8221; even before the aircraft landed. Shrestha said the plane, which was arriving from New Delhi, was flying too low before landing.</p>
<p>Officials refused to give details, saying the incident was still being investigated.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004037&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>US President Barack Obama has welcomed the unified position of the European Union on the crisis in Ukraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;The President welcomed the conclusions of the March 6 European Council and the unified position of the United States and the European Union regarding Ukraine,&#8221; the White House said after the telephone call between Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday.</p>
<p>Obama and Merkel agreed on the need for Russia to pull back its forces, allow for the deployment of international observers and human rights monitors to Crimea, and support free and fair presidential elections in May, the White House said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They discussed the need for Russia to agree quickly on the formation of a contact group that will lead to direct dialogue between Ukraine and Russia to de-escalate the situation and restore Ukraine&#8217;s territorial integrity,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>Obama and Merkel reiterated their grave concern over Russia&#8217;s clear violation of international law through its military intervention in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov as a follow up to Obama&#8217;s call to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a day earlier.</p>
<p>During the call, Kerry underscored the importance of finding a constructive way to resolve the situation diplomatically, which would address the interests of the people of Ukraine, Russia, and the international community. The two top diplomats agreed to continue to consult in the days ahead on the way forward.</p>
<p>Kerry then spoke with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk to debrief him on his conversation with Lavrov and to stay in closest possible coordination on how the US and the international community can continue to support the people and government of Ukraine.</p>
<p>In related development, US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke this morning with his Ukrainian counterpart Ihor Tenyukh.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003989&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/paralympics-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003936" alt="Ukraine had also decided that they would not boycott the Games which run until March 16." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/paralympics-med.jpg" /></a> Ukraine had also decided that they would not boycott the Games which run until March 16.
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin opened the Winter Paralympics in the Black Sea resort of Sochi and was immediately confronted by an emotional Ukrainian protest on a politically-charged night.</p>
<p>As athletes from 45 countries took part in the opening ceremony on Friday, only one Ukrainian competitor appeared in a symbolic, scaled-down presence of the country that has denounced Russia&#8217;s intervention in Crimea.</p>
<p>Spectators gave huge cheers and some even stood to applaud 37-year-old skier and biathlete Mykhailo Tkachenko who came through the Fisht stadium in his wheelchair.</p>
<p>Without a trace of a smile, Tkachenko proudly carried his country&#8217;s national flag for his 31-strong team who did not enter the stadium with him.</p>
<p>Ukraine had earlier said it would refrain from any political protests during the ceremony, and paralympic committee head Valery Sushkevich even said he had to persuade a teenage athlete against expressing her anger at Russia.</p>
<p>Ukraine had also decided that they would not boycott the Games which run until March 16.</p>
<p>Some Western countries, including the United States, Britain and Germany, have not sent government delegations in protest at Russia&#8217;s Crimea intervention.</p>
<p>In what appeared as a taunt towards the US, organisers played a popular 1990s Russian song called &#8220;Good-bye, America&#8221; when the Russian team closed the parade.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003926&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>A <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/asia/malaysia-airlines-has-one-of-asias-best-safety-records/">Malaysia Airlines </a> flight carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew went missing over the South China Sea on Saturday, presumed crashed, as ships and planes from countries closest to its flight path scoured a large search area for any wreckage.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/5-indians-onboard-malaysian-airlines-identified/" target="_blank">5 Indians onboard Malaysian Airlines identified</a></p>
<p>Vietnamese state media, quoting a senior naval official, had reported that the Boeing 777-200ER flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing had crashed off south Vietnam. Malaysia&#8217;s transport minister later denied any crash scene had been identified.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysiarelativesm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003985" alt="A woman wipes her tears after walking out of the reception center and holding area for family and friend of passengers aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines plane, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.

(AP)
<p>&#8220;We are doing everything in our power to locate the plane.    We are doing everything we can to ensure every possible angle has been addressed,&#8221; Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein told reporters near the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking for accurate information from the Malaysian military. They are waiting for information from the Vietnamese side,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004086" alt="MALAYSIA1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia11.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>Vietnamese Admiral Ngo Van Phat later qualified his earlier remarks about a crash site having been identified and told Reuters he was referring to a presumed location beneath the plane&#8217;s flight path, using information supplied by Malaysia.</p>
<p>A crash, if confirmed, would likely mark the US -built Boeing 777-200ER airliner&#8217;s deadliest incident since entering service 19 years ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2004089" alt="MALAYSIA2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaysia2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>The plane disappeared without giving a distress signal &#8211; a chilling echo of an Air France flight that crashed into the South Atlantic on June 1, 2009, killing all 228 people on board. It vanished for hours before wreckage was found.</p>
<p>Search and rescue vessels from the Malaysian maritime enforcement agency reached the area where the plane last made contact at about 4.30 p.m. Singapore time (0830 GMT) but saw no immediate sign of wreckage, a Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency told Reuters.</p>
<p><strong>VANISHED AFTER REACHING 35,000 FEET</strong></p>
<p>Flight MH370, operating a Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, last had contact with air traffic controllers 120 nautical miles off the east coast of the Malaysian town of Kota Bharu, Malaysia Airlines chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said in a statement read to an earlier news conference in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>There were no reports of bad weather in the area.</p>
<p>The airline said people from 14 nationalities were among the 227 passengers &#8211; at least 152 Chinese, 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French and three Americans. A Chinese infant and an American infant were also on board.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Australian government fears the worst for those aboard missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370,&#8221; a spokeswoman for Australia&#8217;s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said.</p>
<p>Flight tracking website flightaware.com showed the plane flew northeast over Malaysia after takeoff and climbed to an altitude of 35,000 feet. The flight vanished from the website&#8217;s tracking records a minute later while it was still climbing.</p>
<p>Malaysia and Vietnam were conducting a joint search and rescue operation, while China and the Philippines have sent ships to the South China Sea to help. The Philippines also dispatched a military plane to help in the search.</p>
<p>China has also put other ships and aircraft on standby, said Transport Minister Yang Chuantang.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;EXTREMELY WORRIED&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters in Beijing before the initial Vietnamese report that the plane had crashed that China was &#8220;extremely worried&#8221; about the fate of the plane and those on board. &#8220;The news is very disturbing. We hope everyone on the plane is safe,&#8221; Wang said.</p>
<p>The flight was operating as a China Southern Airlines   codeshare.</p>
<p>The flight left Kuala Lumpur at 12.21 a.m. (1621 GMT Friday) but no trace had been found of the plane more than eight hours after it was due to land in the Chinese capital at 6.30 a.m. (2230 GMT Friday) the same day.</p>
<p>&#8220;We deeply regret that we have lost all contacts with flight MH370,&#8221; Jauhari said.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines has one of the best safety records among full-service carriers in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>It identified the pilot of MH370 as Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a 53-year-old Malaysian who joined the carrier in 1981 and has 18,365 hours of flight experience.</p>
<p>Chinese state media said 24 Chinese artists and family members, who were in Kuala Lumpur for an art exchange programme, were aboard. The Sichuan provincial government said Zhang Jinquan, a well-known calligrapher, was on the flight.</p>
<p>If it is confirmed that the plane crashed, the loss would mark the second fatal accident involving a Boeing 777 in less than a year and by far the worst since the jet entered service in 1995.</p>
<p>An Asiana Airlines Boeing 777-200ER crash-landed in San Francisco in July 2013, killing three passengers and injuring more than 180. Boeing said it was monitoring the situation but had no further comment. The flight was operating as a China Southern Airlines  codeshare.</p>
<p>An official at the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam said the plane had failed to check in as scheduled at 1721 GMT while it was flying over the sea between Malaysia and Ho Chi Minh city.</p>
<p><strong>Boeing team to offer technical help to investigators</strong></p>
<p>Boeing, the maker of the Boeing 777 flown by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared over the South China Sea, on Saturday said it was assembling a team of experts to provide technical assistance to investigators. &#8220;Boeing is assembling a team to provide technical assistance to investigating authorities,&#8221; the Seattle-based company said in a brief statement on its website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boeing offers its deepest concern to the families of those aboard missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370,&#8221; the statement added. The Boeing 777 is considered to be one of the most popular and safest jets by aviation experts.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003808&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/assad.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003500" alt="Assad" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/assad.jpg" /></a> In this Monday, Aug. 26, 2013 file photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, Syrian President Bashar Assad gestures as he speaks during an interview with a Russian newspaper in Damascus, Syria.
<p>Syrian President Bashar Assad said that Russia&#8217;s military takeover of Crimea reflects President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s &#8220;wise policy&#8221; and his efforts to restore &#8220;security and stability&#8221; in Ukraine after an &#8220;attempted coup.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a letter addressed to the Russian president, Assad claims Putin&#8217;s move in eastern Ukraine prevented &#8220;terrorist extremists&#8221; from taking power in Kiev.</p>
<p>Assad&#8217;s comments, his first since the escalation of the Ukrainian crisis last month, were carried by the Syrian state news service late on Thursday.</p>
<p>Russia has been an adamant supporter of Assad through the 3-year-old conflict that started as a largely peaceful uprising against his rule but turned into a civil war that has claimed at least 140,000 lives.</p>
<p>Assad says his troops are fighting Islamic extremists who want to destroy Syria.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003499&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Underlying talk about taking harsh punitive measures against Russia for its military incursion into Ukraine are economic complications and worries that sanctions levied against Moscow could backfire on the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Heavier U.S. and European Union sanctions could sting Russia&#8217;s already slow-growing economy and hurt its financial sector. But Moscow could retaliate and seize American and other foreign assets or cut exports of natural gas to Europe, which is heavily dependent on Russia for energy.</p>
<p>Declaring his determination not to let the Kremlin carve up Ukraine, President Barack Obama on Thursday slapped new visa restrictions on Russian and other opponents of Ukraine&#8217;s government in Kiev and authorized wider financial penalties against those involved in the military intervention or in stealing state assets. Obama emphasized his resolve in an hourlong telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, affirming his contention that Russia&#8217;s actions violate Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, both chambers of Congress looked to advance legislation imposing hard-hitting sanctions on Russia.</p>
<p>Obama hailed U.S. cooperation with the European Union, which on Thursday suspended talks with Putin&#8217;s government on a wide-ranging economic agreement and on granting Russian citizens visa-free travel within the 28-nation bloc. But Europe&#8217;s presidents and prime ministers remain divided on taking more drastic steps such as freezing assets and issuing travel bans on Russian officials.<br />
European hesitancy reflected the reality that targeting influential Russian businessmen or major Russian companies would also harm Europe&#8217;s economic interests. U.S. trade with Russia is less than one-tenth of Europe&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Russian investors hold assets worth billions in European banks, particularly in Britain which is highly protective of its financial sector, and major exporters such as Germany and the Netherlands have far more at stake than the United States in Russia&#8217;s consumer economy.</p>
<p>Showing greater caution than Obama on sanctions, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said European penalties against Russia depend &#8220;on how the diplomatic process progresses.&#8221; EU President Herman Van Rompuy said travel bans, asset freezes and the cancellation of an EU-Russia summit could still come. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk acknowledged &#8220;no enthusiasm&#8221; in Europe for economic sanctions.<br />
In some ways, the debate over sanctions echoes the Cold War doctrine of military strategy in which if two opponents fired off nuclear weapons, both sides would be annihilated.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a kind of mutually assured destruction relationship here,&#8221; said Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and analyst at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington. &#8220;Russia could say, `Well, we&#8217;re going to cut off your gas and you guys can now scramble and buy extra gas and pay big prices.&#8217;<br />
&#8220;It would hurt the Europeans, but it also would cut off the biggest source of cash that flows into Russia today,&#8221;he said referring to oil and gas sales that account for about 60 percent of Russia&#8217;s exports and half of its government revenue.&#8221; So the Russians may threaten some things, but they also have to consider that if they do that what it would do to the Russian economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The State Department sought to allay fears that Europe might find itself short on Russian gas.<br />
&#8220;We understand that European gas inventories are well-above normal levels, due to a milder than usual winter, and could replace a loss of Russian exports for several months, if necessary,&#8221; said State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki.</p>
<p>House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, saw an opening for U.S. gas producers. He called on Obama to fast-track approval of U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, claiming the Energy Department has a slow approval process that amounts to a de facto ban on American natural gas exports.<br />
&#8220;We should not force our allies to remain dependent on Putin for their energy needs,&#8221; Boehner said.</p>
<p>Ariel Cohen, an expert on Russian and Eurasian affairs at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, said he doesn&#8217;t know if the Europeans would be willing to impose tough sanctions, particularly against Russia&#8217;s banking and financial systems. Even if the Europeans don&#8217;t, the U.S. needs to take the lead or risk allowing Russia to alter current world order, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Either we take a lead or the international system goes back to the chaos and high-risk levels that existed before World War I and between World War I and World War II,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is very serious. I cannot emphasize that enough. People who talk about `Oh, we won&#8217;t get cheap gas from Russia&#8217; or `The Russians will get angry&#8217; _ they do not look at it beyond the current geopolitical and international order.&#8221;<br />
If Russia grabs Crimea, Iran would be less willing to give up an ability to develop nuclear arms. &#8220;The message to Iran would be: If you have nuclear weapons you will not be attacked, your regime will be intact. If you don&#8217;t have nuclear weapons, your regime can be toppled and pieces of your territory can be taken away.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result of its move into Ukraine, Cohen said Russia already has lost billions in its stock market drop and devaluation of the Russian ruble. It also stands to lose from a decline in tourism and future energy sales if European nations decide it&#8217;s time to reduce their dependence on Russian gas and buy it from North Africa, Qatar, Nigeria and the U.S.<br />
For the U.S., the worst that can happen is that Russia will partially seize assets of companies like Coca-Cola, Boeing or Pepsi, he said. But that also would make Russia&#8217;s investment climate more difficult than it already is because of arbitrary rules, corruption and hard to understand taxation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003478&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lama-med1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990044" alt="The 78-year-old monk on Thursday delivered the customary prayer that opens each Senate session." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lama-med1.jpg" /></a> The 78-year-old monk on Thursday delivered the customary prayer that opens each Senate session.
<p>Taking exception to the US Senate inviting exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, an angry China on Friday lodged a protest with Washington.</p>
<p>The 78-year-old monk on Thursday delivered the customary prayer that opens each Senate session, after meeting President Barack Obama at the White House last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;We express strong dissatisfaction with and strong  opposition to the meeting between US congress leaders and lawmakers with the Dalai Lama. China has lodged solemn representations with the US,&#8221; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Qin Gang told media briefing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to point out that Tibet is a sacred and inalienable part of China&#8217;s territory. Tibet-related affairs fall totally within China&#8217;s domestic affairs,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What Dalai has been doing and saying over past several decades has shown that he is a political exile who has been engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the cloak of religion,&#8221; Qin said. Obama has met with the Dalai Lama twice earlier in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;China urges the US congress to abide by its commitment of recognising Tibet as part of China, not supporting Tibetan  independence, stop interfering in China&#8217;s domestic affairs within Tibet-related affairs, and cease to connive with and support anti-China separatist activities by Tibet independence forces,&#8221; Qin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;US should also do more to promote friendship between the two peoples as well as the growth of our bilateral relations instead of the other way around,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The US move to invite Dalai Lama to offer prayers at USSenate will certainly affect the Sino-US relationship as China always opposes foreign leaders meeting with the Dalai Lama,  Xin Qiang, a deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told state-run Global Times.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003454&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 13-year-old schoolboy in the UK has become the youngest person in the world to build a nuclear fusion reactor.</p>
<p>Jamie Edwards, a pupil at Penwortham Priory Academy, in Lancashire created the reactor from scratch with help from his school, breaking the record of US student Taylor Wilson, who was 14 when he created nuclear fusion in 2008.</p>
<p>Jamie, who started work in October in an under-used school science laboratory, recreated a process known as &#8216;inertial electrostatic confinement&#8217; which dates back to the 1960s.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day, I was looking on the internet for radiation or other aspects of nuclear energy and I came across Taylor Wilson,&#8221; said the junior scientist who faced a race against time to complete the project before his 14th birthday this week.</p>
<p>Jamie, along with friend George Barker, set about trying to create nuclear fusion by consulting an open source website for amateur physicists, an English news channel reported.</p>
<p>His application for funds was rejected by various nuclear laboratories and universities.</p>
<p>Jamie then turned to his head teacher Jim Hourigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a bit stunned and I have to say a little nervous when Jamie suggested this but he reassured me he wouldn&#8217;t blow the school up,&#8221; said Priory head Hourigan, who agreed to give 2,000 pounds to the project.</p>
<p>Jamie ordered parts and equipment from Lithuania, the US and UK, working on the project every break and lunchtime as well as after school.</p>
<p>He has now become the youngest person in the world to achieve nuclear fusion, using high energy to smash two hydrogen atoms together to make helium.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s magnificent really. I can&#8217;t quite believe it &#8211; even though all my friends think I am mad,&#8221; Jamie said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003417&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russia&#8217;s parliament will abide by the&#8221;historic choice&#8221; to be made by Crimea when the Ukrainian region&#8217;s people vote in a referendum on joining Russia later this month, the speaker of the Russian lower house said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will respect the historic choice of the people of Crimea,&#8221; said State Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin, in comments strongly implying that the Russian legislature would ratify a vote in favour of joining Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We support the free and democratic choice of the population of Crimea,&#8221; he added, quoted by Russian news agencies at a meeting with a delegation of Crimean lawmakers, led by Crimea&#8217;s parliament speaker Vladimir Konstantinov.</p>
<p>Crimea&#8217;s parliament on Thursday said it had agreed to ask President Vladimir Putin for the region to become part of Russia and would put the issue to a referendum on March 16.</p>
<p>Naryshkin said the move was linked to the need to ensure the &#8220;rights and freedom of citizens and simply protect human life&#8221; in Crimea, amid Ukraine&#8217;s turmoil after the fall of president Viktor Yanukovych. But he acknowledged that it was also prompted by reasons of &#8220;historical, spiritual and world-point-of-view character.&#8221;</p>
<p>The head of the State Duma&#8217;s committee for relations with ex-Soviet states, Leonid Slutsky, said that parliament would move fast after the referendum to recognise the result.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that literally in the next days after the referendum the State Duma will formalise the decision in the proper way,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro blamed the month-old unrest shaking his country on a &#8220;minority&#8221; that has left the opposition in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>In an interview with an english news channel, Maduro also renewed his call for establishing a new level of relations with the United States after years of frosty relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;My message (to the US) is: respect, dialogue, that we overcome the visions they have of our country,&#8221; Maduro said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our message to those who rule the US is respect Venezuela, respect Latin America and let&#8217;s establish new levels of relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only excerpts of the interview hosted by Christiane Amanpour were released, which it said would air in full Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who have started the violence are in the minority,&#8221; Maduro said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a tiny group belonging to the opposition and they have put the rest of the opposition in a dire situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wondered aloud what would happen &#8220;if a tiny group said they were going to start a revolution or a revolt to change the constitutional government of the US.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess they would react and resort to the tools to restore order and peace,&#8221; Maduro said.</p>
<p>The United States and Venezuela have not had ambassadors in each other&#8217;s countries since 2010. Last month, the two countries exchanged hostile gestures, such as Caracas expelling three US diplomats. Washington answered in kind.</p>
<p>However, Maduro appointed young diplomat Maximilian Arvelaez to serve as his ambassador to Washington.</p>
<p>The US State Department, however, gave the move a cool reception, noting that an exchange of ambassadors must be a reciprocal gesture.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, an English news channel said that the Venezuelan government had revoked the credential of the news network&#8217;s staff in Caracas and work permits for anchors Patricia Janiot and Rafael Lomo.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003304&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two passers-by were wounded by gunshots fired from a park on Friday that is occupied by anti-government protesters in the heart of the country&#8217;s capital, police said.</p>
<p>A 31-year-old woman was shot while walking on the street and a taxi driver was wounded in the leg while driving near the protest venue of Lumpini Park, said police Col. Chaiya Kongsub.</p>
<p>He said the bullets came from inside the park but did not say who fired the shots.</p>
<p>Protest spokesman Akanat Promphan said he was unaware of the incident.</p>
<p>Erawan emergency medical services said both of the wounded have been discharged from hospitals.</p>
<p>The protesters this week consolidated the rally they had been staging at several major intersections in the city to the one venue Lumpini, saying they wanted to minimize the impact of the protests on city residents after six weeks of a so-called shutdown operation in the capital.</p>
<p>23 people have been killed and more than 700 injured since Thailand&#8217;s latest round of political conflict began last November. Protesters want the prime minister to resign, but she is refusing.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003291&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/barackobamam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003193" alt="For 2014, Obama had proposed USD 300 million in foreign military financing for Pakistan." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/barackobamam.jpg" /></a> For 2014, Obama had proposed USD 300 million in foreign military financing for Pakistan.
<p>US President Barack Obama has proposed USD 882 million in foreign aid to Pakistan for next year, a substantial drop of 18 per cent from the fiscal 2013.</p>
<p>According to Congressional experts, who have tabulated the budgetary proposals which was sent to the Congress by Obama, the President has proposed USD 546 million in total economic-related assistance and USD 336 million in total security related assistance to Pakistan.</p>
<p>The assistance to Pakistan in fiscal 2013 was USD 1.2 billion &#8211; USD 834 million economic and USD 361 million security related aid.</p>
<p>Figures for the fiscal 2014, which ends in October this year, are not yet available.</p>
<p>This, however, does not include the coalition support fund reimbursement which is the money given to Pakistan in lieu of the actual expenses made by Islamabad towards the support of the US operations in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Under the security related assistance, the Obama Administration has retained the 2013 level of USD 280 million of foreign military assistance for the year 2015.</p>
<p>For 2014, Obama had proposed USD 300 million in foreign military financing for Pakistan.</p>
<p>There is been drop in other security related funds including counter narcotics.</p>
<p>There is no allocation to Pakistan counterinsurgency fund/counterinsurgency capability fund, which was USD 452 million in 2012, USD 800 million in 2011 and USD 700 in 2010.</p>
<p>Under the economic related assistance the largest drop has been in the Economic Support Funds &#8211; from actual USD 724 in 2013 and requested USD 766 in 2014 to just USD 546 proposed for the fiscal 2015.</p>
<p>The drop in financial aid to Pakistan is attributed to the continued strain on US economy, as a result of which even the Department of Defence has been forced to cut its budget.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003239&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The health and lives of millions of people across the globe are under threat from government failures to guarantee their citizens sexual and reproductive rights, Amnesty International has said.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity even punishable by death, said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International&#8217;s Secretary General while launching a new global campaign &#8216;My Body My Rights&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;With My Body My Rights, we want to help the next generation realise and claim their sexual and reproductive rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Together we want to send a clear and unequivocal message to governments that this kind of over-reaching control violates human rights and is simply unacceptable&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p>He said states needed to take positive action not just by getting rid of oppressive laws but also by promoting and protecting sexual and reproductive rights, besides providing information, education, services and ending impunity for sexual violence.</p>
<p>The campaign is about people being empowered to enjoy their sexuality.</p>
<p>It encourages young people around the world to know and demand their right to make decisions about their health, body, sexuality and reproduction without state control, fear, coercion or discrimination.</p>
<p>It also seeks to remind world leaders of their obligations to take positive action, including through access to health services.</p>
<p>The campaign was launched at a women meeting in rural communities in Nepal &#8211; where many girls are forced to marry as children and more than half a million women suffer from uterine prolapse or fallen womb, as a result of continuous pregnancy and hard labour.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003181&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukraine-lll.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003180" alt="crowd  chanting &quot;Rossiya! Rossiya!&quot; and waving the Russian tricolour. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukraine-lll.jpg" /></a> Crowd chanting &#8220;Rossiya! Rossiya!&#8221; and waving the Russian tricolour. (Reuters)
<p>The pro-Russian authorities who declared Crimea part of Russia on Thursday said they were carrying out the will of the overwhelming majority of its residents.</p>
<p>The streets belong to Russia&#8217;s supporters: crowds chanting &#8220;Rossiya! Rossiya!&#8221; and waving the Russian tricolour.</p>
<p>But for the quieter people who are proud to call themselves Ukrainian citizens &#8211; no one knows which side is the majority &#8211; the move came as a sharp and sudden shock, bringing fears of chaos, forced emigration or war.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Ukrainian. I want my own, Ukrainian soldiers to protect me. I don&#8217;t want to be part of Russia, I hate Russia,&#8221; said Tanya Kulik, 16, gesturing to a pro-Russian crowd.</p>
<p>Many other people, including ethnic Russians with roots in Russia, also consider themselves Ukrainians.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Russian: I was born in Russia. My father was a Russian officer. But we have lived in Ukraine since 1989. I am a Ukrainian citizen. Although I have the right to Russian citizenship, I have never sought it,&#8221; said Alexandra Kvitko, editor-in-chief of Black Sea TV.</p>
<p>Her station was the only independent TV channel in Crimea until this week when the pro-Russian authorities switched it off. On Thursday its signal and those of the two main stations from Kiev were replaced in Crimea with Russian state channels.</p>
<p>She said the vote behind closed doors by an unverified number of parliamentarians to declare the region part of Russia was proof they were afraid to find out what Crimeans think.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now they are not even holding their blessed referendum to ask the opinion of Crimeans. They just decided,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>If Moscow does annex Crimea she may have to leave: &#8220;Because Russia does not have independent media &#8211; or barely any &#8211; maybe we will move to the channel to Kiev and try to broadcast the Crimean point of view from Kiev.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;THERE WILL BE BLOOD&#8221;</p>
<p>Crimea has a narrow ethnic Russian majority and was administered as part of Russia within the Soviet Union until 1954. Many residents have Russian passports, especially near Sevastopol, home of the Black Sea Fleet. The views of those who support the Russian takeover are passionately held.</p>
<p>But that does not mean public opinion in a province of 2 million people straightforwardly favours Moscow&#8217;s rule. The last time residents were asked, in 1991, they very narrowly voted for independence along with the rest of Ukraine.</p>
<p>However many want to join Russia, hundreds of thousands do not. Ukrainian citizens would presumably be required to accept Russian nationality or become foreigners.</p>
<p>Leonid Pilunsky, a member of the regional parliament who opposes the pro-Russian authorities, said he and other lawmakers were not summoned for Thursday&#8217;s vote and were certain not enough members would have been present for a quorum. &#8220;There was no quorum. This was not a decision by parliament, it was just a statement issued by a collaborationist,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all lawlessness and crime. When parliament is surrounded by men in uniforms with no insignia, it is impossible to describe anything that takes place inside as legitimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although Russia&#8217;s takeover has so far been bloodless, he believed violence was likely. The local authorities would provoke it as an excuse to crack down on their foes: &#8220;There will be provocation. The Russian agents will need blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>TATAR TEARS</p>
<p>The group likely to react most strongly to being annexed to Russia are the Crimean Tatars, the indigenous Muslim people of the peninsula, who were deported to Central Asia en masse after World War Two and allowed to return only in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Those who returned now make up 12 percent of the population, having resurrected ancient cities that became ghost towns when their parents and grandparents were packed into rail cars on Stalin&#8217;s orders.</p>
<p>Many still harbour fierce hatred for Russia, and have long proudly boasted of their enthusiasm for independent Ukraine. Thousands of Tatars marched in favour of unity with Kiev last week on what proved to be the eve of the Russian takeover.</p>
<p>&#8220;My colleagues, the lawmakers &#8230; who voted for this are simply crazy,&#8221; Refat Chubarov, Tatar leader in Crimea&#8217;s parliament, said on Facebook. &#8220;It is clear that they are carrying out the will of others&#8230;. They have lost their minds!&#8221;</p>
<p>About 100 Tatar women gathered on a village roadside on Thursday to protest what they said was an occupation, chanting &#8220;Crimea is Ukraine&#8221; and &#8220;We are for peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many brought strollers and children in tow, holding blue and yellow balloons the colours of the Ukrainian flag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who needs war? Why are they here occupying our land?&#8221; said Safirnar Dzhamila, holding a poster of Putin&#8217;s face spliced with Hitler&#8217;s that read &#8220;Putin, hands off Ukraine!&#8221;.</p>
<p>Two ethnic Tatar women who moved here 20 years ago from Abkhazia &#8211; a region of Georgia now occupied by Russian forces after hundreds of thousands of Georgians were forced to flee in an ethnic conflict in the early 1990s &#8211; broke into tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were caught in exactly the same conflict. We fled with our grandchildren. Now it is happening all over again,&#8221; said Remize Khaibulayev, 58. &#8220;No one who hasn&#8217;t lived through war, knows what it is like. &#8230; We saw war, and hunger and refugees. Everyone is scared the soldiers will provoke something.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003153&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/barackobamam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003193" alt="This was the second telephonic conversation between Obama and Putin in less than a week. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/barackobamam.jpg" /></a> This was the second telephonic conversation between Obama and Putin in less than a week. (AP)
<p>US President Barack Obama has said that Russia&#8217;s actions are in violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and suggested that there is a diplomatic solution that would protect the interest of both Russia and Ukraine and end the worst East-West stand-off since the Cold War.</p>
<p>Obama spoke for an hour on Thursday afternoon with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin and told him that &#8220;there is a way to resolve the situation diplomatically, which addresses the interests of Russia, the people of Ukraine, and the international community&#8221;, the White House said in a statement.</p>
<p>This was the second telephonic conversation between the two leaders in less than a week. It came hours after Obama slapped sanctions and placed restrictions on individuals supporting the Russian incursion and activities undermining democratic processes in crisis-hit Ukraine.</p>
<p>The new restrictions were announced as the US began stepping up pressure on Moscow after Russian forces reportedly took control of Crimea, an autonomous peninsula within Ukraine with a Russian ethnic majority.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a part of that resolution, the governments of Ukraine and Russia would hold direct talks, facilitated by the international community; international monitors could ensure that the rights of all Ukrainians are protected, including ethnic Russians; Russian forces would return to their bases; and the international community would work together to support the Ukrainian people as they prepare for elections in May,&#8221; the White House said.</p>
<p>Obama indicated that Secretary of State John Kerry would continue discussions with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, Ukraine and other international partners in the days to come to advance those objectives, it said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the White House had said the US is pursuing and reviewing a wide range of options in response to Russia&#8217;s ongoing violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity – actions that constitute a threat to peace and security and a breach of international law. <strong></strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003149&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>President Barack Obama had nothing but respect for the &#8220;women of soul&#8221; who shook and rattled the rafters of the White House on Thursday night.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a lineup!&#8221; Obama declared at the outset of a concert that featured a generations-spanning array of soul singers that stretched from musical legends Aretha Franklin and Patti LaBelle to 20-year-old Ariana Grande.</p>
<p>Obama paid tribute to Franklin for turning her signature song &#8220;Respect&#8221; into &#8220;a rallying cry for African-Americans, women and then everyone who felt marginalized.&#8221;</p>
<p>First up in the East Room lineup was LaBelle, with a thundering delivery of &#8220;Over the Rainbow&#8221; that had the audience on its feet.</p>
<p>It was a mutual admiration society of sorts as LaBelle thanked the Obamas for their tenure in the White House, declaring, &#8220;Baby, you got swag!&#8221;</p>
<p>Grande, the youngster in the group, seemed in awe of her fellow performers and the august audience. Her lead-in: &#8220;What&#8217;s up? How are you? Good to see you. Thank you for having me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The emotional high point came when Franklin, 71, sauntered in, gave a shimmy and declared &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a party.&#8221; Then she went right into &#8220;I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)&#8221;</p>
<p>Also in the lineup: Melissa Etheridge, Janelle Monae, Jill Scott and Tessanne Chin.</p>
<p>The program was livestreamed at WhiteHouse.gov/live and will be broadcast as an &#8220;In Performance at the White House&#8221; concert on April 7 on PBS.</p>
<p>At a morning arts workshop for high school and college students, first lady Michelle Obama called soul &#8220;the kind of music that makes you move, no matter who you are or where you come from.&#8221;</p>
<p>LaBelle, Etheridge and Monae had plenty of stories and advice to share with the students, then got them whooping, hooting and swaying with a trio of songs in the intimate venue of the State Dining Room.</p>
<p>Mrs. Obama quoted LaBelle as once saying that she had succeeded because she &#8220;took chances and sang my butt off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first lady tried her own riff on that advice — then admitted she may have taken it a little too far.</p>
<p>&#8220;Find your own voice and be proud of it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And then, sing your butt off. Or work your butt off. Or whatever you do, do it until your butt comes off. &#8220;</p>
<p>Then she added: &#8220;OK, that quote is going to be kind of funny in the papers. I already know it. My communications people are like, &#8216;What?&#8217; But you guys all know what I meant — be good at what you do. &#8220;</p>
<p>The concert was scheduled as part of Women&#8217;s History Month.</p>
<p>Said the president: &#8220;As someone who always shares this house with brilliant, creative, talented, somewhat stubborn women, I think Women&#8217;s History Month is the perfect time to honor a few more: the women of soul.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003099&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/int.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003015" alt="A man holds a Soviet Union flag as he attends a pro-Russian rally at the Crimean parliament building in Simferopol Thursday. reuters" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/int.jpg" /></a> A man holds a Soviet Union flag as he attends a pro-Russian rally at the Crimean parliament building in Simferopol Thursday. reuters
<p><strong>By: AP &amp; Reuters</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Ukraine lurched toward break-up Thursday when lawmakers in Crimea unanimously declared they wanted to join Russia and would put the decision to voters in 10 days — and Russian lawmakers pushed a bill to facilitate a handover. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s hand was almost certainly behind the dramatic move, but it was not clear whether he is aiming for outright annexation, or simply strengthening his hand in talks with the West.</span></p>
<p>The West’s response was less forceful: The EU announced limited punitive measures against Putin’s government — including the suspension of trade and visa talks — and the US said it was imposing travel restrictions on opponents of Ukraine’s new government. Both were discussing further sanctions.</p>
<p>Crimea’s parliament rammed through what amounted to a declaration of independence from Ukraine, announcing it would let the Crimean people, 60 percent of whom are ethnic Russian, decide whether they want to become part of their gigantic neighbor to the east.</p>
<p>“This is our response to the disorder and lawlessness in Kiev,” said Sergei Shuvainikov, a member of the legislature. “We will decide our future ourselves.”</p>
<p>Ukraine’s prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk swiftly denounced the action and said were ready to use the military to defend itself and its regions against Russia.</p>
<p>As an emergency EU summit got underway in Brussels, a senior Western diplomat promised that EU leaders “will send a clear message that the referendum won’t be recognized”.</p>
<p>But the punishment later announced seemed more symbolic than substantive: EU President Herman Van Rompuy declared that the bloc was suspending talks with Russia on a wide-ranging economic pact and on a visa deal, and would consider further measures if Russia does not quickly open meaningful dialogue.</p>
<p>In Moscow, a prominent member of Russia’s parliament, Sergei Mironov, said he has introduced a bill to simplify the procedure for Crimea to join Russia and it could be passed as soon as next week. Another senior lawmaker, Leonid Slutsky, said the parliament could consider such a motion after the referendum.</p>
<p>For Putin, Crimea would be a dazzling acquisition, and help cement his authority with a Russian citizenry that has in recent years shown signs of restiveness and still resents the loss of the sprawling empire Moscow ruled in Soviet times. The peninsula was once Russia’s imperial crown jewel, a lush land seized by Catherine the Great in the 18th century that evokes Russia’s claim to greatness as a world power.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the US Congress moved to advance legislation imposing punitive sanctions on the Kremlin, and the US House of Representatives was poised Thursday to pass the first aid bill for Ukraine’s new, pro-West government. Earlier Thursday, the Obama administration slapped new visa restrictions on Russian and Ukrainian opponents of Ukraine’s new government.</p>
<p>The measures targeted an unspecified and unidentified number of people and entities that the Obama administration accuses of threatening Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial borders.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003012&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pervez-4802.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1982540" alt="The special court had dismissed 70-year-old Musharraf's appeal to conduct the treason trial of the former president in a military court on February 21." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pervez-4802.jpg" /></a> The special court had dismissed 70-year-old Musharraf&#8217;s appeal to conduct the treason trial of the former president in a military court on February 21.
<p>Embattled former Pakistani military dictator Pervez Musharraf will soon challenge in the Supreme Court the rejection of his appeal for conducting his high-profile treason trial in a military court.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have decided to challenge the order of the Special Court. It is still under process,&#8221; key lawyer in Musharraf&#8217;s legal team Mohammad Ali Saif said.</p>
<p>He clarified that no petition has been filed as being reported by a section of the local media. The special court had dismissed 70-year-old Musharraf&#8217;s appeal to conduct the treason trial of the former president in a military court on February 21.</p>
<p>The court had dismissed Musharraf&#8217;s petition saying it has the mandate to try him. Initially, Musharraf had filed three applications that challenged the appointment of the head of the prosecution team, the establishment and the jurisdiction of the special court.<br />
Musharraf is scheduled to appear before the Special Court on March 11.</p>
<p>He is likely to be indicted on that day. He faces treason charges for suspending, subverting and abrogating the Constitution, imposing an emergency and detaining judges of the superior courts.</p>
<p>If convicted, he could face life imprisonment or the death penalty. This is the first time in Pakistan&#8217;s history that a former military chief is facing trial for treason.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002743&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Riot police have used tear gas and pepper spray during scuffles with union members protesting austerity measures, during a ban on demonstrations in parts of central Athens due to a visit by German President Joachim Gauck.</p>
<p>Scuffles broke out today when a group of several dozen demonstrators attempted to break through a police cordon on a major avenue in an effort to march to the Finance Ministry.</p>
<p>The demonstrations were unrelated to the visit by Gauck, who was meeting with his Greek counterpart and was due to visit the site of a Nazi massacre in central Greece tomorrow.</p>
<p>Authorities banned all demonstrations from 8 AM to 7 PM local time in parts of the city, citing security concerns.</p>
<p>Several hundred union members, mainly construction workers, had already scheduled demonstrations.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002722&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An American anchor for the Moscow-funded Russia Today television network resigned live on air in protest at the deployment of Russia-backed forces in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Liz Wahl said during a broadcast on Wednesday that she could no longer work for the network, which she accused of &#8221;whitewashing&#8221; moves by Russian leader Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>&#8220;My grandparents came here as refugees during the Hungarian revolution, ironically to escape the Soviet forces,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally, I cannot be part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of Putin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m proud to be an American and believe in disseminating the truth, and that is why, after this newscast, I am resigning.&#8221;</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='480' height='267' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/8p2KK0g7kKE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>Her resignation comes after another US-based RT host, Abby Martin, criticized the actions of pro-Russian military units on her show.</p>
<p>Reacting to the latest embarrassment, RT accused Wahl of a &#8220;self-promotional stunt&#8221; and questioned her professionalism.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a journalist disagrees with the editorial position of his or her organization, the usual course of action is to address those grievances with the editor, and, if they cannot be resolved, to quit like a professional,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when someone makes a big public show of a personal decision, it is nothing more than a self-promotional stunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Margarita Simonyan, RT&#8217;s editor-in-chief, posted a staunch defence of the network, saying its reporters were being persecuted in a media &#8220;war&#8221; with the West.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was never such persecution of our journalists and the entire channel as there is now,&#8221; wrote the 33-year-old on her LiveJournal blog.</p>
<p>&#8220;Abby and Liz are different guys, they are not Russian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Their motherland is now comparing my motherland to Nazi Germany&#8230; No, there is a real war, not in Crimea, thank God, but in the media,&#8221; Simonyan wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is tough to be the black sheep,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Why do I continue working on the channel which alone is resisting thousands, tens of thousands of Western media by telling a different side of the story?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because this is my motherland and there is no other way for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to CNN, Wahl said she hesitated before deciding to make her views public.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feared what measures they would take against me, what retaliatory measures they would take against me,&#8221; she said, adding that she had been &#8220;contemplating quitting for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s become very clear&#8230; especially in the face of this crisis with Crimea, is that the objective of RT has been to promote the Putinist propaganda, to promote the conflict as Putin wants us to see it and to bash the US,&#8221; Wahl said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002709&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lawmakers in the embattled Crimean region of Ukraine have decided to hold a referendum March 16 on whether Crimea should become part of Russia.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our response to the disorder and lawlessness in Kiev,&#8221; Sergei Shuvainikov, a member of the local Crimean legislature, said Thursday. &#8220;We will decide our future ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The parliament in Crimea, which enjoys a degree of autonomy under current Ukrainian law, voted 78 with eight abstentions in favor of holding the referendum. Local voters will also be given the choice of deciding to remain part of Ukraine, but with enhanced local powers.</p>
<p>There was no immediate response from the Ukrainian central government to the vote. On Wednesday, Ukraine&#8217;s prime minister told The Associated Press that Crimea would remain part of Ukraine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002549&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A NATO airstrike in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday accidentally killed five Afghan soldiers, government officials said, while the coalition said it was investigating reports of the incident.</p>
<p>The deaths are likely to worsen already fraught relations between the US-led NATO coalition and President Hamid Karzai, who has often seized on botched airstrikes to launch bitter criticism of the international military effort in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;At 3:30 am on Thursday Morning, due to a NATO airstrike in Charkh district, Logar province, five service members of the Afghan national army were martyred and eight others were wounded,&#8221; defence ministry spokesman Zahir Azimi said on his Twitter account.  Khalilullah Kamal, the Charkh district governor, said he had visited the site of the attack, which he said was from a US drone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The post is totally destroyed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Americans used to be in that post but since they left, the ANA (Afghan army) took over. The post is on a hilltop. The attack was conducted by drones.&#8221;</p>
<p>President Karzai, who is due to stand down after elections on April 5, in an interview this week expressed his &#8220;extreme anger&#8221; towards the United States as it prepares to end its 13-year war in Afghanistan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002431&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Niger on Thursday extradited to Libya one of Moammar Gaddafi&#8217;s sons, al-Saadi, who fled as his father&#8217;s regime crumbled in 2011 and who was under house arrest in the desert West African nation ever since, the government in Tripoli said.<br />    <br />The authorities said al-Saadi, one of the deposed Libyan leader&#8217;s eight children, will be treated &#8220;in accordance with international law.&#8221;<br />    <br />A Libyan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said al-Saadi arrived early on Thursday at the Tripoli airport and was transferred to a prison in the capital.<br />    <br />Shortly after the news broke, photographs circulated on social media showing al-Saadi in a blue prison uniform while Libyan guards were shaving his hair and beard.<br />    <br />Al-Saadi was known for his love of professional soccer and a playboy lifestyle. His brief career in Italian football ended after a failed drug test. He headed Libya&#8217;s Football Federation and was also former head of the country&#8217;s special forces.<br />    <br />Like most of Gaddafi loyalists and ex-regime officials, al-Saadi is wanted for his role in curbing protests against his father&#8217;s rule and the killing of protesters.<br />    <br />But unlike his brother, Seif al-Islam, who was groomed to be Gaddafi&#8217;s successor, al-Saadi is not sought by the<br />International Criminal Court. Seif al-Islam is held by a militia in the western Libyan town of Zintan, which refuses to hand him over to the central government for trial.<br />    <br />With the extradition, al-Saadi joins Seif al-Islam as the only two of Gaddafi&#8217;s children currently in Libya. At least three other Gaddafi&#8217;s sons were killed during the uprising while the rest of the children sought asylum in neighbouring Algeria, along with Gaddafi&#8217;s wife and al-Saadi&#8217;s mother, Safiya.</p>
<p>The mother, a sister and two brothers, were granted asylum in Oman in 2012 and moved there from Algeria.<br />    <br />The rule of law is still weak in Libya after decades of Gaddafi&#8217;s reign. Courts are still paralysed and security<br />remains tenuous as unruly militias proliferate.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002435&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A rising China is unlikely to threaten the pre-eminence of the US military power globally, a top Pentagon commander has said, after Beijing&#8217;s move to hike its defence budget by more than 12 per cent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pre-eminence of the US military power globally will remain in place for a long time, and that even a rising China will not be able to globally threaten that,&#8221; Navy Admiral Samuel Locklear, Commander of the US Pacific Command (PACOM), told lawmakers during a Congressional hearing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think where we have the most concern are in the region &#8211; where we happen to have four or five very important allies to us &#8211; where the PRC has introduced some of their military capabilities that on the surface would appear to want to deny access to the United States and limit our ability to defend our allies and to protect our interests in that region,&#8221; Locklear said.</p>
<p>Locklear said that the US should not be surprised by China&#8217;s desire to build a military to defend their interests, both regionally and globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should also be recognising that as a rising China, there is benefit to the world for a peaceful, prosperous China that is transparent and that participates in the international institutions and is a net provider of security rather than a net user of security,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Locklear also lamented the &#8220;slow but steady&#8221; relationship between China and the US.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are making progress and kind of breaking down the barriers we have to understand each other. This is an essential part of having a peaceful, prosperous, stable China that has a military that helps,&#8221; Locklear said.</p>
<p>The PACOM Commander, however, said the Chinese military is on the rise and wondered whether the world will see it as a net provider of security or whether Beijing will use its muscle to pursue regional claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;So whether their military will rise, I think that is a given. It will. The question is, is it transparent?  What is it used for?  Is it in cooperation in the larger security environment that its neighbours and that we as a Pacific nation want them included?  So that remains the question to see how they proceed,&#8221; Locklear said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002422&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 21-year-old Indian-origin university student has mysteriously disappeared while enjoying a vacation with friends in the US state of Florida.</p>
<p>Reny Jose, a mechanical engineering major and a member of Martel College at Rice University, was on a spring break at the time of his disappearance in the Panama City Beach,Florida.</p>
<p>The Bay CountyOffice Sheriff&#8217;s in Florida has been searching for him after Jose was last seen on Monday evening.</p>
<p>His friends told authorities that he went for a walk in the evening and never returned. He arrived to Panama City<br />
Beach on Saturday with his friends.</p>
<p>The Sheriff&#8217;s Office was contacted by Jose&#8217;s friends who reported him missing from the beach-front home he was<br />
renting.</p>
<p>Jose&#8217;s clothing and personal items were found in a garbage can near the home, including his mobile phone.</p>
<p>The family of the college student left for Panama City Beach to help with the search efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were contacted yesterday by the Sheriff&#8217;s Department notifying us that he was reported missing and that they were conducting search efforts,&#8221; said Jismi George, Reny Jose&#8217;s cousin.</p>
<p>A Sheriff&#8217;s Office Air Unit has been covering the area and surrounding beaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just pretty much working with what we have right now and that&#8217;s not too much, so you know they&#8217;re doing<br />
the best they can but obviously they are not doing too well,&#8221; George said.</p>
<p>Jose&#8217;s sister, Reashma Jose, has created a Facebook page to help find her brother. &#8220;My family and I are so<br />
thankful for all your prayers and support,&#8221; Reashma wrote on the social media site.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is the third Indian-American student who has gone missing in the last few weeks, with their<br />
parents originally from Kerala.</p>
<p>Jasmine Joseph, 22, a nursing student from New York has been missing for over a week now.</p>
<p>Southern Illinois University student Pravin Varughese was found dead in Carbondale after missing for six days.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002407&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ladies, beware of what you wear &#8211; if you are in Massachusetts!</p>
<p>The top court in Massachusetts has ruled that &#8216;upskirting&#8217; &#8211; the practice of secretly photographing under a woman&#8217;s skirt &#8211; is not prohibited by state law.</p>
<p>The shocking decision by the Massachusetts&#8217;s high court said that a state law intended to prohibit &#8216;Peeping Tom&#8217; voyeurism of completely or partially undressed people did not apply to those who take pictures of people who are fully clothed.</p>
<p>The ruling on Wednesday exonerated a man previously charged with taking unauthorised pictures of women on a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority trolly.</p>
<p>Michael Robertson was charged in December 2011 with the act before successfully appealing the ruling to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, &#8216;Boston.com&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The court focused on the language of the law, which prohibits secret photography of &#8220;a person &#8230; who is partially nude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A female passenger on a MBTA trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering [private] parts of her bodyis not a person who is &#8216;partially nude&#8217;, no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing,&#8221; the court said in its ruling.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Speaker of the House Robert DeLeo described the court&#8217;s ruling as obeying a legal loophole that he intends to change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ruling of the Supreme Judicial Court is contrary to the spirit of the current law. The House will begin work on updating our statutes to conform with today&#8217;s technology immediately,&#8221; DeLeo said.</p>
<p>According to &#8216;New York Daily News&#8217;, several Twitter users also immediately voiced criticism, with one woman writing: &#8220;Not all assault is physical. &#8216;Upskirting&#8217; is a disgusting violation. And it&#8217;s just been given the green light by a court.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002398&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/venezuelam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002365" alt="A demonstrator returns teargas to Bolivarian National Police during clashes in Caracas. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/venezuelam.jpg" /></a> A demonstrator returns teargas to Bolivarian National Police during clashes in Caracas. (AP)
<p>Thousands of Venezuelans mourned the passing of President Hugo Chavez on the first anniversary of his death Wednesday, while National Guard troops fired tear gas and rubber bullets at anti-government activists who pressed on with street protests despite the commemorations.</p>
<p>Chavez&#8217;s successor, President Nicolas Maduro, angrily announced that he would break off relations with Panama, which he accused of being a &#8220;lackey&#8221; of the US in what he has repeatedly called a conspiracy to topple his government through the daily protests that have left at least 18 dead since mid-February.</p>
<p>Maduro said he made the move because Panama asked for the Organization of American States to study the situation in Venezuela. Maduro considers the OAS to be dominated by the US government, which has denied his claims that it is acting against Venezuela&#8217;s government.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t accept the interventionism of anyone, because our international policy is a policy of peace, of cooperation, of respect, of the anti-imperialist Latin American union,&#8221; Maduro said.</p>
<p>Panama&#8217;s Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing &#8220;astonishment&#8221; at Maduro&#8217;s action and called his comments &#8220;unacceptable insults.&#8221; It denied that the request for the OAS to discuss Venezuela was interference in Venezuelan affairs, saying the proposal had the  &#8220;sole purpose to assist in bringing together the different actors in that sister country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Venezuela is mired in economic crisis and daily anti-government demonstrations, and Wednesday was no exception as protests erupted in at least six cities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The National Guard attacked with a lot of fury against the guys and used tractors to violently take down the barricades,&#8221; said Mari Marcano, a protester on the tourist island of Margarita. &#8220;They launched a lot of tear gas, shot rubber bullets.&#8221;</p>
<p>In restive central Lara state, the leader of a small center-left opposition party, Hector Alzaul Planchart, was shot dead by unknown assailants as he left his party offices in Barquisimeto, according to media reports.</p>
<p>Despite the protests, the pomp-soaked anniversary of Chavez&#8217;s passing was a time for sadness and nostalgia for many Venezuelans. Thousands gathered at the capital&#8217;s parade grounds to honor the socialist leader who died of cancer on March 5, 2013.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t like an anniversary; it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re mourning,&#8221; said Gledis Hernandez, 43, who took her daughter and niece to the memorial parade in Caracas. She said Chavez gave her an apartment when her home was washed away in floods, but &#8220;right now we&#8217;re living in a sad situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vendors hawked Chavez T-shirts, pins and hats. Visitors were given a newspaper upon entering the area with the headline &#8220;Chavez lives!&#8221; on the front and a cardboard cutout of Chavez riding a bike tucked within. Inside, tanks and soldiers paraded before a waving Maduro and military jets screamed overhead.</p>
<p>The military parade, attended by Chavez friends Bolivian President Evo Morales, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and Cuban President Raul Castro among others, kicked off a 10-day commemoration. Afterward, they participated in a ceremony at Chavez&#8217;s hilltop mausoleum, and that was followed by the television premier of Oliver Stone&#8217;s documentary &#8220;My Friend Hugo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maduro seems in a stalemate with the political opposition. His administration shows no sign of crumbling, but he appears unable to stop the student-led protests. Instead, he moves ahead with a peace effort that the opposition calls farcical while his foreign minister rebuffs offers for outside mediation.</p>
<p>Inflation in Venezuela hit 56 percent last year, slashing the buying power of the poor who Chavez lifted above the poverty line using the state&#8217;s oil profits. Simple grocery shopping has become a daily odyssey as residents hunt for scarce items like flour, cooking oil and toilet paper, and wait hours in line when they&#8217;re lucky enough to find them.</p>
<p>Luisa Teresa Guzman, 64, said she still cries over Chavez. Wearing a red beret, red shirt and red pants at the entrance to the parade grounds, she said Maduro can carry the revolution forward. &#8220;That&#8217;s why Chavez left him there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a month of protests has drawn international attention to the country&#8217;s struggles.</p>
<p>In San Antonio de los Altos, in Miranda state, protesters blocked roads, but were driven off by hundreds of National Guard troops, national police and other authorities with tear gas and rubber bullets. Protests were also reported in Valencia, San Cristobal, Merida and Barinas.</p>
<p>Ruben Velasquez, 44, making his way from the parade grounds, said the protests are simply an expression of the situation people are living now in Venezuela.</p>
<p>He said life had worsened in every way since Chavez&#8217;s death, particularly with regard to the economy and crime. He supports Maduro, because he works in the government customs agency, but only to a point.</p>
<p>&#8220;If things escape from his (Maduro) hands I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s going to have support from anyone,&#8221; Velasquez said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002304&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The European Union added a significant financial underpinning to the struggling Ukraine government on Wednesday in the midst of the East-West crisis with Russia over Ukraine’s future, offering aid worth as much as $15 billion over the next two years.</span></p>
<p>The offer comes on top of the $1 billion in American loan guarantees to ease Ukraine’s economic transition, announced here on Tuesday by Secretary of State John Kerry during a visit aimed at reassuring the interim Ukraine authorities and challenging Russia, which escalated the crisis last weekend by seizing control of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Kerry met later on Wednesday in Paris with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V Lavrov, as part of an attempt to arrange the first face-to-face talks between representatives of the Russian and interim Ukraine governments since the crisis boiled over. The Russians have refused to recognise the interim Ukraine government’s legitimacy.</p>
<p>Lavrov insisted earlier Wednesday in Madrid that Russia had no control over “self-defense forces” in Crimea, which Russian troops have effectively occupied, surrounding and neutralising the thin Ukrainian military presence there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Russia accused Ukraine of &#8220;hallucinating&#8221; on Wednesday after Kiev warned a UN atomic agency meeting of risks to the safety of its nuclear power plants in case of a Russian invasion, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Envoys of the two neighbours engaged in a fiery verbal exchange during a session of the 35-nation governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), diplomats who attended the closed-door discussions said.</p>
<p>The standoff in Crimea, and the larger struggle over Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that is deeply intertwined with Russia economically, are at the heart of these diplomatic and financial maneuvers.</p>
<p>The offers of loans are crucial, because Ukraine is in dire economic shape, with a promised Russian loan of $15 billion in abeyance since the ouster of Yanukovych and Russia’s decision on Tuesday to cancel a large discount on natural gas supplies.</p>
<p>The American and European offers are also intended to answer political criticism in Washington and some European countries that the West is not doing enough to support Ukraine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001772&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Israeli naval forces raided a ship in the Red Sea early Wednesday and seized dozens of advanced rockets from Iran destined for Palestinian militants in Gaza, the military said.</p>
<p>The ship, the KLOS C, was carrying Syrian-made M-302 rockets and was intercepted more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) south of Israel off the coasts of Sudan and Eritrea, military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner told reporters.</p>
<p>He said the M-302 rockets have a range of up to 100 miles (160 kilometers) and would have significantly improved the capabilities of Gaza militants, putting nearly all of Israel in their range. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah used M-302s in a 2006 war with Israel, the military says.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from Iranian officials about the Israeli claims.</p>
<p>The operation, codenamed &#8220;Full Disclosure,&#8221; followed months of intelligence gathering. Lerner said the shipment originated in Syria. From there the weapons were flown to Iran and departed from the Bandar Abbas port. Lerner said the Iranians tried to &#8220;obscure their tracks&#8221; by shipping first via Iraq and then out to sea. The shipment was destined for Sudan from where it would be moved overland through Egypt to Gaza. Israel says militants have used similar routes in the past.</p>
<p>Lerner said the 17-man crew of the ship, flying under a Panama flag, were not suspects and were probably unaware of the cargo. The vessel was being brought to Israel.</p>
<p>Video released by the military showed Israeli soldiers on the ship inspecting the rockets, which were kept in large boxes. The video also showed beige bags containing cement with the words &#8220;Made in Iran,&#8221; in English, written on them.</p>
<p>Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said the weapons were &#8220;strategically important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Iran trains, funds and arms terror groups in the region and around the world and its failed attempts to transfer the arms that were discovered this morning is more proof of that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamic militant group that already possesses thousands of rockets. A number of smaller groups, including the Iranian-backed Islamic Jihad, and al-Qaida-inspired groups also possess rockets. The military did not specify which group the shipment was believed to be destined for.</p>
<p>Israel accuses Iran of supplying rockets and other arms to its foes — militants in Gaza and Lebanon&#8217;s Hezbollah — and it has moved to intercept weapons shipments in the past.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Israel seized the cargo ship Victoria loaded with weapons sent by Iran to Gaza militants, including land-to-sea missiles.</p>
<p>In November 2009, Israel took over the Iranian Francop vessel off the coast of Cyprus and captured hundreds of tons of rockets, missiles, mortars, grenades and anti-tank weapons on board that it said were headed to Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Israel is also suspected of carrying out airstrikes in Sudan on arms shipments believed to be bound for Gaza. Israel has never confirmed carrying out the strikes.</p>
<p>In January 2002, Israeli forces stormed the Karine A freighter on the Red Sea, and confiscated what the military said was 50 tons of missiles, mortars, rifles and ammunition headed for Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>In May 2001 off its coast, Israel captured the vessel Santorini, packed with explosives that Israel said were being sent from Hezbollah to Palestinian militant groups.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001620&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The United States says Iran must clear up suspicions it worked on atomic arms if it hopes to get full relief from sanctions choking its economy.</p>
<p>Iran and six world powers now are working on a deal that highlights sanctions relief in exchange for agreement by Tehran to scale back nuclear programs that could be turned toward making a bomb.</p>
<p>But U.S. envoy Joseph Macmanus told the International Atomic Energy Agency&#8217;s 35-nation board Wednesday that Tehran must also fully cooperate with the IAEA in its probe of the weapons allegations.</p>
<p>He says clearing up suspicions that Iran worked on nuclear arms &#8220;will be critical&#8221; to any final accord meant to give Tehran full final sanctions relief.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001590&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/eu-women480.jpg" /></a> Ten per cent of respondents reported some form of sexual violence since the age of 15, with one in 20 saying she had been raped. (AP)
<p>A survey of 42,000 women across the European Union suggests that about one in 10 have been the victims of sexual violence, and half of them reported being raped.</p>
<p>Described as the largest of its kind, the survey released on Wednesday by the EU&#8217;s Agency for Fundamental Rights is the most ambitious effort yet to gauge the extent of sexual violence  and harassment experienced by the 186.6 million women in the EU&#8217;s 28 nations.</p>
<p>The survey suggests that more than 100 million women were subject to sexual harassment broadly defined in 11 categories ranging from indecent exposure to inappropriate requests for a date. Only one woman in seven reported their most serious incident of intimate partner violence to police. Released on International Women&#8217;s Day, the EU survey was based on face-to-face interviews with women aged between 15 and 74 in all 28 EU countries.</p>
<p>It was conducted from March to September 2012 by a consortium headed the UN -affiliated European Institute for Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the UN Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 1.5 per centage points.</p>
<p><strong>Among the findings:</strong></p>
<p>RAPE AND OTHER SEXUAL VIOLENCE</p>
<p>Ten per cent of respondents reported some form of sexual violence since the age of 15, with one in 20 saying she had been raped. That would be more than 9 million rape victims when applied to all women between 15 and 74 in the EU. CHILDHOOD ABUSE</p>
<p>Twelve per cent reported some form of sexual abuse by an adult before age 15, with 1 per cent indicating they were forced to have intercourse with an adult. Some 27 per cent reported physical abuse before age 15 at the hands of an adult. Men were perpetrators of 97 per cent of cases of sexual violence against children, but in cases of physical violence men slightly outnumbered women.</p>
<p>ABUSE WITHIN A RELATIONSHIP</p>
<p>Of respondents who are or have been in a relationship with a man, 22 per cent reported physical and or sexual violence from their partner. Some form of &#8220;psychological violence&#8221; by a current or previous partner was reported by 43 per cent. Examples included humiliation, threats of physical harm and limitations on freedom of movement such as taking away respondents&#8217; car keys or locking them in.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001272&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pak-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001267" alt="he US maintained USD 280 million in military aid to Pakistan for the fiscal year 2015 beginning in October 2014. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pak-med.jpg" /></a> Under the FMF, the US maintained USD 280 million in military aid to Pakistan for the fiscal year 2015 beginning in October 2014. (Reuters)
<p>Arguing that Pakistan will remain a key player in counter terrorism post-2014, the US has proposed USD 280 million in military assistance to the country, although it wants to cut civilian aid in an effort to acknowledge India&#8217;s concerns about misuse of the funds.</p>
<p>Marred by financial constraints, the Obama administration has proposed to substantially cut civilian aid to Pakistan to USD 446 million for the next fiscal year as against USD 703 million in 2013, which among other things the State Department argued is aimed at improving ties with India.</p>
<p>&#8220;The OCO (Overseas Contingency Operations) resources will support critical US activities such as sustaining close cooperation with Pakistan, ensuring the safety of Pakistani nuclear installations, working with Pakistan to facilitate the peace process in Afghanistan, and promoting improved relations with India,&#8221; the State Department said as it proposed USD 446 million in civilian aid to Pakistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;FY 2015 funding for Pakistan is crucial to meeting key US strategic priorities of combating terrorism, strengthening security in both Pakistan and the region, and maintaining stability in Afghanistan post-transition,&#8221;the Department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pakistan will remain a key player in US counter terrorism and nuclear nonproliferation efforts in FY 2015, as well as in our long-term objectives of economic development and stability in the region,&#8221; the State Department said in its annual budget proposals to the Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developing an enduring and collaborative relationship with an increasingly stable and prosperous Pakistan that plays a constructive role in the region will therefore continue to be a priority for the United States,&#8221; the State Department said proposing USD 100 million to Pakistan under the Economic Support Fund (ESF) for the fiscal year 2015.</p>
<p>Under the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) category, the US maintained USD 280 million in military aid to Pakistan for the fiscal year 2015 beginning in October 2014.</p>
<p>Given the ongoing transition in Afghanistan and continued terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets throughout Pakistan, FMF is essential to Pakistan&#8217;s efforts to increase stability in its western border region and ensure overall stability within its own borders, the Department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The USD 280 million Pakistan requests will enhance the Pakistan Army, Frontier Corps, Air Force, and Navy&#8217;s ability to conduct counter insurgency (COIN) and counter terrorism (CT) operations against militants throughout its borders and will improve Pakistan&#8217;s ability to deter threats emanating from those areas, and encourage continued US-Pakistan military-to-military engagement,&#8221; the State Department said.</p>
<p>The OCO supports a robust diplomatic presence and critical assistance programmes to support the government and its people following Pakistan&#8217;s first democratic transition.</p>
<p>&#8220;These funds will help facilitate increased stability and prosperity in this strategically important nation and will enable us to sustain a presence necessary to achieve essential strategic priorities of eliminating terrorism and enhancing stability in Pakistan and the region following the transition in Afghanistan,&#8221; the State Department said.</p>
<p>Pakistan lies at the heart of the US&#8217; counter terrorism strategy, the peace process in Afghanistan, nuclear non-proliferation efforts, and economic integration in South and Central Asia, it said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001224&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama-llll1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001160" alt="Obama was speaking to a group of more than 40 donors who paid $10,000 to $32,400 a ticket to attend a Democratic Senatorial Campaign (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama-llll1.jpg" /></a> Obama was speaking to a group of more than 40 donors who paid $10,000 to $32,400 a ticket to attend a Democratic Senatorial Campaign (Reuters)
<p>Democrats need to wake up and understand the stakes involved in holding on to control of the US Senate in the November congressional elections, President Barack Obama told Democratic Party donors at a fundraiser on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something about midterms &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what it is about us. We get a little sleepy. We get a little distracted. We don&#8217;t turn out the vote. We don&#8217;t fund campaigns as passionately,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That has to change and it&#8217;s got to change right here because too much is at stake for us to let this opportunity slip by,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Obama was speaking to a group of more than 40 donors who paid $10,000 to $32,400 a ticket to attend a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee event at the home of former Senator Chuck Robb and his wife, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb.</p>
<p>It is one of 30 fundraisers the president plans to headline through June. He will attend two more on Wednesday in Boston.</p>
<p>Obama said he planned to devote time and energy to working for Democratic candidates because advancing issues ranging from the environment to women&#8217;s health issues depend on keeping control of the Senate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I want to do is just emphasize the degree to which everything you all care about, advancing every issue that is of deep concern to you, depends on us successfully maintaining a Democratically controlled Senate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You better hope Democrats stay in the saddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>A third of the 100-member Senate is up for grabs in November elections as well as all 435 seats in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Republicans believe they have a good chance to pick up the six seats they need to take control of the Senate based on public dissatisfaction with Obama. Democrats are in a tight spot, forced to defend 21 seats to only 14 for Republicans.</p>
<p>That has prompted the White House this year to promote populist measures such as raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance benefits and investing in preschool programs.</p>
<p>In the 2010 midterms, Republicans took control of the House after what Obama called a &#8220;shellacking&#8221; from voters frustrated with the economy. &#8220;We paid a dear price for not paying enough attention,&#8221; Obama told donors on Tuesday, recalling the 2010 losses.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001144&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/turkey-pm-480.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1992778" alt="Turkey-PM-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/turkey-pm-480.jpg" /></a> Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan. (AP)
<p>Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday that it was largely up to Ukrainians to resolve their country&#8217;s crisis, and said instability in the Black Sea nation would have regional repercussions.</p>
<p>The leaders spoke by telephone about the situation in Ukraine and its southerly Crimea region, which lie across the Black Sea from Turkey. Crimea has a large Turkic speaking minority and is now under Moscow&#8217;s control. Erdogan told Putin &#8220;that it is foremost the responsibility of Ukrainians to resolve the country&#8217;s crisis&#8221; and emphasised that &#8220;instability in (Ukraine) would negatively affect the entire region&#8221;, a statement from Erdogan&#8217;s office said.</p>
<p>A Kremlin statement focused on Crimea and suggested the two leaders were in broad agreement. &#8220;Both sides expressed certainty that, despite the aggressive actions of radical and extremist forces of the Maidan, there would be success in providing for inter-ethnic and interfaith peace and calm in Crimea,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Maidan&#8221; refers to the square in the Ukrainian capital that was the focus of a bloody, three-month political confrontation that led to the overthrow of Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich last month.</p>
<p>There is tension in Crimea between Christian Slavs, including ethnic Russians, and Crimean Tatars &#8211; Turkic speaking Muslims who were exiled en masse by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin but now make up about 12 percent of Crimea&#8217;s population.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000897&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jinping-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000799" alt="People of all ethnic groups of the country should cherish ethnic unity, said Jinping." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jinping-med.jpg" /></a> People of all ethnic groups of the country should cherish ethnic unity, said Jinping.
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called for resolute opposition to any act that could damage the country&#8217;s ethnic unity amid growing anger over the recent knife attacks by militants from Xinjiang in Kunming.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will build a &#8216;wall of bronze and iron&#8217; for ethnic unity, social stability and national unity,&#8221; he said while joining a panel discussion with members from the minority ethnic groups of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>The tradition of all ethnic groups in the country &#8220;breathing the same air and sharing the same fate&#8221; should be handed down from generation to generation, Xi was quoted as saying by state-run Xinhua news agency. &#8220;Unity and stability are blessings, while secession and turmoil are disasters. People of all ethnic groups of the country should cherish ethnic unity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His comments came amid growing anger among the majority Han community over the mass knife attack at the railway station in Kunming, capital of southwest Yunnan Province, on Saturday that left 33 people killed and over 143 injured. Chinese police held al-Qaeda linked East Turkestan Islamic Movement, fighting for the independence of Xinjiang, responsible for the gruesome attacks. Four militants from the eight-member group, including two women, which carried out the attacks, have been captured.</p>
<p>Local native Muslim Uyghurs in the northwestern Xinjiang province felt agitated with increasing settlements of majority Han Chinese from mainland China.</p>
<p>Xi also urged that everything possible be done to accelerate the social and economic development of China&#8217;s minority ethnic groups and the ethnic areas and to bring concrete benefits to people there. Meanwhile, a self-exiled Uyghur leader urged China not to crackdown on the Uyghurs in Xinjiang for what the militant have done.</p>
<p>Strongly condemning the violence, Rebiya Kadeer, leader of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress (WUC), said: &#8220;It is absolutely vital the Chinese government deal with the longstanding and deteriorating human rights issues facing Uyghurs if tensions are to be reduced.&#8221;</p>
<p>BBC quoted WUC statement as saying that it &#8220;unequivocally condemns the violence&#8221; and also expressed condolences to thevictims of the attack and their families. It urged Beijing &#8220;to refrain from using this as a pretext to further and indiscriminately crackdown on Uyghurs as precedents suggest, and to show a measured response&#8221;, it said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000795&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday  met Myanmar&#8217;s pro-democracy icon and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>The meeting between Singh and Suu Kyi, held after the 3rd BIMSTEC Summit, was warm and cordial, officials said. Suu Kyi is a Nobel laureate and the chairperson and secretary general of the opposition party National League for Democracy.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi, 68, who has studied at New Delhi&#8217;s Lady Shri Ram College, came to India in 2012 on the invitation of UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi to deliver the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Lecture.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi spent several years in India during her early days when her mother Daw Khin Yi was Ambassador to the country. She was freed in 2010 after being kept in house arrest in Myanmar for years by the military junta.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000776&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/putin-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000767" alt="Putin had ordered tens ofthousands of Russian troops participating in military exercises near Ukraine's border to return to their bases." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/putin-med.jpg" /></a> Putin had ordered tens of thousands of Russian troops participating in military exercises near Ukraine&#8217;s border to return to their bases.
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow reserves the right to use all means to protect Russianin Ukraine as US Secretary of State John Kerry was on his wayto Kiev.</p>
<p>Tensions remained high in the strategic Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea with troops loyal to Moscow firing warning shots to ward off protesting Ukrainian soldiers.</p>
<p>In first comments since fugitive Ukraine President ViktorYanukovych fled Kiev, Putin said he considers him to still beUkraine&#8217;s leader, and hopes that Russia won&#8217;t need to use force in predominantly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine. Earlier, the Kremlin said Putin had ordered tens of thousands of Russian troops participating in military exercises near Ukraine&#8217;s border to return to their bases.</p>
<p>The massive military exercise in western Russia involving 150,000 troops, hundreds of tanks and dozens of aircraft was supposed to wrap up anyway, so it was not clear if Putin&#8217;s move was an attempt to heed the West&#8217;s call to de-escalate the crisis that has put Ukraine&#8217;s future on the line.</p>
<p>It came as Kerry was on his way to Kiev to meet with the new Ukrainian leadership that deposed a pro-Russian president,and has accused Moscow of a military invasion in Crimea. The Kremlin, which does not recognise the new Ukrainian leadership, insists it made the move in order to protect Russian installations and its citizens living there.</p>
<p>Today, Russian troops who had taken control of the Belbekair base in the Crimea region fired warning shots into the air as around 300 Ukrainian soldiers, who previously manned the airfield, demanded their jobs back.</p>
<p>About a dozen Russian soldiers at the base warned theUkrainians, who were marching unarmed, not to approach. They fired several warning shots into the air and said they wouldshoot the Ukrainians if they continued to march toward them.The shots reflected tensions running high in the Black Seapeninsula since Russian troops estimated by Ukrainianauthorities to be 16,000 strong tightened their grip over theweekend on the Crimean peninsula, where Moscow&#8217;s Black SeaFleet is based. Ukraine has accused Russia of violating a bilateralagreement on conditions of a Russian lease of a naval base inCrimea that restricts troop movements, but Russia has argued that it was acting within the limits set by the deal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000762&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The murder trial of deposed Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi was adjourned to Thursday for the court to consider a defence request for new judges.</p>
<p>The trial is part of a relentless government crackdown against Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood movement since the military ended his turbulent year-long rule on July 3. Morsi is accused of inciting the killing of opposition protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012.</p>
<p>At today&#8217;s hearing, a lawyer representing one of Morsi&#8217;s co-defendants requested that two of the three judges be replaced, alleging that one of them spoke about the case in a media interview.</p>
<p>Lawyer Mohamed al-Masri had initially asked that the court include the judge&#8217;s interview in the trial records. &#8220;But since this request was ignored, we are presenting a recusal request,&#8221; head defence lawyer Mohamed al-Damati told cAFP. A similar request for appointing new judges has been made in two other trials involving Morsi, and an Egyptian appeals court is expected to decide on it on April 9.</p>
<p>In one of the trials, Morsi and others are accused of breaking out of jail during the 2011 uprising that toppled<br />
veteran president Hosni Mubarak. The second trial concerns accusations of espionage against the Islamist president.A date for a fourth trial, on charges of insulting the judiciary, has yet to be set.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000763&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Laxmi, a victim of acid attack and a standard-bearer for the movement to end acid attacks, has been selected by US prestigious International Women of the Courage Award.</p>
<p>Laxmi would receive the award from US First Lady Michelle Obama at an awards ceremony at the State Department here.</p>
<p>She was 16 when an acquaintance threw acid on her face while she waited at a bus stop in New Delhi&#8217;s busy Khan Market in 2005, disfiguring her permanently.</p>
<p>Her attacker, a friend&#8217;s 32-year old brother, planned to use the acid to destroy Laxmi&#8217;s face after she refused to respond to his romantic advances.</p>
<p>Many acid attack victims never return to normal life:they often go to great lengths to hide their disfigurement, many forgo education or employment rather than appear in public, and suicide is not uncommon. But Laxmi did not hide,&#8221; the State Department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She became the standard-bearer in India for the movement to end acid attacks. She made repeated appearances on national<br />
television, gathered 27,000 signatures for a petition to curb acid sales, and took her cause to the Indian Supreme Court,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>&#8221;Laxmi&#8217;s petition led the Supreme Court to order the Indian central and state governments to regulate immediately the sale of acid, and the Parliament to make prosecutions of acid attacks easier to pursue,&#8221; the State Department said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much is left to be done, and Laxmi continues to advocate on behalf of acid attack victims throughout India for increased compensation, effective prosecution and prevention of acid attacks, and rehabilitation of survivors,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Secretary of State John Kerry, who was earlier scheduled to be present at the awards ceremony, is now travelling to Kiev in the aftermath of the Ukrainian situation. He would be represented by Deputy Secretary of State Heather A Higginbottom.</p>
<p>Last year, Nirbhaya, a courageous 23-year-old girl whose brutal gang rape on a moving bus in Delhi in December 2012,triggered widespread protests, received the prestigious award.</p>
<p>The award would be presented to Laxmi along with other awardees from countries across the globe.</p>
<p>Established in 2007, the annual Secretary of State&#8217;s International Women of Courage Award honors women around the globe who have exemplified exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women&#8217;s equality, and social progress, often at great personal risk.</p>
<p>This is the only Department of State award that pays tribute to emerging women leaders worldwide.</p>
<p>Among other awardees are Nasrin Oryakhil (Afghanistan), Roshika Deo (Fiji), Bishop Rusudan Gotsiridze (Georgia), Iris Yassmin Barrios Aguilar (Guatemala), Fatimata Toure (Mali), Maha Al Muneef (Saudi Arabia), Oinikhol Bobonazarova (Tajikistan), Ruslana Lyzhychko (Ukraine) and Beatrice Mtetwa (Zimbabwe).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000620&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mush-yogi.jpg" /></a> Musharraf is scheduled to appear before the Special Court on March 11. (PTI)
<p>The hearing in the high-profile treason case against former Pakistani military dictator Pervez Musharraf was postponed on Tuesday till Wednesday after the judges failed to turn up due to a boycott called by lawyers over the brazen terror attack on a local court .</p>
<p>After a rare gun and bomb attack in the capital on Monday that left at least 11 people dead, including additional sessions judge Rafaqat Awan, and injured 25 others, the lawyer community had announced a call for strike.</p>
<p>Registrar Abdul Ghani Soomro adjourned the case&#8217;s hearing until Wednesday as special court judges did not reach court premises on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The defence and prosecution lawyers had informed the registrar of their mutual decision to seek excuse from appearance in the court today due to lawyers&#8217; strike.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of Musharraf&#8217;s lawyers Ahmed Raza Kasuri said the special court had been constituted in the capital city, adding that the District Bar and the Islamabad High Court had announced boycott of court proceedings for a week.</p>
<p>Following the attack on Monday, there were security threats surrounding the special court, he said.</p>
<p>He criticised the capital police and demanded strict action be taken against high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>He said if weak security prevailed, then Musharraf would not appear in the court and they would have to request the special court to transfer the hearing of the trial to a safer location.</p>
<p>Kasuri said when Musharraf missed court hearings due to his concerns regarding security, he was made fun of but yesterday&#8217;s attack was an example of the lack of security they were talking about.</p>
<p>Musharraf is scheduled to appear before the Special Court on March 11. He is likely to be indicted on that day.</p>
<p>This is the first time in Pakistan&#8217;s history that a former military chief is facing trial for treason.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000607&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday told troops to return to their permanent bases after calling a <a title="Russia on ‘wrong side of history’: Obama on Ukraine crisis" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/russia-on-wrong-side-of-history-obama-on-ukraine-crisis/">snap drill</a> to check their battle-readiness last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;The commander-in-chief President Vladimir Putin gave the order to the <a title="Ukraine says Russia issues ultimatum to surrender or face an all-out assault" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/ukraine-says-russia-issues-ultimatum-to-surrender-or-face-an-all-out-assault/">troops and units taking part in military exercises</a> to return to their permanent bases,&#8221; Putin&#8217;s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies.</p>
<p>Putin on February 26 ordered snap combat readiness drills involving <a title="Russia’s actions on Ukraine unacceptable: European Union top leaders" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/russias-actions-on-ukraine-unacceptable-european-union-top-leadersrussias-action-deeply-concerning-says-european-union-top-leaders/">thousands of troops</a>, in what was ostensibly a routine exercise.</p>
<p>The drill involved army, navy and airforce troops based in the central and western military districts, a vast territory that includes regions bordering Ukraine but also extending to the Arctic.</p>
<p>The drill did not include any regions beyond Russia&#8217;s borders such as Crimea, the Ukrainian Black Sea region which has become a flashpoint in the standoff between Moscow and Ukraine&#8217;s new authorities after the ousting of president Viktor Yanukovych.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had said that the drill would include military exercises &#8220;on Russia&#8217;s borders with other countries, including Ukraine&#8221;. The drill, which was initially announced to finish yesterday, came shortly before Russian security forces began operating covertly in Crimea and Putin gained permission from senators for military intervention.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000581&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Patrick Snay, 69, a former headmaster of Gulliver Preparatory School in Florida was set to receive the amount after settling a 2011 age discrimination suit with the school he once headed.</p>
<p>However, his daughter,Dana ruined the USD 80,000 deal by blabbing about it on Facebook,  the &#8216;Miami Herald&#8217; reported. &#8220;Mama and Papa Snay won the case against Gulliver. Gulliver is now officially paying for my vacation to Europe this summer. SUCK IT,&#8221; she wrote on the social networking website.</p>
<p>The message circulated among the former Gulliver student&#8217;s 1,200 Facebook friends and eventually made its way back to the school.</p>
<p>The school claimed the post violated the settlement&#8217;s confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>A judge last week tossed out the settlement, ruling the ex-employee and his daughter breached the terms of a confidential agreement when she took to social media to brag about it, the report said.</p>
<p>The case came to fore in 2010 when Gulliver declined to renew Snay&#8217;s contract following years of employment. Snay claimed age discrimination and retaliation that involved his daughter.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000526&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000530" alt="Snake-handling Kentucky pastor Jamie Coots died from a rattlesnake bite at church. (AP Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler.jpg" /></a> Snake-handling Kentucky pastor Jamie Coots died from a rattlesnake bite at church. (AP Photo)
<p>Three days after pastor Jamie Coots died from a rattlesnake bite at church, mourners leaving the funeral went to the church to handle snakes.</p>
<p>Coots, who appeared on the National Geographic Channel&#8217;s &#8220;Snake Salvation,&#8221; pastored the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name church founded by his grandfather in Middlesboro, Ky. The third-generation snake handler was bitten during a service on February 15 and died later at his home after refusing medical help. Now his adult son, Cody Coots, is taking over the family church where snakes are frequently part of services.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler2_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2000531" alt="snakehandler2_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler2_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=417" width="480" height="417" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;People think they will stop handling snakes because someone got bit, but it&#8217;s just the opposite,&#8221; said Ralph Hood, a professor of psychology at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, who has been studying snake handlers for decades. &#8220;It reaffirms their faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The practice of snake handling in the United States was first documented in the mountains of East Tennessee in the early 20th Century, according to Paul Williamson, a professor of psychology at Henderson State University who, along with Hood, co-wrote a book about snake handlers called, &#8220;Them That Believe.&#8221;  In the 1940s and 1950s, many states made snake-handling illegal (it&#8217;s currently illegal in Kentucky), but the practice has continued, and often law enforcement simply looks the other way.</p>
<p>The basis for the practice is a passage in the Gospel of Mark. In the King James Version of the Bible, Mark 16:17-18 reads: &#8220;And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandling_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2000532" alt="snakehandling_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandling_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=382" width="480" height="382" /></a></p>
<p>Snake handling gained momentum when George Hensley, a Pentecostal minister working in various Southern states in the early 1900s, recounted an experience where, while on a mountain, a serpent slithered beside him. Hensley purported to be able to handle the snake with impunity, and when he came down the mountain he proclaimed the truth of following all five of the signs in Mark. Hensley himself later died from a snake bite.</p>
<p>Today the practice is most common in Southern Appalachian states, and snake handlers often use native rattlesnakes and copperheads. Such churches are independent, and often call themselves &#8220;signs following&#8221; churches.</p>
<p>Andrew Hamblin, who co-starred on &#8220;Snake Salvation,&#8221; said he was with Coots when he died.</p>
<p>&#8220;I held him in my arms when he took his last breath,&#8221; said Hamblin, who is pastor at the Tabernacle Church of God in the nearby community of LaFollette, Tenn.</p>
<p>He believes that Coots, 42, would have died Feb. 15 no matter what; If not by a snake, then a stroke or some sort of accident.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandlercoots_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2000536" alt="Snakehandlercoots_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandlercoots_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=321" width="480" height="321" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s appointed time of death trumps everything,&#8221; Hamblin said.</p>
<p>Williamson said believers describe the feeling they get when they are handling snake, &#8220;Like a high, but a greater high than any drug or alcohol. It&#8217;s a feeling of joy, peace, extreme happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that many snake handlers believe that when God anoints them, they will be protected, but they still recognize there is danger. For instance, if the spirit leaves them and they don&#8217;t put down the snake quickly enough, they could be bitten.</p>
<p>Coots had handled snakes many years and had been bitten several times, always relying on prayer, and not medical help, to heal him. In &#8220;The Serpent Handlers: Three Families and Their Faith,&#8221; a book focusing on prominent snake-handling families, Coots is interviewed and describes a bite that took part of his finger, saying he had done something he shouldn&#8217;t have done (he doesn&#8217;t say what) and God was punishing him. Describing another painful bite, Coots says he was bitten after the spirit had moved out of him but he continued holding the snake for egotistical reasons.</p>
<p>Hood knew Coots well, and attended his standing-room only funeral service last week. At a gathering at the church afterward, some mourners were handling snakes, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the service, what everybody recognized and accepted is that he died obedient to God and that his salvation is assured,&#8221; said Hood.</p>
<p>At church service on Saturday, a week after Coots died, both Cody Coots and his mother handled the rattler that killed his father, said Williamson, who attended the service. Calls to the Coots family have not been returned.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2000533" alt="snakehandler_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/snakehandler_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>Williamson said he has documented 91 snake bite deaths among serpent handlers since 1919; Each year, about five people die from snake bites in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Williamson said questions of why a snake-handling believer dies from a bite are no different from the questions believers of various faiths have about why bad things happen to good people.</p>
<p>Coots&#8217; death was the second snake bite death at his church, which was founded in 1978. Melinda Brown, a 28-year-old mother of five, died in 1995, two days after she was bitten by a rattlesnake during a service.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/k1-BhaX5GSE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>Coots was then a 23-year-old pastor, and Brown spent the two days it took her to die at Coots&#8217; house. At the time, Coots told reporters that Brown had decided to put her fate in God&#8217;s hands rather than go to the hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything that happened, where it happened, was the Lord&#8217;s will,&#8221; Coots said.</p>
<p>Brown&#8217;s husband, John Wayne &#8220;Punkin&#8221; Brown, continued to handle serpents after his wife&#8217;s death. He was killed by a snake in 1998, at the age of 34, while preaching at an Alabama church.</p>
<p>His last words to the congregation were, &#8220;No matter what else, God&#8217;s still God.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000528&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Winter weather shut down much of Washington on Monday, although the snowfall wasn&#8217;t as bad as predicted.</p>
<p>Snow covered a thin layer of ice in the capital city early Monday, and officials warned people to stay off treacherous  roads. Schools were canceled, bus service was halted in places and federal government workers in the DC area were told to stay home Monday.</p>
<p>Up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of snow were forecast from Baltimore to Washington _ lower than earlier predictions but enough to cause headaches for the region. The latest frigid blow of the harsh winter threatened as much as 10 inches (25 centimeters) of snow by the end of the day in Washington, Baltimore and elsewhere in the Mid-Atlantic region. Up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of snow was predicted to the north in Philadelphia, while nearly a foot (30 centimeters) of snow was expected in parts of New Jersey.</p>
<p>Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency. School systems in Baltimore, Washington and many suburban areas were closed, as were all Smithsonian museums except for the National Air and Space Museum. However, the U.S. Supreme Court was expected to be open and had arguments scheduled for Monday.</p>
<p>More than 2,600 flights in the United States were canceled as of Monday morning, according to flight tracking site  FlightAware.com. The bulk of the problems were at airports in Washington, New York and Philadelphia.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000466&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama-llll.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000435 " alt="Obama government provide a package of assistance to the Ukrainians, to the people and that government (AP photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/obama-llll.jpg" /></a> Obama said that he spent the weekend talking to leaders across Europe. (AP photo)
<p>US President Barack Obama has said Russia was on the &#8220;wrong side of history&#8221; and its invasion in Ukraine was an attack on sovereignty of a nation, warning that he was considering economic and diplomatic options to punish Moscow if it didn&#8217;t reverse course quickly.</p>
<p>Obama asserted that America&#8217;s interest was in seeing the Ukrainian people be able to determine their own destiny.</p>
<p>&#8220;My interest is seeing the Ukrainian people be able to determine their own destiny,&#8221; Obama told White House reporters in a joint press availability with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Russia has strong historic ties to the Ukraine&#8230;There are strong commercial ties between those two countries. And so all of those interests I think can be recognized. But what cannot be done is for Russia, with impunity, to put its soldiers on the ground and violate basic principles that are recognized around the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Asserting that the US and its global partners were supportive of the interim Ukrainian government, Obama said &#8220;the strong condemnation that it has received from countries around the world indicates the degree to which Russia is on the wrong side of history on this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secretary of State John Kerry will be travelling to Kiev to indicate the US support for the Ukrainian people, to offer very specific and concrete packages of economic aid &#8212; because one of the things the US concerned about is stabilising the economy even in the midst of this crisis, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are also indicating to the Russians is that if, in fact, they continue on the current trajectory that they&#8217;re on, that we are examining a whole series of steps &#8211; economic, diplomatic &#8211; that will isolate Russia and will have a negative impact on Russia&#8217;s economy and its status,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve already suspended preparations for the G8 summit. I think you can expect that there would be further follow-up on that. We are taking a look a whole range of issues that John Kerry mentioned on Monday,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>Obama said that he spent the weekend talking to leaders across Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the world is largely united in recognising that the steps Russia has taken are a violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty, Ukraine&#8217;s territorial integrity; that they&#8217;re a violation of international law; they&#8217;re a violation of previous agreements that Russia has made with respect to how it treats and respects its neighbours,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, as a consequence, we got strong statements from NATO, from the G7, condemning the actions that Russia has taken. We are going to continue these diplomatic efforts during the course of this week,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The question for the Russian government generally is if their concern is the rights of all Ukrainians are respected, if, in fact, their primary concern, as they&#8217;ve stated, is that Russian speakers and Russian nationals are not in any way harmed or abused or discriminated against, then we should be able to set up international monitors,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And an international effort that mediates between various parties, that is able to broker a deal that is satisfactory to the Ukrainian people &#8212; not to the United States, not to Russia, but to the Ukrainian people &#8212; and we should be able to deescalate the situation,&#8221; Obama said.</p>
<p>The US, he said, has been very specific with the Russians about how that might be done under the auspices of either the United States or the OSCE, or some other international organisation.</p>
<p>&#8220;So there are really two paths that Russia can take at this point. Obviously, the facts on the ground in Crimea are deeply troubling and Russia has a large army that borders Ukraine. But what is also true is that over time this will be a costly proposition for Russia. And now is the time for them to consider whether they can serve their interests in a way that resorts to diplomacy as opposed to force,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Referring to the calls being made from the Congress about doing something, Obama said one thing they can do right away is to work with the administration to help provide a package of assistance to the Ukrainians, to the people and that government.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they get back in, assuming the weather clears, I would hope that would be the first order of business. Because at this stage there should be unanimity among Democrats and Republicans that when it comes to preserving the principle that no country has the right to send in troops to another country unprovoked, we should be able to come up with a unified position that stands outside of partisan politics,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And my expectation is that I&#8217;ll be able to get Congress to work with us in order to achieve that goal,&#8221; Obama said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000416&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/billgates.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000381" alt="Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is back on top of the list of the world's richest people. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/billgates.jpg" /></a> Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is back on top of the list of the world&#8217;s richest people. (AP)
<p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is back on top of the list of the world&#8217;s richest people.</p>
<p>Forbes magazine announced its ranking of the world&#8217;s billionaires on Monday.</p>
<p>Gates, who led the list for 15 of the past 20 years, won the spot back from Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu, who had topped the list for the past four years. Gates&#8217; net worth is estimated at $76 billion; Slim Helu follows at $72 billion.</p>
<p>Spanish clothing magnate Amancio Ortega, known for the Zara retail chain, maintained his third-ranked spot and came out ahead of famed US investor Warren Buffett, who ranked fourth. Larry Ellison of Oracle came in fifth.</p>
<p>Forbes says a record 1,645 billionaires made the list this year, with an average net worth of $4.7 billion. That&#8217;s up from 1,426 billionaires last year with a net worth of $4.2 billion. Total net worth of this year&#8217;s list was $6.4 trillion, up from $5.4 trillion last year.</p>
<p>The magazine said that 1,080 of the billionaires were self-made, 207 inherited their wealth and 352 inherited a portion but are still growing it.</p>
<p>The largest net worth gainer on the list was Facebook&#8217;s Mark Zuckerberg, who more than doubled his fortune to $28.5 billion as the value of his company&#8217;s stock soared. He ranks 21st on the list.</p>
<p>The social media giant helped bring a few notable newcomers to the list, including Facebook&#8217;s Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and WhatsApp founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton, who recently sold their business to Facebook for $19 billion.</p>
<p>Forbes said 268 billionaires were new to the list, beating out a prior high of 226 newcomers in 2008. And a record number of women made the list this year, with 172 women joining, up 25 percent from last year.</p>
<p>Altogether 100 people dropped out of the rankings, while 16 passed away.</p>
<p>The US was the country with the greatest number of billionaires at 492, followed by China with 152 and Russia with 111. Billionaires from four new countries joined, adding Algeria, Lithuania, Tanzania and Uganda to the geographic mix.</p>

<p>The US has said its Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Pakistan again, refusing the allegations that America does not want to see peace in the south Asian country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our actions and our efforts, including the recent strategic dialogue we had with Pakistan, and our ongoing engagement the Secretary (of State) was there last summer; (and) he said he hopes to go again,&#8221; State Department Spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters during a conference call on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an ongoing  a vital shared strategic interest with the government of Pakistan in ending terrorism and pursuing a stable, peaceful and prosperous region,&#8221; she said responding to a question on the allegations made by the Pakistani politician Imran Khan that the US does not want peace in his country.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the proof is in the pudding, and we remain very closely tied with the government of Pakistan in fighting terrorism and coordinate it with them in that effort as well,&#8221; Psaki said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000229&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>British Prime Minister David Cameron, <a title="Angela Merkel tells Putin to respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/angela-merkel-tells-putin-to-respect-ukraines-territorial-integrity/" target="_blank">German Chancellor Angela Merkel </a>and French President Francoise Hollande warned of  repercussions for Russia over its &#8220;completely unacceptable&#8221; actions in Ukraine.</p>
<p><a title="British government boycotts Sochi Paralympics over Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/british-government-boycotts-sochi-paralympics-over-ukraine/" target="_blank">Cameron </a>spoke separately to both leaders about the escalating crisis, and agreed that a joint response was needed, according to a spokesman from Cameron&#8217;s office. &#8220;In both calls, the leaders agreed that the international community should speak with one voice and send a clear message to Russia that its actions in Ukraine were completely unacceptable,&#8221;said the statement on Monday.</p>
<p>A special European Council has been called for Thursday, and the three leaders agreed &#8220;it would be important to be clear about the costs and consequences for the <a title="Ukraine says Russia issues ultimatum to surrender or face an all-out assault" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/ukraine-says-russia-issues-ultimatum-to-surrender-or-face-an-all-out-assault/" target="_blank">Russian government </a>of continuing to violate Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty,&#8221;said the spokesman. The trio vowed to support the Ukrainian people and government and also suggested a major role for the United Nations and other international organisations in resolving the crisis.</p>
<p>Cameron earlier earned that Russia will face diplomatic, political, and economic pressure in response to its violation of Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty. Cameron, who chaired a meeting of British military and security chiefs in London to discuss the crisis, said the world needed to send a &#8220;clear message&#8221; to Moscow.</p>
<p>He said &#8220;What we want to see is a de-escalation rather than a continuation down the path that the Russian government has taken, violating the sovereignty and territorial integrity of another country. &#8221; So we shall have to bring to bear diplomatic, political, economic and other pressures in order to make this point. &#8220;That is the very clear message the whole world needs to send to  the Russian government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cameron was speaking after <a title="Obama calls leaders of UK, Poland and Germany on Ukraine" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/obama-calls-leaders-of-uk-poland-and-germany-on-ukraine/" target="_blank">Ukraine&#8217;s</a> military said Russia had issued an ultimatum to Ukrainian forces to surrender in the Crimea or face an all-out assault on the Black Sea peninsula. The Russian Black Sea fleet dismissed the claims as &#8220;nonsense&#8221;, but Cameron said the reports were &#8220;deeply concerning&#8221;, adding that &#8220;we all want to see stability and countries obeying the  rule of law&#8221;. British Foreign Secretary William Hague warned Russia on Monday of &#8220;consequences and costs&#8221; as he met Ukraine&#8217;s new Western-backed leaders in Kiev.</p>
<p>&#8220;This cannot be the way in the 21st century to conduct international affairs,&#8221; Hague said. &#8220;It is not an acceptable way to  behave and there will be consequences and costs,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000238&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>STEVEN ERLANGER</strong></p>
<p>Western nations sought a political and economic response to the crisis in Ukraine Monday as Russia strengthened its hold on Crimea and more pro-Russian demonstrations were taking place in the big cities of Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>There were unconfirmed reports the commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, headquartered in the Crimea port of Sevastopol, had ordered Ukrainian forces in Crimea to surrender by 5 am Tuesday local time — 10 pm Monday Eastern Standard Time — or face assault by Russian forces. But Russia’s Foreign Ministry issued a conflicting statement, saying the Black Sea Fleet was not involved.</p>
<p>The EU foreign ministers met in emergency session in Brussels to discuss possible punitive steps against Russia unless it pulled its troops back to its own bases in Crimea, including suspension of talks with Moscow on visa liberalization. But France and Germany said sanctions were not on the table, urging dialogue first.</p>
<p>Visiting the new government in Kiev, British Foreign Secretary William Hague urged Russia to pull back its forces in Crimea or face “significant costs”, echoing comments made by President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, who was due here Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hague also emphasized diplomacy. “The world cannot just allow this to happen,” he told BBC. “The world cannot say it’s OK in effect to violate the sovereignty of another nation in this way.”</p>
<p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V Lavrov, responded that Russia was only protecting its interests and those of Russian citizens in Ukraine. The use of Russian troops is necessary “until the normalization of the political situation” in Ukraine, he said at an opening of a monthlong session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. “We are talking here about protection of our citizens and compatriots, about protection of the most fundamental of the human rights &#8211; the right to live, and nothing more.” But he did not specify what threats Russian citizens faced from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Crimea was relatively calm, with Russian forces continuing their military standoffs around Ukrainian bases to neutralize them and seek their surrender. The Ukrainian military personnel were effectively hostages, hemmed in by Russian troops.</p>
<p>In Donetsk, however, in eastern Ukraine, Yanukovych’s native region, a large pro-Russian demonstration led to some violence. About 1,000 pro-Russian demonstrators occupied the first floor of the regional government building that has already been flying the Russian flag for several days. The protesters, waving Russian flags and shouting, “Putin, come!”, were unable to go higher because lifts were disabled and stairwell doors shut. They had entered through a side door after confronting police, who were guarding the front entrance.</p>
<p>The rally seemed the latest in a series in eastern cities that Kiev says are encouraged or even organized by Russia.</p>
<p>The Donetsk protest leader, Pavel Gubarev, demanded that the parliament in Kiev be declared illegitimate, a pro-Russian governor be accepted in Donetsk and all security forces be put under regional command, much as has happened already in Crimea.</p>
<p>In Sevastopol, at the headquarters of Ukraine’s naval forces, six heavily armed men in unmarked uniforms and masks stood outside, cheered on by locals waving Russian flags and loudly proclaiming loyalties.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000183&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/crimea-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999924" alt="People stand aboard the Ukrainian navy corvette Ternopil vessel as it stands at harbor in Sevastopol.

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ukraine&#8217;s military said on Tuesday that Russia had given its forces an ultimatum to <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/russia-demands-2-ukraine-warships-surrender-or-face-seizing-of-ships/" target="_blank">surrender</a> in Crimea or face an all-out assault on the strategic Black Sea peninsula that has been overrun by Kremlin-backed troops.</span></p>
<p>But Russia&#8217;s Black Fleet swiftly denied any such demand and the country&#8217;s parliament speaker said there was no need yet for Moscow to use its &#8220;right&#8221; to launch military action in Ukraine. &#8220;The ultimatum is to recognise the new Crimean authorities, lay down our weapons and leave, or be ready for an assault,&#8221; regional Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Vladyslav Seleznyov told AFP in the Crimean capital Simferopol.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be at 1:00 am, 2:00 am, 3:00 am (Tuesday). There are different times,&#8221; he said. Ukraine has accused Russia of pouring more troops into Crimea as world leaders grappled with Europe&#8217;s worst standoff since the Cold War. Crimea &#8211; the strategic host to Tsarist and Kremlin navies since the 18th century &#8211; has been under de-facto occupation by Moscow-backed forces who have raised Russian flag over government buildings and blocked Ukrainians troops inside their barracks across the peninsula.</p>
<p>The new leaders in Kiev branded Russia&#8217;s actions a declaration of &#8220;war&#8221; and jittery global markets plunged on Monday over fears of a conflict while the price of oil surged. The Moscow market alone at one stage lost 13 per cent on a Black Monday of trading that saw the ruble hit historic lows.</p>
<p>World leaders were holding a series of urgent meetings and telephone conversations to try to avert a conflict and also to help Ukraine avert a possible catastrophic debt default.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999922&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP Photo/Al-Jazeera, File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/osama-480.jpg" /></a> This image made from video provided by by Al-Jazeera shows Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden&#8217;s son-in-law and spokesman.

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Osama bin Laden&#8217;s son-in-law was introduced to prospective jurors on Monday at the start of his trial on charges that he conspired to kill Americans and support terrorists in his role as al-Qaida&#8217;s spokesman after the Sept. 11 attacks.</span></p>
<p>Sulaiman Abu Ghaith is the highest-ranking al-Qaida figure to face trial on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks. The government plans to show jurors during its opening statement a picture of Abu Ghaith seated with bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders on the day after Sept. 11, 2001, as they make statements about the attacks.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan asked Abu Ghaith to turn and face the potential jurors before asking if any knew him. None did. The judge drew silence as well when he asked if there was anyone who had never heard of al-Qaida.</p>
<p>The questioning was part of a process designed to shrink a jury pool of dozens of prospective jurors to the 12 anonymous jurors and several alternates necessary before opening statements begin as early as Wednesday.</p>
<p>The trial, expected to last about three weeks, began a year after Abu Ghaith was brought to the United States following his capture in Jordan.</p>
<p>Kaplan told prospective jurors that the intent of the trial was to decide whether Abu Ghaith had conspired to kill Americans, whether he conspired to provide material support and resources to terrorists and whether he actually supplied material support and resources to terrorists.</p>
<p>Prosecution evidence also will include post-9/11 videos in which the charismatic bearded man promises more attacks on the United States as devastating as those that destroyed the World Trade Center. &#8220;The Americans must know that the storm of airplanes will not stop, God willing, and there are thousands of young people who are as keen about death as Americans are about life,&#8221; Abu Ghaith said in an Oct. 9, 2001, speech.</p>
<p>In one widely circulated propaganda video, Abu Ghaith can be seen sitting with bin Laden and current al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri against a rocky backdrop. Defense lawyers for the balding and bearded defendant, who wore a beige suit to court Monday, asserted last week that some of the government&#8217;s evidence relates to a detainee at Guantanamo Bay with a similar name to Abu Ghaith rather than to the defendant, who has pleaded not guilty. Kaplan on Friday called the mistaken identity claim &#8220;utterly meritless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith&#8217;s attorneys are also trying to enlist help from professed 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed to bolster the case for acquittal, though it hasn&#8217;t come fast enough for them to gain permission from Kaplan for Mohammed to testify, perhaps through a video link to Guantanamo Bay. If convicted, Abu Ghaith could face life in prison.</p>
<p>The Kuwaiti-born defendant was flown to the United States a year ago from Jordan, where he was captured as he headed to Kuwait, which had revoked his citizenship after 9/11.</p>
<p>In an affidavit, Abu Ghaith said he left Afghanistan in 2002 and entered Iran, where he was arrested and held in prisons and interrogated extensively. He said he was heading home to Kuwait to see family when his flight landed instead in Amman, Jordan, where he was handcuffed and turned over to American authorities.</p>
<p>Abu Ghaith is married to bin Laden&#8217;s eldest daughter, Fatima, one of nearly two dozen children bin Laden was believed to have fathered before he was killed in Pakistan by U.S. special forces in 2011. Before heading to Afghanistan in 2000, Abu Ghaith was an imam at a Kuwaiti mosque.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999914&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian Hindus including two women have been barred from entering the Gurdwara Nankana Sahib near here as they had no visa to enter the district, where the Sikh shrine is located.</p>
<p>A source in Evacuee Trust Property Board told PTI that the Hindus &#8211; Vaneet Gupta, Neelam Gupta, Narindar Kumar, Hari Om and Vijay Lakhshami &#8211; reached Gurdwara Janamasthan, the birthplace of Guru Nanak, by a car from Lahore yesterday. The Gurdwara authorities, however, handed them over to the ETPB officials after finding that they had no visa on their passports for the district, some 80 kilometres from Lahore.</p>
<p>When asked about the alleged visa violation, the Hindus said they &#8220;wanted to visit the Sikh holy place out of respect&#8221;, the source said.</p>
<p>The Hindus had come here to attend festivities in connection with the &#8216;Shivratri&#8217; at historic Katasraj Mandir in Chakwal district, some 250 kilometres from here. When contacted, Deputy Secretary (Hindu Affairs) Azhar Sulahry said the Hindus in question had visa for Lahore and Chakwal only.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Hindu pilgrims were sent back to Gurdawar Dera Sahib Lahore from Nankana and today they left for India along with other members of the group,&#8221; he said. Over 150 Hindu pilgrims had arrived here on February 25 to attend the Shivratri festival at the Katasraj Mandir.</p>
<p>While accepting in principle invitation by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit that country, Singh had made it clear that he would undertake the trip only if there is a possibility of a &#8220;substantive&#8221; outcome. India has been unhappy over the slow pace of progress in the trial of the 26/11 Mumbai attackers in Pakistan and feels that Islamabad is deliberately dragging its feet in ensuring that the culprits are punished.</p>
<p>New Delhi is also agitated that Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafeez Sayeed is being permitted to roam around free in Pakistan and also make provocative anti-India speeches.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999817&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Military clashes between China and Japan cannot be ruled out and the People&#8217;s Liberation Army will fight back if provoked, a top Chinese official said on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;At present we cannot completely rule out the possibility of clashes in East Asia, but it is not decided by China,&#8221; said Qian Lihua, a member of China&#8217;s top political advisory body, the National Committee of the Chinese People&#8217;s Political Consultative Conference.</p>
<p>The Chinese army will not stir up a war but will fight back against any provocation, Qian, a major general who used to head the foreign affairs office under the Ministry of National Defence, was quoted by state-run Xinhua news agency as saying.</p>
<p>His comments came amid reports that Japan is forming a new amphibious force to deal with any invasion of the islands held by it in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>China and Japan are at loggerheads over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands and relations between the two countries have steadily deteriorated in recent months.</p>
<p>Qian said it is impossible and impractical for Japan&#8217;s right-wing forces or militarism forces to cause big trouble, chaos, conflicts and even wars against China as the country was not in the same situation as in 1894 or in the 1930s, when Japan waged two wars against China.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Chinese army and the Chinese people are capable of containing the development of Japan&#8217;s militarism and will prevent them from making trouble around China,&#8221; Qian added.</p>
<p>China will make efforts to control risk, prevent conflict escalation and try to bring the China-Japan relation back on the right track, he said.</p>
<p>No country wants to have wars considering the current economic difficulties. &#8220;If there is a war, it will only damage the hard-earned economic recovery,&#8221; Qian said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999511&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukraine.jpg"><img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ukraine.jpg" alt="Unidentified armed men patrol around a Ukraine&#039;s infantry base in Perevalne, Ukraine, Sunday, March 2, 2014." class="size-full wp-image-1999369" /></a> Unidentified armed men patrol around a Ukraine&#8217;s infantry base in Perevalne, Ukraine, Sunday, March 2, 2014.
<p>Pro-Russian troops today took over a ferry terminal on the easternmost tip of Crimea close to Russia, exacerbating fears that Moscow is planning to bring even more troops into this strategic Black Sea region.</p>
<p>The seizure of the terminal in the Ukrainian city of Kerch about 20 kilometres by boat to Russia, comes as the West try to figure out ways to halt and reverse the Russian incursion.</p>
<p>Early today, soldiers were operating the terminal, which serves as a common departure point for many Russian-bound ships. The men refused to identify themselves, but they spoke Russian and the vehicles transporting them had Russian license plates.</p>
<p>Ukraine said that they are the same Russian soldiers who have occupied airports in Crimea, smashed equipment at an air base and besieged a Ukrainian infantry base in this peninsula.</p>
<p>Outrage over Russia&#8217;s military moves mounted in world capitals, with US Secretary of State John Kerry calling on President Vladimir Putin to pull back from <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/world/europe/world-scrambles-as-russia-tightens-grip-on-crimea/" target="_blank">&#8220;an incredible act of aggression.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>A day after Russia captured the Crimean Peninsula without firing a shot, fears grew in the Ukrainian capital and beyond that Russia might seek to expand its control by seizing other parts of eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Senior Obama administration officials said the US now believes that Russia has complete operational control of Crimea, a pro-Russian area of the country, and has more than 6,000 troops in the region.</p>
<p>Faced with the Russian threat, Ukraine&#8217;s new government moved to consolidate its authority, naming new regional governors in the pro-Russia east, enlisting the support of the country&#8217;s wealthy businessmen and dismissing the head of the country&#8217;s navy after he declared allegiance to the pro-Russian government in Crimea.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was no reason for Russia to invade Ukraine and warned that &#8220;we are on the brink of disaster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that our Western partners and the entire global community will support the territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine,&#8221; he said yesterday in Kiev.</p>
<p>World leaders rushed to try to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. NATO held an emergency meeting in Brussels, Britain&#8217;s foreign minister flew to Kiev to support its new government and Kerry was to travel to Ukraine tomorrow.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998560&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kunming-480.jpg" /></a> With a heavy police presence, normal operations have resumed and passengers can walk into and out of the station with no new restrictions. (AP)
<p>Chinese police have launched a manhunt to capture five militants from Xinjiang who reportedly fled after taking part in the deadly knife attacks at a railway station in Kunming city in which 33 people were killed and 143 others injured.</p>
<p>Four of the attackers were killed, while one woman militant who was injured was captured after the incident yesterday.  A search is on for the other militants, stated to be from the banned separatist East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an al-Qaeda-backed outfit.</p>
<p>ETIM, is active in the northwestern Xinjiang province which has witnessed deep ethnic unrest between native Muslim Uyghurs and Han settlers from mainland China in recent years. The Kunming municipal government said that evidence at the crime scene showed that the Kunming station attack was orchestrated by separatist forces from Xinjiang.</p>
<p>No further details have been given.</p>
<p>Thirty-three people including four militants were killed in the attacks and 143 injured, 33 of them seriously. A group of  10 attackers hailing from Xinjiang attacked the crowed with large knives hacking people indiscriminately, Chinese security officials said.  The attack lasted about 25 minutes after which the remaining militants escaped.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a semblance of normalcy has returned to Kunming city after the gruesome knife attacks. Order has been restored in Kunming, capital of southwest China&#8217;s Yunnan Province, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.  At the train station where the attacks happened, train arrivals resumed yesterday after three trains were disrupted. Part of a major road in front of the railway station is still under traffic control and a waiting area on a square east of the station has been cordoned off.</p>
<p>With a heavy police presence, normal operations have resumed and passengers can walk into and out of the station with no new restrictions. Security screening of passengers and luggage is being carried out and staff are maintaining  order in more crowded areas.</p>
<p>Security has been beefed up at the city&#8217;s Changshui International Airport, with increased security personnel and tougher scrutiny of passengers and luggage. The foreign affairs office of the Yunnan provincial government said there were no reports that foreigners were killed or injured in the attacks. Neither are Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao citizens among the victims.</p>
<p>President Xi Jinping has ordered law enforcement agencies to strike out with full force and bring those accountable to  justice as as soon as possible. Xi urged the greatest efforts to treat the injured and help those who have lost their loved ones. Premier Li Keqiang has ordered police forces nationwide to beef up security, particularly at public places of big crowds.</p>
<p>Senior Chinese security official Meng Jianzhu is in Kunming overseeing the security situation. Separately, the city&#8217;s  education authorities said all local middle and primary schools will open as normal on Monday but with enhanced security.  School officials will be on duty before and after class and police officers will be patrolling school campuses and surrounding areas. Following reports of shortage of blood for the injured, more than 2,000 Kunming citizens have donated 560,000 millilitres of blood so far.</p>
<p>A total of 27 medical experts have been dispatched to Kunming to help the treatment of victims, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said on Monday. The experts were recruited from 12 hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu,  Guangzhou and other cities.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997744&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/angelamerkelm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1998216" alt="Putin told Merkel that the steps taken by his government were intended to defend Russia's interests.

<p>As the threat of a showdown between Russia and the West over Ukraine loomed large, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has deplored Moscow&#8217;s military build up on the Crimean peninsula and called on President Vladimir Putin to respect the country&#8217;s territorial integrity.</p>
<p>Merkel told Putin in a telephone call last night that his country has violated international law with its &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; military intervention in Crimea, a government spokesman said.</p>
<p>She reminded Putin that under the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, his country is committed to respect the independence and sovereignty of Ukraine and its existing borders.</p>
<p>Russia also violated the 1997 treaty with Ukraine on stationing its Black Sea fleet in Crimea, Merkel told Putin.</p>
<p>Putin defended Russia&#8217;s military intervention in Crimea, but accepted a dialogue offer from Merkel, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He told Merkel that the steps taken by his government were intended to defend Russia&#8217;s interests and to protect the Russian citizens and Russian-speaking population in Ukraine, who feel threatened by the events in Crimea and in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Russian president agreed to Merkel&#8217;s proposal to create a &#8220;contact group&#8221; to explore the possibilities for a political solution to the present crisis in Ukraine and to send a fact-finding mission there, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The chancellor also spoke to US President Barack Obama last night, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the G-7 group of leading industrialised nations have suspended their preparations for their next summit in Sochi in southern Russia in June, in response to the country&#8217;s military intervention in Crimea.</p>
<p>In a joint statement issued by the White House in Washington, the group comprising the United States, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, Japan and Italy said Russia&#8217;s actions in Ukraine &#8220;contravenes the principles and values on which the G-7 and G-8 operate&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;As such, we have decided for the time being to suspend the participation in activities associated with the preparation of the scheduled G-8 summit in Sochi in June until the environment comes back where the G-8 is able to have meaningful discussions,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>The G-7 nations condemned Russia&#8217;s &#8220;clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, in contravention of Russia&#8217;s obligations under the UN charter and its 1997 basing agreement with Ukraine,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>They called on the Russian government to address any ongoing security or human rights concerns it has with Ukraine through direct negotiations or through international mediation or observation under the auspices of the UN or the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the statement said.</p>
<p>The G-7 nations &#8220;are united in supporting Ukraine&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity and its right to chose its own future&#8221;.</p>
<p>They also pledged their support for Ukraine in its efforts to restore unity, stability and political and economic health in the country.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998154&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;Blade Runner&#8221; <a href="http://indianexpress.com/tag/oscar-pistorius/" target="_blank">Oscar Pistorius</a> arrived at the Pretoria High Court on Monday for the start of his murder trial, opening a decisive chapter in the story of the rise and fall of one of the world&#8217;s best known athletes.</p>
<p>The first witness at Oscar Pistorius&#8217; murder trial told the court on Monday she heard &#8220;blood-curdling&#8221; screams from a woman followed by four shots, offering dramatic testimony of the incident in which Pistorius shot dead his girlfriend last year.</p>
<p>Taking the stand just after the Olympic and Paralympic star pleaded not guilty to murdering 29-year-old model Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine&#8217;s Day last year, Michelle Burger, who lived in a nearby estate, told of being woken in the middle of the night by a woman screaming and shouting for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was still sitting in the bed and I heard her screams,&#8221; Burger said, speaking in Afrikaans through an interpreter. &#8220;She screamed terribly and she yelled for help. Then I also heard a man screaming for help. Three times he yelled for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just after her screams, I heard four shots. Four gunshots &#8230; &#8216;Bang &#8230;bang, bang, bang&#8217;,&#8221; she said, her voice cracking with emotion. At Burger&#8217;s request, her testimony was not shown on television, but the audio was broadcast live.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was very traumatic for me. You could hear that it was blood-curdling screams,&#8221; Burger added.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old Pistorius, who was born without legs but reached the 2012 Olympic 400 metres semi-final running on carbon-fibre &#8220;blades&#8221;, argues that the killing of law graduate Steenkamp was a tragic case of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>He says he mistook her for an intruder hiding in the upstairs toilet of his luxury Pretoria home.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997737&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The British government will boycott the Winter Paralympics in Sochi over host Russia&#8217;s military action in Ukraine, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.</p>
<p>The British premier on Sunday said he and Foreign Secretary William Hague thought it would be &#8220;wrong&#8221; for ministers to go to the Games, which start on Friday, given the unfolding events in nearby Ukraine.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth II&#8217;s youngest son, Prince Edward, who is patron of the British Paralympic Association, &#8220;has, on the advice of government, cancelled a planned visit to Russia&#8221; to attend the Games.</p>
<p>A Downing Street spokesman said Cameron was &#8220;gravely concerned&#8221; about the situation in Ukraine. Hague is in Kiev to meet the new Ukrainian authorities, make clear London&#8217;s support for them and to urge continued restraint.</p>
<p>He tweeted after meeting Ukrainian political leaders that the &#8220;violation&#8221; of the former Soviet republic&#8217;s sovereignty was &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;. Hague announced earlier that Britain would not take part in preparatory meetings this week in Russia for the G8 summit, due to be held in the Black Sea resort of Sochi in June.</p>
<p>&#8220;In current circumstances, the prime minister is clear that the focus of our engagement with Russia must be the situation in Ukraine, rather than other normal business,&#8221; the Downing Street spokesman said.</p>
<p>Ukraine warned Sunday it was on the brink of disaster and called up military reservists after Russia&#8217;s threat to invade its Western-leaning neighbour risked sparking the worst crisis since the Cold War.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prime minister remains gravely concerned about events in Ukraine and is determined to pursue all avenues to reduce tensions and de-escalate a very dangerous situation,&#8221; said the Downing Street spokesman.</p>
<p>&#8220;A stable Ukraine is in the interests of everyone. &#8220;The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine has been violated and this cannot be the way to conduct international affairs.&#8221; He added that Cameron and Hague &#8220;have also decided that it would be inappropriate for UK ministers to attend the Sochi Paralympics in current circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prime minister remains fully supportive of our Paralympic athletes&#8217; participation at Sochi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cameron did not attend the Sochi Winter Olympics last month, though there is no tradition of British premiers attending the Winter Games.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997700&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>North Korea on Monday deported a 75-year-old Australian missionary detained since last month for allegedly distributing religious materials.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-based John Short was arrested after leaving  &#8220;Bible tracts&#8221; in a Buddhist temple in the capital Pyongyang during a tour.</p>
<p>The North&#8217;s state-run KCNA news agency said the &#8220;generous&#8221; decision to release and expel Short had been taken in light of his advanced age and a signed &#8220;confession&#8221; and apology.</p>
<p>A copy of Short&#8217;s statement was released along with photos showing him affixing his thumb in red ink to the document which he also signed and read out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realise that my actions are an indelible hostile act against the independent right and laws of the (North),&#8221; the confession read.</p>
<p>&#8220;I request forgiveness &#8230; and am willing to bow down on my knees,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Confessions and self-criticisms &#8212; scripted by the authorities &#8212; are normally a pre-requisite for detained foreigners seeking release in North Korea.</p>
<p>Short&#8217;s statement stated that US and other western media reports labelling the North as a closed country without religious freedoms were &#8220;inaccurate and wrong&#8221;.</p>
<p>Although freedom of worship is enshrined in North Korea&#8217;s constitution, it does not exist in practice and religious activity is severely restricted to officially-recognised groups linked to the government.</p>
<p>In his statement, Short also admitted distributing religious texts on the Pyongyang subway during a previous tour to the North in 2012.</p>
<p>&#8220;I now realise the seriousness of my insult to the Korean people &#8230; and for this I truly apologise,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Australia has no diplomatic representation in North Korea, but its foreign ministry said it had confirmed Short&#8217;s release through the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly this is welcome news,&#8221; the ministry said.</p>
<p>She said the Australian authorities had told her he was believed to be on the flight to Beijing.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997586&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/uniaea.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997649" alt="IAEA said Iran was sticking to the nuclear freeze it agreed under the November interim deal.

<p>Top International Atomic Energy Agency officials will meet on Monday to assess Iran&#8217;s compliance with a six-month nuclear freeze agreed under an interim deal with world powers last November.</p>
<p>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that despite &#8220;thousands of hours&#8221; of inspection, the United Nations&#8217; atomic watchdog had found no evidence of military objectives in Iran&#8217;s nuclear drive.</p>
<p>Rouhani spoke after Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday said nuclear negotiations were &#8220;going well&#8221;. &#8220;I&#8217;m hoping by the first deadline (July 20) we will reach an agreement,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the meeting of the IAEA&#8217;s 35-member Board of Governors &#8212; their second official parley this year&#8211; Iran will hold expert-level talks with world powers.</p>
<p>In its latest report on Iran last month, the IAEA said Iran was sticking to the nuclear freeze it agreed under the November interim deal. The watchdog&#8217;s report came a month after the deal came into force.</p>
<p>Iran and the so-called P5+1 group of world powers &#8212; UN Security Council members Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, plus Germany &#8212; are seeking to reach a lasting accord that would allay Western suspicions that Tehran&#8217;s nuclear activities mask military objectives.</p>
<p>As part of such a comprehensive deal, the six seek to pressure Iran over its ballistic missile programme, which could theoretically provide Tehran with a device to deliver a nuclear warhead, should it choose to build one.</p>
<p>The IAEA said last month  that uranium enrichment to medium levels &#8212; the main concern to the international community &#8212; &#8220;is no longer taking place&#8221;, as agreed in the November deal.</p>
<p>The IAEA also said that a proportion of Iran&#8217;s medium-enriched uranium stockpile &#8220;is being down-blended, and the remainder is being converted to uranium oxide&#8221;.</p>
<p>Enrichment to low purities however &#8220;continues at a rate of production similar to that indicated&#8221; in the last report from November, meaning that Iran&#8217;s stockpile of this material rose in the last three months.</p>
<p>This is consistent with the agreement with world powers, as long as by the end of the six-month period on July 20 the stockpile is not higher than at the start. Iran is currently building a facility to convert this type of material to oxide form, from which it would be more difficult to enrich to weapons grade, the IAEA report said.</p>
<p>In addition, Iran has not installed any additional uranium enrichment centrifuges at either of its facilities, Natanz and Fordo, according to the IAEA.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997496&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
