<item><title>Missing radioactive material may pose "dirty bomb" threat - IAEA</title><description>By Fredrik Dahl VIENNA (Reuters) - About 140 cases of missing or unauthorised use of nuclear and radioactive material were reported to the U.N. atomic agency in 2013, highlighting the challenges facing world leaders at a nuclear security summit next week. Any loss or theft of highly enriched uranium, plutonium or different types of radioactive sources is potentially serious as al Qaeda-style militants could try to use them to make a crude nuclear device or a so-called "dirty bomb", experts say. Denis Flory, deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said most of the reported incidents concerned small quantities of radioactive material. In a "dirty bomb", conventional explosives are used to disperse radiation from a radioactive source, which can be found in hospitals, factories or other places that may not be very well protected.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/missing-radioactive-material-may-pose-dirty-bomb-threat-133346373.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2014 02:45:02 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">missing-radioactive-material-may-pose-dirty-bomb-threat-133346373</guid></item><item><title>Gunmen ram explosives-laden tanker into Iraq police HQ, killing 15</title><description>By Ghazwan Hassan TIKRIT, Iraq (Reuters) - Scores of gunmen took over a federal police headquarters in northern Iraq on Friday before ramming a tanker laden with explosives into the building, killing at least 15 people, a government official said. The battalion commander and four high-ranking officers were among the dead, trapped under debris when the force of the blast brought the building down on them in the village of Injana, the official said. The mayor of the nearby town of Sulaiman Pek, 160 km (100 miles) north of Baghdad, said security forces later regained control over the village. Islamist militants occupied Sulaiman Pek last month and raised the black flag of the Sunni Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group inspired by al Qaeda, over it.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/gunmen-ram-explosives-laden-tanker-iraq-police-hq-211435018.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2014 02:44:35 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">gunmen-ram-explosives-laden-tanker-iraq-police-hq-211435018</guid></item><item><title>Turkish Twitter ban draws public fury, sets PM at odds with president</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/turkeys-gul-odds-erdogan-over-twitter-ban-104606627--sector.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/zO6Z5hlxQYmqf7uctvHtAQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-03-21T183032Z_3_CDEEA2K0TWX00_RTROPTP_2_TURKEY.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="Turkish riot police prevent the protesters marching through the election rally of Turkey&amp;#039;s ruling Ak Party to protest against PM Erdogan in Eskisehir" align="left" title="Turkish riot police prevent the protesters marching through the election rally of Turkey&amp;#039;s ruling Ak Party to protest against PM Erdogan in Eskisehir" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;By Nick Tattersall and Orhan Coskun ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey&amp;#039;s ban on Twitter ahead of bitterly contested elections sparked public fury over a &amp;quot;digital coup&amp;quot; on Friday, brought international condemnation and triggered a rift between prime minister and president.

It was the first disclosure of costs for the U.S. ships and aircraft joining the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-370, which went missing almost two weeks ago with 239 people aboard. The United States initially dispatched the Navy's guided-missile destroyer USS Kidd, as well as the USS Pinckney, to comb the seas for any signs of wreckage. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren acknowledged that some of the costs of the hunt would have been money spent regardless.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/u-search-missing-malaysian-jetliner-cost-2-5-180755827--sector.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 23:37:55 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">u-search-missing-malaysian-jetliner-cost-2-5-180755827--sector</guid></item><item><title>OSCE extraordinary meeting to decide on monitors for Ukraine</title><description>The OSCE is to hold an extraordinary meeting on Friday evening and diplomats said the European rights and security body could finally reach a unanimous agreement to send a monitoring mission to Ukraine. Asked if agreement had been reached in principle among the 57 states that make up the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, one Western diplomat said: "It seems so." The meeting was scheduled to start at 1830 GMT at the OSCE's Vienna headquarters, officials said. Ukraine, locked in a confrontation with its former Soviet overlord Russia over Moscow's annexation of its Crimean peninsula, wants OSCE monitors to be deployed on its territory, as do Western countries. However, attempts to reach agreement have so far failed due to what Western diplomats described as Russian objections to the mission's mandate.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/osce-extraordinary-meeting-decide-monitors-ukraine-180842689.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 23:38:42 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">osce-extraordinary-meeting-decide-monitors-ukraine-180842689</guid></item><item><title>Uruguay asks U.S. to free Cubans in return for Guantanamo transfer</title><description>Uruguay has asked the United States to free Cuban prisoners as a gesture in return for the South American country agreeing to accept detainees from the much-criticized Guantanamo detention center, President Jose Mujica said on Friday. Uruguay said on Thursday that at Washington's request it would take some inmates from the U.S. military base of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which has been used since 2002 to hold people captured after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. "We're not embarrassed to say that we asked the North American government if they would please do what they could because those two or three Cuban prisoners, they have been there many years, a way is being sought to free them, because that is also shameworthy," said Mujica. Mujica, a 78-year-old ex-guerrilla who was himself in prison for more than a decade during his country's dictatorship, added that the arrival of the Guantanamo detainees was "far from finalized" but that they would be free men in Uruguay.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/uruguay-asks-u-free-cubans-return-guantanamo-transfer-173356010.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 23:03:56 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">uruguay-asks-u-free-cubans-return-guantanamo-transfer-173356010</guid></item><item><title>U.N. rights investigator accuses Israel of "ethnic cleansing"</title><description>By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA (Reuters) - A U.N. human rights investigator accused Israel on Friday of "ethnic cleansing" in pushing Palestinians out of East Jerusalem and cast doubt that the Israeli government could accept a Palestinian state in the current climate.

Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, EU presidents Herman Van Rompuy and Jose Manuel Barroso, and the leaders of the bloc's 28 nations signed the core chapters of the Association Agreement during an EU summit in Brussels. Soon afterwards, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed legislation completing the process of absorbing Crimea into Russia, defying Western leaders who say the Black Sea peninsula remains part of Ukraine. The deal commits Ukraine and the EU to closer political and economic cooperation, although its more substantial parts concerning free trade will be signed only after Ukraine has held a presidential election on May 25.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/european-union-signs-landmark-political-deal-ukraine-122830956--business.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 17:58:30 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">european-union-signs-landmark-political-deal-ukraine-122830956--business</guid></item><item><title>Russia in Crimea?

European governments and mainstream politicians may have united in condemnation of Russian President Vladimir Putin's seizure of the Black Sea peninsula against Ukraine's wishes. But the populist movements vying to make big gains in European Parliament elections in May reckon Brussels is mostly to blame.

The mayor of the nearby town of Sulaiman Pek, 160 km (100 miles) north of Baghdad, said security forces were still fighting the gunmen, who also seized control of another town in the area called Serha. Militants occupied Sulaiman Pek last month and raised the black flag of the Sunni Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) over it.

Parliamentary approval of the pact would pave the way for greater economic integration between the two former geopolitical foes, by opening 80 of China's service sectors to Taiwan and 64 Taiwan sectors to China. They held up signs opposing both the pact on trade in services with mainland China, the island's biggest export destination, and what they called the undemocratic methods used to push the bill over an initial legislative hurdle. "We oppose the abuse of power by a small political body to ram through this bill," said college student Blink Lin, 25, one of hundreds of protesters crowding the floor of parliament.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-protesters-dig-over-china-trade-bill-101952416--business.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 15:49:52 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">taiwan-protesters-dig-over-china-trade-bill-101952416--business</guid></item><item><title>Japan confirms meeting of PM Abe with South Korea president</title><description>Japan and South Korea said on Friday that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will meet South Korean President Park Geun-hye for the first time in a trilateral meeting with the United States next week. The meeting, on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit in The Hague, comes amid chilled ties between the Asian neighbours over anger in South Korea that Japanese leaders have not atoned for Japan's wartime aggression, including the use of Korean sex slaves, as well as friction over the ownership of contested islands. In move to thaw ties with another neighbour, Japan said it had agreed to hold formal talks with North Korea for the first time in more than a year to discuss Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes, the fate of Japanese citizens abducted decades ago and other bilateral issues. Abe, Park and U.S. President Barack Obama would discuss nuclear non-proliferation and missile programmes, the Japanese and Korean foreign ministries said, in talks on either March 24 or 25.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/japan-confirms-meeting-pm-abe-south-korea-president-084151170.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 15:06:51 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">japan-confirms-meeting-pm-abe-south-korea-president-084151170</guid></item><item><title>Putin opposes immediate sanctions on Americans - news agencies</title><description>MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Friday Russia should for the time being refrain from imposing sanctions on Americans in retaliation for punitive measures announced by the United States, Russian news agencies reported.

Lavrov made the remarks in a speech to the upper house of parliament in which he urged the chamber to approve a treaty signed by President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday to make Ukraine's Crimea region part of Russia.

The plans, the largest of which is for 839 homes in the Ariel settlement bloc, are at different stages of approval but none has yet been given the final green light needed from the Defence Ministry, Israeli Peace Now said. Settlement expansion in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which with the Gaza Strip make up the territory of the Palestinians' planned independent state, is a major stumbling block in the already faltering peace talks between the sides. A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Nabil Abu Rdainah, said Israel was trying to derail the peace talks: "The Israelis are trying to push the talks to a dead end with this systematic escalation of continuing settlement activity." Palestinians say settlements, built on land Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East war and deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice, bar them from establishing a viable and contiguous state.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/israel-promotes-plans-2-372-settler-homes-west-081052924.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2014 13:40:52 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">israel-promotes-plans-2-372-settler-homes-west-081052924</guid></item></channel>
