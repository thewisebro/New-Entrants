On February 10, the EU agreed to begin negotiations with Cuba to increase trade, investment and dialogue on human rights in its most significant diplomatic shift since Brussels lifted sanctions on the communist-ruled country in 2008. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said Cuba welcomed the proposal as it "signifies the end of the unilateral policy of the EU towards Cuba," adding that Havana was ready to start negotiations. "On the basis of equality and mutual respect, Cuba is completely willing to discuss any topic, including human rights, about which we have many concerns about what is happening in several European countries," Rodriguez said.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/cuba-agrees-open-talks-eu-political-accord-172020254.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 22:50:20 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">cuba-agrees-open-talks-eu-political-accord-172020254</guid></item><item><title>Williams seeks to revive fortunes with Martini</title><description>By Keith Weir LONDON (Reuters) - Former champion Formula One team Williams believes a new sponsorship deal with Italian drinks brand Martini can help to make it competitive again after a dismal season in 2013. The team will race under the Williams Martini name in a new predominantly white car with distinctive blue and red stripes as part of a multi-year agreement. The sponsorship has added to a mood of optimism that Williams is on the way back after a strong showing from new driver Felipe Massa in pre-season testing. I hope it's as quick, consistent and reliable as it is beautiful," added the former Ferrari driver.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/williams-seeks-revive-fortunes-martini-163644320--sector.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 22:06:44 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">williams-seeks-revive-fortunes-martini-163644320--sector</guid></item><item><title>Fire breaks out at Bangladesh garments factory, no casualties</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/fire-breaks-bangladesh-garments-factory-casualties-unknown-133859314--sector.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l1.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/IsNKwHyhqHAqTO53ZnUicw--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-03-06T155131Z_1_CDEEA25181Z00_RTROPTP_2_BANGLADESH-FIRE.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="Locals and fire-fighters try to control a fire at a garment factory in Dhaka March 6, 2014.

Russia's effective seizure of Crimea, and its threat of further military intervention to protect Russian-speakers there and elsewhere in Ukraine, have confronted Kiev with its deepest crisis since it won independence from Moscow in 1991. Putin has said that military force would be a last resort.

Marwan Salha, acting chairman of MEA, told Reuters the flight, scheduled to leave at 1240 (1040 GMT), had been delayed for six minutes while MEA staff looked for Mahdi al-Amiri, son of Hadi al-Amiri, and his friend in the business lounge. "The plane took off but one of the passengers turned out to be the son of the minister of Iraq." Salha said that when Amiri arrived at the gate he was angry and said: "I will not allow the plane to land in Baghdad." Twenty-one minutes into the flight, the Baghdad airport station manager called MEA operations to tell them there was no clearance to land, Salha said.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/iraqi-ministers-son-misses-flight-forces-plane-back-144541594--finance.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 20:15:41 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">iraqi-ministers-son-misses-flight-forces-plane-back-144541594--finance</guid></item><item><title>Ukraine will defend itself if Russian military intervention escalates-PM</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/ukraine-defend-itself-russian-military-intervention-escalates-pm-143909092--business.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/SNNH8k70U40aflxVpf4c1Q--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-03-06T143818Z_1_CDEEA2514NY00_RTROPTP_2_UKRAINE-CRISIS-PM-DEFEND.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="Ukraine&amp;#039;s Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk holds a news conference during a European leaders emergency summit on Ukraine, in Brussels March 6, 2014.

The announcement came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in the United States to press his case for tougher international action against Iran over its disputed nuclear programme and support for Islamist guerrilla groups. The Panamanian-flagged cargo vessel Klos C was boarded in international waters without resistance from its 17-strong crew in a "complex, covert operation", military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner told reporters. Lerner said dozens of M302 rockets were found aboard the Klos C, a weapon that could have struck deep into Israel from Gaza and would have significantly enhanced the firepower of the Palestinian enclave's Hamas rulers and other armed factions.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/israel-says-seized-gaza-bound-rocket-shipment-iran-064516922--finance.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 12:15:16 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">israel-says-seized-gaza-bound-rocket-shipment-iran-064516922--finance</guid></item><item><title>Five Afghan soldiers killed in air strike by NATO-led force - official</title><description>Five Afghan soldiers were killed in an air strike by the NATO-led force in Afghanistan on Thursday in eastern Logar province, a government official said.

The U.S. military conducted multiple operations targeting China over what Washington believes are "excessive" claims about its maritime boundaries and its effort to force foreign warships to obtain permission before peacefully transiting its territorial seas.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/u-freedom-navigation-operations-2013-targeted-china-iran-051750093--finance.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 10:47:50 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">u-freedom-navigation-operations-2013-targeted-china-iran-051750093--finance</guid></item><item><title>U.S., China officials agree Ukraine's territorial integrity important</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/u-china-officials-agree-ukraines-territorial-integrity-important-051545744.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://l3.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/miVSP5GjRTE94tBTevahtQ--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTg2O3E9NzU7dz0xMzA-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2014-03-06T051545Z_1_CDEEA250EMM00_RTROPTP_2_UKRAINE-CRISIS-OBAMA-CHINA.JPG" width="130" height="86" alt="Pro-Russian demonstrators clash with participants of an anti-war rally as riot police try to separate them, in Donetsk March 5, 2014.

A sale of the treasure trove, which includes 1,400 gold pieces in nearly mint condition, will proceed as planned, said coin expert David McCarthy of currency firm Kagin's. "To my knowledge, no legitimate claims have surfaced, and I don't think that any will," McCarthy told Reuters. Theories about the history of the Saddle Ridge Hoard, named by the owners after an area of land where they unearthed the coins in April, have emerged since the discovery was made public last week. The coins were discovered buried in eight decaying metal cans on the couple's property in California's so-called Gold Country.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/no-legitimate-claim-10-million-california-gold-firm-035510043.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 09:25:10 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">no-legitimate-claim-10-million-california-gold-firm-035510043</guid></item><item><title>CIA probing allegations it improperly monitored Senate committee - reports</title><description>The CIA has begun a probe of whether members of the agency secretly monitored a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation of Bush-era detention and interrogation policies, according to media reports on Wednesday. The New York Times, quoting officials with knowledge of the investigation, said the CIA's inspector general launched the probe after members of Congress complained that agency officers had improperly accessed the work of Intelligence Committee staffers. According to one official cited by the newspaper, CIA employees went so far as to gain access to computer networks the committee was using in its work for a report on the detention program conducted during President George W. Bush's administration. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin said in a statement that "if, as alleged in the media, CIA accessed without permission or authority a computer network dedicated for use by a Senate committee, it would be an extremely serious matter." The Michigan Democrat said such activity, if true, "would impede Congress' ability to carry out its constitutional oversight responsibilities and could violate federal law." CIA Director John Brennan said he was "deeply dismayed that some members of the Senate have decided to make spurious allegations about CIA actions that are wholly unsupported by the facts.</description><link>http://in.news.yahoo.com/cia-probing-allegations-improperly-monitored-senate-committee-reports-034846290--finance.html</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 09:18:46 +0530</pubDate><source url="http://www.reuters.com/">Reuters</source><guid isPermaLink="false">cia-probing-allegations-improperly-monitored-senate-committee-reports-034846290--finance</guid></item><item><title>Singapore police probe 'unnatural' death of American CEO of bitcoin trader</title><description>Singapore police are investigating what they have called the "unnatural" death of a 28-year-old American woman who ran a small exchange that traded virtual currencies, including bitcoins, from the Asian city state.
