				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/love-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015414" alt=" some people's lack of resilience to addictive behaviours may be linked to poor development of their oxytocin systems." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/love-med.jpg" /></a> Some people&#8217;s lack of resilience to addictive behaviours may be linked to poor development of their oxytocin systems.
<p>Addictive behaviour such as drug and alcohol abuse may be associated with poor development of the so-called &#8220;love hormone&#8221; system in our bodies during early childhood, scientists say.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking idea has resulted from a review of worldwide research into oxytocin, known as the &#8220;love hormone&#8221; because of its important role in enhancing social interactions, maternal behaviour and partnership, said researchers at the University of Adelaide.</p>
<p>Dr Femke Buisman-Pijlman from the University of Adelaide&#8217;s School of Medical Sciences said some people&#8217;s lack of resilience to addictive behaviours may be linked to poor development of their oxytocin systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that newborn babies already have levels of oxytocin in their bodies, and this helps to create the all-important bond between a mother and her child,&#8221; Buisman-Pijlman said in an edition of the journal Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior which dealt with the current state of research linking oxytocin and addiction.</p>
<p>&#8220;But our oxytocin systems aren&#8217;t fully developed when we&#8217;re born &#8211; they don&#8217;t finish developing until the age of three, which means our systems are potentially subject to a range of influences both external and internal,&#8221; Buisman-Pijlman said.</p>
<p>She said the oxytocin system develops mainly based on experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main factors that affect our oxytocin systems are genetics, gender and environment. You can&#8217;t change the genes you&#8217;re born with, but environmental factors play a substantial role in the development of the oxytocin system until our systems are fully developed,&#8221; Buisman-Pijlman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Previous research has shown that there is a high degree of variability in people&#8217;s oxytocin levels. We&#8217;re interested in how and why people have such differences in oxytocin, and what we can do about it to have a beneficial impact on people&#8217;s health and wellbeing,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She said studies show that some risk factors for drug addiction already exist at four years of age.</p>
<p>&#8220;And because the hardware of the oxytocin system finishes developing in our bodies at around age three, this could be a critical window to study. Oxytocin can reduce the pleasure of drugs and feeling of stress, but only if the system develops well,&#8221; Buisman-Pijlman said.</p>
<p>Her theory is that adversity in early life is key to the impaired development of the oxytocin system.</p>
<p>&#8220;This adversity could take the form of a difficult birth, disturbed bonding or abuse, deprivation, or severe infection, to name just a few factors,&#8221; Buisman-Pijlman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding what occurs with the oxytocin system during the first few years of life could help us to unravel this aspect of addictive behaviour and use that knowledge for treatment and prevention,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015398&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/parenting-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015375" alt="While parents certainly seem to shape child behaviour, parenting also is influenced by the child's behaviour." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/parenting-med.jpg" /></a> While parents certainly seem to shape child behaviour, parenting also is influenced by the child&#8217;s behaviour.
<p>Scientists have presented the most conclusive evidence yet that genes play a significant role in parenting.</p>
<p>Michigan State University psychologists have challenged the popular theory that how adults parent their children is strictly a function of the way they were themselves parented when they were children.</p>
<p>While environmental factors do play a role in parenting, so do a person&#8217;s genes, said S Alexandra Burt, associate professor of psychology and co-author of a study led by doctoral student Ashlea M Klahr.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we parent is not solely a function of the way we were parented as children. There also appears to be genetic influences on parenting,&#8221; Burt said.</p>
<p>Klahr and Burt conducted a statistical analysis of 56 scientific studies from around the world on the origins of parenting behaviour, including some of their own.</p>
<p>The comprehensive analysis, involving more than 20,000 families from Australia to Japan to the United States, found that genetic influences in the parents account for 23 per cent to 40 per cent of parental warmth, control and negativity towards their children.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s still not clear, however, is whether genes directly influence parenting or do so indirectly, through parent personality for example,&#8221; Klahr said.</p>
<p>The study sheds light on another misconception: that parenting is solely a top-down process from parent to child.</p>
<p>While parents certainly seem to shape child behaviour, parenting also is influenced by the child&#8217;s behaviour &#8211; in other words, parenting is both a cause and a consequence of child behaviour.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most consistent and striking findings to emerge from this study was the important role that children&#8217;s characteristics play in shaping all aspects of parenting,&#8221; the authors said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, parenting styles stem from many factors, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parents have their own experiences when they were children, their own personalities, their own genes. On top of that, they are also responding to their child&#8217;s behaviours and stage of development,&#8221; Burt said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, there are a lot of influences happening simultaneously. Long story short, though, we need to be sensitive to the fact that this is a two-way process between parent and child that is both environmental and genetic,&#8221;Burt<br />
said.</p>
<p>The study is published in Psychological Bulletin, a journal of the American Psychological Association.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015364&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Scientists believe that if you can get rid of toxic tau protein, you can potentially stop the spread of tau-related dementia.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015191&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2015199" alt="m_id_382049_alzheimer" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/m_id_382049_alzheimer.jpg" /> <br />Researchers managed to remove the toxic oligomeric tau that causes Alzheimer without also removing the normal functional tau protein.
<p>Researchers have discovered a new method that may halt the progression of dementia caused by accumulation of a protein known as tau. Normally, tau protein is involved in microtubule formation, which acts as a brain cell&#8217;s transportation system for carrying nutrients in and waste out.</p>
<p>In the absence of tau protein, brain cells become dysfunctional and eventually die, said researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.</p>
<p>In many forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy caused by multiple concussions, the tau protein starts behaving badly and instead of performing its normal cellular functions, it begins accumulating and interfering with cell-to-cell communications.</p>
<p>Without the ability of brain cells to receive signals, they become severely dysfunctional and if enough of them die in a given area of the brain, the result is cognitive impairment, which means difficulty in planning tasks and remembering things.</p>
<p>This accumulation of tau results in the formation of tau oligomers, the toxic form of tau protein. Scientists believe that if you can get rid of this toxic oligomeric tau protein, you can potentially stop the spread of tau-related dementia.</p>
<p>The trick is to remove the toxic oligomeric tau without also removing the normal, functional tau protein. Researchers did just that and demonstrated that treatment with their tau oligomer-specific monoclonal antibody, called TOMA, in experiments involving a rodent model of tauopathy (tau-related dementia) improved locomotor function and performance on memory tests.</p>
<p>The TOMA antibody sticks to the oligomeric tau so it can no longer interfere with cell-to-cell communication, but leaves the native tau protein intact.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is significant because this research describes a very promising vaccination strategy for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, which could prevent memory loss from occurring later in life,&#8221; said professor Rakez Kayed, senior author of the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;No safety concerns were detected in mice receiving this treatment, but more research is needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of immunisation in other animals and in humans,&#8221; said Kayed. The study was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015191&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/smell-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014138" alt="Researchers said the findings could help explain the wide variability of smell perception in humans. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/smell-m.jpg" /></a> Researchers said the findings could help explain the wide variability of smell perception in humans. (Reuters)
<p>Scents and smells can form the basis of some of the most significant memories humans form in their lives, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>The discovery may provide a means to detect early problems with memory formation and memory retrieval in the brain, researchers said.</p>
<p>An international team led by University of Queensland has boosted understanding of the smell-memory connection, showing that olfactory memory in honeybees regulates receptors in their antennae.</p>
<p>Bees&#8217; antennae function like a human nose, said Queensland Brain Institute scientists Dr Judith Reinhard and Associate Professor Charles Claudianos.</p>
<p>&#8220;French novelist Marcel Proust in his novel Remembrance of Things Past (also known as In Search of Lost Time) described how his childhood memories started to flow when he tasted a madeleine cake dipped in linden tea, as he had been given as a child,&#8221; Reinhard said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our team found that odour memories trigger recall of associated events, and that long-term odour memory formation in the brain regulates the sense of smell in the &#8216;nose&#8217; via regulating the receptor molecules,&#8221; Reinhard said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Preferences for different foods and beverages are linked to our sense of smell, and our research shows that long-term scent memories modify how odours are perceived,&#8221; said Reinhard.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a nutshell: our smell experiences shape our preferences,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The study demonstrates for the first time that the ability to smell different things is experience-dependent and modulated by scent conditioning,&#8221; said Reinhard.</p>
<p>Claudianos said the findings could help explain the wide variability of smell perception in humans and the neurological mechanism underlying the common phenomenon of &#8220;acquired taste&#8221;, where repeated sensory experience with a flavour or aroma leads to perceptual changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This knowledge will provide an enormous insight for understanding food and aroma perception,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The discovery may also provide a means to detect early problems with memory formation and memory retrieval in the brain,&#8221; said Claudianos.</p>
<p>Individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia or neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s disease often have an altered sense of smell perception, researchers said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014128&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/diet-med.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013416" alt="&quot;The 5:2 diet is the most promising popular diet around." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/diet-med.gif" /></a> &#8220;The 5:2 diet is the most promising popular diet around.
<p>Australian scientists have claimed that eating sporadically, like animals in the wild, could make people healthier and live longer.</p>
<p>According to researchers at University of New South Wales, hungry animals recycle nutrients stored in their cells which means they need less food to survive and also promote cell repair.</p>
<p>In the wild, this recycling of nutrients allows animals to breed during hard times, promoting survival of the herd unlike animals in laboratory, a news agency reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wild animals don&#8217;t often die of cancer and diseases of old age. They tend to die young as a result of environmental hazards and exposure to parasites,&#8221; said Margo Adler, lead author of a study published in the journal BioEssays.</p>
<p>&#8220;People might be able to reap some of the lifespan and anti-cancer benefits from dietary restriction or interventions that mimic its effects,&#8221; said Adler, evolutionary biologist at the University of New South Wales.</p>
<p>She also endorsed the intermittent fasting concept as made popular by British doctor Michael Mosley&#8217;s 5:2 diet, a form of intermittent fasting that involves severe calorie restriction for two non-consecutive days a week and normal<br />
eating on the other five days.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 5:2 diet is the most promising popular diet around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the popular diets are not based in science. But researchers have found that fasting can have long-term benefits similar to dietary restriction,&#8221; Adler said.</p>
<p>However, people on the 5:2 diet might benefit from reducing their protein intake as well as calories on fasting days.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013401&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/heart-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013409" alt="In 2008, more than 17 million people died from a cardiovascular cause globally." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/heart-med.jpg" /></a> In 2008, more than 17 million people died from a cardiovascular cause globally.
<p>Eating ghee or butter, high in saturated fats, may not increase the risk of heart disease, an Indian-origin scientist has claimed, challenging the medical guidelines that urge people to avoid the &#8216;unhealthy&#8217; fat.</p>
<p>A new study found that the current level of evidence does not support guidelines restricting saturated fatty acid consumption to reduce coronary risk nor does it support high consumption of polyunsaturated fats &#8211; such as omega 3 or omega 6 &#8211; to reduce coronary heart disease.</p>
<p>An international research collaboration led by the University of Cambridge analysed existing cohort studies and randomised trials on coronary risk and fatty acid intake.</p>
<p>The researchers also found insufficient support for guidelines which advocate the high consumption of polyunsaturated fats (such as omega 3 and omega 6) to reduce the risk of coronary disease. When specific fatty acid subtypes (such as different types of omega 3) were examined, the effects of the fatty acids on cardiovascular risk varied even within the same broad &#8216;family&#8217; – questioning the existing dietary guidelines that focus principally on the total amount of fat from saturated or unsaturated rather than the food sources of the fatty acid.</p>
<p>These are interesting results that potentially stimulate new lines of scientific enquiry and encourage careful reappraisal of our current nutritional guidelines, said Dr Rajiv Chowdhury, lead author of the research. &#8220;In 2008, more than 17 million people died from a cardiovascular cause globally. With so many affected by this illness, it is critical to have appropriate prevention guidelines which are informed by the best available scientific evidence,&#8221; Chowdhury said.</p>
<p>The researchers analysed data from 72 unique studies with over 600,000 participants from 18 nations. They found that total saturated fatty acid, whether measured in the diet or in the bloodstream as a bio-marker, was not associated with coronary disease risk in the studies.</p>
<p>Similarly, when analysing the studies that involved assessments of the consumption of total monounsaturated fatty acids, long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, there were no significant associations between consumption and cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p>Researchers found that different subtypes of circulating long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids had different associations with coronary risk, with some evidence that circulating levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (two main types of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids), and arachidonic acid (an omega-6 fat) are each associated with lower coronary risk. The study was published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013392&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/choc-med.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013338" alt="The health benefits of eating dark chocolate have been extolled for centuries, but the exact reason has remained a mystery." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/choc-med.gif" /></a> The health benefits of eating dark chocolate have been extolled for centuries, but the exact reason has remained a mystery.
<p>Gut bacteria in our stomach gobble dark chocolate and ferment it into anti-inflammatory compounds that are good for the heart, a new study has found.</p>
<p>The health benefits of eating dark chocolate have been extolled for centuries, but the exact reason has remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Researchers from Louisiana State University have now found that bacteria in our stomach ferment chocolate into useful anti-inflammatory compounds that are good for the heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that there are two kinds of microbes in the gut: the &#8216;good&#8217; ones and the &#8216;bad&#8217; ones,&#8221; said Maria Moore, one of the study&#8217;s researchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The good microbes, such as Bifidobacterium and lactic acid bacteria, feast on chocolate. When you eat dark chocolate, they grow and ferment it, producing compounds that are anti-inflammatory,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The other bacteria in the gut are associated with inflammation and can cause gas, bloating, diarrhea and constipation. These include some Clostridia and some E coli.</p>
<p>&#8220;When these compounds are absorbed by the body, they lessen the inflammation of cardiovascular tissue, reducing the long-term risk of stroke,&#8221; said John Finley, who led the study.</p>
<p>He said that the study is the first to look at the effects of dark chocolate on the various types of bacteria in the stomach.</p>
<p>The team tested three cocoa powders using a model digestive tract, composed of a series of modified test tubes, to simulate normal digestion.</p>
<p>They subjected the non-digestible materials to anaerobic fermentation using human fecal bacteria.</p>
<p>Finley explained that cocoa powder, an ingredient in chocolate, contains several polyphenolic, or antioxidant, compounds such as catechin and epicatechin, and a small amount of dietary fibre.</p>
<p>Both components are poorly digested and absorbed, but when they reach the colon, the desirable microbes take over.</p>
<p>&#8220;In our study we found that the fibre is fermented and the large polyphenolic polymers are metabolised to smaller molecules, which are more easily absorbed. These smaller polymers exhibit anti-inflammatory activity,&#8221; Finley said.</p>
<p>Finley also noted that combining the fibre in cocoa with prebiotics is likely to improve a person&#8217;s overall health and help convert polyphenolics in the stomach into anti-inflammatory compounds.</p>
<p>Prebiotics are carbohydrates found in foods like raw garlic and cooked whole wheat flour that humans can&#8217;t digest but that good bacteria like to eat.</p>
<p>Finley said that people could experience even more health benefits when dark chocolate is combined with solid fruits like pomegranates and acai.</p>
<p>The findings were presented at a meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Dallas.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013315&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>British researchers are embarking on a new study in collaboration with colleagues from across Europe to identify early signs of physiological change in the body that indicate nascent cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem with cardiovascular disease is that it often develops unnoticed over years before becoming a serious problem,&#8221; Doctor Christian Delles of the Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, key collaborator on the project which is worth 557,000 pounds the University of Glasgow, said.</p>
<p>Despite being the biggest killer in the Western world the individual causes of the various types of CVD: coronary heart disease, heart attack, heart failure and stroke, are still largely unknown.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all know that smoking, over-consumption of alcohol and a high-fat diet can increase the risk of developing CVD but we currently know very little about the earliest stages of the disease, which at are at least in part, reversible,&#8221; Delles said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At present drug-based interventions are based on risk-factor control – for example through reducing existing high blood pressure or using statins to reduce blood cholesterol levels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, if we can identify early signs or biomarkers of the disease before symptoms arise, we have the opportunity to develop interventions to stop disease before it becomes a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to understand what transformations do take place in the body in the early stages of CVD, the scientists will closely study the proteins expressed by different genes and look for disease-specific changes – a field of study known as proteomics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Identifying a range of biomarkers involved in CVD could ultimately lead to treatment tailored to an individual&#8217;s own body – heralding a new era of personalised medicine.</p>
<p>In future, cardiovascular disease may be treated before it is even noticed by the patient and has had the chance to cause irreparable damage.</p>
<p>The four-year study, entitled &#8220;Systems Biology to Identify Molecular Targets for Vascular Disease Treatment&#8221; (SysVasc), is being coordinated by Professor Burkert Pieske at the Medical University of Graz in Austria.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011300&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><a title="If detected early,cancer can be cured,says expert" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ludhiana/if-detected-early-cancer-can-be-cured-says-expert/" target="_blank">Mindfulness-based meditation</a> could lessen some symptoms associated with cancer in teens, scientists say. Mindfulness-based meditation focuses on the present moment and the connection between the mind and body.</p>
<p>In a new study, researchers at the University of Montreal and its affiliated CHU Sainte-Justine children&#8217;s hospital asked 13 adolescents with cancer to complete questionnaires covering mood (positive and negative emotions, anxiety and depression), sleep and quality of life.</p>
<p>The group was divided in two: a first group of eight adolescents were offered eight mindfulness-based meditation sessions and the remaining five adolescents in the control group were put on a wait-list.</p>
<p>The eight sessions were 90 minutes long and took place weekly. After the last meditation session, patients from both groups filled out the same questionnaires a second time. &#8220;We analysed differences in mood, sleep and quality of life scores for each participant and then between each group to evaluate if mindfulness sessions had a greater impact than the simple passage of time,&#8221; said Catherine Malboeuf-Hurtubise of the University of Montreal&#8217;s Department of Psychology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that teenagers that participated in the mindfulness group had lower scores in depression after our 8 sessions.&#8221; Girls from the mindfulness group reported sleeping better. We also noticed that they developed mindfulness skills to a greater extent than boys during the sessions,&#8221; Malboeuf-Hurtubise said. &#8220;Our results suggest that mindfulness sessions could be helpful in improving mood and sleep in teenagers with cancer,as previous oncology research suggests with adults,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Differences between both groups were not large enough for the researchers to impute observed benefits solely to the mindfulness component of the sessions. &#8220;The social support provided to the adolescents in the mindfulness group could possibly explain observed benefits on mood and sleep,&#8221; Malboeuf-Hurtubise said. &#8220;Nonetheless, mindfulness-based interventions for teenagers with cancer appear as a promising option to lighten psychological inconveniences of living with cancer,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010312&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People with blood pressure that is elevated but not enough to be considered “high” are still at an increased risk for strokes, according to a new analysis of past studies.</p>
<p>Researchers found that having so-called pre-hypertension was linked to a 66 per cent increased risk of stroke. “There has been disagreement in the community in general,” Dr Joshua Willey, a neurologist at Columbia University in New York, said.</p>
<p>“Are these people at risk for stroke?” Blood pressure is measured using two numbers. The first, known as the systolic or top number, is a measure of the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats.</p>
<p>The second, known as the diastolic or bottom number, is the pressure in the arteries between heartbeats. Normal blood pressure is a systolic reading of less than 120 millimeters of mercury and a diastolic reading of less than 80 mm Hg.</p>
<p>High blood pressure, or hypertension, is defined as a reading of 140/90 mm Hg or above. Blood pressure readings between the normal and high marks are considered pre-hypertension.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010159&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many observational studies have suggested that vitamin D may have benefits for heart health. Now a randomised trial has found that vitamin D appears to reduce levels of LDL, or “bad” cholesterol.</p>
<p>Researchers randomly assigned 576 post-menopausal women to either a daily dose of 400 units of vitamin D and 1,000 milligrams of calcium, or a placebo.</p>
<p>They followed them for three years. By the end of the study, published in Menopause, the vitamin D group had significantly higher serum levels of vitamin D, and a small but notable drop in LDL. “We don’t have enough here to say that we’ve figured it all out,” said the lead author, Dr Peter F Schnatz, a professor of internal medicine at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The change in LDL, he said, “is significant, and in the right direction, but maybe not enough to say that we’re going to prevent people from getting heart disease.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010153&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Day 3 of my long-coveted trial of a treadmill desk, I sat down.</p>
<p>Day 1 had been all about showing off.</p>
<p>Yes, you can type while walking, I chirped to my fellow reporters.</p>
<p>No, you can’t fall off at the machine’s top speed of two miles per hour, I assured the ergonomics safety squad.</p>
<p>On Day 2, while strolling in my newsroom cubicle, I had written emails, made phone calls, read material for a story I am researching, bragged to my friends on instant message and scrolled triumphantly through my “tread desk” folder, where I had filed such articles from my own newspaper as “Get Up. Get Out. Don’t Sit,” “Stand Up While You Read This!,” “How Walking May Lower Breast Cancer Risk” and “Is Sitting a Lethal Activity?”</p>
<p>By lunchtime on Day 3, at a slow-but-steady one mile per hour, I had burned about 300 calories without noticing. When I finished a long phone interview, I was thirsty, a little sweaty and downright cheery, feeling the slight mood elevation that comes from a walk through the park.</p>
<p>But when an editor asked for the top of my story, I spent half an hour straining to form a sentence. Slowing down didn’t help.<br />
“You know I need all of your energy,” my brain seemed to be saying, “if you want this to be good.”<br />
First commercialised in 2007, treadmill desks, which consist of an adjustable-height desk surface atop a treadmill optimized for use at slow speeds, were clearly gaining ground.</p>
<p>It took just a few minutes to remove my regular desk to make room for the $4,500 loaner from Steelcase. (LifeSpan, Ergotron, TreadDesk and others also make popular models, starting around $1,000). Other than it moving under my feet, it’s just your basic desk with a console that displays my distance, time and calories burned.</p>
<p>After a few false starts, I began to learn to adjust my speed to the task at hand. Sometimes I was walking too fast to concentrate, but sometimes a slow pace seemed to be a drag on my work. So when I felt my body getting in the way of my brain, I just pushed the treadmill’s up or down buttons.</p>
<p>When it comes to synthesising a lot of information into a coherent article, the hardest part of my job, I still have the powerful urge to sit. And I pause when editors come by to talk, because it seems rude to burn calories while they stand still. But ideal email-writing speeds range from half a mile to 1.5 miles per hour, and the perfect balance for phone interviews is closer to two miles per hour.</p>
<p>As my second week drew to a close, I was logging five-mile days. It seemed clear that I was reaping some of the health benefits of the treadmill desk.</p>
<p>But as I started to write this &#8211; sitting down &#8211; I wondered whether I had missed out on something almost as important that it might offer.</p>
<p>Could walking while writing actually improve my stories, as well as my health? Could those punchy but profound endings that I invariably conceive when I’m out exercising but can’t remember when I’m in front of the screen be channeled by the tread desk?<br />
I might just have to keep it for a while to find out.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010146&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[A new study shows marathon training can’t be too hard on hearts.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010141&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An ingenious new study of marathon runners and their non-running spouses should reassure anyone headed for a spring marathon that prolonged training doesn’t damage the heart, a concern that has been raised in previous research. At the same time, becoming fit as a marathoner doesn’t seem to protect the heart to the extent you might expect, although it may have unexpected benefits for your spouse.</p>
<p>While we all know that exercise is healthy, some research has begun to raise questions about whether it’s possible to overdo a good thing. A few studies have found that long-time endurance athletes can have a heightened risk for abnormal heartbeats, and even for scarring of the heart muscle. Likewise, experiments with lab animals have found possible links between prolonged, extremely strenuous running and undesirable changes in the structure and function of the heart.</p>
<p>But the actual incidence of runners having a heart attack during a marathon race is vanishingly small, a finding that seems to suggest that marathon training can’t be excessively hard on hearts.</p>
<p>Such inconsistencies in the data about prolonged endurance exercise and heart health prompted researchers to wonder if past studies had been too imprecise. It is difficult to isolate the risks associated with strenuous exercise from other lifestyle factors, said Beth Taylor, an assistant professor in the health sciences department at the University of Hartford who led the new study, which was published last month in BMJ Open. Runners whose hearts seemed to have been affected by their exercise habits might also have smoked, gorged on junk food or otherwise imperiled their hearts, separately from how much they worked out.</p>
<p>So Dr Taylor and her colleagues decided to better control for such factors by studying marathon runners along with their domestic partners, who presumably would be sharing their lifestyles if not their physical exertions. If cardiac health differed among these couples, the scientists felt, they could reasonably conclude that training had played a role, since so many lifestyle factors would be the same.</p>
<p>Forty-two runners, along with their spouses or partners, agreed to participate in the study. Half of the runners were women. Their ages ranged from 33 to 59, although most were in their mid- to late 40s. Their partners were around the same age but considerably less active, averaging fewer than two sessions of moderate exercise per week. Many did not formally exercise at all, although most reported frequently walking, gardening or undertaking other types of moderate activity.</p>
<p>The day before the 2012 race, the racers and their partners filled out questionnaires about their exercise and health histories. Scientists then drew blood to determine the volunteers’ vital signs. Finally, each volunteer underwent a heart scan to reveal the buildup of arterial plaques, an indication of heart disease.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the marathon runners were significantly thinner than their partners, although few of the partners were overweight. The runners also generally had lower blood pressure, heart rates, bad cholesterol and other indicators of cardiac health.</p>
<p>But running did not insulate the racers altogether from heart disease, the scientists found. Some of the racers, particularly the oldest ones, carried large deposits of plaques in their arteries, a worrying sign. These older racers also tended to have the highest tallies on a numerical assessment of heart attack risk called the Framingham risk score, which considers medical and lifestyle factors that, along with genetics, can contribute to the development of atherosclerotic plaques.</p>
<p>Over all, Dr Taylor said, the study’s data suggests that if you’re training for a marathon or otherwise doing frequent and prolonged endurance exercise, you’re probably not hurting your heart and are likely strengthening it. But you should be aware of your past health habits and family history.</p>
<p>Perhaps the more surprising takeaway of the study, Dr Taylor said, is that marathon training’s cardiac benefits may be transferable. “The spouses of the runners were quite healthy, too,” she pointed out. More so than many people, they walked and moved around frequently, and had generally robust cardiac risk profiles. Dr Taylor’s conclusion: if you want improved heart health but can’t be a runner, marry one.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010141&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2000567" alt="The newly discovered network triggers reactions even before the conscious brain has time to process them. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/brain-med.jpg" /> The newly discovered network triggers reactions even before the conscious brain has time to process them. (PTI)
<p>Scientists have found for the first time that our brain&#8217;s ability to instantly link what we see with what we do is down to a dedicated information &#8216;highway&#8217;.</p>
<p>Researchers from University College London and Cambridge University found a specialised mechanism for spatial self-awareness that combines visual cues with body motion.</p>
<p>Standard visual processing is prone to distractions, as it requires us to pay attention to objects of interest and filter out others.</p>
<p>The new study found that our brains have separate &#8216;hard-wired&#8217; systems to visually track our own bodies, even if we are not paying attention to them.</p>
<p>In fact, the newly discovered network triggers reactions even before the conscious brain has time to process them.</p>
<p>The researchers tested 52 healthy adults in a series of three experiments. In all experiments, participants used robotic arms to control cursors on two-dimensional displays, where cursor motion was directly linked to hand movement.</p>
<p>Their eyes were kept fixed on a mark at the center of the screen, confirmed with eye tracking.</p>
<p>In the first experiment, participants controlled two separate cursors with their left and right hands, both equally close to the centre.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the cursor or target on one side would jump left or right, requiring subjects to take corrective action. Each jump was &#8216;cued&#8217; with a flash on one side, this was random so did not always correspond to the side about to change.</p>
<p>People reacted faster to target jumps when their attention was drawn to the &#8216;correct&#8217; side by the cue. However, reactions to cursor jumps were fast regardless of cuing, suggesting that a separate mechanism independent of attention is responsible for tracking our own movements.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first experiment showed us that we react very quickly to changes relating to objects directly under our own control, even when we are not paying attention to them,&#8221; said Dr Alexandra Reichenbach of the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, lead author of the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;This provides strong evidence for a dedicated neural pathway linking motor control to visual information, independently of the standard visual systems that are dependent on attention,&#8221; Reichenbach said.</p>
<p>The second experiment was similar to the first, but also introduced changes in brightness to demonstrate the attention effect on the visual perception system.</p>
<p>In the third experiment, participants had to guide one cursor to its target in the presence of up to four dummy targets and cursors, &#8216;distractors&#8217;, alongside the real ones.</p>
<p>In this experiment, responses to cursor jumps were less affected by distractors than responses to target jumps.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results provide further evidence of a dedicated &#8216;visuomotor binding&#8217; mechanism that is less prone to distractions than standard visual processing,&#8221; said Reichenbach.</p>
<p>The newly discovered system could explain why some schizophrenia patients feel like their actions are controlled by someone else, researchers said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009723&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/holi480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008991" alt="Happy Holi!" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/holi480.jpg" /></a> Happy Holi!
<p>The festival of colours, Holi, is round the corner and people are already in a colourful mood. As it is considered to be fair to drench each other in all types of colour, we get you a few skin and hair care tips from a reputed dermatologist to let you enjoy Holi without any tension!</p>
<p>Skincare tips</p>
<p>1) Wear clothes that cover your body entirely and use mustard oil/coconut oil/ olive oil/ vaseline over your entire body a night before and also in the morning so that it gets easier to remove colours post holi</p>
<p>2) Herbal and natural colours like turmeric, tea leaves, henna, marigold flowers etc can be a very good choice for playing holi as they do not harm your skin much.</p>
<p>3) Drink lots of water as skin tends to get dehydrated with the use of chemicals.</p>
<p>4) Use of a toner before stepping out to play Holi helps in closing of the pores of skin thereby reducing the absorption of colours.</p>
<p>5) Use dry hands or cloth to remove gulal rather than using water as it spreads even more with water.</p>
<p>6) A transparent nail polish can take care of your nails, never rub your skin while removing colours and a facial cleanser is a better choice instead of a soap.</p>
<p>7) If any irritation develops after the use of colours, wash the area with cold water and apply calamine lotion and a good moisturizer.</p>
<p>8) Last but not the least, a good waterproof sunscreen and a thick moisturiser is a must</p>
<p>Hair care Tips</p>
<p>1) The best way is to tie your hair.</p>
<p>2) Use coconut oil/rosemary oil to prevent dryness in scalp. Apply conditioner while washing hair post Holi.</p>
<p>3) Hair should be washed with a mild shampoo and lemon juice to prevent dryness and any kind of infection. Do not try to shampoo your hair several times in a day in order to remove all the colour in a single day.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008984&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/heart.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007688" alt=" heart attacks and heart failure - one of the major causes of death worldwide. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/heart.jpg" /></a> Heart attacks and heart failure &#8211; one of the major causes of death worldwide. (PTI)
<p>Scientists claim they are a step closer to developing a new drug to stop heart attack in its tracks and reduce the damage caused, without any side effects.</p>
<p>Researchers from the the Monash University in Australia offer new hope to thousands of people who experience heart attacks and heart failure &#8211; one of the major causes of death worldwide.</p>
<p>They showed new insights into a specific protein belonging to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).</p>
<p>After successfully combining two molecules, they say they are a step closer to creating a brand new class of drug that is more targeted and could possess minimal side effects.</p>
<p>GPCRs play a role in virtually every biological process and most diseases, including, cardiovascular disease, obesity and diabetes, neuropsychiatric disorder, inflammation and cancer, researchers said.</p>
<p>Almost half of all current medications available use GPCRs to achieve their therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>Current GPCR drugs work either by fully activating or completely blocking receptors, treating the protein like a simple &#8220;on-off&#8221; switch.</p>
<p>The new research discovered alternative recognition sites on GPCRs that can be targeted by drugs to fine-tune the behaviour of the protein, basically converting the &#8220;on-off&#8221; switch into a &#8220;dimmer switch&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Correct dosage has been a serious challenge in clinical trials for A1 receptor drugs. The consequences are serious; a dosage that is too high can stop the heart from beating. Too low, and the drug fails to prevent cell damage. Getting this balance right has been a big problem,&#8221; said researcher Peter Scammells.</p>
<p>The study focused on finding new ways to activate the protein, to achieve the beneficial effects (protection) without the side effects (slowing the heart), researchers said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal PNAS.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007668&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Smartphones are not only capable of providing directions or sending photos and videos to your friends, they can also diagnose diseases in real-time, scientists say.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Houston are developing a disease diagnostic system that offers results that could be read using only a smartphone and a USD 20 lens attachment. The new device, like all diagnostic tools, relies on specific chemical interactions that form between something that causes a disease – a virus or bacteria, for example – and a molecule that bonds with that one thing only, like a disease-fighting antibody.</p>
<p>The system developed by Jiming Bao and Richard Willson involves a simple glass slide and a thin film of gold with thousands of holes poked in it. The glass slide is covered by a film of gold with ordered rows and columns of transparent holes where light can pass through.</p>
<p>The device diagnoses an illness by blocking the light with a disease-antibody bond and a few additional ingredients. The disease antibodies are placed in the holes, where they are coaxed into sticking to the glass surface.</p>
<p>A biological sample is flowed over the slide. If the sample contains the bacteria or virus being sought out, it will bond with the antibody in the hole. A second round of antibodies is then flowed that bond with the bacteria over the slide.</p>
<p>Attached to these antibodies are enzymes that produce silver particles when exposed to certain chemicals. With this second set of antibodies now attached to any bacteria in the holes, the entire system is then exposed to the chemicals that encourage silver  production.</p>
<p>About 15 minutes later the slide is rinsed off. Thanks to chemical properties of the gold, the silver particles in the holes remain in place, completely blocking light.</p>
<p>A basic microscope used in elementary school classrooms provides enough light and magnification to show whether the holes are blocked, Willson said. With a few small tweaks, a similar reading could almost certainly be made with a smartphone&#8217;s camera, flash and an attachable lens, researchers said.</p>
<p>The system promises readouts that are affordable and easy to interpret. The study featured in ACS Photonics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006526&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Around 80 per cent cases of blindness in India and 20 per cent of the world&#8217;s blind </span></span><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">population can be treated, an expert has said.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Lack of adequate eye health services was the major cause of cases of blindness in the country. Cataract and refractive error are regarded as the major causes of this handicap, charity body Sightsavers (India) Director of Programme Operations Prasanna kumar said here.</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cancer-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987698" alt="cancer-med" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cancer-med.jpg" /></a> Cancerous Tumours.
<p>People who have had common skin cancers may be at an increased risk of developing melanoma and 29 other cancer types, a new study has warned. Individuals who had nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) were at increased risk for subsequently developing other cancer types, and this association was much higher for those under 25 years of age, researchers said.</p>
<p>NMSC is the most common type of skin cancer. It is relatively easy to treat if detected early, and rarely spreads to other organs, they said. &#8220;Our study shows that NMSC susceptibility is an important indicator of susceptibility to malignant tumours and that the risk is especially high among people who develop NMSC at a young age,&#8221; said Rodney Sinclair, professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne in Australia.</p>
<p>&#8220;The risk increases for a large group of seemingly unrelated cancers; however, the greatest risk relates to other cancers induced by sunlight, such as melanoma,&#8221; said Sinclair. Compared with people who did not have NMSC, those who did were 1.36 times more likely to subsequently develop any cancer, including melanoma and salivary gland, bone, and upper gastrointestinal cancers.</p>
<p>Survivors younger than 25 years of age, however, were 23 times more likely to develop any cancer other than NMSC. In particular, they were 94 and 93 times more likely to get melanoma and salivary gland cancer, respectively. &#8220;Our study identifies people who receive a diagnosis of NMSC at a young age as being at increased risk for cancer and, therefore, as a group who could benefit from screening for internal malignancy,&#8221; said Sinclair.</p>
<p>Researchers hypothesised that people who develop skin cancers later in life do so as a result of accumulated Sun exposure, while those who develop skin cancer at a younger age may do so as a result of an increased susceptibility to cancer in general. To investigate this, they stratified the risk ratios by age and discovered that young people with NMSC are more cancer-prone.</p>
<p>The researchers constructed two cohorts: one of 502,490 people with a history of NMSC, and a cohort of 8,787,513 people who served as controls. They followed up with the participants electronically for five to six years, and 67,148 from the NMSC cohort and 863,441 from the control group subsequently developed cancers.</p>
<p>They found that for those who had NMSC, the relative risk for developing cancers of the bladder, brain, breast, colon, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, and stomach remained consistently elevated for the entire period of the study, and the risk for cancers of the brain, colon, and prostate increased with time.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Bio-markers &amp; Prevention.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005769&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(ENS)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alzhemeir-disease.jpg" /></a> A blood test that can predict with more than 90 per cent accuracy if a healthy person will develop Alzheimer&#8217;s disease within three years. (ENS)
<p>Scientists have developed a blood test that can predict with more than 90 per cent accuracy if a healthy person will develop mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer&#8217;s disease within three years. The blood test can identify 10 lipids, or fats, in the blood that predict Alzheimer&#8217;s disease onset. It could be ready for use in clinical studies in as few as two years, researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our novel blood test offers the potential to identify people at risk for progressive cognitive decline and can change how patients, their families and treating physicians plan for and manage the disorder,&#8221; said the study&#8217;s corresponding author Howard J Federoff, professor of neurology and executive vice president for health sciences at Georgetown University Medical Center.</p>
<p>Federoff said that the efforts to develop drugs to slow or reverse the progression of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease may have failed because the drugs were evaluated too late in the disease process. &#8220;The preclinical state of the disease offers a window of opportunity for timely disease-modifying intervention,&#8221;Federoff said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Biomarkers such as ours that define this asymptomatic period are critical for successful development and application of these therapeutics,&#8221; he added. The study included 525 healthy participants aged 70 and older who gave blood samples upon enrolling and at various points in the study.</p>
<p>Over the course of the five-year study, 74 participants met the criteria for either mild Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) or a condition known as amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), in which memory loss is prominent. Of these, 46 were diagnosed upon enrolment and 28 developed aMCI or mild AD during the study (the latter group<br />
called converters).</p>
<p>In the study&#8217;s third year, the researchers selected 53 participants who developed aMCI/AD (including 18 converters)and 53 cognitively normal matched controls for the lipid biomarker discovery phase of the study. A panel of 10 lipids was discovered, which appears to reveal the breakdown of neural cell membranes in participants<br />
who develop symptoms of cognitive impairment or AD.</p>
<p>The panel was validated using the remaining 21 a MCI/AD participants (including 10 converters), and 20 controls. Blinded data were analysed to determine if the subjects could be characterised into the correct diagnostic categories based solely on the 10 lipids identified by researchers.&#8221;The lipid panel was able to distinguish with 90 per cent accuracy these two distinct groups: cognitively normal participants who would progress to MCI or AD within two to three years, and those who would remain normal in the near future,&#8221; Federoff said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005626&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Using smartphones can give you wrinkles as looking down at handheld devices and computers for countless hours develops a line around the neck and chin, experts have warned.</p>
<p>This terrifying new scourge has been dubbed &#8220;tech neck&#8221; and could affect anyone who owns a modern gadget.</p>
<p>However the effect may last only for a short period of time, &#8216;Mirror&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The &#8220;tech neck&#8221; is a line around the neck and chin which is caused by looking down at handheld devices and computers every day.</p>
<p>The bizarre latest face furrow was identified after a surge of neck-related enquiries for non-surgical, knife-free face-lifts by CACI international, a firm that specialises in &#8221;non-surgical beauty solutions&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We noticed a surge in enquiries for our product, specifically to combat lines around the neck area,&#8221; Dean Nathanson, Managing Director of CACI international, said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve identified a correlation between the rise of technology in recent years and the growth of the &#8216;tech neck&#8217;,&#8221; said Nathanson.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004733&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Thinkstock)
<p>Obese adolescents who do not get adequate sleep may be at a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke, a new study has warned.</p>
<p>Lack of sleep and obesity have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in adults and young children.</p>
<p>However, the association is not as clear in adolescents, an age group that is known to lack adequate sleep.</p>
<p>In a new study, researchers found that cardiometabolic risk in obese adolescents may be predicted by typical sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Heidi B IglayReger and colleagues from the University of Michigan and Baylor University studied 37 obese adolescents (11-17 years of age).</p>
<p>Metabolic syndrome characteristics (fasting cholesterol and blood sugar, waist circumference, body mass index [BMI], and blood pressure) were measured to create a continuous cardiometabolic risk score.</p>
<p>The adolescents were fitted with a physical activity monitor, which was worn 24 hours a day for seven days, to measure typical patterns of physical activity and sleep.</p>
<p>One-third of the participants met the minimum recommendation of being physically active at least 60 minutes a day.</p>
<p>Most participants slept approximately seven hours each night, usually waking up at least once. Only five of the participants met the minimal recommended 8.5 hours of sleep per night.</p>
<p>Even after controlling for factors that may impact cardiometabolic risk, like BMI and physical activity, low levels of sleep remained a significant predictor of cardiometabolic risk in obese teens.</p>
<p>This shows that even among those already considered to be at risk for cardiometabolic disease, in this case obese teens&#8217; decreased sleep duration was predictive of increased cardiometabolic risk, researchers said.</p>
<p>The study cannot determine whether lack of sleep causes cardiometabolic disease or if obesity itself causes sleep disturbances, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The strong association between sleep duration and cardiometabolic risk score independent of the effects of body composition and physical activity suggest a potential influence of sleep duration on cardiometabolic health in obese adolescents,&#8221; said IglayReger.</p>
<p>The study appears in The Journal of Pediatrics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004732&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaria-llll.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003257" alt="Impacts of global warming on the worldwide incidence of malaria, that infects more than 300 million people each year (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/malaria-llll.jpg" /></a> Impacts of global warming on the worldwide incidence of malaria, that infects more than 300 million people each year (AP)
<p>The worldwide incidence of malaria, which killed about 6,27,000 people in 2012 alone, could rise as temperatures warm due to climate change, a new study has warned.</p>
<p>Researchers have debated for more than two decades the likely impacts of global warming on the worldwide incidence of malaria, a mosquito-borne disease that infects more than 300 million people each year.</p>
<p>Now, University of Michigan ecologists and their colleagues are reporting the first hard evidence that malaria does &#8211; as had long been predicted &#8211; creep to higher elevations during warmer years and back down to lower altitudes when temperatures cool.</p>
<p>The study, based on an analysis of records from highland regions of Ethiopia and Colombia, suggests that future climate warming will result in a significant increase in malaria cases in densely populated regions of Africa and South America, unless disease monitoring and control efforts are boosted and sustained.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw an upward expansion of malaria cases to higher altitudes in warmer years, which is a clear signal of a response by highland malaria to changes in climate,&#8221; said Mercedes Pascual, senior author of the research paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is indisputable evidence of a climate effect,&#8221; said Pascual.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main implication is that with warmer temperatures, we expect to see a higher number of people exposed to the risk of malaria in tropical highland areas like these,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Pascual and her colleagues looked for evidence of a changing spatial distribution of malaria with varying temperature in the highlands of Ethiopia and Colombia.</p>
<p>They examined malaria case records from the Antioquia region of western Colombia from 1990 to 2005 and from the Debre Zeit area of central Ethiopia from 1993 to 2005.</p>
<p>By focusing solely on the altitudinal response to year-to-year temperature changes, they were able to exclude other variables that can influence malaria case numbers, such as mosquito-control programmes, resistance to anti-malarial drugs and fluctuations in rainfall amounts.</p>
<p>They found that the median altitude of malaria cases shifted to higher elevations in warmer years and back to lower elevations in cooler years. The relatively simple analysis yielded a clear, unambiguous signal that can only be explained by temperature changes, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our latest research suggests that with progressive global warming, malaria will creep up the mountains and spread to new high-altitude areas. And because these populations lack protective immunity, they will be particularly vulnerable to severe morbidity and mortality,&#8221; said co-author Menno Bouma, from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p>
<p>The research was published in the journal Science.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003240&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/exercise-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003230" alt="exercise-med" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/exercise-med.jpg" /></a> 150 minutes of exercise every week improves blood glucose tolerance, reduce body fat and the risk to all possible lifestyle diseases.
<p>It takes as little as 150 minutes of exercise every week to improve blood glucose tolerance, reduce body fat and the risk to all possible lifestyle diseases that come with obesity, says a celebrity fitness trainer and nutritionist.</p>
<p>In her third book, &#8220;Don&#8217;t Lose Out, Work Out&#8221;, Rujuta Diwekar tries to tackle every myth and fad related to exercise, demystifies exercise for everyone and presents it as not an activity but a science which has the potential to combat all lifestyle disorders including diabetes and obesity.</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai-based nutritionist, whose clientele includes the likes of Anil Ambani, Kareena Kapoor, Karisma Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma and Anupam Kher, the best exercise is the one that gets done on a regular basis.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are a lover of the breaststroke in an Olympic-size pool, then that&#8217;s the best exercise for you. If you love the treadmill, then it&#8217;s the treadmill for you. If squatting under a bar double your body weight does it for you, then it&#8217;s weight training for you, and if your head won&#8217;t function without the sirsasana or sarvangasana cycle, then it&#8217;s yoga for you,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Diwekar also suggests that it is best to keep daily exercise to an hour, including warm-up, workout sets and cool down, and perhaps even the drive back home if one lives close by the gym.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will improve exercise compliance and lead to reduction in guilt and body fat, again brought about by the exercise compliance.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003219&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Three out of four working women in India suffer from lifestyle, chronic or acute ailments due to the pressure from trying to balance their personal and professional lives, according to an Assocham survey.</p>
<p>The survey findings, released ahead of International Women&#8217;s Day on March 8, reveals that 42 per cent of working women suffer from lifestyle diseases like backache, obesity, depression, diabetes, hyper-tension and heart ailments.</p>
<p>Besides, twenty-two per cent of women surveyed suffered from chronic diseases while 14 per cent had acute ailments. &#8220;Working women have to double up as valued employees at their work place and home-makers after office hours. This takes a toll on their health,&#8221; Assocham Secretary General D S Rawat said.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted on 2,800 working women aged between 32-58 years from 120 companies across 11 sectors of the economy in 10 cities – Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai and Pune.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002702&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hop leaves discarded during beer brewing contain healthful antioxidants that could fight cavities and gum disease, scientists say.</p>
<p>Researchers said they have also identified some of the substances that could be responsible for these healthful effects of the hop leaves.</p>
<p>The light green leaves are found on the pinecone-like flowers, called hops, that give beer its bitterness and aroma.<br />
Yoshihisa Tanaka from the company Asahi Group Holdings in Japan and colleagues said that their earlier research found that antioxidant polyphenols, contained in the hop leaves (called bracts) could help fight cavities and gum disease.</p>
<p>Extracts from bracts stopped the bacteria responsible for these dental conditions from being able to stick to surfaces and prevented the release of some bacterial toxins.</p>
<p>Bracts are not used for making beer and are discarded. Thus, there is potentially a large amount of bracts that could be repurposed for dental applications, researchers said. Tanaka&#8217;s group decided to investigate what substances in these leaves might cause the healthful effects.</p>
<p>Using a laboratory technique called chromatography, they found three new compounds, one already-known compound that was identified for the first time in plants and 20 already-known compounds that were found for the first time in hops.</p>
<p>The bracts also contained substantial amounts of proanthocyanidins, which are healthful antioxidants, researchers said. The study is published in the American Chemical Society&#8217;s Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002515&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/drugs-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000664" alt="drugs-med" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/drugs-med.jpg" /></a> Two-thirds of abusers said they used the drugs infrequently and over half of these users said they got them free from friends or relatives.
<p>Most people who abuse addictive prescription painkillers get them for free from friends or relatives, while drug dealers are a relatively uncommon source for those at highest risk for deadly overdoses, a U.S. government study found.</p>
<p>People who abuse the most frequently often doctor-shop; more than 1 in 4 who used these drugs almost daily said they had been prescribed by one or more physicians. Almost as many said they got them for free from friends or relatives; only 15 percent of the most frequent abusers said they bought the drugs from dealers or other strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those abusers are probably using at much greater volumes and simply asking a friend for a pill now and then is not going to be sufficient,&#8221; said Dr. Leonard Paulozzi, a researcher at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>According to the study, two-thirds of abusers said they used the drugs infrequently and well over half of these users said they got them free from friends or relatives.</p>
<p>Paulozzi and CDC colleagues analyzed four years of nationwide health surveys on nonmedical use of pain relievers including oxycodone and hydrocodone. These include the brand-name pills OxyContin and Vicodin, in a family of drugs called opioids chemically similar to opium.</p>
<p>The study was published online Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.</p>
<p>Paulozzi said overall prevalence of nonmedical use of prescription opioid painkillers has held steady in recent years, at about 12 million, or 1 in 20 people aged 12 and older.</p>
<p>But previous CDC data show overdose deaths involving these drugs more than tripled from 1999 to 2010, with more than 16,000 deaths that year. By contrast, overdose deaths that involved heroin and cocaine totaled less than 8,000, and deaths that involved often-abused prescription drugs that include anti-anxiety medication totaled about 6,500.</p>
<p>A separate study in the same journal presents Tennessee _ among states hardest hit by prescription drug abuse _ as a snapshot of the problem. From 2007 through 2011, one-third of Tennessee&#8217;s population filled an opioid prescription each year, the study found. Nearly 8 percent had used more than four prescribers and these abusers were more than six times more likely to have fatal overdoses than the least frequent users.</p>
<p>The larger nationwide study included data from annual government health surveys for 2008-2011 that included questions about use of these powerful painkillers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonmedical use was defined as use without a prescription or use with a prescription for the feeling or experience caused by the drug,&#8221; the researchers said.</p>
<p>Paulozzi said the data don&#8217;t indicate whether friends and relatives who offered free drugs shared their own prescriptions or had obtained the medication in some other way.</p>
<p>Public health messages have urged patients with legitimate prescriptions for addictive painkillers not to share the drugs and to turn in any leftovers to designated drop-off sites.</p>
<p>The new data suggest a need to strengthen messages to doctors to be on the watch for signs of prescription misuse, Paulozzi said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000639&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Yoga &#8211; the 5,000-year-old Indian meditative practice &#8211; can benefit women who are undergoing treatment for breast cancer, as it regulates stress and fights fatigue, a new study has found.</p>
<p>For women with breast cancer undergoing radiation therapy, yoga offers unique benefits beyond fighting fatigue, researchers said.</p>
<p>The study by Lorenzo Cohen, from University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center is part of an effort to scientifically validate mind-body interventions in cancer patients.</p>
<p>Researchers found that while simple stretching exercises counteracted fatigue, patients who participated in yoga exercises that incorporated controlled breathing, meditation and relaxation techniques into their treatment plan experienced improved ability to engage in their daily activities, better general health and better regulation of cortisol (stress hormone).</p>
<p>Women in the yoga group were also better equipped to find meaning in the illness experience, which declined over time for the women in the other two groups.</p>
<p>The study also assessed, for the first time, yoga benefits in cancer patients by comparing their experience with patients in an active control group who integrated simple, generic stretching exercises into their lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Combining mind and body practices that are part of yoga clearly have tremendous potential to help patients manage the psychosocial and physical difficulties associated with treatment and life after cancer, beyond the benefits of simple stretching,&#8221; said Cohen.</p>
<p>Participants in the yoga and stretching groups attended sessions specifically tailored to breast cancer patients for one-hour, three days a week throughout their six weeks of radiation treatment.</p>
<p>They were asked to report on their quality of life, including levels of fatigue and depression, their daily functioning and a measure assessing ability to find meaning in the illness experience.</p>
<p>Saliva samples were collected and electrocardiogram tests were administered.</p>
<p>Women who practiced yoga had the steepest decline in their cortisol levels across the day, indicating that yoga had the ability to help regulate this stress hormone.Higher stress hormone levels throughout the day, known as a blunted circadian cortisol rhythm, have been linked to worse outcomes in breast cancer, researchers said.</p>
<p>After completing radiation treatment only the women in the yoga and stretching groups reported a reduction in fatigue, they said.</p>
<p>At one, three and six months after radiation therapy, women who practiced yoga during the treatment period reported greater benefits to physical functioning and general health.</p>
<p>They were more likely to find life meaning from their cancer experience than the other groups.The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000645&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Increasing the intake of fish to a minimum of three to four weekly meals can boost good cholesterol levels which may provide protection against heart diseases, a new study has found.</p>
<p>People who increased their intake of fatty fish had more large High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) particles in their blood than those who were less frequent eaters of fish, said researchers at the University of Eastern Finland.</p>
<p>The study provides new information on how the consumption of fish affects the size and lipid concentrations of lipoproteins which transport lipids in the blood, researchers said.</p>
<p>They observed that a higher intake of fish increased the number of large HDL particles and lipids contained in them. Population-based studies have shown that HDL cholesterol also known as good cholesterol &#8211; and large HDL particles are efficient in sweeping extra cholesterol off artery walls.</p>
<p>Large HDL particles have been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, whereas small HDL particles may even have opposite effects.</p>
<p>Positive changes in lipid metabolism were observed in persons who increased their intake of fish most, ie in persons who ate at least three to four fish meals per week.</p>
<p>The study participants ate fatty fish such as salmon, rainbow trout, herring and vendace. No added butter or cream was used in the preparation of fish.</p>
<p>The study does not give answers to whether a similar effect would have been observed had the study participants mainly eaten low-fat fish such as zander and perch, researchers said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Plos One.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000568&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Damage to the brain may still occur even if symptoms of traumatic brain injury are not present, scientists, including one of Indian origin, suggest.</p>
<p>Veterans exposed to explosions who do not report symptoms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may still have damage to the brain&#8217;s white matter comparable to those with TBI, researchers said.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that a lack of clear TBI symptoms following an explosion may not accurately reflect the extent of brain injury, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Similar to sports injuries, people near an explosion assume that if they don&#8217;t have clear symptoms &#8211; losing consciousness, blurred vision, headaches &#8211; they haven&#8217;t had injury to the brain,&#8221; said senior author Rajendra A Morey, associate professor at Duke University School of Medicine and a psychiatrist at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings are important because they are showing that even if you don&#8217;t have symptoms, there may still be damage,&#8221; said Morey.</p>
<p>Researchers evaluated 45 US veterans who volunteered to participate in the study.</p>
<p>The veterans were split into three groups: veterans with a history of blast exposure with symptoms of TBI; veterans with a history of blast exposure without symptoms of TBI; and veterans without blast exposure.</p>
<p>The study focused on veterans with primary blast exposure, or blast exposure without external injuries, and excluded those with brain injury from direct hits to the head.</p>
<p>To measure injury to the brain, the researchers used a type of MRI called Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). DTI can detect injury to the brain&#8217;s white matter by measuring the flow of fluid in the brain.</p>
<p>White matter is the connective wiring that links different areas of the brain. Injury to white matter can impair the brain&#8217;s communication network and may result in cognitive problems, researchers said.</p>
<p>Both the groups who were near an explosion, regardless of whether they had TBI symptoms, showed a significant amount of injury compared to the veterans not exposed to a blast.</p>
<p>The injury was not isolated to one area of the brain, and each individual had a different pattern of injury.</p>
<p>Using neuropsychological testing to assess cognitive performance, the researchers found a relationship between the amount of white matter injury and changes in reaction time and the ability to switch between mental tasks.</p>
<p>However, brain injury was not linked to performance on other cognitive tests, including decision-making and organisation, said researchers.</p>
<p>The study was published in the Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000560&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alzehmiersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999785" alt="Alzheimer's disease which is the most common form of dementia, is mostly diagnosed in people over 65 years of age. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alzehmiersm.jpg" /></a> Alzheimer&#8217;s disease which is the most common form of dementia, is mostly diagnosed in people over 65 years of age.
<p>Scientists have identified a gene thought to play a causal role in the development of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>The gene, identified by researchers including one from Simon Fraser University in Canada, affects accumulation of amyloid-beta, a protein believed to be one of the main causes of the damage that underpins this brain disease in humans.</p>
<p>Each brain cell relies on an internal highway system that transports molecular signals needed for the development, communication, and survival of the cell. The gene encodes a protein that is important for intra-cellular transportation.</p>
<p>The impairment in the internal system can disrupt amyloid-beta processing, causing its eventual accumulation. This contributes to the development of amyloid plaques, which are a key hallmarks of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alzheimer&#8217;s is a multifactorial disease where a build-up of subtle problems develop in the nervous system over a span of decades,&#8221; said Michael Silverman, an SFU biology associate professor who worked on the study with a team of Japanese scientists led by Dr Takashi Morihara at Osaka University.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alzheimer&#8217;s, like many human disorders, has a genetic component, yet many environmental and lifestyle factors contribute to the disease as well,&#8221; said Silverman.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a sense, it is like looking for a needle in a complex genetic haystack,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The gene discovery could open new avenues for the design of therapeutics and pave the way for early detection by helping healthcare professionals identify those who are predisposed to the disease, researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;One possibility is that a genetic test for a particular variant of this newly discovered gene, along with other variants of genes that contribute to Alzheimer&#8217;s, will help to give a person their overall risk for the disease,&#8221; said Silverman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lifestyle changes, such as improved diet, exercise, and an increase in cognitive stimulation may then help to slow the progression of Alzheimer&#8217;s,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999747&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shorter people are more likely to have a lower IQ than their taller counterparts, a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>Scientists, including the Edinburgh University academics, identified genes which influence both height and intelligence. They found that people who are shorter than average are more likely to have lower intelligence quotient than people who are taller, &#8216;The Scotsman&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The findings were based on data compiled on thousands of people recruited over a five-year period for the Scottish Family Health Study. The intelligence levels were determined by a number of tests that measured linguistic ability, reaction times and power of recall.</p>
<p>Academics analysed DNA markers in more than 6,800 unrelated people from 2006 to 2011 in a joint study with Aberdeen University and University College London. The study concluded that 70 per cent of the link between height and IQ could be explained by genetics, while the remaining 30 per cent was down to environmental factors.</p>
<p>Understanding genetic links between intelligence and height could help predict an individual&#8217;s health problems, scientists believe. &#8220;What we found was a small association between height and intelligence such that people who are taller tend to be smarter,&#8221; Riccardo Marioni, from Edinburgh University&#8217;s Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found a moderate and statistically significant genetic correlation between height and general intelligence,&#8221; researchers said. Scientists have explored the link between height and intelligence for a number of years, but the reasons for the relationship remained unclear.</p>
<p>The study appears in the Behaviour Genetics journal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999712&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women are able to carry higher levels of genetic defects without getting brain development disorders such as autism, a new study has found.</p>
<p>The study provides compelling evidence in support of the &#8220;female protective model&#8221;, which proposes that women require more  extreme genetic mutations than do males to push them over the diagnostic threshold for neurodevelopmental disorders, researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first study that convincingly demonstrates a difference at the molecular level between boys and girls referred to the clinic for a developmental disability,&#8221;said study author Sebastien Jacquemont of the University Hospital of Lausanne in Switzerland. &#8220;The study suggests that there is a different level of robustness in brain development, and females seem to have a clear advantage,&#8221; Jacquemont said.</p>
<p>Jacquemont teamed up with Evan Eichler of the University of Washington School of Medicine to analyse DNA samples and sequencing data set of one cohort consisting of nearly 16,000 individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. Some of these people had autism spectrum disorders but they were not separated from the rest, &#8216;ABC Science&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The defects researchers were looking for were large &#8216;copy number variants&#8217; (CNVs) &#8211; sections of chromosomes carrying perhaps a dozen genes which are either missing, or present as multiple copies. Surprisingly, the females in the sample had more CNVs than the males. Although both sexes in the study had neurodevelopmental disorders, the females were carrying a bigger  &#8216;burden&#8217; of genetic damage.</p>
<p>Eichler said this fits with females somehow being better protected from the effects of the CNVs. The team then focused on  autism alone using a separate group of 762 families with autism spectrum disorders. The females in this group carried an even greater burden of CNVs. These women were also more likely to carry tiny harmful mutations, affecting just a couple of base pairs in the DNA, than the men in the group. &#8220;Overall, females function a lot better than males with a similar mutation affecting brain development,&#8221; Jacquemont said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings may lead to the development of more sensitive, gender-specific approaches for the diagnostic screening of neurodevelopmental disorders,&#8221; he said. The study was published in The American Journal of Human Genetics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999417&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hiv-lll.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997749" alt="Scientists have found the paving way for an effective vaccine for the deadly virus. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hiv-lll.jpg" /></a> Scientists have found the paving way for an effective vaccine for the deadly HIV virus. (PTI)
<p>Scientists have discovered how the immune system makes a powerful antibody that blocks HIV infection of cells by targeting a key site, paving way for an effective vaccine for the deadly virus.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that if a vaccine could elicit potent antibodies to a specific conserved site in the V1V2 region of the virus, one of a handful of sites that remains constant on the fast-mutating virus, then the vaccine could protect people from HIV infection.</p>
<p>Analyses of the results of a clinical trial of the only experimental HIV vaccine to date to have modest success in people suggest that antibodies to sites within V1V2 were protective.</p>
<p>The new findings point the way towards a potentially more effective vaccine that would generate V1V2-directed HIV neutralising antibodies, researchers said.</p>
<p>The study led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) scientists began by identifying an HIV-infected volunteer who naturally developed V1V2-directed HIV neutralising antibodies, named CAP256-VRC26, after several months of infection.</p>
<p>Using techniques similar to those employed in an earlier study of HIV-antibody co-evolution, the researchers analysed blood samples donated by the volunteer between 15 weeks and 4 years after becoming infected.</p>
<p>This enabled the scientists to determine the genetic make-up of the original form of the antibody; to identify and define the structures of a number of the intermediate forms taken as the antibody mutated towards its fullest breadth and potency.</p>
<p>It also allowed them to describe the interplay between virus and antibody that fostered the maturation of CAP256-VRC26 to its final, most powerful HIV fighting form.</p>
<p>The study showed that after relatively few mutations, even the early intermediates of CAP256-VRC26 can neutralise a significant proportion of known HIV strains.</p>
<p>This improves the chances that a V1V2-directed HIV vaccine developed based on the new findings would be effective, according to scientists, who have begun work on a set of vaccine components designed to elicit V1V2 neutralising antibodies and guide their maturation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997739&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have identified mutations in a gene that can reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, even in people who have risk factors such as obesity and old age.</p>
<p>The study by an international team led by researchers at the Broad Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) suggests that if a drug can be developed that mimics the protective effect of these mutations, it could open up new ways of preventing the disease.</p>
<p>Type 2 diabetes affects over 300 million people worldwide and is rising rapidly in prevalence, researchers said.</p>
<p>In the new study, they described the genetic analysis of 150,000 patients showing that rare mutations in a gene called SLC30A8 reduce risk of type 2 diabetes by 65 per cent.</p>
<p>The results were seen in patients from multiple ethnic groups, researchers said.</p>
<p>The protein encoded by SLC30A8 had previously been shown to play an important role in the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas, and a common variant in that gene was known to slightly influence the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>However, it was previously unclear whether inhibiting or activating the protein would be the best strategy for reducing disease risk &#8212; and how large an effect could be expected.</p>
<p>The study selected people with severe risk factors for diabetes, such as advanced age and obesity, who never developed the disease and had normal blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>The team identified a genetic mutation that appeared to abolish function of the SLC30A8 gene and that was enriched in non-diabetic individuals studied in Sweden and Finland.</p>
<p>Because this particular genetic variation was exceedingly rare outside of Finland, it proved difficult to obtain additional evidence to corroborate the initial discovery.</p>
<p>Then, in 2012, these unpublished results were shared with deCODE genetics, a bio-pharmaceutical company based in Iceland, who uncovered a second mutation in an Icelandic population that also appeared to abolish function of the gene SLC30A8.</p>
<p>That mutation independently reduced risk for type 2 diabetes and also lowered blood sugar in non-diabetics without any evident negative consequences.</p>
<p>As part of the T2D-GENES Project, chaired by Mike Boehnke at the University of Michigan, the Broad Institute had performed sequencing of 13,000 samples drawn from multiple ethnicities.</p>
<p>The T2D-GENES Project joined the collaboration, found ten more mutations in the same gene, and again saw a protective effect.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Nature Genetics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997707&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/brain-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992853 " alt="Researchers found that learning stimulates our brain cells in a manner that causes a small fatty acid to attach to delta-catenin, a protein in the brain." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/brain-med.jpg" /></a> The new live imaging approach was developed by a team of researchers at the University of Miami.
<p>For the first time, scientists have been able to observe intact interactions between proteins directly in the brain of a live animal. The new live imaging approach was developed by a team of researchers at the University of Miami (UM).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our ultimate goal is to create the systematic survey of protein interactions in the brain,&#8221; said Akira Chiba, professor of Biology in the College of Arts and Sciences at UM and lead investigator of the project.The new technique will allow scientists to visualise theinteractions of proteins in the brain of an animal, along different points throughout its development, said Chiba.</p>
<p>&#8221;We know that proteins are one billionth of a human in size. Nevertheless, proteins make networks and interact with each other, like social networking humans do,&#8221; Chiba said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scale is very different, but it&#8217;s the same behaviour happening among the basic units of a given network,&#8221; Chiba said.</p>
<p>The researchers chose embryos of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) as an ideal model for the study.Because of its compact and transparent body, it is possible to visualise processes inside the Drosophila cells using a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope (FLIM). The results of the observations are applicable to other animal brains, including the human brain.</p>
<p>The Drosophila embryos in the study contained a pair of fluorescent labelled proteins: a developmentally essential and ubiquitously present protein called Rho GTPase Cdc42 (cell division control protein 42), labelled with green fluorescent tag and its alleged signalling partner, the regulatory protein WASp (Wiskot-Aldrich Syndrome protein), labelled with red fluorescent tag.</p>
<p>Together, these specialised proteins are believed to help neurons grow during brain development. The proteins were selected because the same (homolog) proteins exist in the human brain as well.Previous methods required chemical or physical treatments that most likely disturb or even kill the cells. That made it impossible to study the protein interactions in their natural environment.</p>
<p>The current study addresses these challenges by using the occurrence of a phenomenon called Forster resonance energy transfer, or FRET. It occurs when two small proteins come within a very small distance of each other, (eight nanometres). The event is interpreted as the time and place where the particular protein interaction occurs within the living animal.</p>
<p>The findings show that FRET between the two interacting protein partners occurs within neurons, during the time and space that coincides with the formation of new synapses in the brain of the baby insect.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995577&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/choc-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995506" alt="Dark chocolate helps restore flexibility to arteries while also preventing white blood cells from sticking to the walls of blood vessels." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/choc-med.jpg" /></a> Dark chocolate helps restore flexibility to arteries while also preventing white blood cells from sticking to the walls of blood vessels.
<p>In some good news for chocoholics, scientists have found that eating dark chocolate may ward off atherosclerosis by making arteries more elastic and preventing white blood vessels from sticking to their walls.</p>
<p>New research suggests that consumption of dark chocolate lowers the augmentation index, a key vascular health predictor, and reduces adhesion of white blood cells to the vessel wall.</p>
<p>Dark chocolate helps restore flexibility to arteries while also preventing white blood cells from sticking to the walls of blood vessels, researchers have found.</p>
<p>Both arterial stiffness and white blood cell adhesion are known factors that play a significant role in atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Scientists also found that increasing the flavanol content of dark chocolate did not change this effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;We provide a more complete picture of the impact of chocolate consumption in vascular health and show that increasing flavanol content has no added beneficial effect on vascular health,&#8221; said Diederik Esser from the Top Institute Food and Nutrition and Wageningen University, The Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, this increased flavanol content clearly affected taste and thereby the motivation to eat these chocolates. So the dark side of chocolate is a healthy one,&#8221; said Esser.</p>
<p>Esser and colleagues analysed 44 middle-aged overweight men over two periods of four weeks as they consumed 70 grammes of chocolate per day.</p>
<p>Study participants received either specially produced dark chocolate with high flavanol content or chocolate that was regularly produced. Both chocolates had a similar cocoa mass content.</p>
<p>Before and after both intervention periods, researchers performed a variety of measurements that are important indicators of vascular health.</p>
<p>During the study, participants were advised to refrain from certain energy dense food products to prevent weight gain.</p>
<p>Scientists also evaluated the sensory properties of the high flavanol chocolate and the regular chocolate and collected the motivation scores of the participants to eat these chocolates during the intervention.</p>
<p>The study was published in The FASEB Journal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995488&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/babies-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994854" alt="Babies 1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/babies-1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>Babies delivered by cesarean section may be at 26 per cent increased risk of becoming overweight or obese as adults than those born by normal delivery, scientists<br />
including one of Indian-origin have warned.The finding is based on combined data from 15 studies with over 38,000 participants.</p>
<p>The researchers, from Imperial College London, said there are good reasons why many women should have a C-section, but mothers should be aware that there might be long-term consequences for their children.</p>
<p>Around one in three to four births in UK are by cesarean section, around twice as many as in 1990. In some countries, the rate is much higher, with 60 per cent of mothers in China and almost half in Brazil having the procedure.</p>
<p>Some previous studies have suggested that the odds of other adverse long-term outcomes, such asthma and type 1 diabetes in childhood, are also higher in babies born by cesarean.</p>
<p>The new study, which includes data from 10 countries, found that the average BMI of adults born by cesarean section is around half a unit more than those born by vaginal delivery. It is the largest to show a link between cesarean delivery and BMI in adulthood, researchers said.</p>
<p>The authors say they cannot be certain that cesarean delivery causes higher body weight, as the association may be explained by other factors that weren&#8217;t recorded in the data they analysed. &#8220;There are good reasons why C-section may be the best option for many mothers and their babies, and C-sections can on occasion be life-saving,&#8221; Professor Neena Modi from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, the report&#8217;s senior author, said. &#8220;However, we need to understand the long-term outcomes in order to provide the best advice to women who are considering cesarean delivery,&#8221; said Modi. She also added, &#8220;This study shows that babies born by C-section are more likely to be overweight or obese later in life. We now need to determine whether this is the result of the C-section, or if other reasons explain the association,&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr Matthew Hyde, one of the researchers, said that there are plausible mechanisms by which cesarean delivery might influence later body weight. The types of healthy bacteria in the gut differ in babies born by cesarean and vaginal delivery, which can have broad effects on health. &#8220;Also, the compression of the baby during vaginal birth appears to influence which genes are switched on, and this could have a long-term effect on metabolism,&#8221; Hyde said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/baby-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994636" alt="Researchers utilised a national data set that followed 7,500 mothers and their children from birth to five years of age." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/baby-med.jpg" /></a> Researchers utilised a national data set that followed 7,500 mothers and their children from birth to five years of age.
<p>Children who are breastfed score higher on IQ tests and perform better in school, scientists say.</p>
<p>A new study by sociologists at Brigham Young University pinpoints two parenting skills as the real source of this cognitive boost: Responding to children&#8217;s emotional cues and reading to children starting at 9 months of age.</p>
<p>Breastfeeding mothers tend to do both of those things, said lead study author Ben Gibbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really the parenting that makes the difference,&#8221; said Gibbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breastfeeding matters in others ways, but this actually gives us a better mechanism and can shape our confidence about interventions that promote school readiness,&#8221; said Gibbs.</p>
<p>According to the analysis, improvements in sensitivity to emotional cues and time reading to children could yield 2-3 months&#8217; worth of brain development by age 4 (as measured by math and reading readiness assessments).</p>
<p>&#8220;Because these are four-year-olds, a month or two represents a non-trivial chunk of time,&#8221; Gibbs said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if a child is on the edge of needing special education, even a small boost across some eligibility line could shape a child&#8217;s educational trajectory,&#8221; said Gibbs.</p>
<p>Researchers utilised a national data set that followed 7,500 mothers and their children from birth to five years of age.</p>
<p>The data set is rich with information on the home environment, including how early and how often parents read to their kids.</p>
<p>Additionally, each of the mothers in the study also participated in video-taped activities with their children.</p>
<p>As the child tried to complete a challenging task, the mother&#8217;s supportiveness and sensitivity to their child&#8217;s emotional cues were measured.</p>
<p>Sandra Jacobson of Wayne State University School of Medicine noted that children in the study who were breastfed for 6 months or longer performed the best on reading assessments because they also &#8220;experienced the most optimal parenting practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gibbs and Forste found that reading to an infant every day as early as age 9 months and sensitivity to the child&#8217;s cues during social interactions, rather than breastfeeding per se, were significant predictors of reading readiness at age 4 years,&#8221; said Jacobson.</p>
<p>The study was published in The Journal of Pediatrics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994570&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/brain-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992853" alt="Researchers found that learning stimulates our brain cells in a manner that causes a small fatty acid to attach to delta-catenin, a protein in the brain." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/brain-med.jpg" /></a> Researchers found that learning stimulates our brain cells in a manner that causes a small fatty acid to attach to delta-catenin, a protein in the brain.
<p>Scientists have found that an important molecular change occurs in the brain when we learn and remember.</p>
<p>Researchers found that learning stimulates our brain cells in a manner that causes a small fatty acid to attach to delta-catenin, a protein in the brain.</p>
<p>This biochemical modification is essential in producing the changes in brain cell connectivity associated with learning.</p>
<p>The findings may provide an explanation for some mental disabilities, researchers said.</p>
<p>In animal models, the scientists found almost twice the amount of modified delta-catenin in the brain after learning about new environments.</p>
<p>While delta-catenin has previously been linked to learning, this study is the first to describe the protein&#8217;s role in the molecular mechanism behind memory formation.</p>
<p>&#8220;More work is needed, but this discovery gives us a much better understanding of the tools our brains use to learn and remember, and provides insight into how these processes become disrupted in neurological diseases,&#8221; said co-author Shernaz Bamji, an associate professor in University of British Columbia&#8217;s Life Sciences Institute.</p>
<p>Disruption of the delta-catenin gene has been observed in some patients with schizophrenia, researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brain activity can change both the structure of this protein, as well as its function,&#8221; said Stefano Brigidi, first author of the article and a PHD candidate Bamji&#8217;s laboratory.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we introduced a mutation that blocked the biochemical modification that occurs in healthy subjects, we abolished the structural changes in brain&#8217;s cells that are known to be important for memory formation,&#8221; Brigidi said.</p>
<p>The study is published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992840&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cancer-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987698" alt="A new technology will make cancer detection very easy. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cancer-med.jpg" /></a> A new technology will make cancer detection very easy.
<p>Scientists have developed a new technique to scan young cancer patients&#8217; bodies for tumours without exposing them to radiation. The technique could reduce patients&#8217; risk of developing secondary cancers later in life, researchers said. The new method developed by researchers from the Stanford University Medical Center and Lucile Packard Children&#8217;s Hospital Stanford is a modification of magnetic resonance imaging that employs a novel contrast agent to find tumours.</p>
<p>Researchers found that the MRI-based method is as effective as cancer-detection scans that use ionising radiation &#8211; specifically, positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Although whole-body PET-CT technology provides essential information for detecting cancer, it has one big drawback: a single scan exposes the patient to as much radiation as 700 chest X-rays.</p>
<p>This exposure is especially risky for children and teenagers, who are more vulnerable to radiation than adults because they are still growing. Children are also more likely to live long enough to develop a second cancer. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited about having an imaging test for cancer patients that requires zero radiation exposure,&#8221; said senior author Heike Daldrup-Link, associate professor of radiology at Stanford and a diagnostic radiologist at the hospital.</p>
<p>The research team compared the modified MRI technique to standard PET-CTs in 22 patients ages 8 to 33 who had lymphoma or sarcoma. These cancers originate in the immune system and the bones, respectively. Both cancers can spread throughout tissues such as bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver and spleen. In the past, several hurdles prevented physicians from using whole-body MRIs to look for tumours. The scans take up to two hours. A whole-body PET-CT takes only a few minutes.</p>
<p>More importantly, in many organs, MRI does not distinguish healthy from cancerous tissue. And existing contrast agents &#8211; chemicals injected into the body to make tumours visible &#8211; leave the tissues too quickly to be used in a lengthy, whole-body MRI. To find tumours via MRI, the Stanford team used a new contrast agent consisting of nanoparticles of iron. Injections of these iron nanoparticles are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat anemia, and the researchers obtained FDA permission for the experimental use.</p>
<p>The nanoparticles are retained in the body for many days. On MRIs, they cause blood vessels to appear brighter, providing anatomic landmarks. The nanoparticles also cause healthy bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver and spleen to appear darker, making tumours stand out. The PET-CTs detected 163 of 174 total tumours in the 22 patients; the MRIs found 158 of 174 tumours, researchers said. The study was published in The Lancet Oncology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992004&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mothers with cavities can transmit caries-producing oral bacteria to their babies when they clean pacifiers by sticking them in their own mouths or by sharing spoons, scientists say.</p>
<p>According to Liliana Rozo, assistant professor, University of Louisville School of Dentistry, tooth decay can have a detrimental effect on a child&#8217;s quality of life, performance in school and success in life.</p>
<p>The disease can cause pain, inability to chew food well, embarrassment about discoloured or damaged teeth, and distraction from play and learning. Often, Rozo said, parents do not make the connection between oral health and overall health, but they are related. The mouth is an open door for many microbial infections to enter the bloodstream, she said.</p>
<p>Poor oral health may be a risk factor for systemic disease. Oral health manifestations, such as bleeding or dry mouth can indicate the presence of a systemic disease or exacerbate the effects of an existing disease such as diabetes and heart disease. So parents, too, should make their own oral health care a priority in order to help their children stay healthy, said Rozo.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990803&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[In contrast, appetite is a complex phenomenon, which refers to signals that guide dietary selection, often in the absence of obvious hunger. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990628&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ishi Khosla</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">An increasing proportion of food consumption appears to be driven by pleasure, not just by the need for calories. Eating for pleasure than to satisfy our biological need is the norm rather than the exception. This phenomenon is referred to as hedonic eating and results in food intake that can override the body’s innate homeostatic system that helps control eating, leading to over-consumption of calories. The food environment in affluent societies may be creating a psychological effect comparable to other hedonically driven activities such as drug use and gambling.</span></p>
<p>What we choose to eat and when we eat are determined by hunger and our appetite signals. Hunger relates to the innate need to eat and is associated with unpleasant sensation coupled with physiological need, also referred to as internal factors. Appeasing it, creates satiety — no further desire to eat.</p>
<p>In contrast, appetite is a complex phenomenon, which refers to signals that guide dietary selection, often in the absence of obvious hunger. Appetite is usually associated with pleasure during food consumption and is mainly governed by external factors. Hedonic hunger, a new dimension of appetite, has recently been recognised.</p>
<p>Hedonic hunger incorporates motivational (reward), cognitive, and emotional influences on eating. It is governed by external stimuli like food-related cues such as seeing food, taste, palatability or smell of food, talking about; reading about, or even thinking about food, food preferences, aromas, meal times, memories, emotions and associations; environmental factors such as climate, food advertisements, presence of others, social settings, beliefs, religion and philosophy. Interestingly, while hedonic hunger leads to obesity, in turn research suggests that hedonic hunger increases with obesity and is dependent on the body weight of an individual. The higher the body mass index, more the hedonic hunger.</p>
<p>Hedonic hunger and the resultant overeating have been compared to drug addiction for several reasons. In response to hedonic hunger, an individual usually becomes overly focussed on eating, feels a loss of control over starting and stopping eating, and requires increasing amounts of food to satisfy the urge to eat. A 2010 study published in the American Journal of Nutrition reported that obese patients displayed a marked increase in hedonic hunger that is not observed in patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery, suggesting that the operation normalises excessive appetite for palatable foods.</p>
<p>Our relationship with food has undergone a change, we are living to eat rather than eating to live. Stress and psychological disturbances may also cause the release of appetite-stimulating signals of the brain. We are responding more to external cues in choosing when and what to eat.</p>
<p>Each of us can begin by redefining our relationship with food by recognising ‘what drives us to eat’. We must ‘eat to live rather than live to eat’.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Pity the poor beet.</span></strong></p>
<p>While pizza, ice cream and that flavor of the moment, bacon, soar on the Internet via hashtags, Instagram photos or other social media mentions, the richly red, healthy tuber just doesn’t get much love on the web.</p>
<p>Bolthouse Farms, which produces juices, smoothies and other items, has developed an exceptionally playful website, FoodPornIndex.com, that calls attention to such food inequities. The company, owned by Campbell’s, wants to generate more clicks highlighting the plight of those unpopular beets and other less trendy but nutritious fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>It has devised an algorithm to track hashtags on Twitter and elsewhere on the Internet and other mentions of 24 keywords for different vegetables, fruits and all those fatty, sugary favourites. Then, using alluring photographs, humour and music, the website lets visitors click on the Pomegranate Piñata, the Pizzabot or the Guac-a-Mole to get a sense of the numbers behind the item’s popularity on the web in real time. Visitors can play a musical Carrot Keyboard or follow the Burger Snake. The goal, say Bolthouse executives, is to remind consumers that a fresh strawberry is just as beautiful as those found in a dessert like a tart — and healthier.</p>
<p>“#Melons are high in Vitamin A,” the site notes. “I guess you could say they’re Vitamin A-mazing.”</p>
<p>It then adds, “You know what else is amazing? Melon Meditation. Namaste. Explore the #FoodPornIndex and help Bolt-house Farms share the way to a healthier Internet.”</p>
<p>But as more and more consumers make the connection between what they eat and how they feel and seek information about the ingredients n the foods they consume, food companies are increasingly trying to promote the healthiness and purity of the foods they sell.</p>
<p>The FoodPornIndex.com will be showcased at the Partnership for a Healthier America’s summit meeting next month, where Michelle Obama, who has promoted healthy eating while at the White House, will be the keynote speaker. Bolthouse has worked with Obama before, enlisting her support for its effort to get produce providers to use Sesame Street characters as a way of encouraging children to eat more fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>“If I can get the first lady to say ‘food porn,’ “ Putman said, “I will have made my day.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990626&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The results of a study spanning 19 years show that overweight and obese women face higher risks of health problems and disability<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990611&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Michelle Obama has done an excellent job mobilizing the nation to combat childhood obesity and encouraging kids to eat better and move more. But now her efforts may be needed on another front.</span></p>
<p>Obesity can take a heavy toll on older women, too: Their risk of developing chronic diseases, losing the ability to walk or dying earlier increases with excess weight. We get the particulars from a large national study, recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine, that tracked more than 36,000 post-menopausal women at 40 research centers and universities around the US.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM STUDY</strong><br />
When the women enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative between 1993 and 1998, they were between 66 and 79 years old (average age: 72). When the study concluded in 2012, the researchers found that the women fell into five categories:<br />
* 19 per cent of these women were deemed healthy, meaning that “they survived to age 85 and had no major chronic diseases and maintained the ability to walk,” said lead author Dr Eileen Rillamas-Sun, an epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer</p>
<p><strong>Research Center in Seattle.</strong><br />
* Another 14.7 per cent began the study with one or more of five chronic disease (cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes or hip fracture), but did not develop any additional health problems, and remained mobile.<br />
* Nearly a quarter, 23.2 per cent, developed one or more of the diseases during the study period, but maintained their ability to walk.<br />
* 18.3 per cent did lose their mobility — meaning they required crutches, walkers or wheelchairs — or reported limited ability to walk a block or climb a flight of stairs. The researchers used this measure of disability, Dr Rillamas-Sun said, because “losing one’s ability to walk contributes to loss of independence.”<br />
* The remaining women, 24.8 per cent, died before age 85.</p>
<p>When the researchers looked at the impact that obesity or being overweight — calculated by body mass index — took on the women’s health, “we found that women with a healthy body weight had a greater chance of living to 85 without developing a chronic disease or a mobility disability,” Dr Rillamas-Sun said. “The heavier you are, the worse your chances of healthy survival.”</p>
<p><strong>THE RISKS</strong></p>
<p>Now some readers are already mentally composing comments like, “Didn’t we already know that obesity is bad for us?” and “We needed a study funded by the National Institutes of Health to tell us this?”</p>
<p>We did, on both counts. But older people and women have historically been under-represented in — or actually excluded from — research trials. For years, experts assumed that findings from all-male studies applied to women, too, which has proved to be untrue.</p>
<p>Also, aside from gender disparities, “a lot of research focuses on everyone 65 and older,” Dr Rillamas-Sun pointed out. “We looked at the old-old” — those who are 85-plus.</p>
<p>But it is true that this work confirms what we thought we knew: Overweight women run a higher risk of health problems and disability, and those risks rise sharply when overweight becomes obese.</p>
<p>Compared to older women with healthy body mass indexes (below 25), overweight women had a 20 per cent greater chance of developing one of the five diseases. But women with Level 1 obesity (BMI over 30 but below 35) had a 65 per cent higher risk of disease, and women with higher levels of obesity were more than twice as likely to develop disease. The likelihood of dying before age 85 showed a similar pattern. (The data has been adjusted to account for demographic differences and health behaviours like smoking.)</p>
<p>When it came to losing mobility, the researchers found even more striking differences. Overweight women had a 60 per cent higher risk of losing the ability to walk, but obese women were three to six times more likely to lose their mobility. For African-American and Hispanic women who were overweight or obese, the odds of disease, disability or death before age 85 were higher yet.</p>
<p>What this study doesn’t address is whether losing weight later in life can protect older women from disease and disability. But the researchers are working on that. (And of course, some factor other than obesity might be involved because — all together now — correlation is not causation.)</p>
<p>But we shouldn’t wait for Dr Rillamas-Sun’s next publication to try to reduce obesity in older women.</p>
<p>Paging the First Lady. Women often do gain weight after menopause, and losing it can be harder than when we’re 35 (a challenge with which I’m all too familiar).</p>
<p>But it’s not impossible, and the effort is worth undertaking — for our aging parents, and for ourselves.</p>
<p>“This says, you can’t be in denial any longer,” said Dr Rillamas-Sun. “Most people need to see the numbers; they prove what is supposedly obvious. And we do have the numbers.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990611&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/depress-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990279" alt="This study is the first to find an association between depression and thyroid activity variations within the normal range. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/depress-m.jpg" /></a> This study is the first to find an association between depression and thyroid activity variations within the normal range. (Reuters)
<p>Older individuals whose thyroid glands are more active than average may be at a greater risk of developing depression, according to new research.</p>
<p>Beyond its role in regulating the body&#8217;s metabolism, the thyroid gland also can influence mental health. Past research has found links between an increased risk of depression and both over and underactive thyroid glands, researchers said.</p>
<p>This study is the first to find an association between depression and thyroid activity variations within the normal range, they said.</p>
<p>To determine how active the thyroid gland was, researchers measured levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is the body&#8217;s signal to the thyroid gland to release more hormones.</p>
<p>When TSH levels are low, this suggests the thyroid gland is active and producing plenty of thyroid hormones.</p>
<p>Researchers also measured levels of the actual thyroid hormones at a later point in time and confirmed these subjects had increased thyroid activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that older individuals with thyroid activity at the high end of the normal range had a substantially increased risk of developing depression over the course of an eight-year period compared to individuals who had less thyroid activity within the normal range,&#8221; said one of the study&#8217;s authors, Marco Medici, of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;This suggests that people with even minor changes in thyroid function may experience similar mental health effects as those with overt thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism,&#8221; Medici said.</p>
<p>The population-based cohort study analysed data from a group of 1,503 people with an average age of 70.</p>
<p>At the outset of the study, researchers measured participants&#8217; TSH levels and gauged their depression symptoms using a questionnaire. Participants included in the study displayed no depression symptoms at the first visit.</p>
<p>During follow-up visits over the course of eight years, on average, researchers assessed participants for the development of depression symptoms.</p>
<p>The study divided participants into three groups based on their TSH levels.</p>
<p>Study participants with TSH levels at the low end of the normal range &#8211; signalling they had more active thyroid glands &#8211; were more likely to have depression symptoms emerge during the course of the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results provide insight into the powerful effects thyroid activity can have on emotions and mental health,&#8221; Medici said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This information could influence the process of diagnosing and treating depression, as well as treatments for individuals with thyroid conditions,&#8221; Medici said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990276&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cancer-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987698" alt="Activity requires a significant amount of energy from the cancer cells." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cancer-med.jpg" /></a> Activity requires a significant amount of energy from the cancer cells.
<p>Indian-origin scientists have successfully developed a radical new technique that may kill brain tumours by hijacking them into toxic pits or areas of the body that are safer to operate on.</p>
<p>One factor that makes glioblastoma cancers so difficult to treat is that malignant cells from the tumours spread throughout the brain by following nerve fibres and blood vessels to invade new locations. Now, researchers have learned to hijack this migratory mechanism, turning it against the cancer by using a film of nanofibres thinner than human hair to lure tumour cells away.</p>
<p>Instead of invading new areas, the migrating cells latch onto the specially-designed nanofibres and follow them to a location &#8211; potentially outside the brain &#8211; where they can be captured and killed. Using this technique, researchers can partially move tumours from inoperable locations to more accessible ones. Though it would not eliminate the cancer, the new technique reduced the size of brain tumours in animal models, suggesting that this form of brain cancer might one day be treated more like a chronic disease, researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have designed a polymer thin film nanofibre that mimics the structure of nerves and blood vessels that brain tumour cells normally use to invade other parts of the brain,&#8221; said Ravi Bellamkonda, lead investigator and chair of the Wallace H Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University.<br />
&#8220;The cancer cells normally latch onto these natural structures and ride them like a monorail to other parts of the brain. By providing an attractive alternative fibre, we can efficiently move the tumours along a different path to a destination that we choose,&#8221; said Bellamkonda.</p>
<p>Treating the Glioblastoma multiforme cancer, also known as GBM, is difficult because the aggressive and invasive cancer often develops in parts of the brain where surgeons are reluctant to operate.</p>
<p>Even if the primary tumour can be removed, however, it has often spread to other locations before being diagnosed. &#8220;The signalling pathways we were trying to activate to repair the spinal cord were the same pathways researchers would like to inactivate for glioblastomas,&#8221; said first author of the study, Anjana Jain, an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.<br />
Tumour cells typically invade healthy tissue by secreting enzymes that allow the invasion to take place, Jain said. That activity requires a significant amount of energy from the cancer cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our idea was to give the tumour cells a path of least resistance, one that resembles the natural structures in the brain, but is attractive because it does not require the cancer cells to expend any more energy,&#8221; she said. Details of the technique were reported in the journal Nature Materials.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987696&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/den-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987693" alt="Dengue fever, an infectious tropical disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus, afflicts millions of people each year, causing fever, headache, muscle and joint pains." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/den-med.jpg" /></a> Dengue fever, an infectious tropical disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus, afflicts millions of people each year, causing fever, headache, muscle and joint pains.
<p>Scientists have unveiled the mechanism behind how dengue enters cells of our immune system, a finding that could help develop vaccine for the deadly virus.</p>
<p>Dengue fever, an infectious tropical disease caused by a mosquito-borne virus, afflicts millions of people each year, causing fever, headache, muscle and joint pains and a characteristic skin rash, researchers said. In some people the disease progresses to a severe, often fatal, form known as dengue hemorrhagic fever.</p>
<p>Despite its heavy toll, the prevention and clinical treatment of dengue infection has been a &#8220;dramatic failure in public health compared to other infectious diseases like HIV,&#8221; said Ping Liu of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>Now, new research by Liu and her colleagues could offer vital insight into the mechanism of dengue virus entry into cells &#8211; and aid vaccine and clinical drug development. Liu along with dengue fever expert Aravinda de Silva, used high-resolution microscopes to examine the expression of a particular protein, known as DC-SIGN, on the surface of immune system cells called dendritic cells.</p>
<p>The normal role of DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule grabbing nonintegrin) is to capture pathogens so that fragments of those pathogens can be presented as antigens on the surface of the dendritic cells.</p>
<p>Such antigens then are recognised by T cells – the workhorse cells of the immune system &#8211; &#8220;which is one of the first steps in the normal immune response,&#8221; Liu said. While it has been known for some time that dengue used DC-SIGN to attach to cells, Liu and her colleagues used high-resolution microscopy to study exactly how the viruses used the protein to gain entry into cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;DC-SIGN has a unique carbohydrate recognition domain on its extracellular portion, which binds to all sorts of carbohydrates on pathogens,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;An effective medication or vaccine should stop the process of dengue virus entry into cells,&#8221; Liu said. She said, de Silva and his colleagues have identified strong neutralisation antibodies that block dengue infection. By identifying the mechanism of antibody neutralisation, Liu and colleagues hope to advance the development of vaccines for dengue virus infections.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987683&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dep.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987684" alt="Teenage boys with symptoms of depression and raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol are up to 14 times more likely to develop major depression." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dep.jpg" /></a> Teenage boys with symptoms of depression and raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol are up to 14 times more likely to develop major depression.
<p>Cambridge scientists have identified the first biomarker for clinical depression after they found that high levels of stress hormone in spit can indicate a serious risk of developing psychiatric disorders in teen boys.</p>
<p>Teenage boys with symptoms of depression and raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol are up to 14 times more likely to develop major depression than those without these traits, researchers found.</p>
<p>Clinical depression affects one in six people at some point in their lives. Until now, doctors have lacked a biomarker for clinical depression, partly because its causes and symptoms are so varied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through our research, we now have a very real way of identifying those teenage boys most likely to develop clinical depression,&#8221; said Professor Ian Goodyer of the University&#8217;s Department of Psychiatry who led the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will help us strategically target preventions and interventions at these individuals and hopefully help reduce their risk of serious episodes of depression and their consequences in adult life,&#8221; Goodyer said.</p>
<p>The researchers collected spit samples from hundreds of teenagers and measured levels of cortisol in the saliva, as well as self-reported information on symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>This they used to divide the teenagers into one of four groups depending on their cortisol levels and symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>After following the group for 12 to 36 months, they were then able to work out which group was most likely to develop clinical depression and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>They found boys with high levels of cortisol and depressive symptoms were 14 times more likely to develop clinical depression than those with neither. In girls, however, this difference was less marked.</p>
<p>Girls with high cortisol and depressive symptoms were four times more likely to develop clinical depression than those with neither, suggesting gender differences in how depression develops.</p>
<p>The researchers hope that having an easily measurable biomarker &#8211; in this case, raised cortisol plus depressive symptoms &#8211; will allow primary care services to identify boys at high risk and consider new public mental health strategies for this part of the population.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new biomarker suggests that we may be able to offer a more personalised approach to tackling boys at risk for depression,&#8221; said co-author Dr Matthew Owens.</p>
<p>The study was published in Proceedings of the National Academies of Science.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987671&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/blood-med.jpg" /></a> Ratan Sinha has pledged to fight and serve Thalassemia patients.
<p>As summer season approaches, the concern of parents having thalassemia patients mounts. “Volunteers do not turn up to donate blood during summer and the Red Cross Blood bank finds it difficult to meet the demands of some 400 thalassemia patients currently undergoing treatment here”, says Ratan Sinha, a voluntary blood donor of repute in Cuttack city.<br />    <br />Thalassemia patients need blood in every 45 days in order to survive, doctors said. In order to meet the emergency, Sinha has embarked upon an innovative way. Striking an emotional chord, he is now encouraging people to organise blood donation camps at wedding receptions, birth and death anniversaries feasts.</p>
<p>“Instead of presenting gifts or cash during all such occasions, if the guests are encouraged to donate blood, the<br />sanctity of the occasion would be doubled”, says Sinha. Sinha organised a blood donation camp here yesterday<br />on behalf of a voluntary organisation. At least 21 volunteers, donated blood, which was handed over to Red Cross Blood Bank to be exclusively used for thalassemia patients.<br />    <br />The 47-year-old Sinha also donated blood on the occasion for the 99th time. “I have been donating blood since 1986 almost every three months”, Sinha claimed. His recent efforts were commended when he arranged mobile blood donation camps in Cuttack by converting his SUV into a makeshift ambulance and went on a blood collection drive at crowded marketplaces and busy office locations.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987565&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/foodm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1962835" alt="Identifying factors that promote weight gain could help identify targets for obesity intervention and prevention. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/foodm.jpg" /></a> Identifying factors that promote weight gain could help identify targets for obesity intervention and prevention.
<p>An infant&#8217;s hearty appetite may appear as a healthy sign, but could signal a predisposition to obesity, scientists have warned. A new research has found that infants with a heartier appetite grew more rapidly up to age 15 months, potentially putting them at increased risk for obesity.</p>
<p>The research linked appetite to more rapid infant growth and to genetic predisposition to obesity. The research investigated how weight gain is linked to two key aspects of appetite, namely lower satiety responsiveness (a reduced urge to eat in response to internal &#8216;fullness&#8217; signals) and higher food responsiveness (an increased urge to eat in response to the sight or smell of nice food).</p>
<p>The authors used data from non-identical, same-sex twins born in the UK in 2007. Twin pairs were selected that differed in measures of satiety responsiveness (SR) and food responsiveness (FR) at 3 months, and their growth up to age 15 months was compared. Within pairs, the infant who was more food responsive or less satiety responsive grew faster than their co-twin.</p>
<p>The more food responsive twin was 654g heavier than their co-twin at six months and 991g heavier at 15 months. The less satiety responsive twin was 637g heavier than their co-twin at six months and 918g heavier at 15 months. &#8220;Obesity is a major issue in child health,&#8221; said Professor Jane Wardle, lead author of the study from the University College London (UCL) Health Behaviour Research Centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;Identifying factors that promote or protect against weight gain could help identify targets for obesity intervention and prevention in future. These findings are extremely powerful because we were comparing children of the same age and same sex growing up in the same family in order to reveal the role that appetite plays in infant growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might make life easy to have a baby with a hearty appetite, but as she grows up, parents may need to be alert<br />
for tendencies to be somewhat over-responsive to food cues in the environment, or somewhat unresponsive to fullness. This behaviour could put her at risk of gaining weight faster than is good for her,&#8221; Wardle said. The research was published in journal JAMA Pediatrics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987557&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Thinkstock)
<p>A father&#8217;s genetic code influences the weight of a baby at birth, according to a new study. The study led by the UCL Institute of Child Health (ICH) suggests that genes inherited from the mother and father regulate a baby&#8217;s growth at different times during the pregnancy, to ensure a successful birth as well as the mother&#8217;s survival.<br />    <br />Low birth weight is a well-known risk factor for Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems in later life. One group of growth genes of particular interest are the imprinted genes inherited from one&#8217;s parents. If the paternal one is expressed, the maternal one is imprinted (silenced) and vice versa.<br />    <br />The &#8216;parental conflict hypothesis&#8217; suggests that expression of the father&#8217;s genes enhances a baby&#8217;s growth, improving the success of the paternal genome to be passed on. In contrast, the mother&#8217;s genome limits foetal growth, distributing equal resources to each of her offspring, whilst ensuring her own survival post-birth allowing her to reproduce again.<br />    <br />The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, looked at the relationship between birth weight and the paternally expressed Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) early in gestation, where IGF2 is a key hormone regulating growth in the womb. Professor Gudrun Moore, lead author at the UCL Institute of Child Health, says most of us think of both the mother&#8217;s and father&#8217;s genes as having an equal influence on birth weight, but this does not appear to be the case.<br />    <br />&#8220;Our study suggests that the two parental genomes may be acting at different times during the pregnancy in order to control the baby&#8217;s size. Whilst greater foetal growth appears to be promoted by the father&#8217;s genes early on, it must still require careful regulation by the mother to ensure a successful birth,&#8221; he said. He added that understanding the genetic basis of foetal growth is of critical importance in the prevention and monitoring of small and low weight babies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986782&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two neighbouring farmers, a field of canola and a gust of wind are at the centre of a landmark court case in Australia that could have consequences for the growing of genetically modified (GM) crops in the country.</p>
<p>Steve Marsh is suing former childhood friend Michael Baxter after harvested seed heads from Baxter’s GM canola crop blew onto Marsh’s farm in the state of Western Australia, court documents said, contaminating land used for his organic oat and wheat crops.</p>
<p>Marsh, stripped of his organic certification and export licence for his oats, is claiming unspecified damages in the case, which opened on January 10 in the West Australian Supreme Court.</p>
<p>It is the first time in Australia one farmer has sued another for negligence over contamination of organic crops by genetically modified organisms (GMO) and will set a precedent for future cases, lawyers said.</p>
<p>The case also illustrates the challenge Australia faces developing its agri-business sector as it looks to become a “food bowl” for Asia amid rapidly growing demand for everything from grains to beef.</p>
<p>Baxter’s lawyer Brian Bradley declined to comment ahead of the trial. Marsh and Baxter both declined to speak to Reuters. The former friends have not spoken to each other since the row erupted, local media reported.</p>
<p>Baxter bought the seeds from Monsanto Co, the world’s largest seed company. Marsh opted not to sue the US firm because of a non-liability contract Monsanto signs with all farmers who buy its seeds.</p>
<p>The case is likely to lead to regulations outlining boundaries between farms producing GM crops and organic farms, lawyers said, potentially reducing the land available for cultivation.</p>
<p>Unlike the US, the EU and Japan, which allow trace amounts of GMO in organic foods in acknowledgement of contamination by wind or pollen transfer, Australia maintains a zero threshold.</p>
<p>Kojonup, a wheat and sheep district some 250 km south of Perth, is a quiet, tight-knit community of farmers. But the case is splitting loyalties in the pastoral area where many farmers have turned to cutting-edge GMO production.</p>
<p>Marsh’s decision to sue Baxter, 48, has garnered support from celebrity chefs. In the other corner, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association is giving financial support to Baxter. “We believe in the farmers right to choose what he grows,” said chairman John Snooke.</p>
<p>Monsanto declined to comment on whether it was giving financial assistance to Baxter, an accusation levelled by Marsh’s supporters.</p>
<p>Organic farmers see threat from the hearing on two fronts. In the event Standards Australia does not change its zero-tolerance policy, farmers risk losing organic certification. Alternatively, an easing of the policy would result in Australia losing its position on world markets as a strict organic producer.</p>
<p>Demand for safe and nutritious food is forecast to soar across Asia over the next five years, with consumer spending predicted by the Economist Intelligence Unit to rise to $3.7 trillion from $2.8 trillion in 2012.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By a strange coincidence, two leading medical journals have published case studies of the same arcane medical mystery. In one, doctors solved the riddle only after the patient got so sick she had to have a heart transplant. But in the other, a physician who teaches at the University of Marburg in Germany found the clues in Season 7, Episode 11, of the Fox television show House.</p>
<p>It turned out that Dr Gregory House, the cantankerous, fictional diagnostician modelled on Sherlock Holmes, had used his powers of deduction to diagnose the very same ailment in a woman played by actress Candice Bergen on an episode that aired in 2011.</p>
<p>In this case of life imitating art — or at least TV — a paper in The Lancet, a London-based medical publication, described how an ailing man in Germany had gone from doctor to doctor, seeking a diagnosis. He had low thyroid hormone levels, inflammation of oesophagus and fever, and he had gone almost blind and deaf. Most perilous of all, his heart had weakened so much it could not pump blood hard enough.</p>
<p>Finally, in May 2012, the man, then 55, arrived at a University of Marburg clinic run by Dr Juergen R Schaefer, who specialises in puzzling cases and happens to be a major fan of House. In fact, Schaefer uses House in teaching medicine, and he realised his patient’s symptoms were eerily similar to those of Bergen’s character.  House’s diagnosis: cobalt poisoning from her artificial metal hip.</p>
<p>Schaefer’s patient had had an artificial ceramic hip that failed, and it was replaced with a metal one in November 2010, shortly before his symptoms began.<br />
Schaefer tested the man’s cobalt level and discovered it was 1,000 times the level considered normal.</p>
<p>A scan showed the metal in his hip was eroded. The reason, Schaefer speculated, was that when the man’s doctor removed the broken ceramic hip, he inadvertently left behind tiny particles of ceramic. Those particles, Schaefer said, acted like sandpaper.</p>
<p>The man had his metal hip replaced with another ceramic one, after which his cobalt level plunged. His heart function improved, but he still needed a defibrillator implanted. His fever and oesophagus problems went away. But his hearing and eyesight barely got any better.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the doctors in the other case, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, had not seen that episode of House.</p>
<p>The patient, a woman in Denver, said she began feeling ill on a vacation in Hawaii a few years ago. “I was tired all the time,” she said. When she returned from her travels, she discovered she had gained 10 pounds on her 4-foot-10, 95-pound frame. Her abdomen was swollen, as were her arms and legs.</p>
<p>Her doctor ordered a CT scan, which showed fluid accumulating around her heart. He drained the fluid, but she still felt ill. Normally, someone with such a condition has an enlarged heart, but hers was  a normal size.</p>
<p>By 2011, her heart was failing. She went to the Anschutz Medical Campus of the University of Colorado, Denver, where her doctor, Larry A Allen, a heart failure and transplant specialist, confessed he was baffled.</p>
<p>On September 10, 2011, she underwent a heart transplant.</p>
<p>Sometime later, the orthopaedist who had replaced her hips with metal implants took some routine blood tests and found something curious. Her cobalt level was more than 300 times normal. The cause of her problems was suddenly clear.</p>
<p>About a year after her heart transplant, she had both artificial hips replaced with ones that had a polyethylene liner. Her postoperative course was rocky, but her cobalt level declined.</p>
<p>In their article describing the case, Allen said however rare cobalt poisoning might be, it is something to consider when people with metal-on-metal hip implants have symptoms suggestive of it.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately,” he added, “I have seen about two half-episodes of House.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985938&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>US health officials have begun to predict the end of cigarette smoking in America.</p>
<p>They have long wished for a cigarette-free America, but shied away from calling for smoking rates to fall to zero or near zero by any particular year. The power of tobacco companies and popularity of their products made such a goal seem like a pipe dream.</p>
<p>But a confluence of changes has recently prompted public health leaders to start throwing around phrases like “endgame” and “tobacco-free generation”. Now, they talk about the adult smoking rate dropping to 10 per cent in the next decade and to 5 per cent or lower by 2050.</p>
<p>Acting US Surgeon General Boris Lushniak last month released a 980-page report on smoking that pushed for stepped-up tobacco-control measures. “We believe we have the public health tools to get us to the zero level,” he told AP.</p>
<p>This is not the first time a US health official has spoken so boldly. In 1984, Surgeon General C Everett Koop called for a “smoke-free society” by 2000. However, Koop didn’t offer specifics.</p>
<p>“What’s different today is that we have policies and programmes that have been proven to drive down tobacco use,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.</p>
<p>Among the things that have changed:<br />
n Cigarette taxes have increased. A pack of cigarettes that would have sold for about $1.75 20 years ago would cost more than triple that now.<br />
n Laws banning smoking in restaurants, bars and workplaces have popped up.</p>
<p>n Polls show that cigarette smoking is no longer considered normal behaviour, and is less popular among teens than marijuana.</p>
<p>n Federal officials are increasingly aggressive about anti-smoking advertising. The Food and Drug Administration has launched a new youth tobacco prevention campaign, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has debuted a third, $60-million round of its successful anti-tobacco ad campaign.</p>
<p>n Tobacco companies, once considered impervious to legal attack, have suffered some huge defeats in court. Perhaps the biggest was the 1998 settlement of a case brought by more than 40 states demanding compensation for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. Big Tobacco agreed to pay about $200 billion.</p>
<p>n Retailing of cigarettes is changing. CVS Caremark, the second-largest US pharmacy chain, has announced that it will stop selling tobacco products at its more than 7,600 drugstores. Public health leaders predict pressure will increase on companies like Walgreen Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc to follow suit.</p>
<p>These developments have caused Myers’s organisation and others to recently tout the goal of bringing adult smoking rate down to 10 per cent by 2024, from the current 18 per cent. The bigger goal is to reduce US smoking-related deaths to fewer than 10,000, from the current 4,80,000.</p>
<p>But while some experts and advocates are swinging for the fences, others are more pessimistic. They say the key is not simply more taxes and more local smoking bans, but action to regulate smoking.</p>
<p>A 2009 US law gave the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products. It barred the FDA from blocking the sale of cigarettes, but the agency was free to take such steps as prohibiting the use of menthol flavouring and requiring cigarette makers to ratchet down the amount of nicotine.</p>
<p>But nearly five years later, the FDA has yet to even propose such regulations.</p>
<p>“The industry makes money as long as they  delay regulation,” said Kenneth Warner, a University of Michigan public health professor.</p>
<p>Warner and Michigan colleague David Mendez estimate that, barring any major new tobacco control victories, the adult smoking rate will drop from its current 18 per cent only to about 12 per cent by 2050. If health officials do make huge strides, the rate could drop as low as 6 per cent, they think.</p>
<p>But Lushniak said zero. Will that ever happen?<br />
Some experts doubt it. Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor who focuses on tobacco issues, said it’s hard to take away something from the people.</p>
<p>Better, he said, is to bar people from having a product in the first place. He is intrigued by legal efforts in Singapore and a handful of other countries to ban sales of tobacco to anyone born after a certain year — 2000, say. That would be constitutional, he said. The question is: Would American culture accept it?</p>
<p>A growing number of experts believe the most promising option is to get people to switch voluntarily to something else, like electronic cigarettes.<br />
In the past, “the country really wasn’t ready to walk away from cigarettes”, Daynard said. “I think the country’s ready now.”    AP</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985927&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Thinkstock)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/memorydeclinem.jpg" /></a> Study doesn&#8217;t explain why the infections are related to worsening cognitive function. (Thinkstock)
<p>Exposure to common infections is linked to memory and brain function &#8211; even if the infections never made you ill, a new research has warned.</p>
<p>Researchers found an index of antibody levels caused by exposure to Chlamydia pneumoniae, Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 was associated with worse cognitive performance, including memory, speed of mental processing, abstract thinking, planning and reasoning ability.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were very interested in what were the risk factors for cognitive performance and decline,&#8221; said Clinton Wright, the study&#8217;s lead researcher and scientific director of the Evelyn F McKnight Brain Institute at the University of Miami.</p>
<p>Earlier studies have already linked certain infections to an increased risk of stroke and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>Researchers investigated if evidence of past exposure to these infections contributed to performance on tests of memory, thinking speed and other brain functions.</p>
<p>The study conducted brain function tests and took blood samples from 588 people who participated in the Northern Manhattan Study. Half of the participants then took cognitive tests again in five years.</p>
<p>Researchers believe exposure to these infections may be associated with an increase in stroke risk, as well as an increase in atherosclerosis and inflammation, said Wright.</p>
<p>The study doesn&#8217;t explain why the infections are related to worsening cognitive function.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could be caused by an immune system response to the infections or the infection itself could result in clinical damage that we&#8217;re not aware of,&#8221; Wright said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no evidence yet that treating these infections is beneficial,&#8221; Wright said, because the initial exposure to the viruses may have happened decades earlier and the damage may be the result of a gradual process.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be great if treatment prevented these bad outcomes, but we&#8217;re very far away from having that type of evidence,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985638&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the-better-late-than-never department, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has revised its guidelines for effective treatment of the symptoms of menopause.</p>
<p>Published as a practice bulletin for doctors called “Management of Menopausal Symptoms,” the new guidelines recognize that up to three-fourths of women in the United States experience troublesome side effects when their bodies stop producing estrogen as a result of natural or medically induced menopause. The document addresses the most common distressing consequences: hot flushes and vaginal atrophy.</p>
<p>Hot flushes can last for months or even decades, but vaginal problems, if untreated, persist for the remainder of a woman’s life.</p>
<p>Hot flushes can cause drenching, sometimes embarrassing sweating, and seriously disrupt sleep night after night. Vaginal atrophy and the loss of lubrication and elasticity can make sexual encounters painful, depress libido and cause irritation and bleeding during exercise.</p>
<p>You might think the standard treatment would be to administer the hormones that menopausal women are losing. Indeed, supplementation with estrogen was a common practice for decades, and not just for curbing menopausal symptoms. Estrogen was widely promoted as a way to protect women’s health and to keep looking and feeling young well into old age.</p>
<p>But in 2002, a large clinical trial called the Women’s Health Initiative found that the most popular form of hormone replacement, a pill that combined estrogen and synthetic progesterone called Prempro, increased a woman’s risk of heart disease, breast cancer, stroke and blood clots.</p>
<p>The new bulletin, prepared by Dr Clarisa R Gracia, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Pennsylvania, examines the various claims and scores of studies. It offers treatment recommendations based on the best available evidence for preserving the health and well-being of women experiencing menopausal symptoms.</p>
<p>But most women do best when their physicians offer remedies that have been shown to be effective in well-designed studies. And as you might guess, estrogen alone, or in combination with a natural or synthetic progesterone (progestin) for women who still have a uterus, is the “most effective therapy” for curbing hot flushes, the report found.</p>
<p>“Data do not support the use of progestin-only medications, testosterone or compounded bioidentical hormones,” the report also said.</p>
<p>Estrogen with or without progestin can be administered orally or through the skin with a patch, gel or spray. The transdermal route is considered safer: When absorbed through the skin, hormones bypass the liver, which would otherwise create substances that might raise the risk of heart attack or cancer.</p>
<p>The report emphasises that treatment with hormones must be individualized and that doctors should prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest time needed to relieve hot flushes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985275&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/workout-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985273" alt="Volunteers who had consumed the antioxidants had significantly lower levels of the markers related to mitochondrial creation. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/workout-m.jpg" /></a> Volunteers who had consumed the antioxidants had significantly lower levels of the markers related to mitochondrial creation.
<p>Many people take vitamins as part of their daily fitness regimens, having heard that antioxidants aid physical recovery and amplify the impact of workouts. But in another example of science undercutting deeply held assumptions, several new experiments find that antioxidant supplements may actually reduce the benefits of training.</p>
<p>Antioxidants became popular dietary supplements largely because they were said to sop up free radicals, the highly reactive oxygen molecules that are generated during daily activities. Physical exertion, through its breakdown of oxygen, results in the creation of large numbers of these molecules, which, in excess, can lead to cell death and tissue damage. So it seems logical that reducing the number of free radicals produced by exercise would be desirable.</p>
<p>Enter antioxidants, which absorb and deactivate free radicals. While the body creates its own antioxidants, until recently many researchers believed that we produce too few natural antioxidants to counteract the depredations from free radicals created during exercise. So many people who exercise began downing large doses of antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, even though few experiments in people had actually examined the precise physiological impacts of antioxidant supplements in people who work out.</p>
<p>For a study published last week in The Journal of Physiology, researchers with the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo and other institutions gathered 54 healthy adult men and women, most of them recreational runners or cyclists, and conducted a series of tests, including muscle biopsies, blood draws and treadmill runs, to establish their baseline endurance capacity and the cellular health of their muscles.</p>
<p>Then they divided the volunteers into two groups. Those in one group took four pills a day, delivering a total dose of 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C and 235 milligrams of vitamin E. Members of the second group got identical placebo pills.</p>
<p>Finally, they asked all of the participants to complete a vigorous 11-week training program, consisting of increasingly intense interval sessions once or twice per week, together with two weekly sessions of moderately paced hour-long runs. By the end, all of the volunteers were more fit than they had been at the start, with their maximum endurance capacity increasing by an average of about 8 per cent.</p>
<p>But their bodies had responded quite differently to the training. The runners who had swallowed the placebo pills showed robust increases of biochemical markers that are known to goose the creation of mitochondria, the tiny structures within cells that generate energy, in cells in their bloodstream and muscles. More mitochondria, especially in muscle cells, means more energy and, by and large, better health and fitness. The creation of new mitochondria is, in fact, generally held to be one of the most important effects of exercise.</p>
<p>But the volunteers who had consumed the antioxidants had significantly lower levels of the markers related to mitochondrial creation. The researchers didn’t actually count the specific populations of mitochondria within their volunteers’ muscles cells, but presumably, over time, those taking the antioxidants would see a smaller uptick in mitochondrial density than among those not taking them.</p>
<p>That finding echoes the results of another study of antioxidant supplementation and exercise, also published last year in The Journal of Physiology, in which half of a group of older men downed 250 milligrams daily of the supplement resveratrol, an antioxidant famously found in red wine, and the other half took a placebo. After two months of exercising, the men taking the placebo showed significant and favorable changes in their blood pressure, cholesterol profiles and arteries, with fewer evident arterial plaques.</p>
<p>The men taking the resveratrol were not as fortunate. They had exercised as much as the other men, but their blood pressures, cholesterol levels and arteries had remained stubbornly almost unchanged.</p>
<p>The supplements did not improve performance in comparison with a placebo, so why bother with them, Dr Goran Paulsen, a researcher at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, who led the vitamin C and E study, asked. “Personally, I would avoid high dosages” of antioxidants while training, he said. The science on the topic may not be complete, but the intimation of the recent studies is that by downing the supplements, “you risk losing some of the benefits of exercise”.<br />

<p><em>Ishi khosla is a former senior nutritionist at Escorts. She heads the Centre of Dietary Counselling and also runs a health food store. She feels that for complete well-being, one should integrate physical, mental and spiritual health. According to her: “To be healthy should be the ultimate goal for all.”</em></p>
<p>Our immune system protects us from various diseases. However, at times it goes on an overdrive and attacks the body itself, leading to tissue destruction and degenerative diseases referred to as autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>Autoimmune disorders include multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, type-1 diabetes mellitus, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Graves’ disease, chronic thyroiditis, celiac disease and Crohn’s disease, Autoimmune problems have a strong genetic predisposition but triggers may include excessive sun, infections, drugs, or other conditions — such as pregnancy — that stress the body.</p>
<p>Whether diet influences autoimmunity has been the subject of many unresolved debates. Interestingly, growing evidence indicates a role of diet in preventing, delaying or reversing the expression of genetically determined autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>As the gut is a major site of many complex interactions which control immunity, it is the largest interface between an individual and his environment and, therefore, provides the largest exposure for immune building micro-organisms and exposure to toxins and allergens. Strengthening the age-old adage, we are what we eat. This suggests an important role of probiotics and pre-biotics in autoimmunity. Scientists explored the role of pre-biotic and probiotic supplementation in young infants to promote good bacteria and concluded that they were beneficial in the prevention of eczema. However, the effects in the treatment of eczema were less convincing.</p>
<p>Maternal diets during pregnancy and breast feeding too have been found to influence autoimmune processes. Breast feeding also emerges as a potentially protective factor for prevention of allergies and celiac disease.</p>
<p>Over the past years, evidence has supported a major role for specific dietary factors including vitamin D, vitamin A, selenium, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, glutamine (an amino acid) and flavanols (plant chemicals which protect against disease) in influencing autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, deficiency of vitamin D has now been associated with increased autoimmunity and increased susceptibility to infections. Associations between vitamin D and autoimmune diseases have been confirmed in multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).</p>
<p>Recent studies also indicate that vitamin A is a potent immuno-regulator and can be instrumental in prevention of intestinal inflammation and autoimmunity.</p>
<p>Dietary modification has shown its greatest beneficial effect when started prior to or immediately after the onset of disease. Optimum but balanced food intake maintains healthy growth and disease-free lifespan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/co-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1984979" alt="Childhood obesity may itself be enough to cause outcomes including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and its associated cardiovascular, retinal and renal complications." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/co-med.jpg" /></a> Childhood obesity may be enough to cause metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and its associated cardiovascular, retinal and renal complications.
<p>Childhood obesity can have long-term consequences &#8211; even when kids later lose weight, scientists say.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Colorado Cancer Center said that even in cases in which obese children later lose weight, the health effects of childhood obesity may be long-lasting and profound.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were two things going on here. First, the earlier you are exposed to obesity, the earlier we may see the onset of complications including type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and cancer,&#8221; said Kristen Nadeau, investigator at the CU Cancer Center, associate professor of Pediatric Endocrinology at the CU School of Medicine, and the paper&#8217;s senior author.</p>
<p>&#8220;That makes sense: these complications don&#8217;t happen overnight, and the earlier you start the ball rolling, the earlier and more likely you are to see early morbidity and mortality from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But then it looks like independent of this increased-exposure effect, kids&#8217; maturing bodies may be especially vulnerable to the detrimental health effects of obesity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early exposure can make you much more predisposed to complications than might exposure once the body is done maturing. It may be that childhood obesity changes the way the whole metabolism is working &#8211; and changes it during a critical developmental time frame,&#8221; Nadeau said in an article published in the journal Gerontology.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown the intuitive causal chain of childhood obesity leading to adult obesity, which in turn leads to complications, but recent evidence shows that childhood obesity may also create these effects independent of adult obesity, researchers said.</p>
<p>Childhood obesity may itself be enough to cause outcomes including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and its associated cardiovascular, retinal and renal complications.</p>
<p>It may also cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovarian syndrome, infertility, asthma, orthopedic complications, psychiatric disease, and increased rates of cancer, among others.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, our ability to make conclusions is complicated by a lack of data,&#8221; Nadeau said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the epidemic of childhood obesity is still relatively new, we simply don&#8217;t have the longitudinal data to know how childhood obesity affects late-life health.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people who were children in, say, 1980 near the start of this rise in obesity rates are only reaching their 40s. Therefore one major message of our study is that we need increased funding aimed at tracking kids longitudinally so we are not just speculating about these long-term effects,&#8221; Nadeau said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1984964&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pizza-480.jpg" /></a> An ingredient in pizza can ward off winter disease. (Reuters)
<p>A pizza ingredient may help ward off the notorious winter vomiting bug, new research published in the journal Applied Microbiology has claimed. Carvacrol, the primary active component in oregano oil, effectively kills norovirus, a common cause of foodborne illness outbreaks in hospitals, schools and cruise ships, researchers said.</p>
<p>A study led by University of Arizona researcher Kelly Bright has found that carvacrol &#8211; the substance in oregano oil that gives the pizza herb its distinctive warm and aromatic smell and flavour &#8211; is effective against norovirus, causing the breakdown of the virus&#8217; tough outer coat.</p>
<p>Norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting disease, is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhoea around the world. &#8220;Carvacrol could potentially be used as a food sanitiser and possibly as a surface sanitiser, particularly in conjunction with other antimicrobials,&#8221; said Bright. &#8220;We have some work to do to assess its potential, but carvacrol is an interesting prospect,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Bright and her team &#8211; former graduate student Damian Gilling, former visiting scholar Masaaki Kitajima and current doctoral student Jason Torrey &#8211; determined whether oregano oil and carvacrol, the primary active component in oregano oil, were effective against mouse norovirus. In the experiments, oregano oil had limited efficacy, but carvacrol resulted in a nearly 10,000-fold reduction in viral infectivity within an hour. In other words, it is 99.99 per cent effective against the virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carvacrol does not act as quickly as bleach, which will act in minutes or even seconds, but it is still effective,&#8221; Bright said. Since carvacrol is a plant compound, it is generally regarded as safe for human consumption, Bright added. This is also the first study that looks at the mechanism of breakdown in detail of a plant antimicrobial on a non-enveloped virus, Bright said. Nonenveloped viruses like noroviruses tend to be the ones that target the gastrointestinal tract. Their tough outer protein shell &#8211; called the capsid &#8211; makes them resistant against stomach acid and allows them to travel through the gastrointestinal tract unharmed.</p>
<p>Bright&#8217;s research revealed the exact mechanism of how this plant compound kills a nonenveloped virus. &#8220;Carvacrol acts directly on the virus&#8217; outer shell and breaks it down,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The virus needs that capsid to attach to the human cell, so if you break down that shell, it won&#8217;t be able to cause an infection. In addition, it breaks down the virus&#8217; RNA genome. These effects are therefore likely irreversible, so the mechanism of action is an example of true virus inactivation,&#8221; said Bright.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1983459&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">About 78,000 infants born with congenital heart disease in India die every year because of inadequate health care facilities in the country, experts said. &#8220;Every year 1.5 lakh infants are born in India with congenital heart disease,&#8221; Dr Murtaza Chisti, chief cardiac surgeon of the Mahatma Gandhi Cardiac and Critical Care Centre told reporters after conducting a medical camp here today.</span></p>
<p>Due to lack of awareness, cases of congenital heart disease are on the rise in the country. &#8220;Work-related tension coupled with lifestyle changes of young people and people in age group of 30 to 40 years make them susceptible to heart attacks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A controlled diet with minimal fatty and non-vegetarian food, non-consumption of sweets, coupled with adequate rest could reduce the incidence of heart problems, he said, adding that diabetes, high blood pressure, mental tension, increase in cholesterol were contributory causes for heart attacks.</p>
<p>Dr ML Swarankar, chairman of the India Education Trust, said that India had the dubious distinction of having the largest number of deaths in Asia owing to heart attack. More and well-equipped cardiac centres were needed to bring down the number, he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1981327&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/vitamin-a-480.jpg" /></a> Scientists are still uncertain whether giving children vitamin A pills will be an easy solution. (Reuters)
<p>School-age kids who do not get enough vitamin A are more likely to get sick with gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, the Journal of Nutrition found. The study followed nearly 2,800 children, ages 5-12 over the course of a year in the US.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Michigan School of Public Health and Michigan State University found that children with less vitamin A in their blood got sick more often with diarrhoea, vomiting, cough, and fever. &#8220;No study had estimated the potential role of vitamin A alone in children between 5 and 12 age group,&#8221; said Dr Eduardo Villamor, senior author of the study.</p>
<p>Researchers said more research is needed to determine if vitamin A supplementation can reduce the risk or severity of infection in older children. The researchers also studied other micro-nutrients that are important to the immune system, including zinc, iron, folate and vitamin B12. But only vitamin A was related to illness. The study found that for every 10 micrograms per decilitre of vitamin A present in the blood, children experienced 18 per cent fewer days with diarrhoea and vomiting, 10 per cent fewer days of cough and fever, and 6 per cent fewer visits to the doctor.</p>
<p>Villamor said the effects of vitamin A could vary in different countries due to differences in diet and the microorganisms that cause illness. &#8220;The age and possibly sex of children could also be factors,&#8221; he said. However, he added that it&#8217;s uncertain whether giving children vitamin A pills will be an easy solution.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1980564&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pigeons-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1980534" alt="Scientists say that feather colours in 82 breeds of pigeons could be explained by various combinations of the three genes.

(Reuters)
<p>Scientists have identified mutations in three key genes that determine feather colour in domestic rock pigeons. The same genes control pigmentation of human skin and can be responsible for melanoma and albinism, researchers said. &#8220;In humans, mutations of these genes often are considered &#8216;bad&#8217; because they can cause albinism or make cells more susceptible to UV (ultraviolet sunlight) damage and melanoma because the protective pigment is absent or low,&#8221; said Eric Domyan, a biology postdoctoral fellow at the University of Utah and first author of the study in the journal Current Biology.</p>
<p>Various forms of a gene named Tyrp1 make pigeons either blue-black (the grayish colour of common city pigeons), red or brown, researchers said. Mutations of a second gene, named Sox10, makes pigeons red no matter what the first gene does. And different forms of a third gene, named Slc45a2, make the pigeons&#8217; colours either intense or washed out, researchers said. The scientists discovered how pigeons&#8217; feather colour is determined by different versions of these three genes &#8211; known as variants or alleles &#8211; and by what are called &#8220;epistatic&#8221; interactions, in which one gene obscures the effects of other genes. &#8220;Both Tyrp1 and Sox10 are potential targets for treatment of melanoma. Mutations in Slc45a2 in humans can lead to changes in skin colour, including albinism (lack of skin colour),&#8221; said Michael Shapiro, senior author of the study.</p>
<p>Different versions of the three major pigeon-colour genes affect the relative proportions of major forms of the melanin pigment- eumelanin and pheomelanin- and their distribution within cells. Eumelanin provides black and brown pigmentation, while pheomelanin provides red and yellow pigmentation of feathers. Interplay among the three major genes is complex, resulting in diverse colouration of pigeons. &#8220;Mutations in one gene determine whether mutations in a second gene have an effect on an organism,&#8221; Domyan said.</p>
<p>In other words, one gene can mask the effects of another in relation to pigeon colour. The three pigment genes don&#8217;t control how the colours are distributed in patterns on pigeons&#8217; bodies, such as white patches of feathers on some breeds. The genetics of colour patterns remains to be determined, researchers said. The scientists showed that feather colours in 82 breeds of pigeons could be explained by various combinations of the three genes and their different versions.</p>
<p>Shapiro and co-workers found that versions of the Tyrp1 gene were responsible for determining three basic pigeon colours: blue-black, ash-red, and brown. Blue-black colour of pigeons is considered &#8220;normal,&#8221; because neither Tyrp1 nor the other two major colour genes contain mutations in these pigeons. City pigeons typically are this colour.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1980533&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Patients who experience abrupt kidney injury following surgery have an increased risk of developing heart problems later, a new study has warned. Acute kidney injury (AKI), a sudden decline in kidney function, is an increasingly prevalent and potentially serious condition in hospitalised patients, researchers said. Sometimes acute kidney injury arises after major surgery because the kidneys can be deprived of normal blood flow during the procedure.</p>
<p>To investigate the links between AKI and later heart problems, Vin-Cent Wu from National Taiwan University Hospital and his colleagues analysed information from hospitalised patients who recovered from AKI that required dialysis. Data were collected from inpatient claims of the Taiwan National Health Insurance from 1999 to 2008. Among the 17,106 acute dialysis patients who were discharged, 4,869 recovered from dialysis-requiring AKI and were matched with 4,869 patients without AKI. Patients who recovered from AKI had a 67 per cent increased risk of experiencing coronary events or dying during the study period, regardless of whether or not they developed chronic kidney disease, researchers said.</p>
<p>AKI&#8217;s harmful effects on heart health were comparable to those attributed to diabetes. &#8220;These findings indicate that dialysis-requiring AKI with subsequent recovery should be deemed as a risk category for cardiovascular disease, and they shed light on the importance of adequate care for affected patients,&#8221; said Wu. The study will appear in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1980499&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Improper diet is a risk factor for a number of diseases. However, the exact effect of different components of food may depend on a person’s genetic make up.</p>
<p>Nutritional genomics or nutrigenomics is the study of how different foods can interact with particular genes to alter a person’s risk of developing diseases and how individual genetic differences can affect the way we respond to nutrients. This means that it is not a question of whether your genes are good or bad, but rather how they interact with your environment.</p>
<p>The science of nutrigenomics also studies how genes, diet and disease interact to create health disparities for certain human populations that evolved from different geographic locations. For example, African American men have a 60 per cent higher risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer than do Caucasian men. Half of all adult Pima Indians in the United States have type 2 diabetes, compared with 6.5 per cent of adult Americans of Caucasian descent.</p>
<p>Recent studies in Indians living overseas have shown a great potential for CHD in people of this subcontinent. They run just about the highest risk of heart attack and death compared to all other ethnic groups and races.</p>
<p>So far, modern nutrition and medicine have not worked on designing diets or medicines according to different ethnic groups or body types. Scientific wisdom is based on the premise that what works for one should work for most. It does not factor in individual differences. On the contrary, alternative/traditional systems believe that individuals are different and traditional therapies such as Chinese medicine, Unani, Ayurveda and Homeopathy have been formulated according on this premise. This could probably be an explanation of why one of the largest scientific trials on homeopathy failed to prove its efficacy. Nutrigenomics integrates this gap — studying genetic profiles and customising nutrients and foods according to the DNA.<br />
The nutrigenomics effort seeks to identify genes controlled by nutrients and other naturally occurring chemicals in food and to study how some of these genes can tip the balance between health and disease.</p>
<p>Nutritional genomics helps individuals to better manage their health and well being by precisely matching their diets to their unique genetic make up.</p>
<p>In the USA, there are claims you can make your children more intelligent by customising their diet according to their genetic make-up&#8230; There is also the ‘DNA diet’, which claims you can lose weight, tone up and even live longer by following advice based on analysis of your DNA.</p>
<p>So far, evidence on the interaction of nutrients, genetic variations and health implications is uncertain. In fact, according to US Government Accountability Office (GAO), nutrigenetic tests “may mislead consumers by promising results they cannot deliver” and issue medical predictions that may either needlessly alarm or in some cases, falsely assure, consumers about their health.<br />
However, this may well be the road ahead for personalised dietary intervention based on knowledge of nutritional needs, nutritional status and genes to prevent, mitigate or cure chronic diseases.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1980186&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Smoking regularly may not only affect fitness levels, it may also make you less physically active and decrease your motivation, a new study has warned.</p>
<p>Resaerchers found that smokers are less physically active, lack motivation and are more likely to suffer symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>The study, led by Dr Karina Furlanetto, from Universidade Estadual de Londrina, Brazil, is the first to show that smokers are less physically active than non-smokers.</p>
<p>As many as 60 smokers and 50 non-smokers were asked to wear a pedometer for a minimum of 12 hours per day, over 6 days. The results showed that smokers walked less on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When their capacity to take long breaths was tested, their lung function was found to be reduced and this impacted their ability to exercise.</p>
<p>When smokers were asked to rate their own health-related quality of life they reported feeling more tired, and lacked the motivation to change their inactive behaviour.</p>
<p>&#8220;To our knowledge, this is the first study that has demonstrated a reduction in the objectively measured level of physical activity in daily life of adult smokers compared with non-smokers,&#8221; said Furlanetto.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides presenting poorer lung function, exercise capacity, quality of life and symptoms of anxiety and depression, smokers also walked less than non-smokers in daily life,&#8221; Furlanetto said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Respirology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1978196&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our immune system is constantly working to prevent cancer by eliminating certain potentially cancerous cells in their early stages, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Immune cells undergo &#8216;spontaneous&#8217; changes on a daily basis that could lead to cancers if not for the diligent surveillance of our immune system, scientists have found.</p>
<p>The research team from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne found that immune system was responsible for eliminating potentially cancerous immune B cells in their early stages, before they developed into B-cell lymphomas.</p>
<p>This immune surveillance accounts for what researchers call the &#8216;surprising rarity&#8217; of B-cell lymphomas in the population, given how often these spontaneous changes occur.</p>
<p>The discovery could lead to the development of an early-warning test that identifies patients at high risk of developing B-cell lymphomas, enabling proactive treatment to prevent tumours from growing.</p>
<p>Dr Axel Kallies, Associate Professor David Tarlinton, Dr Stephen Nutt and colleagues made the discovery while investigating the development of B-cell lymphomas. Kallies said the discovery provided an answer to why B-cell lymphomas occur in the population less frequently than expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each and every one of us has spontaneous mutations in our immune B cells that occur as a result of their normal function,&#8221; Kallies said. &#8220;It is then somewhat of a paradox that B cell lymphoma is not more common in the population.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our finding that immune surveillance by T cells enables early detection and elimination of these cancerous and pre-cancerous cells provides an answer to this puzzle, and proves that immune surveillance is essential to preventing the development of this blood cancer,&#8221; Kallies said. The research team made the discovery while investigating how B cells change when lymphoma develops.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of the research, we &#8216;disabled&#8217; the T cells to suppress the immune system and, to our surprise, found that lymphoma developed in a matter of weeks, where it would normally take years,&#8221; Kallies said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that our immune system is better equipped than we imagined to identify and eliminate cancerous B cells, a process that is driven by the immune T cells in our body,&#8221; said Kallies.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1976581&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sleeping for six hours or less per night may increase the risk of major depression especially among adolescents, a new research has warned.</p>
<p>A genetic study of adult twins and a community-based study of adolescents both report novel links between sleep duration and depression.</p>
<p>A study of 4,175 individuals between 11 and 17 years of age is the first to document reciprocal effects for major depression and short sleep duration among adolescents using prospective data.</p>
<p>Results suggest sleeping six hours or less per night increases the risk for major depression, which in turn increases the risk for decreased sleep among adolescents.</p>
<p>&#8220;These results are important because they suggest that sleep deprivation may be a precursor for major depression in adolescents, occurring before other symptoms of major depression and additional mood disorders,&#8221; said principal investigator Dr Robert E Roberts, from the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston.</p>
<p>Another study of 1,788 adult twins suggest that sleep durations outside the normal range increase the genetic risk for depressive symptoms.</p>
<p>Among twins with a normal sleep duration of seven to 8.9 hours per night, the total heritability of depressive symptoms was 27 per cent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Healthy sleep is a necessity for physical, mental and emotional well-being,&#8221; said American Academy of Sleep Medicine President Dr M Safwan Badr.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new research emphasises that we can make an investment in our health by prioritising sleep,&#8221; said Badr.</p>
<p>However, the genetic influence on depressive symptoms increased to 53 per cent among twins with a short sleep duration of five hours per night and 49 per cent among those who reported sleeping 10 hours per night.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were surprised that the heritability of depressive symptoms in twins with very short sleep was nearly twice the heritability in twins sleeping normal amounts of time,&#8221; said principal investigator Dr Nathaniel Watson, from the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Center in Seattle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both short and excessively long sleep durations appear to activate genes related to depressive symptoms,&#8221; said Watson.</p>
<p>The studies are published in the journal Sleep.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1975908&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Children with depression are more likely to be obese, smoke and be inactive, and can show the effects of heart disease as early as their teen years, a new study has warned.</p>
<p>Depression may increase the risk of heart problems later in life, according to the study by University of South Florida Associate Professor of Psychology Jonathan Rottenberg and his colleagues at Washington University and the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The researchers also observed higher rates of heart disease in the parents of adolescents that had been depressed as children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given that the parents in this sample were relatively young, we were quite surprised to find that the parents of the affected adolescents were reporting a history of heart attacks and other serious events,&#8221; Rottenberg said.</p>
<p>Cardiologists and mental health professionals have long known a link exists between depression and heart disease.</p>
<p>Depressed adults are more likely to suffer a heart attack, and if they do have a heart attack, it&#8217;s more likely to be fatal.</p>
<p>However it was unclear when the association between clinical depression and cardiac risk develops, or how early in life the association can be detected.</p>
<p>These findings suggest improved prevention and treatment of childhood depression could reduce adult cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>During the study, Rottenberg and his colleagues followed up on Hungarian children who had participated in a 2004 study of the genetics of depression.</p>
<p>The researchers compared heart disease risk factors &#8211; such as smoking, obesity, physical activity level, and parental history &#8211; across three categories of adolescents.</p>
<p>The investigators surveyed more than 200 children with a history of clinical depression, as well as about 200 of their siblings who have never suffered from depression.</p>
<p>They also gathered information from more than 150 unrelated children of the same age and gender with no history of depression.</p>
<p>Further studies planned will examine whether any early warning signs of heart disease are present as the adolescents move into young adulthood.</p>
<p>The research is published in Psychosomatic Medicine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1974635&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/asthma-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1973123" alt="Those born more than two months early were three times as likely to be affected as babies born at full term." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/asthma-med.jpg" /></a> Those born more than two months early were three times as likely to be affected as babies born at full term.
<p>Premature babies are more likely to develop childhood asthma than those born at full term, says a new research. A worldwide study of more than 1.5 million children found that the risk of developing asthma, or asthma-like symptoms, after a preterm birth is higher than previously thought.</p>
<p>In addition, the risks of developing asthmatic symptoms are the same for preschool and school-age children, indicating that children born prematurely do not outgrow the risk, a release by the University of Edinburgh said.</p>
<p>As an increasing number of babies now surviving premature birth and asthma being the most common chronic disease in childhood, it is likely to become a significant health problem. Asthma affects some 8 per cent of children born at full term, while this rises to 14 per cent in babies born prematurely defined as at least three weeks early, the study shows.</p>
<p>Babies born more than three weeks before the usual 40-week term early were almost 50 per cent more likely to develop asthma.<br />
Those born more than two months early were three times as likely to be affected as babies born at full term. Data was taken from 30 studies of patients from six continents who were born since the 1990s. Most were from Western countries, including 14 from Europe and four from the UK.</p>
<p>Many premature babies experience breathing problems, because their lungs are immature. The findings were published in medical journal called PLOS Medicine. Previous research among premature babies born in the 1960s to 1980s showed that many went on to develop asthma. Although care for preterm babies has improved, it was unclear whether this affected the babies&#8217; long-term risk of asthma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctors and parents need to be aware of the increased risks of asthma in premature babies, in order to make early diagnosis and intervention possible,&#8221; said Dr Jasper Been, of the University of Edinburgh&#8217;s Centre for Population Health Sciences, who led the study in collaboration with Maastricht and Harvard Universities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that uncontrolled asthma in pregnant women, amongst other things, can increase the risk of premature birth, which reinforces the need for good asthma management during pregnancy,&#8221; said Dr Samantha Walker, Executive Director of Research and Policy at Asthma UK.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1973118&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/nano-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1973017" alt="The nanoemulsion could hold antibodies, releasing them only when targeted cells were found, Sainbury said." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/nano-med.jpg" /></a> The nanoemulsion could hold antibodies, releasing them only when targeted cells were found, Sainbury said.
<p>Nano-engineered oil droplets can be used to target infectious diseases and provoke specific immune responses to deal with side-effects of broad-spectrum treatments such as chemotherapy, according to a new research.</p>
<p>The researchers at the University of Queensland said the droplets called nanoemulsions can effectively target diseased cells and provoke specific immune responses.The nanoemulsions carry antibodies and protein and can generate an immune response against infectious diseases such as influenza, HIV and malaria.</p>
<p>A paper on the development has been published in the international journal SMALL. Researcher Frank Sainbury said the journal paper provided proof of the precise targeting that could be achieved by nanoemulsions.</p>
<p>He said it addressed challenges with existing targeted therapies, such as limited drug-carrying capacity and difficulty of manufacture. An ability to target specific cells gives the emulsion the potential to overcome side-effects of broad-spectrum treatments such as chemotherapy, which attacks healthy cells as well as cancerous ones. The nanoemulsion could hold antibodies, releasing them only when targeted cells were found, Sainbury said. &#8220;This is about efficient targeting,&#8221; he said adding, &#8220;Nanoemulsions have a long, safe history in pharmaceutical formulations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The research is a collaboration between Anton Middelberg&#8217;s Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology research group, UQ&#8217;s Diamantina Institute,The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and Burnet Institute&#8217;s Centre for Immunology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1973014&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/alzhiemer.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1972242" alt="The new finding suggests a way to treat Alzheimer's symptoms independently of targeting amyloid plaques, researchers said." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/alzhiemer.jpg" /></a> The new finding suggests a way to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s symptoms independently of targeting amyloid plaques, researchers said.
<p>A chemical that is found in fruits and vegetables, such as strawberries and cucumbers, halts memory loss that accompanies Alzheimer&#8217;s disease in mice, scientists have found.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in the US found that in mice that normally develop Alzheimer&#8217;s symptoms less than a year after birth, a daily dose of the compound &#8211; a flavonol called fisetin &#8211; prevented the progressive memory and learning impairments.</p>
<p>The drug, however, did not alter the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain, accumulations of proteins which are commonly blamed for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>The new finding suggests a way to treat Alzheimer&#8217;s symptoms independently of targeting amyloid plaques, researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had already shown that in normal animals, fisetin can improve memory,&#8221; said Pamela Maher, senior staff scientist in Salk&#8217;s Cellular Neurobiology Laboratory who led the new study.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we showed here is that it also can have an effect on animals prone to Alzheimer&#8217;s,&#8221; Maher said.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, Maher discovered that fisetin helps protect neurons in the brain from the effects of ageing.</p>
<p>She and her colleagues have since &#8211; in both isolated cell cultures and mouse studies &#8211; probed how the compound has both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects on cells in the brain.</p>
<p>Most recently, they found that fisetin turns on a cellular pathway known to be involved in memory.</p>
<p>So Maher and colleagues turned to a strain of mice that have mutations in two genes linked to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>The researchers took a subset of these mice and, when they were only three months old, began adding fisetin to their food. As the mice aged, the researchers tested their memory and learning skills with water mazes.</p>
<p>By nine months of age, mice that had not received fisetin began performing more poorly in the mazes. Mice that had gotten a daily dose of the compound, however, performed as well as normal mice, at both nine months and a year old.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even as the disease would have been progressing, the fisetin was able to continue preventing symptoms,&#8221; Maher said.</p>
<p>In collaboration with scientists at the University of California, San Diego, Maher&#8217;s team next tested the levels of different molecules in the brains of mice that had received doses of fisetin and those that had not.</p>
<p>In mice with Alzheimer&#8217;s symptoms, they found, pathways involved in cellular inflammation were turned on. In the animals that had taken fisetin, those pathways were dampened and anti-inflammatory molecules were present instead.</p>
<p>One protein in particular &#8211; known as p35 &#8211; was blocked from being cleaved into a shorter version when fisetin was taken. The shortened version of p35 is known to turn on and off many other molecular pathways.</p>
<p>The results were published in the journal Aging Cell.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1972237&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/smoking-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1971476" alt="About one third of the group were smokers at age 21, and by age 38 around 40 per cent of these people had quit." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/smoking-med.jpg" /></a> About one third of the group were smokers at age 21, and by age 38 around 40 per cent of these people had quit.
<p>Smokers who want to kick the butt need not be worried about gaining weight after quitting, scientists have found.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Otago in New Zealand analysed data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, which closely followed the progress of around 1,000 people born in Dunedin in 1972-73.</p>
<p>Smoking habits and weight were measured at regular intervals from 15 to 38 years old. About one third of the group were smokers at age 21, and by age 38 around 40 per cent of these people had quit.</p>
<p>Over the 17-year follow up, the quitters&#8217; weight returned to the same level as people of similar age who had never smoked in the first place. Furthermore, they gained only a relatively small amount of weight &#8211; around 5kg &#8211; compared to people who carried on smoking. The findings were the same for both men and women.</p>
<p>Lindsay Robertson, who led the research, said some earlier research had suggested that people might gain large amounts of weight after quitting, but many of these studies were not very reliable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that our findings will encourage people who are thinking about quitting. They should not be put off by the fear of putting on large amounts of weight. It is important to be aware that a small weight gain is unlikely to offset the health benefits of quitting,&#8221; said Robertson.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that being a smoker did not prevent long-term weight gain. All groups in the Dunedin Study tended to put on weight over time, regardless of their smoking status, she said. The study was published in the journal Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1971446&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/bran-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1970838" alt="The longer the vibrations continue, the more charge builds up in the membrane." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/bran-med.jpg" /></a> The longer the vibrations continue, the more charge builds up in the membrane.
<p>Ultrasound may help scientists to unlock the brain&#8217;s secrets noninvasively, and perhaps create new treatments for illnesses, new research suggests. Neurons &#8211; the cells that make up the brain, nerves, and spinal cord &#8211; communicate with each other using electrical pulses known as action potentials, but their interactions are complicated and hard to understand.</p>
<p>Just getting access to the brain itself is difficult:inserting devices through the skull into the brain requires surgery, researchers said. But work by American Technion Society Professors EitanKimmel and Shy Shoham, and PhD student Misha Plaksin, may advance our ability to unlock the brain&#8217;s secrets noninvasively using sound, and perhaps create new treatments for illnesses.<br />Scientists have known for a while that ultrasonic waves can affect cells in many ways. For instance, physicians use ultrasound to stimulate the production of blood vessels and bone; it&#8217;s also used in heat therapy.</p>
<p>When applied to neurons, ultrasonic waves can change how the neurons generate and transmit electrical signals. According to Kimmel&#8217;s model, when the ultrasonic waves encounter a cell, the two layers of the cellular membrane begin to vibrate. Cell membranes also act as capacitors, storing electrical charge. As the layers vibrate, the membrane&#8217;s electrical charge also moves, creating an alternating current that leads to a charge accumulation.</p>
<p>The longer the vibrations continue, the more charge builds up in the membrane. Eventually, enough charge builds up that an action potential is created. The team was able to use the model to predict experimental results that were then verified using brain stimulation experiments performed in mice.</p>
<p>According to Shoham, this is &#8220;the first predictive theory of ultrasound stimulation.&#8221; All of these results mean that scientists might be on the verge of finally understanding how ultrasound affects nerve cells, researchers said. The findings were published in the journal Physical Review X.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1970837&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/diabetesm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1969345" alt="Researchers found that a person is at 26 per cent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their spouse also has the condition.

(AP)
<p>You may be at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if your spouse has it, scientists, including one of Indian-origin, have found.</p>
<p>Researchers found that a person is at 26 per cent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes if their spouse also has the condition.</p>
<p>The team from the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) in Montreal has found, through combined analyses of several studies, evidence that spousal diabetes is a diabetes risk factor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found a 26 per cent increase in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes if your spouse also has type 2 diabetes,&#8221; said senior author of the study, Dr Kaberi Dasgupta, researcher at the Research Institute of the MUHC and an associate professor of medicine at McGill University.</p>
<p>&#8220;This may be a platform to assist clinicians to develop strategies to involve both partners. Changing health behaviour is challenging and if you have the collaboration of your partner it&#8217;s likely to be easier,&#8221; Dasgupta said.</p>
<p>Researchers wanted to see if diabetes in one partner could lead to diabetes in the other partner because many of the risk behaviours that lead to diabetes, such as poor eating habits and low physical activity, could be shared within a household.</p>
<p>Researchers analysed results from six selected studies that were conducted in different parts of the world and looked at key outcomes such as age, socioeconomic status and the way in which diabetes was diagnosed in 75,498 couples.</p>
<p>Most of the studies used in the meta analysis relied on health records which may not always accurately record diabetes, researchers said.</p>
<p>Those that used direct blood testing suggested that diabetes risk doubles if your partner has diabetes. A strong correlation with pre-diabetes risk was also found.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we look at the health history of patients, we often ask about family history. Our results suggest spousal history may be another factor we should take in consideration,&#8221; said Dasgupta.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results of our review suggest that diabetes diagnosis in one spouse may warrant increased surveillance in the other,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, it has been observed that men are less likely than women to undergo regular medical evaluation after childhood and that can result in delayed diabetes detection.</p>
<p>As a result, men living with a spouse with diabetes history may particularly benefit from being followed more closely,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal BMC Medicine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1969333&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sunnmed.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1965273" alt="Researchers found that sunlight alters levels of the small messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO) in the skin and blood, reducing blood pressure." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sunnmed.jpg" /></a> Researchers found that sunlight alters levels of the small messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO) in the skin and blood, reducing blood pressure.
<p>Exposing skin to sunlight may help lower blood pressure and cut the risk of heart attack and stroke, a new study has found.</p>
<p>Research carried out at the Universities of Southampton and Edinburgh found that sunlight alters levels of the small messenger molecule, nitric oxide (NO) in the skin and blood, reducing blood pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;NO along with its breakdown products, known to be abundant in skin, is involved in the regulation of blood pressure,&#8221; said Martin Feelisch, Professor of Experimental Medicine and Integrative Biology at the University of Southampton.</p>
<p>&#8220;When exposed to sunlight, small amounts of NO are transferred from the skin to the circulation, lowering blood vessel tone; as blood pressure drops, so does the risk of<br />
heart attack and stroke,&#8221; Feelisch said.</p>
<p>While limiting sunlight exposure is important to prevent skin cancer, the authors of the study, including Dr Richard Weller of the University of Edinburgh, suggest that minimising exposure may be disadvantageous by increasing the risk of prevalent conditions related to cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular disease, often associated with high blood pressure, accounts for 30 per cent of deaths globally each year.</p>
<p>Blood pressure and cardiovascular disease are known to vary according to season and latitude, with higher levels observed in winter and in countries further from the equator, where ultraviolet radiation from the Sun is lower.</p>
<p>During the study, the skin of 24 healthy individuals was exposed to ultraviolet (UVA) light from tanning lamps for two sessions of 20 minutes each.</p>
<p>In one session, the volunteers were exposed to both the UVA rays and the heat of the lamps. In another, the UV rays were blocked so that only the heat of the lamps affected the skin.</p>
<p>The results suggested that UVA exposure dilates blood vessels, significantly lowers blood pressure, and alters NO metabolite levels in the circulation, without changing vitamin D levels.</p>
<p>Further experiments indicated that pre-formed stores of NO in the upper skin layers are involved in mediating these effects.</p>
<p>The data are consistent with the seasonal variation of blood pressure and cardiovascular risk at temperate latitudes, researchers said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1965231&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a broad review of scientific literature, the US’s top doctor has concluded that cigarette smoking — long known to cause lung cancer and heart disease — also causes diabetes, colorectal and liver cancers, erectile dysfunction and ectopic pregnancy.<br />
In a report, the acting surgeon general, Dr Boris D Lushniak, significantly expanded the list of illnesses that cigarette smoking has been scientifically proved to cause.<br />
The other health problems the report names are vision loss, tuberculosis, rheumatoid arthritis, impaired immune function and cleft palates in children of women who smoke.<br />
Smoking has been known to be associated with these illnesses, but the report was the first time the federal government concluded that smoking causes them.<br />
The finding does not mean that smoking causes all cases of the health problems and diseases listed in the report, but that some of the cases would not have happened without smoking. The surgeon general has added to the list of smoking-related diseases before. Bladder cancer was added in 1990 and cervical cancer in 2004.<br />
The report is not legally binding, but is broadly held as a standard for scientific evidence among researchers and policy makers.<br />
“I thought the science was very well done and up to date,” said Dr Robert Wallace, a professor of epidemiology and internal medicine at the University of Iowa, who helped review the report.<br />
The report comes 50 years after the pivotal 1964 surgeon general’s report in which the government concluded for the first time that smoking caused lung cancer. That report was credited with starting to change public attitudes toward smoking, which has declined sharply. In 1965, about 43 per cent of adults were smokers; in 2012, about 18 per cent were.<br />
But that decline has slowed in recent years, and the new report calls for stronger action in combating smoking. The report concluded that the evidence was insufficient to say that smoking caused prostate cancer. The evidence was suggestive, but not definite, that smoking causes breast cancer.<br />
While smoking causes most cases of lung cancer, it causes only a small fraction of liver and colorectal cancers. A current smoker is 25 times as likely to develop lung cancer as someone who has never smoked, but only about 1.5 times as likely to develop liver cancer.<br />
“It is a fairly modest association, but because so many people smoke, it’s still an important cause of these cancers,” said Neal Freedman, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute.<br />
He pointed out that the surgeon general last looked at the effect of smoking on liver cancer in 2004, and found the evidence only suggestive. Since then, 90 new studies have been published allowing the surgeon general to conclude smoking is a cause.<br />
The report also finds that the risks of lung cancer are far higher today than in past decades, even though smokers today consume fewer cigarettes. In 1959, women who smoked were 2.7 times as likely as women who never smoked to develop lung cancer, and by 2010, the additional risk had jumped nearly tenfold. For men, the risk doubled over the same period. The report said changes in cigarettes’ design, namely to the filter, contributed to the increased deadliness.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1964218&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heavy Americans who drink diet beverages rather than those sweetened with sugar appear to eat more, according to a study released on Thursday that raised questions about the role lower-calorie drinks play in helping people lose weight.<br />
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University analysed data from a US survey of 24,000 people over a period of 10 years. People who were overweight or obese generally consumed the same amount of calories a day no matter what they drank, but those who chose diet drinks got more of those calories from food.<br />
Outside experts were quick to caution that it is not clear what role, if any, diet drinks such as low- or no-calorie versions of sodas, sports drinks and teas played for people who ate more.<br />
In the study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, overweight drinkers of diet beverages in the United States ate 1,965 in food calories a day compared to 1,874 calories among heavy people who drank regular sugar-sweetened beverages.<br />
Among obese diet beverage drinkers, those who consumed low- or no-calorie drinks ate 2,058 calories a day in food versus 1,897 food calories for those who had regular drinks, researchers said.<br />
Such differences were statistically significant, they added. Lead author Sara Bleich said the results, when paired with other research, suggest that artificial sweeteners may affect people’s metabolism or cravings, although more study is needed.<br />
She acknowledged that people could be deciding to eat more since they are saving calories with their diet drinks.<br />
“The push to diet soda may not make a lot of sense if you are then also eating more solid food,” Bleich said. “The switch from a sugary beverage to a diet beverage should be coupled with other changes in the diet, particularly reducing snacks.”<br />
Critics said the analysis, based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination survey between 1999 and 2010, is flawed and that it is too early to say what, if any, role the low-calorie drinks or their artificial sweeteners play in weight loss.<br />
Several researchers noted that the study did not track a set group of people over time and only looked at a 24-hour snapshot of what any individual consumed.<br />
The beverage industry, which has long promoted diet drinks as an alternative to full-calorie beverages, defended such alternatives to help manage weight.<br />
“Losing or maintaining weight comes down to balancing the total calories consumed with those burned through physical activity,” the American Beverage Association said in a statement on Thursday.<br />
Low- or no-calories drinks contain artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and sucralose. Many beverage companies are also turning to other alternatives, such as the extract of Stevia.<br />
Kelly Brownell, a professor psychology and neuroscience at Duke University and dean of its Sanford School of Public Policy, said while the study was compelling and there are still many questions about such sweeteners, more data is needed.<br />
“People need to separate the biology from the psychology,” he said.<br />
Bonnie Liebman, the director of nutrition at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said while her group may have other questions about artificial sweeteners, “it’s premature to conclude that it’s something going on in your brain.”<br />
In the meantime there are other ways to watch your weight, she said: “You’re much better off with water — or coffee or tea, if they’re unsweetened.”<br />

high incidence of breathing problems and running-related injuries.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1964207&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/run-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1964211" alt=" The ultra-runners had a low, although not non-existent, incidence of high blood pressure and irregular heartbeats. (NYT)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/run-m.jpg" /></a> The ultra-runners had a low, although not non-existent, incidence of high blood pressure and irregular heartbeats. (NYT)
<p>Ultra-runners are different from you and me. They run more. But a new study of these racers, who compete in events longer than marathons, joins other recent science in finding that they also tend to be older and have some different health concerns than most of us might expect, suggesting that some beliefs about how much activity the human body can manage, especially in middle age, may be too narrow.<br />
In recent years, the health effects of increasing inactivity have received plenty of scientific and media scrutiny. But the potential health effects of relatively gargantuan levels of physical activity have received less attention, and much of the science that does exist focuses on the potential dangers of over-exercise for the heart. Few studies have examined the more general health implications — the benefits as well as the risks — of training for and running more miles in a day than many of us complete in a month.<br />
Hoping to better understand what happens to an ultra-endurance athlete’s body, researchers at Stanford University and the University of California, Davis recently contacted more than 1,200 experienced ultra-marathon runners and asked them probing and almost impolite questions about the past and current states of their bones, hearts, blood pressures, prostates, breasts, skin, lungs, moods, bowels, eyes, waistlines, livers and many other body parts and systems. They also asked about their race histories, times, training regimens and any recent injuries and illnesses.<br />
Then they compared the ultra-runners’ aggregate answers with comparable health statistics for average, more sedentary adults, while also comparing the training and injury-related data with similar information about recreational runners, like myself, who are not running 50- or 100-mile races on the weekend.<br />
The results, which were published last week in PLoS One, were telling. The ultra-runners had a low, although not non-existent, incidence of high blood pressure and irregular heartbeats, with about 7.5 per cent of the runners reporting one of those problems. But less than 1 per cent had been diagnosed with heart disease or had a past stroke, and few had experienced cancer, with basal cell skin carcinoma being the most common malignancy, occurring in 1.6 percent of the runners.<br />
On a less salutary note, the runners did report a high incidence of breathing problems, with almost a third of the group telling researchers that they experienced either allergies or asthma, often after running. That finding, while worrying, makes sense, the researchers note, since ultra-long-distance runners spend many hours outside, striding along trails strewn with pollen-slinging trees and flowers, priming their respiratory systems for allergies and asthma.<br />
They also tend to get hurt, as runners at all mileage levels do. More than half said they had experienced a running-related injury in the past year that had been severe enough to keep them from training for at least a few days, about the same percentage as often is reported by recreational runners. Many of the injuries were knee problems or stress fractures, along with a few, unexpected concussions.<br />
Interestingly, injuries were most common among younger, inexperienced ultra-runners, and in particular among men not yet aged 40 who trained fast and intensely. Ultra-runners past age 40 whose training pace was more plodding were far less likely to be sidelined with injuries.<br />
There can be substantial, accruing benefits to covering those miles, says Dr Eswar Krishnan, an assistant professor at Stanford and co-author of the new study. Over all, the ultra-runners in the study were absent from work less often than other American adults because of illness or injury, he said, and rarely felt compelled to see a physician, with almost half visiting a doctor only once in the past year, usually because of a running injury.<br />
Of course, the ultra-competitors may have “developed stoicism” from their many hours of training, Dr Krishnan said, and ignored niggling ills that would keep the rest of us from work or send us hurrying to the doctor. But they also displayed a substantially reduced risk of developing many of the common diseases of modern life.     NYT</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1964207&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/foodm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1962835" alt="Researchers say children who rely on fast foods may tend to have parents who do not have the means, desire or time to purchase or prepare healthy foods at home." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/foodm.jpg" /></a> Researchers say children who rely on fast foods may tend to have parents who do not have the means, desire or time to purchase or prepare healthy foods at home.
<p>Fast food is not the main culprit behind rising childhood obesity rates, a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>While rising fast-food consumption has been considered the major factor causing rapid increases in childhood obesity for years, researchers said fast-food consumption is simply a byproduct of a much bigger problem: poor all-day-long dietary habits that originate in children&#8217;s homes.</p>
<p>Researchers at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found that children&#8217;s consumption of fast food is only a small part of a much more pervasive dietary pattern that is fostered at an early age by children&#8217;s parents and caregivers.</p>
<p>The pattern includes few fruits and vegetables, relying instead on high amounts of processed food and sugar-sweetened beverages. These food choices also are reinforced in the meals students are offered at school.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is really what is driving children&#8217;s obesity,&#8221; said Barry Popkin at UNC&#8217;s Gillings School of Global Public Health, whose team led the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eating fast foods is just one behaviour that results from those bad habits. Just because children who eat more fast food are the most likely to become obese does not prove that calories from fast foods bear the brunt of the blame,&#8221; Popkin said.</p>
<p>The study examined data acquired through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2007 and 2010.</p>
<p>Dietary intake, including whether foods and beverages were obtained in fast-food establishments or elsewhere, was evaluated in 4,466 children who were 2 years to 18 years of age.</p>
<p>They were further categorised as being nonconsumers of fast food (50 per cent of the children), low consumers (less than or equal to 30 per cent of calories from fast foods; 40 per cent of the children), or high consumers (more than 30 per cent of calories from fast foods; 10 per cent of the children).</p>
<p>The researchers then determined which factors were most related to dietary adequacy and risk for obesity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The study presented strong evidence that the children&#8217;s diet beyond fast-food consumption is more strongly linked to poor nutrition and obesity,&#8221; said Jennifer Poti, doctoral candidate in UNC&#8217;s Department of Nutrition and co-author of the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;While reducing fast-food intake is important, the rest of a child&#8217;s diet should not be overlooked,&#8221; Poti said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Children who rely on fast foods may tend to have parents who do not have the means, desire or time to purchase or prepare healthy foods at home,&#8221; Popkin said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is really what is driving children&#8217;s obesity and what needs to be addressed in any solution,&#8221; Popkin said.</p>
<p>The study was published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1962823&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/cancer-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1958776" alt="Researchers believe that molecules associated with the presence of disease, called biomarkers, can affect the thermogram of someone with cervical disease." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/cancer-med.jpg" /></a> Researchers believe that molecules associated with the presence of disease, called biomarkers, can affect the thermogram of someone with cervical disease.
<p>Scientists have found that using the heat profile from a person&#8217;s blood, called plasma thermogram, can indicate the presence or absence of cervical cancer and also predict the stage of the disease.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Louisville led by Nichola Garbett demonstrated that the plasma thermogram profile varies when a person has or does not have cervical cancer.</p>
<p>To generate a plasma thermogram, a blood plasma sample is &#8220;melted&#8221; producing a unique signature indicating a person&#8217;s health status.</p>
<p>This signature represents the major proteins in blood plasma, measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC).</p>
<p>Researchers believe that molecules associated with the presence of disease, called biomarkers, can affect the thermogram of someone with cervical disease.</p>
<p>They used mass spectrometry to show that biomarkers associated with cervical cancer existed in the plasma.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key is not the actual melting temperature of the thermogram, but the shape of the heat profile,&#8221; Garbett said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been able to establish thermograms for a number of diseases. Comparing blood samples of patients who are being screened or treated against those thermograms should enable us to better monitor patients as they are undergoing treatment and follow-up,&#8221; Garbett said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1958774&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What should I eat?”</p>
<p>While the matter is easier to settle on a daily basis, the real trouble occurs when we step out of home and are away from our carefully-constructed dietary plans. The problem is compounded in a country like ours, where cuisine is as diverse as culture.</p>
<p>Dietary guidelines do vary, of course, depending on health conditions, nature of travel and other criteria. But consult any nutritionist, dietary expert or doctor, and the advice you will get — adequate hydration and snacking healthy.</p>
<p>Swati Kumar Dwivedi, a senior dietician at Max Hospital, Saket, Delhi said, “Keeping oneself adequately hydrated is of utmost importance, but not with beverages or aerated drinks. Stick to water as much as possible. Coconut water is a good alternative. Even juices are not recommended.”</p>
<p>The other benefit of keeping oneself hydrated, according to Dr Ruchi Verma, in-charge of preventive health care programme at Max Hospital, is that it creates a feeling of fullness and helps us avoid junk food.</p>
<p>When it comes to snacking, several recent studies have been found to be leaning towards nuts.</p>
<p><em>A New York Times</em> article titled ‘Snacking your way to better health’, dated December 9, quoted several recent studies that found nuts (all kinds) to be one of the healthiest snacks. The article said those who ate nuts regularly tended to be leaner, simply because nuts were replacing other high-calorie snacks such as chips, cookies and candy.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/capture.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1958894" alt="Capture" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/capture.jpg?w=480&#038;h=534" width="480" height="534" /></a></p>
<p>Another snack option is dry fruits. Carrying small pouches of dry fruits, possibly mixed with nuts, is highly recommended. If the trip is short, or if you have a portable cooler, experts suggest carrying fresh fruits and vegetables. Homemade sandwiches with whole grain bread and peanut butter are an equally good option.</p>
<p>Once your snacks are taken care of, monitoring the rest of the meals is pretty easy. Grilled over fried, baked over grilled, salads over burgers, whole wheat bread over white bread, oats over muffins, boiled eggs over omelette is common knowledge.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the hospitality and travel industries too have evolved with people’s increasing awareness regarding health. As a result, there is always a healthier, low-calorie option available. Arijit Basu, chief general manager (Delhi), State Bank of India, agrees. He travels for work at least six or seven times a month, most of them being two-day trips.</p>
<p>“Wherever I travel, meals are usually laid out in a buffet. And there, one always has the option to pick a soup or a salad over the high-calorie options. So if you are eating unhealthy, it is not because you don’t have an option,” he says.</p>
<p>Most airlines too have begun to offer a variety of menu options catering to specific needs of fliers.</p>
<p>Jet Airways, which is one of the few airlines in the country that still has an in-house catering department, offers at least 20 varieties of ‘special’ meals, which cater to the different medical and religious requirements of passengers. The medical ‘special meals’ include low-fat, low-salt, low-calorie, low-purine, non-lacto and gluten-free meals.</p>
<p>“Our research has shown that first-time passengers and those who travel occasionally want to enjoy every aspect of the flight, especially the food served. Alternatively, the profiles of frequent travellers, such as senior corporate executives and entrepreneurs, are more health conscious, often pre-ordering a healthy or low-calorie option. Our pre-ordered meals also include fresh fruits, whole wheat breads, cereals and yogurt,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The thumb-rule is to pick complex carbohydrates over simple carbohydrates. This is because complex carbs are rich in nutrients, as opposed to the simple carbs which are essentially refined sugars with very little nutritional value. Also the complex carbs take some time to digest, thus ensuring that they don’t raise sugar levels in the body as quickly as simple carbs do.</p>
<p>Foods rich in complex carbs include whole-meal bread, cereals, vegetables such as spinach, yams, broccoli, beans, zucchini. Lentils, skimmed milk, whole grains and many other leguminous plants and vegetables also contain complex carbs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1958288&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The finding, made by British and Swedish scientists, could pave the way for the development of a new treatment for the estimated 450,000 people worldwide who have multi drug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB.</p>
<p>In a study in The Lancet medical journal on Thursday, researchers said more than half of 30 drug-resistant TB patients treated with a transfusion of their own bone marrow stem cells were cured of the disease after six months. &#8220;The results &#8230; show that the current challenges and difficulties of treating MDR-TB are not insurmountable, and they bring a unique opportunity with a fresh solution to treat hundreds of thousands of people who die unnecessarily,&#8221; said TB expert Alimuddin Zumla at University College London, who co-led the study.</p>
<p>TB, which infects the lungs and can spread from one person to another through coughing and sneezing, is often falsely thought of as a disease of the past. In recent years, drug-resistant strains of the disease have spread around the world, batting off standard antibiotic drug treatments.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that in Eastern Europe, Asia and South Africa 450,000 people have MDR-TB, and around half of these will fail to respond to existing treatments. TB bacteria trigger an inflammatory response in immune cells and surrounding lung tissue that can cause immune dysfunction and tissue damage.</p>
<p>Bone-marrow stem cells are known to migrate to areas of lung injury and inflammation and repair damaged tissue. Since they also modify the body&#8217;s immune response and could boost the clearance of TB bacteria, Zumla and his colleague, Markus Maeurer from Stockholm&#8217;s Karolinska University Hospital, wanted to test them in patients with the disease.</p>
<p>In a phase 1 trial, 30 patients with either MDR or XDR TB aged between 21 and 65 who were receiving standard TB antibiotic treatment were also given an infusion of around 10 million of their own stem cells. The cells were obtained from the patient&#8217;s own bone marrow, then grown into large numbers in the laboratory before being re-transfused into the same patient, the researchers explained.</p>
<p>During six months of follow-up, the researchers found that the infusion treatment was generally safe and well tolerated, with no serious side effects recorded. The most common non-serious side effects were high cholesterol levels, nausea, low white blood cell counts and diarrhoea. Although a phase 1 trial is primarily designed only to test a treatment&#8217;s safety, the scientists said further analyses of the results showed that 16 patients treated with stem cells were deemed cured at 18 months compared with only five of 30 TB patients not treated with stem cells.</p>
<p>Maeurer stressed that further trials with more patients and longer follow-up were needed to better establish how safe and effective the stem cell treatment was. But if future tests were successful, he said, it could become a viable extra new treatment for patients with MDR-TB who do not respond to conventional drug treatment or those with severe lung damage.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1957343&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/walnuts-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1957348" alt="In addition to the effect of nuts on MetS, the researchers also looked at the effect on obesity. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/walnuts-med.jpg" /></a> In addition to the effect of nuts on MetS, the researchers also looked at the effect on obesity.
<p lang="en-US">High consumption of tree nuts such as almonds, cashews and walnuts may significantly lower obesity risk, a new study has found.</p>
<p lang="en-US">The study looks at the association between tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamias, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts), metabolic syndrome (MetS) and obesity in a population with a wide range of nut intake ranging from never to daily.</p>
<p lang="en-US">Researchers at Loma Linda University studied 803 adults using a validated food frequency questionnaire and assessed both tree nut and peanut intake together and separately.</p>
<p lang="en-US">Mean tree nut intake was 16 grams/day among the high tree nut consumers and 5 grams/day among low tree nut consumers.</p>
<p lang="en-US">In addition to the effect of nuts on MetS, the researchers also looked at the effect on obesity.</p>
<p lang="en-US">&#8220;We found that high tree nut consumers had significantly lower prevalence of obesity compared to the low tree nut consumers,&#8221; said said lead researcher Karen Jaceldo-Siegl.</p>
<p lang="en-US">&#8220;And, high consumers of tree nuts had the lowest prevalence of obesity when compared to the low peanut/tree nut groups,&#8221; Jaceldo-Siegl said.</p>
<p lang="en-US">&#8220;Our results showed that one serving (28g or 1 ounce) of tree nuts per week was significantly associated with 7 per cent less MetS,&#8221; said Jaceldo-Siegl, adding &#8220;doubling this consumption could potentially reduce MetS risk by 14 per cent.&#8221;</p>
<p lang="en-US">&#8220;Interestingly, while overall nut consumption was associated with lower prevalence of MetS, tree nuts specifically appear to provide beneficial effects on MetS, independent of demographic, lifestyle and other dietary factors,&#8221; Jaceldo-Siegl added.</p>
<p>MetS is a cluster of risk factors shown to be associated with death, a twofold increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and a fivefold increased risk for type 2 <span style="color:#ff0000;">diabetes</span><span style="color:#000000;">.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/untidia-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1957337" alt="FDA approves Farxiga for type 2 diabetes." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/untidia-med.jpg" /></a> FDA approves Farxiga for type 2 diabetes.
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved a new diabetes drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca that uses a novel approach to reduce blood sugar.</p>
<p>Farxiga is a once-a-day tablet designed to help diabetes patients eliminate excess sugar via their urine. That differs from older drugs that decrease the amount of sugar absorbed from food and stored in the liver.</p>
<p>The drug is the second product approved in the U.S. from the new class of medicines known as SGLT2 drugs. In March the FDA approved Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Invokana, which also works by eliminating excess sugar through patients’ urine. The agency cleared Farxiga tablets for patients with type 2 diabetes. The approval marks a comeback for the drug, which was previously rejected last year after studies raised concerns about links to bladder cancer and liver toxicity.</p>
<p>Ten cases of bladder cancer were found in patients taking the drug in clinical trials, so Farxiga’s label warns against using it in patients with the disease. A panel of FDA advisers last month said that the uptick in cancers was likely a statistical fluke, and not related to the drug. But the FDA is requiring Bristol and AstraZeneca to track rates of bladder cancer in patients enrolled in a long-term follow up study. The companies will also monitor rates of heart disease, a frequent safety issue with newer diabetes medications.</p>
<p>The most common side effects associated with Farxiga included fungal and urinary tract infections. The drug can be used as a stand-alone drug or in combination with other common diabetes treatments, such as insulin and metformin. People with type 2 diabetes are unable to properly break down carbohydrates, either because their bodies do not produce enough insulin or have become resistant to the hormone, which controls blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>Diabetics often require multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action to control their blood sugar levels. New York-based Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and London-based AstraZeneca PLC already co-market the diabetes drug Onglyza, which increases insulin production while reducing glucose production.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1957290&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/smoke.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1957334" alt="Smoking Report Research" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/smoke.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a>The proportion of Indian men who smoke every day has fallen from a third to a little over a fifth over the last three decades, but the percentage of women smokers has remained largely unchanged. Given the country’s population, this means in absolute numbers India has more women smokers than in every country except the US.<br />
According to new research by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington, the prevalence of smoking  among Indian men fell from 33.8 per cent in 1980 to 23 per cent in 2012.<br />
Female smoking prevalence in 2012 was 3.2 per cent, virtually the same as in 1980. This worked out to over 12.1 million women in 2012; the number of male smokers, by contrast, was 98 million in that year.<br />
The study, “Smoking Prevalence and Cigarette Consumption in 187 countries, 1980-2012,” will be  published on January 8 in a special ‘tobacco’ issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.<br />
IHME, an independent global health research organisation, arrived at its estimates — covering all ages — on the basis of on a wide range of data sources, including in-country surveys, government statistics, and World Health Organisation data. Previous estimates have typically focused on fewer data sources and a limited age range.<br />
Despite the lowered prevalence among men, smoking leads to nearly a million deaths in India annually. “Smoking rates remain dangerously high for men and there is more work to be done to drive these rates lower,” Dr Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, said.<br />
Speaking from Bangalore, National Cancer Registry Programme director Dr A Nandakumar said the number of women smokers was troubling, and that the new research corroborated the findings of the programme’s report on “Time Trends in Cancer Incidence Rates, 1982-2010”, released recently.<br />
“Annually there is an increase in the incidence of lung cancer among women. For instance, the annual percentage change in the incidence rates of lung cancer is 0.8 per cent in Mumbai, 2.4 per cent in Delhi, 4.1 per cent in Bangalore and 4.9 per cent in Chennai. The age group of women is 35-44 years. In some cities, younger women have taken to smoking in a big way,” Nandakumar said.<br />
Dr Pankaj Chaturvedi of Mumbai’s Tata Memorial Hospital said according to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey of 2010, 35 per cent of Indians above the age of 15 consumed tobacco in some form. Twenty-one per cent chewed tobacco, 6 per cent smoked beedis, 3 per cent smoked cigarettes, and 5 per cent were dual users. Oral cancers, he said, accounted for the highest cancer mortality among men aged 30-69 in India.<br />
IHME director Dr Christopher Murray said, “Despite the tremendous progress made on tobacco control, much more remains to be done.” According to the most recent figures from the Global Burden of Disease study, coordinated by IHME, tobacco use (not including secondhand smoke) led to nearly one million deaths, loss of 6.1 per cent of life years due to premature deaths, and 5.1 per cent of health loss in India.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1956609&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed a new technique to diagnose autism in babies as young as 12 months.</p>
<p>Dr Josephine Barbaro from Australia&#8217;s La Trobe University has developed an accurate set of &#8220;red flag&#8221; markers of the condition,which include a failure by babies to make consistent eye contact,to smile,show their toys to others,to play social games,point and respond when their name is called.</p>
<p>Barbaro is training medical experts around the globe in the use of her diagnostic method on children under two years of age.</p>
<p>&#8220;All typically developing babies are pre-wired to be social,look at other people&#8217;s faces,learn from them and copy what they&#8217;re doing. Children with autism are not doing this -and we can now accurately identify this at a much younger age and take action,&#8221; Barbaro said.</p>
<p>Barbaro and her team are training doctors in Tianjin in China,as part of an Australia-China Science and Research Fund Group Mission.</p>
<p>They have helped to train 300 doctors monitor children&#8217;s development using the early autism identification programme.</p>
<p>Based on these preliminary findings,the Tianjin government has agreed to conduct autism surveillance using Barbaro&#8217;s programme for every child born in the city for the next seven years.</p>
<p>The team is also training healthcare workers in Poland,Korea,Japan and Bangladesh. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1207633&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People infected with the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be at an increased risk of heart disease,a new research has warned.</p>
<p>It is well known that patients with HIV have a high incidence of structural heart disease (mainly diastolic dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension) but the reason is not clear,according to Dr Nieves Montoro from Madrid,Spain.</p>
<p>The new study included 65 HIV patients (63 per cent male,average age 48 years) who had dyspnoea (shortness of breath).</p>
<p>The stage of HIV was determined by measuring the CD4 count and their opportunistic diseases. Also,the viral blood load was determined.</p>
<p>Patients had a transthoracic echocardiogram to assess whether they had structural heart disease (ventricular hypertrophy,systolic or diastolic dysfunction,or pulmonary hypertension).</p>
<p>The following cardiovascular risk factors were assessed: hypertension,diabetes,smoking status,dyslipidemia and renal failure.</p>
<p>Nearly half of patients (47%) had some form of structural heart disease,mainly left ventricular hypertrophy,left ventricular dysfunction,pulmonary hypertension and signs of right ventricle failure.</p>
<p>Patients with a positive blood viral load had a significantly higher incidence of structural heart disease than those with an undetectable load,independent of their cardiovascular risk profile or type of antiretroviral therapy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that half of HIV patients with dyspnea had echocardiographic evidence of structural heart disease. Our most interesting finding was that patients with a positive blood viral load had a significantly higher incidence of structural heart disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact,having a detectable blood viral load nearly doubled the prevalence of heart disease,suggesting that HIV itself might be an independent causal agent,&#8221; Montoro said.</p>
<p>The amount of structural heart disease was not affected by whether or not the patient had AIDS,their gender,age,or presence of cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our study shows an association between the presence of the virus in the blood and cardiac disease. These findings open the door to the hypothesis that HIV is involved in the aetiology of cardiac damage,&#8221; Montoro said.</p>
<p>Our findings show that having any detectable level of virus in the blood nearly doubles the risk of heart disease,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The study was presented at the annual meeting of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) in Istanbul,Turkey.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1206856&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 1st Indian Cancer Congress (ICC),which was held in New Delhi recently,discussed the need for changing the narcotic regulations in India,which is preventing easy access to pain relieving medications to thousands of cancer patients.</p>
<p>The Indian Cancer Congress and the Indian Association of Palliative Care felt strongly about the NDPS Act Bill (Amendment),which is waiting for the clearance from Parliament. It urged all political parties to help pass the bill,which addresses the unresolved issue of poor access to medications to treat cancer pain.</p>
<p>India is one of the largest producers of morphine in the world. But the big irony is that the country exports the medicine to other parts of the world,especially the developed countries for the benefit of patients there,but availability to patients here is restricted.</p>
<p>As per the national policy on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances released on February 6,2012,the medical use of morphine has been extremely low,with the result that thousands of patients in India suffer from pain,which can be avoided,says ICC.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1204651&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Federal health regulators are warning the public that certain cardiac defibrillators recalled by Philips Healthcare may fail to deliver a needed shock in an emergency.</p>
<p>Defibrillators are used by emergency responders and others to restore normal heart function in people suffering a heart attack. The FDA says an electrical problem with recalled Philips&#8217; HeartStart devices could cause them to fail to deliver a life-saving shock.</p>
<p>Philips recalled three models of its HeartStart devices in September 2012 due to an internal electrical malfunction. The recall affects about 700,000 defibrillators sold between 2005 and 2012. The recalled HeartStart FRx and HS1 (OnSite and Home) devices include an electrical part called a resistor that could fail when high voltage is applied,and that could prevent the device from delivering the necessary shock. If the resistor fails,the device will emit an audible triple-chirp alert.</p>
<p>Customers who have received the affected devices should contact Philips at 1-800-263-3342 to receive a replacement. Until a replacement is received,the agency does recommend keeping the recalled defibrillators in service because it considers the benefits of attempting to use the device in a cardiac arrest emergency greater than the risk of not attempting to use the defibrillator,said Steve Silverman,director of the Office of Compliance in the FDA&#8217;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health,in a statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>In March the FDA proposed new requirements for companies that manufacture external defibrillators,which are found everywhere from hospitals to schools to airports. The proposed rules would require an FDA review of devices before their launch and are intended to curb years of recalls caused by design and manufacturing flaws.</p>
<p>Philips said Tuesday that it has not received any reports of patient harm due to this recall and has been working closely with regulatory authorities and with customers to address this issue.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1203061&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probiotics &#8211; live bacteria that help maintain a healthy digestive system &#8211; could help boost a person&#8217;s mood and prevent depression,according to new research.</p>
<p>Timothy Dinan and his colleagues from University College Cork in Ireland,define a psychobiotic as &#8220;a live organism that,when ingested in adequate amounts,produces a health benefit in patients suffering from psychiatric illness.&#8221;</p>
<p>They reviewed the evidence that these bacteria,when ingested in adequate amounts,offer enormous potential for the treatment of depression and other stress-related disorders.</p>
<p>The gut microbiota,which contains approximately one kg of bacteria,can be modulated by diet and many other factors. It is not static and can change from day to day,starting at birth.</p>
<p>Early life stress,such as maternal separation,is known to induce long-term changes in the microbiome. Dinan and his colleagues review one study that assessed the potential benefits of a specific probiotic,B infantis,in rats displaying depressive behaviour due to maternal separation.</p>
<p>The probiotic treatment normalised both their behaviour and their previously-abnormal immune response.</p>
<p>This preclinical study and others like it strongly support the hypothesis that probiotics have the potential to exert behavioural and immunological effects.</p>
<p>Some psychobiotics have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. This is important because depression and stress are both associated with inflammation in the body.</p>
<p>&#8220;The intestinal microbial balance may alter the regulation of inflammatory responses and in so doing,may be involved in the modulation of mood and behaviour,&#8221;the authors said.</p>
<p>In one human study,healthy volunteers received either a probiotic combination (L helveticus R0052 and B longum) or placebo for 30 days.</p>
<p>Those who received the probiotics reported lower stress levels. In a separate study,volunteers who consumed a yogurt containing probiotics reported improved mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is clear at this point is that,of the large number of putative probiotics,only a small percentage have an impact on behaviour and may qualify as psychobiotics,&#8221; said Dinan.</p>
<p>The review article appeared in the journal Biological Psychiatry published by Elsevier.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1195341&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Singing songs from hit musicals such as &#8216;The Sound of Music&#8217; can boost the brain function of people suffering from Alzheimer&#8217;s disease,new research claims.</p>
<p>Positive cognitive changes in healthy elderly and dementia populations exposed to singing may lead to cognitive improvement over time,researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Musical aptitude and music appreciation are two of the last remaining abilities in patients with Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease,&#8221; lead author Linda Maguire wrote in an abstract explaining the study.</p>
<p>Longitudinal studies in the field of vocal music and cognition in the elderly are rare,according to a study presented at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting in San Diego.</p>
<p>The purpose of the study by researchers from George Mason University in Virginia was to examine cognitive changes in vocal-music participants before and after a 4-month series of music programming.</p>
<p>Singing and listening groups were given 50-minute vocal-music sessions thrice per week at an East Coast Elder-care facility that housed Secure-ward (dementia) residents.</p>
<p>The study was conducted at a care home in the east coast of America.</p>
<p>Half of the 18 dementia patients involved were invited to take part in the sessions per week for four months,performing familiar songs from The Sound of Music,Oklahoma,The Wizard of Oz and Pinocchio,while the other half only listened.</p>
<p>Patients who joined in the singing improved their scores in cognitive tests,with scans revealing that singing sparked activity in several regions of their brain,&#8217;The Telegraph&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>They also performed better at a task which required them to draw the hands onto a clock face to represent a designated time.</p>
<p>These data show that participation in an active singing programme for an extended period of time can improve cognition in patients with moderate to severe dementia. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1194856&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intense musical training triggers new processes within the brain which can impact creativity,cognition and learning,new research has found. </p>
<p>The studies show that extensive musical training affects the structure and function of different brain regions,how those regions communicate during the creation of music,and how the brain interprets and integrates sensory information.</p>
<p>The findings,presented at Neuroscience 2013,the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience,in US,suggest potential new roles for musical training including fostering plasticity in the brain,an alternative tool in education,and treating a range of learning disabilities.</p>
<p>According to one study,long-term high level musical training has a broader impact than previously thought. </p>
<p>Researchers found that musicians have an enhanced ability to integrate sensory information from hearing,touch,and sight.</p>
<p>Another study found that the age at which musical training begins affects brain anatomy as an adult; beginning training before the age of seven has the greatest impact.</p>
<p>In a third study,researchers found that brain circuits involved in musical improvisation are shaped by systematic training,leading to less reliance on working memory and more extensive connectivity within the brain.</p>
<p>Some of the brain changes that occur with musical training reflect the automation of task and the acquisition of highly specific sensorimotor and cognitive skills required for various aspects of musical expertise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Playing a musical instrument is a multisensory and motor experience that creates emotions and motions from finger tapping to dancing and engages pleasure and reward systems in the brain. It has the potential to change brain function and structure when done over a long period of time,&#8221; said Gottfried Schlaug,of Harvard Medical School/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center,an expert on music,neuroimaging and brain plasticity.</p>
<p>&#8220;As today&#8217;s findings show,intense musical training generates new processes within the brain,at different stages of life,and with a range of impacts on creativity,cognition,and learning,&#8221; said Schlaug.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1194417&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High levels of stress can block memory processes,according to new research on pond snails.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Exeter and the University of Calgary trained snails and found that when they were exposed to multiple stressful events they were unable to remember what they had learned.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that stress also affects human ability to remember.</p>
<p>The new study,published in the journal PLOS ONE,found that experiencing multiple stressful events simultaneously has a cumulative detrimental effect on memory.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really important to study how different forms of stress interact as this is what animals,including people,frequently experience in real life,&#8221; said Dr Sarah Dalesman,a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellow,from the University of Exeter,formally at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>&#8220;By training snails,and then observing their behaviour and brain activity following exposure to stressful situations,we found that a single stressful event resulted in some impairment of memory but multiple stressful events prevented any memories from being formed,&#8221; Dalesman said.</p>
<p>The pond snail,Lymnaea stagnalis,has easily observable behaviours linked to memory and large neurons in the brain,both useful benefits when studying memory processes.</p>
<p>They also respond to stressful events in a similar way to mammals,making them a useful model species to study learning and memory.</p>
<p>In the study,the pond snails were trained to reduce how often they breathed outside water. Usually pond snails breathe underwater and absorb oxygen through their skin.</p>
<p>In water with low oxygen levels the snails emerge and inhale air using a basic lung opened to the air via a breathing hole.</p>
<p>To train the snails not to breathe air they were placed in poorly oxygenated water and their breathing holes were gently poked every time they emerged to breathe.</p>
<p>Snail memory was tested by observing how many times the snails attempted to breathe air after they had received their training.</p>
<p>Memory was considered to be present if there was a reduction in the number of times they opened their breathing holes. The researchers also assessed memory by monitoring neural activity in the brain.</p>
<p>Immediately before training,the snails were exposed to two different stressful experiences,low calcium &#8211; which is stressful as calcium is necessary for healthy shells &#8211; and overcrowding by other pond snails.</p>
<p>When faced with the stressors individually,the pond snails had reduced ability to form long term memory,but were</p>
<p>still able to learn and form short and intermediate term memory lasting from a few minutes to hours.</p>
<p>However,when both stressors were experienced at the same time,results showed that they had additive effects on the snails&#8217; ability to form memory and all learning and memory processes were blocked.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1193962&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Japanese researchers are developing a new car that can not only warn its driver of an impending heart attack,but also predict the ailment in advance.</p>
<p>The car will have two electric poles for electrocardiographic monitoring and sensors mounted in the steering wheel to detect pulse waves created in blood vessels when blood flows from the heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to reduce the number of unfortunate accidents&#8221; by developing the system &#8220;as early as possible,&#8221; said Takao Kato,a professor emeritus at Nippon Medical School,who proposed the project.</p>
<p>As the driver holds the steering wheel,his or her electrocardiograms and pulse waves are continuously recorded.</p>
<p>Data is analysed on a real-time basis and the driver is informed of any dangerous symptoms by voice and on the car navigation system and instructed to pull the vehicle to the side of the road,&#8217;Kyodo&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>Researchers analysed electrocardiograms of 34 people who developed ventricular fibrillations or acute heart attacks while wearing a Holter monitor,which continuously records the heart&#8217;s rhythms.</p>
<p>While 20 of them died as a result,the analysis found that 31 people had shown a common pattern of fluctuations in the autonomic nerves one to two hours before their cardiac troubles.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the pattern can be detected,heart attacks can be anticipated to some extent,&#8221; Kato said.</p>
<p>Kato suggested that the planned system will not only warn drivers of possible cardiac attacks just before they occur but also predict them much in advance.</p>
<p>Clear data on the rhythms can be obtained by improving the circuits of the detector,said Tsuyoshi Nakagawa,a senior engineer at Denso Corporation.</p>
<p>In order to increase accuracy,researchers have added electrodes to the driver&#8217;s seat so that electrocardiograms can be measured even when people drive with only one hand on the wheel.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1193188&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Photo therapy may effectively treat neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s disease,a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Researchers discovered that it is possible to distinguish aggregations of the proteins,believed to cause the diseases,from the the well-functioning proteins in the body by using multi-photon laser technique.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody has talked about using only light to treat these diseases until now. This is a totally new approach and we believe that this might become a breakthrough in the research of diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s,Parkinson&#8217;s and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,&#8221; said Piotr Hanczyc from Chalmers University of Technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have found a totally new way of discovering these structures using just laser light,&#8221; said Hanczyc.</p>
<p>If the protein aggregates are removed,the disease is in principle cured. The problem until now has been to detect and remove the aggregates.</p>
<p>The researchers now harbour high hopes that photo acoustic therapy,which is already used for tomography,may be used to remove the malfunctioning proteins.</p>
<p>Today amyloid protein aggregates are treated with chemicals,both for detection as well as removal. These chemicals are highly toxic and harmful for those treated.</p>
<p>With multi photon laser the chemical treatment would be unnecessary. Nor would surgery be necessary for removing of aggregates.</p>
<p>Due to this discovery it might,thus,be possible to remove the harmful protein without touching the surrounding tissue,researchers said.</p>
<p>These diseases arise when amyloid beta protein are aggregated in large doses so they start to inhibit proper cellular processes.</p>
<p>Different proteins create different kinds of amyloids,but they generally have the same structure. This makes them different from the well-functioning proteins in the body,which can now be shown by multi photon laser technique.</p>
<p>The study at Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden,and the Polish Wroclaw University of Technology,was published in the journal Nature Photonics. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1190805&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moms-to-be who smoke may significantly up their babies&#8217; risk of developing respiratory and other infections,a new study has warned.</p>
<p>Researchers found that infants of mothers who smoked were 50 per cent more likely to be admitted to a hospital or die from any of a wide variety of infectious diseases than babies of mothers who did not smoke.</p>
<p>For the study,researchers reviewed hospitalization records and death certificates of 50,000 infants born in the state of Washington between 1987 and 2004.</p>
<p>The case-control study assessed infant hospitalizations and deaths due to respiratory and non-respiratory infectious disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve known for a long time that babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy are at high risk for serious medical problems relating to low birth weight,premature delivery and poor lung development,&#8221; said Abigail Halperin,lead author of the study published in journal Pediatric Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;While respiratory infections have been recognized as a common cause of these sometimes life-threatening illnesses,this study shows that babies exposed to smoke in utero also</p>
<p>have increased risk for hospitalization and death from a much broader range of infections &#8211; both respiratory and non respiratory &#8211; than we knew before,&#8221; Halperin said.</p>
<p>The findings were largely independent of birth weight and gestational age,&#8221;thus even full-term babies with normal weight are at increased risk for hospitalization or death from multiple types of infections if their mother smoked,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The results suggest that exposure to smoke during pregnancy harms infants&#8217; immune responses more generally,not just within the respiratory system,she said.</p>
<p>The study also found that when mothers cut back on their cigarette smoking or quit part way through their pregnancy,it seems to lower their child&#8217;s risk of infection.</p>
<p>The study will be presented this week at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) National Conference and Exhibition in Orlando. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1185755&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have for the first time identified a protein in breast milk that neutralises HIV and may protect babies from acquiring the virus from their infected mothers.</p>
<p>The protein,called Tenascin-C or TNC,had previously been recognised as playing a role in wound healing,but had not been known to have antimicrobial properties. The discovery could lead to potential new HIV-prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Researchers at Duke University Medical Center found the TNC protein in breast milk binds to and neutralises the HIV virus,protecting exposed infants who might otherwise become infected from repeated exposures to the virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though we have antiretroviral drugs that can work to prevent mother-to-child transmission,not every pregnant woman is being tested for HIV,and less than 60 per cent are receiving the prevention drugs,particularly in countries with few resources,&#8221; said senior study author Sallie Permar,assistant professor of pediatrics,immunology and molecular genetics and microbiology at Duke.</p>
<p>&#8220;So there is still a need for alternative strategies to prevent mother-to-child transmission,which is why this work is important,&#8221; Permar said.</p>
<p>In their study,the Duke team screened mature milk samples from uninfected women for neutralising activity against a panel of HIV strains,confirming that all of the detectable HIV-neutralisation activity was contained in the high molecular weight portion.</p>
<p>Using a multi-step protein separation process,the researchers narrowed the detectable HIV-neutralisation activity to a single protein,and identified it as TNC.</p>
<p>&#8220;TNC is a component of the extracellular matrix that is integral to how tissues hold themselves together,&#8221; Permar said,noting that co-author Harold Erickson,professor of cell biology at Duke,was among the first to identify and describe TNC in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Researchers found the protein is uniquely effective in capturing virus particles and neutralises the virus,specifically binding to the HIV envelope.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s likely that TNC is acting in concert with other anti-HIV factors in breast milk,and further research should explore this,&#8221; Permar said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But given TNC&#8217;s broad-spectrum HIV-1-binding and neutralising activity,it could be developed as an HIV-prevention therapy,given orally to infants prior to breastfeeding,similar to the way oral rehydration salts are routinely administered to infants in developing regions,&#8221; Permar said.</p>
<p>Permar said TNC would also be inherently safe,since it is a naturally occurring component of breast milk,and it may avoid the problem of HIV resistance to antiretroviral regimens that complicate maternal/infant applications.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1185714&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed an implantable gel that contains genetically modified light-sensitive cells and it can be used to treat diabetes.</p>
<p>Myunghwan Choi of Harvard Medical School in Boston and colleagues designed an implantable gel that guided light under a mouse&#8217;s skin in experiments.</p>
<p>To control diabetes,the team shone light into the mouse and at the implanted gel using a fibre optic cable attached to its head.</p>
<p>The light triggered cells in the gel to produce a compound that stimulated the secretion of insulin and stabilised blood glucose levels,&#8217;New Scientist&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The team also showed they could monitor for cadmium poisoning using cells that fluoresced when the mouse was under stress from the toxin.</p>
<p>The gel is in the prototype stage but Choi&#8217;s team is already planning to make it more user-friendly.</p>
<p>For example,he said,we are thinking of adding a micro-LED with a wireless power receiver [to the gel implant.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1185352&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In its latest advisory on health risks associated with mobile phones and their base stations,both the World Health Organization (WHO) and a French government expert group, ANSES (Agence Nationale De Securite Sanitaire &#8211; French Organization for Food,Environmental and Occupational Health &amp; Safety),said that there is no health hazard from mobile phone emissions. </p>
<p>The WHO in its advisory has said; Studies to date provide no indication that environmental exposure to RF (radio frequency) fields,such as from base stations,increases the risk of cancer or any other disease. Scientists have reported other health effects of using mobile phones including changes in brain activity,reaction times,and sleep patterns. These effects are minor and have no apparent health significance.</p>
<p>Because exposure to the radio frequency fields emitted by mobile phones is generally more than a 1000 times higher than from base stations,and the greater likelihood of any adverse effect being due to handsets,research has almost exclusively been conducted on possible effects of mobile phone exposure. In particular,with the recent popularity of mobile phone use among younger people,and therefore a potentially longer lifetime of exposure,WHO has promoted further research on this group and is currently assessing the health impact of RF fields on all studied endpoints, the WHO said.</p>
<p>In another related development the French government agency ANSES,in its recommendation said,Biological effects corresponding to generally reversible changes in the inner functioning of the body can thus be observed,as is also found in the case of exposure to different stimuli of everyday life.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;However,the agency&#8217;s experts were unable to establish any causal link between the biological effects described in cell models,animals or humans,and any possible resulting health effects. Given this evidence,proposing new exposure limits for the general population on health grounds does not seem justified, it said.</p>
<p>It is heartening that the recent WHO advisory continues to validate the COAIs consistent stand that there is no empirical evidence to indicate exposure to electromagnetic fields causes higher risk of cancer and other diseases, said Rajan S Mathews,Director General,Cellular Operators Association of India. </p>
<p>Indias mobile industry complies and conforms to norms mandated by the Department of Telecom (DoT) ,which lowered by 90% the norms mandated by international regulatory bodies such as the WHO and the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1184610&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early humans were using toothpicks almost 1.8 million years ago,scientists have discovered.</p>
<p>Researchers studied hominid jaws from the Dmanisi Republic of Georgia &#8211; the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa.</p>
<p>They found evidence of gum disease caused by repeated use of what must have been a basic toothpick.</p>
<p>The findings shed light on why the Georgian hominid mandibles,or jaws varied widely in shape from each other.</p>
<p>Ani Margvelashvili,lead author of the study at the University of Zurich,Switzerland,said that scientists dealing with fossil hominid mandibles should pay close attention to tooth wear and the fossil individual&#8217;s age.</p>
<p>&#8220;Progressive tooth wear triggers bone remodelling processes that substantially modify the shape of the jaw during an individual&#8217;s lifetime. These effects are typically underestimated when attributing fossil hominid jaws to different species,&#8221; she told &#8216;BBC News&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The individual who was using a toothpick was young,as his or her teeth were not worn down. We also discovered a damaged area between the tooth area and the gum. There was a small cylinder-shaped lesion &#8211; in this area,if you place a toothpick it goes through,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>One of the jaws examined had lost all the teeth except for one canine. The mandibles that showed the least wear were from younger individuals,researchers found.</p>
<p>The study analysed four mandibles from one of the biggest collections of well-preserved early human remnants known anywhere in the world. The Dmanisi site has been valued as an important place to look at how hominids migrated from Africa.</p>
<p>It is not yet known what species the Dmanisi hominids were. They were once believed to be Homo erectus who first ventured out of Africa.</p>
<p>The Dmanisi individuals were short,long-armed and small-brained. The fossils are therefore now sometimes referred to as Homo georgicus.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1182389&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The distress of returning to work after a weekend causes more than 75 per cent of employees to experience &#8216;Sunday night blues&#8217;,a new research has found.</p>
<p>For nearly half of them the angst is so distressing that it makes them want to find a new job.</p>
<p>The research,based on surveys of more than 3,600 employees worldwide,found that Sunday nights are riddled with anxiety for most employees.</p>
<p>Just 22 per cent of those surveyed said they are never nervous about returning to work after a weekend,according to the study by an online job site.</p>
<p>Mary Ellen Slayter,career advice expert for Monster.com,said with Monday morning being notoriously stressful,she doesn&#8217;t think anyone is truly happy to see their weekends come to a close,&#8217;BusinessNewsDaily&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>To reduce Sunday night stress,employees should take time on Friday to make sure they are set up for success the following week,she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spend a few minutes preparing for next week: review and prioritise your calendar,assemble materials you expect to be using and tie up every loose end you can,&#8221; Slater said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1182085&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed a new technology that uses grated carrot to obtain natural compounds which they claim have the potential to prevent cancer,flu,cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative conditions.</p>
<p>Researchers from the FEMSA Center of Biotechnology at Technologic of Monterrey (ITESM) designed the technique,which also allows them to obtain shikimic acid &#8211; a substance which is a raw material used to produce antiviral drugs for influenza.</p>
<p>Currently the production of bioactive compounds in plants is accomplished by genetic engineering; however,this new process employs an alternate technique in which the tissue is stressed by cutting and applying herbicides.</p>
<p>The project,lead by Daniel Alberto Jacobo Velazques,won the National Award in Food Science and Technology (PNCTA) 2012 in the Technology Professional in Food category.</p>
<p>The award has been given and organised for 37 years by the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) and the Mexican Industry of Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Velazques explained that they activate the carrot&#8217;s metabolism using cut stress (grating),and then the carbon flow of its metabolism is modulated by applying an herbicide called glyphosate that inhibits enzymes.</p>
<p>This technique makes it possible to accumulate great amounts of shikimic acid and phenolic compounds in the plant tissue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first four parts of the research have been completed,we have figured out the mechanism by which the carrot produces this compounds when subjected to stress. Now,we look for the optimisation of the production so the plant tissue will secrete more of this compounds,&#8221; Velazques said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afterwards we&#8217;d like to extract them to produce dietary supplements and shikimic acid. The shikimic acid is the raw material that the pharmaceutical industry needs to produce Tamiflu,a useful drug in the treatment against flu,&#8221; Velazques added.</p>
<p>Velazques pointed that currently,shikimic acid is extracted from the Star anise,which is only produced in China; in contrast,the carrot is cultivated in many regions across the planet.</p>
<p>Besides the extraction of the shikimic acid,phenolic compounds are obtained,which help to prevent diseases in humans,mostly because its antioxidant potential that aids in the neutralisation of free radicals in the blood stream,preventing chronic degenerative diseases. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1179481&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dog owners may want to keep their pooch&#8217;s weight in check!</p>
<p>Being overweight shortens a dog&#8217;s life expectancy,a new study has found.</p>
<p>Data on a range of popular dog breeds from across the US showed that dogs that are overweight in middle age have a shorter life expectancy than ideal weight dogs.</p>
<p>Specifically,overweight dogs were found to suffer a reduction in life expectancy of up to ten months compared to ideal weight dogs,researchers said.</p>
<p>Being overweight in middle age can have potentially far-reaching consequences for a dog&#8217;s life span,highlighting the importance of maintaining dogs at a healthy body weight throughout life.</p>
<p>The research examined the impact of body condition score on the life expectancy of a broad range of popular breeds.</p>
<p>We saw that overweight dogs tend to have a shorter life expectancy. This was particularly pronounced in five breeds &#8211; Labrador,Shih Tzu,American Cocker Spaniel,Golden Retriever and Beagle, said lead scientist Carina Salt,from WALTHAM Centre for Pet Nutrition.</p>
<p>This is the first reported research of its kind looking specifically at a large number of pet dogs. The findings therefore provide important insights into the risks of being overweight for dogs in the general population, said Salt.</p>
<p>Being overweight in middle age can have long-term consequences and,depending on breed,mean a reduction in life span of between one and ten months, Salt added.</p>
<p>The research used data on the body condition of male and female neutered dogs aged between 6.5 and 8.5 years from 10 popular breeds.</p>
<p>There were on average 546 dogs per breed and data were collected by veterinarians during consultations across the network of Banfield Pet Hospital locations in the US.</p>
<p>The findings were presented at the WALTHAM International Nutritional Sciences Symposium </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1179441&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eating a good breakfast can help women overcome problems of infertility,a new study has found.</p>
<p>Eating more calories in the morning,rather than evening,can assist in tackling reproductive difficulties,researchers said.</p>
<p>The study by researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University found that a big breakfast increases fertility among women who suffer from menstrual irregularities.</p>
<p>The study examined whether meal times have an impact on the health of woman with menstrual irregularities due to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).</p>
<p>PCOS affects approximately 6-10 per cent of women of reproductive age,disrupting their reproductive abilities.</p>
<p>This syndrome creates a resistance to insulin,leading to an increase in male sex hormones (androgens),and can also cause menstrual irregularities,hair loss on the scalp though increase in body hair,acne,fertility problems and future diabetes.</p>
<p>The experiment was carried out at Wolfson Medical Center on 60 women over a 12-week period. The women,from the ages of 25 to 39,were thin with a BMI (body mass index) of less than 23 and suffered from PCOS.</p>
<p>The women were divided into two groups and were allowed to consume about 1,800 calories a day. The difference between the groups was the timing of their largest meal.</p>
<p>One group consumed their largest meal,approximately 980 calories,at breakfast,while the other at dinner. Researchers wanted to examine whether the schedule of calorie intake affects insulin resistance and the increase in androgens among woman suffering from PCOS.</p>
<p>The findings showed improved results for the group that consumed a big breakfast. Glucose levels and insulin resistance decreased by 8 per cent,while the second group (&#8220;dinner&#8221;) showed no changes.</p>
<p>Another finding showed that among the &#8220;breakfast&#8221; group,testosterone (one of the androgens) levels decreased by nearly 50 per cent,while the &#8220;dinner&#8221; group level stayed neutral.</p>
<p>In addition,there was a much higher rate of ovulating woman within the &#8220;breakfast group&#8221; compared to the &#8220;dinner&#8221; group,showing that eating a hearty breakfast leads to an increase in the level of fertility among woman with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Clinical Science.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1177319&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian scientists are on the verge of creating a new test to help diagnose motor neurone disease.</p>
<p>There is no known cause,or any cure,for the deadly disease. Average live expectancy after diagnosis is just one to five years.</p>
<p>A team at Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide is hopeful to change that,the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported on Monday.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re looking at is a protein that&#8217;s released from nerve cells that are damaged and ends up in urine and blood and we&#8217;ve been able to detect this protein in people with motor neurone disease,researcher Mary-Louise Rogers said.</p>
<p>She said the protein was not found in healthy people and could prove vital in an early diagnosis.</p>
<p>It would also enable doctors to prescribe &#8216;Riluzole&#8217; far sooner,the only medication currently available and able to extend life by a few months.</p>
<p>If we could actually get them earlier then it actually may be more effective,because what happens they often get it when it&#8217;s a little bit too late,Rogers said.</p>
<p>The team is now waiting for a USD 500,000 grant,which will enable further research and start of clinical trials within 18 months.</p>
<p>The team is also working on a new gene therapy treatment,which will better target motor neurons.</p>
<p>Thirty nine year old Joanne Pratt,diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2011,said,I think it&#8217;s hugely advantageous,I mean you can&#8217;t get a diagnosis early enough.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1176318&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new easy-to-use intra-vaginal ring filled with an anti-retroviral drug could be extremely effective at preventing the deadly HIV in women,a new study has found.</p>
<p>The ring is easy to use,long lasting,and recently has demonstrated a 100 per cent success rate protecting primates from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SHIV).</p>
<p>The device will soon undergo its first test in humans,researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;After 10 years of work,we have created an intra-vaginal ring that can prevent against multiple HIV exposures over an extended period of time,with consistent prevention levels throughout the menstrual cycle,&#8221; said Patrick Kiser,an expert in intra-vaginal drug delivery.</p>
<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that antiviral drugs can prevent HIV infection,but existing methods for delivering the drug fall short.</p>
<p>Pills must be taken daily and require high doses; vaginal gels that must be applied prior to each sex act are inconvenient,yielding poor usage rates.</p>
<p>The new ring is easily inserted and stays in place for 30 days. And because it is delivered at the site of transmission,the ring &#8211; known as a TDF-IVR (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate intravaginal ring) &#8211; utilises a smaller dose than pills.</p>
<p>The device contains powdered tenofovir,an anti-retroviral drug that is taken orally by 3.5 million HIV-infected people worldwide,but that has not previously been studied topically,researchers said.</p>
<p>The ring&#8217;s strength stems from its unique polymer construction: its elastomer swells in the presence of fluid,delivering up to 1,000 times more of the drug than current intra-vaginal ring technology,such as NuvaRing,which are made of silicon and have release rates that decline over time.</p>
<p>The upcoming clinical trial,to be conducted in November at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York,will evaluate the ring in 60 women over 14 days.</p>
<p>The trial will assess the ring&#8217;s safety and measure how much of the drug is released and the properties of the ring after use.</p>
<p>Other drugs could potentially be integrated into the ring,such as contraceptives or antiviral drugs to prevent other sexually transmitted infections &#8211; a feature that could increase user rates,said Kiser,who joined Northwestern University from the University of Utah,where the research was conducted.</p>
<p><i>The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).</i></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1175947&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Girls who eat more peanut butter and nuts substantially reduce their risk of breast cancer later in life,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>The study from Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis and Harvard Medical School shows that girls aged 9 to 15 who regularly ate peanut butter or nuts were 39 per cent less likely to develop benign breast disease by age 30.</p>
<p>Benign breast disease,although noncancerous,increases risk of breast cancer later in life,researchers said.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that peanut butter could help reduce the risk of breast cancer in women, said senior author Graham Colditz.</p>
<p>The findings are based on the health histories of 9,039 US girls enrolled in The Growing Up Today Study from 1996 through 2001.</p>
<p>Later,from 2005 through 2010,when the study participants were 18 to 30 years old,they reported whether they had been diagnosed with benign breast disease that had been confirmed by breast biopsy.</p>
<p>The researchers found that participants who ate peanut butter or nuts two times each week were 39 per cent less likely to have developed benign breast disease than those who never ate them.</p>
<p>The study&#8217;s findings suggest that beans,lentils,soybeans and corn also may help prevent benign breast disease,but consumption of these foods was much lower in these girls and thus the evidence was weaker.</p>
<p>Past studies have linked peanut butter,nut and vegetable fat consumption to a lower risk for benign breast disease. However,participants in those studies were asked to recall their high school dietary intakes years later.</p>
<p>This new study is the first to use reports made during adolescence,with continued follow-up as cases of benign breast disease are diagnosed in young women.</p>
<p>Because of the obesity epidemic,Colditz recommended that girls replace high-calorie junk foods and sugary beverages with peanut butter or nuts.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Breast Cancer Research and Treatment. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1175151&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A helmet that fires red lasers into the scalp to treat hair loss has now been launched in the UK.</p>
<p>The helmet,called iGrow Hair Growth System,provides a minimum of 35-40 per cent increase in hair growth,its makers claim.</p>
<p>According to a study,published in the Lasers in Surgery &amp; Medicine journal,the product encourages new,healthy hair while doubling the follicle size of existing hair and slowing down or stopping hair loss.</p>
<p>While the published study was only conducted on men,a similar study on women is due to be published shortly and the early results look &#8220;promising&#8221;,the &#8216;Daily Express&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The helmet works using 51 low-level red laser and LED lights to help re-energise cells in the follicles,called low-level laser therapy (LLLT).</p>
<p>The product developed by Apira Science,Inc looks like an old salon hairdryer,has a built-in headphone base which enables you to connect any music,audio,TV or entertainment device while your hair is growing.</p>
<p>It is to be worn for 25 minutes a time and is recommended for men and women with alopecia or those with baldness in the family.</p>
<p>&#8220;The average person using iGrow will first start to see less hair loss after six to eight weeks,&#8221; said a California-based dermatologist,Dr Lorrie Klein.</p>
<p>&#8220;After a few months their hair should start looking and feeling thicker,healthier and stronger. After nine months they will see the maximum results and continued use with the iGrow will continue these results,&#8221; Klein said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1174647&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s drinking habits could provide hints about their risk of being in a violent relationship,a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Men who regularly drank at parties at their friends&#8217; houses were more likely to be violent toward their partners,researchers found.</p>
<p>On the other hand,women were more violent when their husbands and boyfriends frequently drank at home.</p>
<p>What might explain those patterns still isn&#8217;t clear,lead researcher Christina Mair,of the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health,wrote in an email.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she said,&#8221;men who drink frequently at parties are surrounded by others who share more permissive norms about (intimate partner violence),and they get riled up while at the party,then go home and hit their wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study couldn&#8217;t show whether people were under the influence when they acted violently,however.</p>
<p>Mair and her colleagues interviewed more than 1,500 married or cohabitating opposite-sex couples in California. They asked each partner separately about drinking habits over the previous year and about instances of physical,sexual or psychological harm in the relationship.</p>
<p>About six percent of couples reported male-to-female partner violence and close to 10 percent reported female-to-male violence.</p>
<p>In general,men who drank often were more likely to be violent toward their partners and to be victims of violence. Women who drank large amounts of alcohol in public places were also more likely to be violent.</p>
<p>The results,published in Addiction,are a reanalysis of data released last year by the same group in the Journal of the Study of Alcohol and Drugs.</p>
<p>Each year,millions of Americans are victims of intimate partner violence,or IPV. Women account for about 85 percent of victims,according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p>
<p>&#8220;A great deal of research over the past few decades has established that alcohol use is a contributing cause of intimate partner violence,&#8221; Dominic Parrott,a psychologist at Georgia State University in Atlanta,said.</p>
<p>Kathryn Graham,a senior scientist for the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto,said the new findings are difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an interesting question whether certain drinking contexts have higher risk of IPV over and above how much alcohol is consumed in these contexts,&#8221; she told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>But the data do not indicate how much of the partner violence actually involved drinking,said Graham,who wasn&#8217;t part of the research team.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important to understand that data from this one study probably aren&#8217;t sufficient to change our prevention or treatment efforts to reduce alcohol-related intimate partner violence,&#8221; Parrott,who also wasn&#8217;t involved in the new research,told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>He said if future research replicates these findings,the collective data could be used for prevention.</p>
<p>For example,people who want to drink alcohol could be encouraged to seek out low-risk contexts rather than high-risk contexts,Parrott said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1174024&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Dr Rajeev Virmani</p>
<p>There are countless physical activities out there,but walking is the simplest positive change you can make to effectively improve your health. Walking is simple,free and one of the easiest ways to get more active,lose weight and become healthier. It&#8217;s underrated as a form of exercise but walking is ideal for people of all ages and fitness levels who want to be more active.</p>
<p>Regular walking has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic illnesses,such as heart disease,type 2 diabetes,asthma,stroke and some types of cancers. Your heart is the single most important muscle in your body,but keeping it in shape doesn&#8217;t require a fancy gym membership or hours of gruelling workouts. Adding a few brisk walks into your week is all it takes. Exercise,such as walking,strengthens the muscles of heart and makes it pump more efficiently,delivering more oxygen and nutrients to the other organs. </p>
<p>This is why Max Bupa has taken up the cause of walking and introduced Max Bupa Walk for Health campaign which is aimed at reinforcing the benefits of walking and encouraging people to build more walking into their everyday lives for their overall wellbeing. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no question that walking is great for everyone: It dramatically boosts energy levels,fights fat,and protects your heart. But if you have high blood sugar,or if you have been diagnosed with prediabetes or diabetes,walking can be a lifesaver. There is a strong association between abdominal fat and risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular. Walking shrinks this dangerous abdominal fat and thus cuts down the risk of these grave conditions.</p>
<p>According to a research conducted by Max Bupa,diabetes is the biggest health concern amongst Indians. While 32% respondents perceive diabetes as the top health worry,26% of them cite heart disease as a major health concern followed by stroke at 12%. For both diabetes and heart diseases,walking is the best precaution and cure.</p>
<p>The key is to walk briskly &#8211; 3 to 4 miles per hour &#8212; and for 30-60 minutes at least five days a week. This can cut your risk of heart disease by 40 percent. Walking can also benefit those with a history of heart problems. However,it is important to check with your doctor first before beginning any kind of exercise program. </p>
<p>The easiest way to walk more is to make walking a habit. Think of ways to include walking into your daily routine. If you drive to work,park at the farthest point of the parking lot and walk the difference. If you take the bus,get off one or two stops earlier than normal. Take a 10-minute walk during your lunch break and another during your coffee break. Fit in another 10 minutes after dinner.</p>
<p><b>Be Sure To</b></p>
<p>* Get a check up before starting any new exercise program. If you already have heart problems,your doctor may want to perform tests to find out how much exercise you can safely do</p>
<p>* Get a good pair of walking shoes</p>
<p>* Start out slowly and increase gradually. At first,set a pace of about 3 miles per hour and walk for just 10 minutes</p>
<p>* After you have ramped up,do at least 2.5 hours of walking a week. One way to do this is to walk for 30 minutes a day five times a week. But the total number of hours can be reached in any increments convenient for you</p>
<p>* For motivation,walk with friends or pets</p>
<p>* Use a pedometer to count your steps. Wear it throughout the day and try to reach at least 2,000 steps (approximately one mile) at first. Gradually increase your number of steps by 500 per week. Ways to do this include taking the stairs instead of an elevator,or parking farther away from your destination than you normally would</p>
<p>If youre regularly active,youll burn more calories,which helps you manage your weight and other cardiovascular risk factors. Plus,physically active people nearly always report better moods,less stress,more energy and a better outlook on life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have identified a new gene that may have the ability to prevent HIV from spreading after the virus enters the body.</p>
<p>The study led by King&#8217;s College London is the first to identify a role for the human MX2 gene in inhibiting Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
<p>Researchers said this gene could be a new target for effective,less toxic treatments where the body&#8217;s own natural defence system is mobilised against the virus.</p>
<p>Scientists carried out experiments on human cells in the lab,introducing the virus to two different cell lines and observing the effects.</p>
<p>In one cell line the MX2 gene was expressed or &#8216;switched on&#8217;,and in the other it was not,or &#8216;silenced&#8217;. They saw that in the cells where MX2 was silenced,the virus replicated and spread.</p>
<p>In the cells where the MX2 gene was expressed,the virus was not able to replicate and new viruses were not produced.</p>
<p>The work was led by Dr Caroline Goujon and Professor Mike Malim at the Department of Infectious Diseases,King&#8217;s College London.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an extremely exciting finding which advances our understanding of how HIV virus interacts with the immune system and opens up opportunities to develop new therapies to treat the disease,&#8221; Malim said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until now we knew very little about the MX2 gene,but now we recognise both its potent anti-viral function and a key point of vulnerability in the life cycle of HIV.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developing drugs to stimulate the body&#8217;s natural inhibitors is a very important approach because you are triggering a natural process and therefore won&#8217;t have the problem of drug resistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two possible routes &#8211; it may be possible to develop either a molecule that mimics the role of MX2 or a drug which activates the gene&#8217;s natural capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although people with HIV are living longer,healthier lives with the virus thanks to current effective treatments,they can often be toxic for the body and drug resistance can become an issue with long-term use.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important to continue to find new ways of mobilising the body&#8217;s natural defence systems and this gene appears to be a key player in establishing viral control in people with HIV,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The study was published in journal Nature.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1171271&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Electronic devices may help those with dyslexia improve their reading speed and comprehension,a new study suggests.</p>
<p>While e-readers are growing in popularity as convenient alternatives to traditional books,researchers have found that convenience may not be their only benefit.</p>
<p>The team discovered that when e-readers are set up to display only a few words per line,some people with dyslexia can read more easily,quickly and with greater comprehension.</p>
<p>An element in many cases of dyslexia is called a visual attention deficit.</p>
<p>It is marked by an inability to concentrate on letters within words or words within lines of text. Another element is known as visual crowding &#8211; the failure to recognise letters when they are cluttered within the word.</p>
<p>Using short lines on an e-reader can alleviate these issues and promote reading by reducing visual distractions within the text.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least a third of those with dyslexia we tested have these issues with visual attention and are helped by reading on the e-reader,&#8221; said Matthew H Schneps,director of the Laboratory for Visual Learning at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and lead author of the research.</p>
<p>&#8220;For those who don&#8217;t have these issues,the study showed that the traditional ways of displaying text are better,&#8221; said Schneps.</p>
<p>The study examined the role the small hand-held reader had on comprehension,and found that in many cases the device not only improved speed and efficiency,but  improved abilities for the dyslexic reader to grasp the meaning of the text.</p>
<p>The team tested the reading comprehension and speed of 103 students with dyslexia who attend Landmark High School in Boston. Reading on paper was compared with reading on small hand-held e-reader devices,configured to lines of text that were two-to-three words long.</p>
<p>The use of an e-reader significantly improved speed and comprehension in many of the students. Those students with a pronounced visual attention deficit benefited most from reading text on a handheld device versus on paper,while the reverse was true for those who did not exhibit these issues.</p>
<p>The small screen on a handheld device displaying few words &#8211; versus a full sheet of paper &#8211; is believed to narrow and concentrate the reader&#8217;s focus,which controls visual distraction.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that this reading method can be an effective intervention for struggling readers and that e-readers may be more than new technological gadgets: They also may be educational resources and solutions for those with dyslexia.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1171261&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Max Bupa Health Insurance announced the launch of Max Bupa Walk for Health 2013 in Delhi and Mumbai. Max Bupa Walk for Health is a health initiative that aims to motivate people to incorporate walking as an exercise into their daily routine. This will be the second edition of the calendar event which saw response from 18,000 people in 2012. </p>
<p>The event will be held three categories &#8211; adults,children and elderly. They will pledge their allegiance to include walking as an integral part of their lives. This year the distance for each category will be 5 kms walk for adults and avid walkers and 2 kms walk for senior citizens and children.</p>
<p>Max Bupa Walk for Health 2013 is focused on Delhi and Mumbai,as owing to a sedentary lifestyle,people living in these metros are more prone to stress and lead an unhealthy life. Prominent as the IT/Telecom and BFSI hubs of India,the people in these cities work long hours which leaves them with hardly any spare time to exercise. Bupas global research in 13 countries has revealed that high stress level,unhealthy diets and sedentary lifestyle has high negative impact on peoples health. </p>
<p>Speaking about the initiative,Manasije Mishra,CEO,Max Bupa Health Insurance,said,We believe that if we can get people to change their lifestyles and start walking in these cities then we can make a significant impact on the health of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p>A Max Bupa research shows that walking is the most preferred form of exercise with 56 per cent of people who exercise,opting for it, Manasije added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1170839&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed a synthetic peptide that could be the first in a new class of drugs to treat heart disease,high blood pressure and diabetes.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Alberta,Canada found that a deficiency in the peptide apelin is associated with heart failure,pulmonary hypertension and diabetes.</p>
<p>They also developed a synthetic version that targets pathways in the heart and promotes blood vessel growth.</p>
<p>Lead author Gavin Oudit,an associate professor in the Faculty of Medicine &amp; Dentistry,said the synthetic form of apelin is far more stable and potent than the naturally occurring peptide,making drug therapies possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a new group of drugs that we hope can be used for a wide variety of disorders,all of which have a huge economic burden on the health-care system,&#8221; said Oudit,a cardiologist and clinician-scientist at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute.</p>
<p>Oudit&#8217;s research group studied apelin deficiency in the hearts of mice and humans through the Human Explanted Heart Programme,or HELP.</p>
<p>The HELP programme allows for the study of specimens obtained from patients undergoing a heart transplant.</p>
<p>The research team found that hearts from patients who suffered heart attacks were deficient in apelin,which is needed for angiogenesis &#8211; the formation of new blood vessels that helps the body adapt after tissue damage from heart attacks.</p>
<p>Oudit&#8217;s team has filed a provisional patent on the synthetic apelin and will continue work developing the drug to be more potent and clinically applicable.</p>
<p>Once the drug is perfected,they&#8217;ll move into the first phase of clinical trials in two to three years.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1170803&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have identified a biomarker that can predict diabetes risk up to 10 years before onset of the disease.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Vanderbilt Heart and Vascular Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital in US conducted a study of 188 individuals who developed type 2 diabetes</p>
<p>mellitus and 188 individuals without diabetes who were followed for 12 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the baseline blood samples,we identified a novel biomarker,2-aminoadipic acid (2-AAA),that was higher in people who went on to develop diabetes than in those who did not,&#8221; said Thomas J Wang,director of the Division of Cardiology at Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>&#8220;That information was above and beyond knowing their blood sugar at baseline,knowing whether they were obese,or had other characteristics that put them at risk,&#8221; Wang said.</p>
<p>Individuals who had 2-AAA concentrations in the top quartile had up to a fourfold risk of developing diabetes during the 12-year follow-up period compared with people in the lowest quartile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The caveat with these new biomarkers is that they require further evaluation in other populations and further work to determine how this information might be used</p>
<p>clinically,&#8221; Wang said.</p>
<p>The researchers also conducted laboratory studies to understand why this biomarker is elevated so well in advance of the onset of diabetes.</p>
<p>They found that giving 2-AAA to mice alters the way they metabolise glucose. These molecules seem to influence the function of the pancreas,which is responsible for making insulin,the hormone that tells the body to take up blood sugar.</p>
<p>&#8220;2-AAA appears to be more than a passive marker. It actually seems to play a role in glucose metabolism,&#8221; Wang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is still a bit early to understand the biological implications of that role,but these experimental data are intriguing in that this molecule could be contributing in some manner to the development of the disease itself,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The value of markers like these,which are metabolites,is that they can be given to people as nutritional supplements. These are amino acid derivatives that are byproducts of metabolism. Studies in humans can be done to see if there are similar patterns to what is seen experimentally,&#8221; Wang said.</p>
<p>The study will be published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1170329&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ill-trained and uninspiring counsellors at de-addiction centres,including the most prominent de-addiction address Alcoholics Anonymous,can hardly help reverse the rising alchoholism in the country.</p>
<p>For starters,the decades&#8217; old 12 steps to recovery for alcoholics,floated by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) decades&#8217; ago,is not suitable in the Indian context &#8211; more so for its overemphasis on divine healing.</p>
<p>&#8220;In multi-religious India of 2013,a treatment programme of the complex condition of alcoholism cannot rest solely on a divine element. Alcoholism is a human problem. It needs a human solution,&#8221; sobriety campaigner and counsellor Vijay Simha told PTI.</p>
<p>Simha doesn&#8217;t mention the word God in his treatment. &#8220;I provide human solutions that are based on a rational understanding of alcoholism (and addiction to narcotics. My treatment model does not exclude non-believers who find the repeated reference to God perplexing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Simha says the 12 steps don&#8217;t work as much in India as they do in the West because their practitioners are largely uninspiring and have a negative mindset. North India has a serious problem of alcoholic addiction led by Punjab,Haryana and Delhi.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will always hear stories of huge losses (or wins) in Diwali gambling from many AA members,who are given the impression that recovery from alcoholism is merely abstinence. It is not,&#8221; says Simha. Clinical psychologist Aruna Broota,too,agrees that there is shortage of counsellors at the few de-addiction centres across the city and the ones available are not well-trained. &#8220;There should be a body of senior psychiatrists to train these counsellors. De-addiction centres offering treatment to alcoholics need to be checked,including the working of the India chapter of Alcoholics Anonymous,&#8221; suggests Broota.</p>
<p>Samir Parikh,another city-based psychiatrist,adds: &#8220;There are very few counsellors available even though the alcohol consumption rate is high in India.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Simha,abstinence from alcohol is a requirement of recovery and recovery is a mental process more than physical.</p>
<p>&#8220;This you will find missing in those that practice the 12 Steps in India. This is why they struggle; they have around 25,000 members in India after more than 50 years of being here. They could&#8217;ve had millions of members if they were true to the steps and recovery. The message is lost when the messenger is confused,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>To counter the overemphasis on the divine element in helping alcoholics,Simha has come up with alternative 12 secular steps to recovery.</p>
<p>To improve the standard of counsellors in India,Simha suggests making accreditation mandatory for counsellors by a recognized body; regular training of counsellors; and penalising those who counsel without accreditation  with fines and,maybe,jail terms for repeat offenses. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1169876&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indulging in fatty foods could destroy stomach&#8217;s signals to the brain,according to a new study which gives insight why many dieters tend to regain the weight  after losing it.</p>
<p>New University of Adelaide research has found the nerves in the stomach which signal fullness to the brain appeared to be desensitised after long-term consumption of a high-fat diet.</p>
<p>The findings could explain why many dieters tend to regain the weight they have lost.</p>
<p>PhD student Stephen Kentish investigated the impact of high-fat diets on the ability of the gut to signal its fullness,and whether those changes revert back to normal by</p>
<p>losing weight.</p>
<p>Study leader Associate Professor Amanda Page said laboratory studies showed the stomach&#8217;s nerve response does not return to normal upon a return to a normal diet.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means you would need to eat more food before you felt the same degree of fullness as a healthy individual,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A hormone in the body,leptin,known to regulate food intake,can also change the sensitivity of the nerves in the stomach that signal fullness.</p>
<p>&#8220;In normal conditions,leptin acts to stop food intake. However,in the stomach in high-fat diet induced obesity,leptin further desensitises the nerves that detect fullness.&#8221;</p>
<p> Associate Professor Page said the two mechanisms combined meant that obese people needed to eat more to feel full,which fuels their obesity cycle.</p>
<p>She said the results had &#8220;very strong implications for obese people,those trying to lose weight,and those who are trying to maintain their weight loss&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately,our results show that the nerves in the stomach remain desensitised to fullness after weight loss has been achieved,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Page says the researchers were not yet sure whether the effect was permanent or just long-lasting. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1169843&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The tendency to experience hangovers decreases with age,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>Many people are familiar with the uncomfortable morning-after symptoms of excessive drinking,commonly known as a hangover.</p>
<p>While it is a common phenomenon,little is known about hangover differences across the lifespan. The new study of hangovers across adulthood has found their severity depends on age.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it is true that a hangover is mostly referred to in a humorous way,we could also say they are the most frequent alcohol-related morbidity,&#8221; said Janne S Tolstrup,a research programme director at the University of Southern Denmark and corresponding author for the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears as though not everyone is equally susceptible to hangovers,and it is possible that resistance to hangovers plays a role in the development of drinking problems,&#8221; said Jonathan Howland,a professor of emergency medicine at the Boston University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Furthermore,neurocognitive impairment such as attention/reaction time appears to be a residual next-day effect of intoxication in the presence of a hangover,but not in the absence of a hangover. This could have implications for occupational performance and safety,&#8221; Howland said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This paper rectifies that with its very large sample size of 50,000 individuals,including 30,000 older than the age of 40,and makes a major contribution to understanding hangover across the lifespan,&#8221; said Tolstrup.</p>
<p>Tolstrup and her colleagues used 2007 and 2008 information gathered by the Danish Health Examination Survey (DANHES),an Internet-based health survey that asked participants about their diet,smoking,alcohol and physical activity.</p>
<p>Analysis was performed on data provided by 51,645 individuals (24,118 males,27,527 women) 18 to 94 years of age living in 13 municipalities in Denmark. &#8220;We found that the tendency to have hangovers decreased by increasing age,&#8221; said Tolstrup.</p>
<p>The study will be published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical &amp; Experimental Research. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1168781&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[A study reveals that the most common form of dementia can be reversed using a common diabetes drug.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1168290&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A commonly prescribed diabetes drug can reverse memory loss and the build-up of plaques in the brain linked to Alzheimer&#8217;s disease,scientists have found.</p>
<p>The study,led by Professor Christian Holscher at Lancaster University,found that the drug liraglutide might be able to reverse some of the damage caused by Alzheimer&#8217;s,even in the later stages of the condition.</p>
<p>Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is the most common form of dementia. The condition is characterised by the slow death of brain cells. It is progressive,ultimately terminal and there is yet no cure.</p>
<p>If successful in clinical trials this will be the first new dementia treatment in a decade.</p>
<p>In the study,mice with late-stage Alzheimer&#8217;s given the drug performed significantly better on an object recognition test and their brains showed a 30 per cent reduction in the build-up of toxic plaques.</p>
<p>Most drugs that show promising effects in dementia do so at an early stage of the disease; these results from a more advanced stage of Alzheimer&#8217;s will provide hope that this drug could be of benefit for people in the moderate to severe stages too.</p>
<p>Liraglutide is a member of a class of drugs known as a GLP-1 analogue.</p>
<p>The drug is used to stimulate insulin production in diabetes,but research shows it can also pass through the blood brain barrier and have a protective effect on brain cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;This exciting study suggests that one of these drugs can reverse the biological causes of Alzheimer&#8217;s even in the late stages and demonstrates we&#8217;re on the right track,&#8221; said Dr Doug Brown,Director of Research and Development at Alzheimer&#8217;s Society.</p>
<p>A major clinical trial led by Dr Paul Edison of Imperial College London to test the effectiveness of the drug on people with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease will begin recruiting patients in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Neuropharmacology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1168290&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parents,want your kids to get better grades? Make them exercise!</p>
<p>Aerobic fitness can boost learning and memory in children aged nine to 10,a new research has claimed.</p>
<p>Researchers from Lauren Raine and colleagues from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign asked 48 children aged nine to ten to memorise names and locations on a fictitious map,either only by studying the information or being tested on the material as they studied.</p>
<p>Half the children were in the top 30 per cent of their age group on a test measuring aerobic fitness,while the other half scored in the lowest 30 per cent.</p>
<p>When asked to recollect the information studied,children who were fitter performed better than those who were not as fit.</p>
<p>The difference between the high-fitness and low-fitness groups was also stronger when the initial learning was performed by studying alone than when testing and study were interspersed.</p>
<p>Based on these results,the authors suggest that fitness levels may influence learning differently when the study method used is more challenging,and that higher levels of aerobic fitness can benefit learning and memory in school-age children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Future research should focus on the manner in which these factors impact the neural processes of children during learning,&#8221; researchers said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal PLOS ONE.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1168240&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Overweight and obese people are at higher-than-average risk of migraines,suggests a new study.</p>
<p>Researchers looking at so-called episodic migraines &#8211; headaches that occur less than every other day &#8211; found they were almost twice as common among obese people as among normal-weight adults.</p>
<p>&#8220;This suggests patients and doctors need to be aware that obesity is associated with an increased risk of episodic migraine and not wait until a patient has chronic migraine to address healthy lifestyle choices,such as diet and exercise,and to choose medications that impact weight with care,&#8221; lead researcher Dr. Lee Peterlin,from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore,told Reuters Health in an email.</p>
<p>However,the researchers couldn&#8217;t be sure which came first &#8211; the extra weight or the headaches. And one migraine researcher not involved in the study said he would be cautious interpreting its findings.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this helps of course to make people believe they should lose weight,that&#8217;s great,but does it mean that reduction in weight will reduce migraine attacks,or treat migraines? That&#8217;s a question they haven&#8217;t addressed,&#8221; Dr. Tobias Kurth,of the French national research institute INSERM and the University of Bordeaux,said.</p>
<p>About 10 to 15 percent of people have episodic migraines,according to Peterlin.</p>
<p>Previous studies have linked obesity to chronic migraines,which by definition occur at least every other day. But there&#8217;s less evidence on whether weight also plays a role in less frequent migraines,researchers said.</p>
<p>To try to answer that question,Peterlin and her colleagues analyzed data on 3,862 people who participated in a national U.S. survey in the early 2000s,including 188 who reported having migraines an average of three or four times each month.</p>
<p>About 32 percent of people with episodic migraines were obese,based on their self-reported height and weight,compared to 26 percent of non-migraine sufferers.</p>
<p>After accounting for other differences between people with and without migraines,such as their age and smoking rates,the researchers found that being obese was linked to an 81 percent higher chance of having episodic migraines,they reported Wednesday in Neurology.</p>
<p>The obesity-migraine link was stronger among women and people under 50 years old but less clear for men and older adults,who have lower migraine rates in general.</p>
<p>Peterlin said there are a few possible explanations for the association,including that the same systems in the body that are activated during a migraine help regulate how much people eat. Also,people who get regular migraines may be less active because of the pain or take medications that influence weight gain,she said.</p>
<p>Kurth,who wasn&#8217;t involved in the new study,agreed lifestyle factors may play a role in both obesity and migraines. But he cautioned against drawing a direct link between weight and episodic migraines in the absence of more research.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just very careful,because I&#8217;m missing the big picture,&#8221; he told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>&#8220;If obesity would cause migraine,which is the suggestion of this study,we would expect to see an increase  in the prevalence of migraine,because we have such an epidemic of obesity in the United States,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And this is just not true.&#8221;</p>
<p>However,Peterlin said,rates of the two conditions wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be expected to go hand and hand on a larger scale &#8211; and that some studies have suggested episodic migraines are in fact becoming more common.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1168175&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What does one visualize when they think about their ageing parents? A sense of safety and security,feeling of belongingness with loved ones around,ample recreational opportunities to keep themselves engaged and active&#8230; When we are younger,we are both physically and mentally active; we are also physically and mentally alert to handle any concerns. But with age the scenario changes. Age sets in many changes,some which we are prepared for and some we are unaware of. </p>
<p>If one was to ask if the external factors make a difference,it most certainly makes a great difference when we get older. Changing social dimensions,fading joint families and financial independence are some factors that are contributing to the trend.</p>
<p>Retirement is a vital change in senior years. If one was to ask you how would you like to spend your retirement? The answer would probably have two main components- I want to be happy and healthy and also constructively engaged. As you know,being stress free and being in good health is a major part of ageing cycle. However,everything needs planning. We all have a picture of a retirement somewhere&#8230;. well at least some of us do&#8230; a mental snap shot of where you would like to be once you retire from the responsibilities &#8211; to enjoy in peace and take a deep breath after all the running around.</p>
<p>So while we all want the perfect place to unwind after a long road of life to seek enjoyment and fun. Is it the way we see most of our seniors leading their life?</p>
<p>There is an increase in number of assaults,stealing and killing cases in the city among the senior citizens in the recent past. It is not an easy task for the seniors to be tension free especially when their children and other family members do not reside in the same city/country. I have a friend of mine who called me from London worried on the phone asking me to check how her father was. This is because of the rising concern for the safety and wellbeing of their senior family members.</p>
<p>A large number of people have moved overseas however their parents havent really been able to adapt to the western lifestyle,so they still seek their comfort in their homeland. There are quite a few difficulties which these senior citizens have to put up with. To name a few would be- lack of available sources for them to commute,finding a reliable house help,finding someone to help them around in case of medical emergencies and last but not the least,source for recreation to pass time and a emotional bonding.</p>
<p>At times children find it difficult to find sources of affiliation for their senior family members. While we are busy making two ends meet,they struggle to find someone they can have a chat with,interact and share their wisdom,discuss their worries and seek companionship. In our senior citizen workshops we initially organized structured meetings by getting a specialist to talk to them,do activities which will improve their health,but eventually the members of the group came and told us that all they were looking for just simple everyday activities and ways to make life easier for them and improve their quality of life.</p>
<p>Some seniors have their families living with them,but this is also an age old practice which is breaking down due to urbanization and the need to move to different cities to earn a living. Even those senior people who have their families living with them in most cases suffer from loneliness as both children/daughter/son and son/daughter in law is working. The second option is sanatoriums and for some it is living in a religious place if their community makes it available to them.</p>
<p>So what is the need for the hour? I strongly believe that it is essential to have a place where people as they age in life feel safe,secure and can lead their life in true hassle free manner.</p>
<p>In India such a concept is still new,but few names are now coming in light which have initiated their thought in this direction. Time has come for India to have senior friendly and senior specific communities which are focused on offering active and healthy living. Its imperative to provide seniors a place which allows them to spend time with likeminded neighbors. A living space designed by special experts to provide holistic lifestyle. It&#8217;s important to give our loved ones a happy home and a healthy environment a small gesture of thank you after all that they have done for us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Low levels of chloride are associated with higher mortality rate and cardiovascular disease in people,according to a new study led by an Indian-origin physician.</p>
<p>Too much salt in the diet and specifically sodium is widely acknowledged as a major risk factor for high blood pressure,however scientists have found that salt&#8217;s other overlooked constituent chloride might also play an important role.</p>
<p>A study by researchers at the University of Glasgow has revealed that low chloride levels in the blood is an independent indicator of mortality risk in people with hypertension.</p>
<p>The role of chloride in hypertension has received little attention from scientists hitherto.</p>
<p>After analysing data from almost 13,000 patients with high blood pressure,followed up over 35 years,the researchers found that low levels of chloride were associated with a higher risk of death and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>The group with the lowest level of chloride in their blood had a 20 per cent higher mortality rate compared to the other subjects.</p>
<p>The results are published in the journal Hypertension.</p>
<p>Dr Sandosh Padmanabhan of the Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences,said in a statement today,&#8221;Sodium is cast as the villain for the central role it plays in increasing the risk of high blood pressure,with chloride little more than a silent extra in the background.&#8221;</p>
<p>However,our study has put the spotlight on this under-studied chemical to reveal an association between low levels of chloride serum in the blood and a higher mortality rate,and surprisingly this is in the opposite direction to the risks associated with high sodium.</p>
<p>It is likely that chloride plays an important part in the physiology of the body and we need to investigate this further.</p>
<p>Chloride is already measured as part of routine clinical screening and so monitoring of chloride levels could easily be incorporated into clinical practice to identify individuals at high risk.</p>
<p>Dr Padmanabhan said,&#8221;The results we see from this study are confounding against the knowledge that excess salt is a bad thing,yet higher levels of chloride in the blood seems to be an independent factor that is associated with lower mortality and cardiovascular risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>We seem to have entered a grey area here that requires further investigation.</p>
<p>It is too early to draw any conclusions about relating this finding to salt intake and diet.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1166320&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smokers who switch to electronic cigarettes to try to kick their habit are at least as likely to succeed in quitting or cutting down as users of nicotine patches,according to research published on Sunday.</p>
<p>In a first-of-its-kind study,researchers compared electronic,or e-cigarettes,with the more standard nicotine replacement therapy patches.</p>
<p>They found levels of success were comparable,with e-cigarettes &#8211; whose effects are a subject of intense debate among health experts &#8211; more likely to help smokers who fail to quit cut the amount of tobacco they use.</p>
<p>Some experts fear e-cigarettes may be a &#8220;gateway&#8221; to nicotine addiction and tobacco smoking,while others view them as the most useful method yet of cutting back and helping would-be quitters.</p>
<p>While the argument rumbles on,smoking continues to kill half of all those who indulge in it.</p>
<p>Tobacco is responsible for 6 million deaths a year and the World Health Organisation estimate that number could rise beyond 8 million by 2030.</p>
<p>As well as causing lung cancer and other chronic respiratory conditions,smoking is also a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases,the world&#8217;s number-one killer.</p>
<p><b>&#8216;USEFUL WEAPON&#8217;</b></p>
<p>The study,published in The Lancet medical journal and presented at a conference in Spain,was the first to assess whether e-cigarettes are more or less effective than nicotine patches &#8211; already recognised as useful in helping people quit.</p>
<p>&#8220;While our results don&#8217;t show any clear-cut differences&#8230; in terms of quit success after six months,it certainly seems that e-cigarettes were more effective in helping smokers who didn&#8217;t quit to cut down,&#8221; said Chris Bullen of New Zealand&#8217;s University of Auckland,who led the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s also interesting that the people who took part in our study seemed to be much more enthusiastic about e-cigarettes than patches,as evidenced by the far greater proportion of people&#8230; who said they&#8217;d recommend them to family or friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bullen&#8217;s research team recruited 657 smokers who wanted to quit smoking and divided them into three groups.</p>
<p>They gave 292 of them 13 weeks&#8217; supply of commercially available e-cigarettes,each of which contained around 16mg of nicotine. The same number of participants got 13 weeks of nicotine patches,and the remaining 73 got placebo e-cigarettes containing no nicotine.</p>
<p>At the end of the six-month study,5.7 percent of participants had managed to completely stop smoking for that period.</p>
<p>Bullen said that while the proportion of participants who quit was highest in the e-cigarettes group &#8211; at 7.3 percent compared to 5.8 percent on nicotine patches and 4.1 percent on placebo &#8211; the differences were not statistically significant,so the results were that the two products were comparable.</p>
<p>The study also found that among those who had not managed to quit,cigarette consumption was markedly more reduced in the nicotine e-cigarettes group,compared to both other groups.</p>
<p>Some 57 percent of people using e-cigarettes had cut their daily number of cigarettes smoked by at least half after six months,compared to just over 40 percent of the patches group.</p>
<p>Ann McNeill,a professor of tobacco addiction at the Institute of Psychiatry at King&#8217;s College London,said the findings should persuade health experts to embrace e-cigarettes as a useful weapon in the battle against smoking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Electronic cigarettes are the most exciting new development in tobacco control over the last few decades as we have witnessed a rapid uptake of these much less harmful products by smokers,&#8221; she said in an emailed comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The popularity of e-cigarettes suggests that we now have a product that can compete with cigarettes,thus heralding the first real possibility that cigarette smoking could be phased out.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1166272&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bad night&#8217;s sleep may make people buy more unhealthy foods the next day,a new study suggests.</p>
<p>People who were deprived of one night&#8217;s sleep purchased more calories and grammes of food in a mock supermarket on the following day,researchers said.</p>
<p>Sleep deprivation also led to increased blood levels of ghrelin,a hormone that increases hunger,on the following morning.</p>
<p>However,there was no correlation between individual ghrelin levels and food purchasing,suggesting that other mechanisms &#8211; such as impulsive decision making &#8211; may be more responsible for increased purchasing.</p>
<p>Researchers in Sweden were curious as to whether sleep deprivation may impair or alter an individual&#8217;s food purchasing choices based on its established tendency to impair higher-level thinking and to increase hunger.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hypothesised that sleep deprivation&#8217;s impact on hunger and decision making would make for the &#8216;perfect storm&#8217; with regard to shopping and food purchasing  leaving individuals hungrier and less capable of employing self-control and higher level decision-making processes to avoid making impulsive,calorie-driven purchases,&#8221; said first author Colin Chapman,of Uppsala University.</p>
<p>On the morning after one night of total sleep deprivation,as well as after one night of sleep,Chapman,along with Christian Benedict,and their colleagues,gave 14 normal-weight men a fixed budget (approximately USD 50).</p>
<p>The men were instructed to purchase as much as they could out of a possible 40 items,including 20 high-caloric foods and 20 low-calorie foods.</p>
<p>The prices of the high-caloric foods were then varied to determine if total sleep deprivation affects the flexibility of food purchasing.</p>
<p>Before the task,participants received a standardised breakfast to minimise the effect of hunger on their purchases.</p>
<p>Sleep-deprived men purchased significantly more calories and grammes of food than they did after one night of sleep.</p>
<p>The researchers also measured blood levels of ghrelin,finding that the hormone&#8217;s concentrations were higher after total sleep deprivation; however,this increase did not correlate with food purchasing behaviour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our finding provides a strong rationale for suggesting that patients with concerns regarding caloric intake and weight gain maintain a healthy,normal sleep schedule,&#8221; said Chapman.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Obesity.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1165530&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A stress-related protein genetically linked to depression,anxiety and other psychiatric disorders contributes to the acceleration of Alzheimer&#8217;s disease,a new study has found.</p>
<p>Researchers led by the University of South Florida found when the stress-related protein FKBP51 partners with another protein known as Hsp90 it prevents the clearance from the brain of the toxic tau protein associated with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances,tau helps make up the skeleton of our brain cells.</p>
<p>The study was done using test tube experiments,mice genetically engineered to produce abnormal tau protein like that accumulated in the brains of people with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease,and post-mortem human Alzheimer&#8217;s brain tissue.</p>
<p>The researchers reported that FKBP51 levels increase with age in the brain,and then the stress-related protein partners with Hsp90 to make tau more deadly to the brain cells involved in memory formation.</p>
<p>Hsp90 is a chaperone protein,which supervises the activity of tau inside nerve cells. Chaperone proteins typically help ensure that tau proteins are properly folded to maintain the healthy structure of nerve cells.</p>
<p>However,as FKBP51 levels rise with age,they usurp Hsp90&#8242;s beneficial effect to promote tau toxicity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that FKB51 commandeers Hsp90 to create an environment that prevents the removal of tau and makes it more toxic,&#8221; said the study&#8217;s principal investigator Chad Dickey,associate professor of molecular medicine at the USF Health Byrd Alzheimer&#8217;s Institute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically,it uses Hsp90 to produce and preserve the bad tau,&#8221; Dickey said.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that developing drugs or other ways to reduce FKB51 or block its interaction with Hsp90 may be highly effective in treating the tau pathology featured in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease,Parkinson&#8217;s disease dementia and several other disorders associated with memory loss.</p>
<p>A previous study by Dickey and colleagues found that a lack of FKBP51 in old mice improved resilience to depressive behaviour.</p>
<p>The study was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1165077&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drinking wine in moderation may be associated with a lower risk of developing depression,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>Moderate amounts of alcohol consumed may have similar protective effects on depression to those that have been observed for coronary heart disease,researchers said.</p>
<p>Few studies have looked at the relationship between mental health and moderate alcohol intake. </p>
<p>Researchers report on a cohort study that followed over 5,500 light-to-moderate drinkers for up to seven years. The results show an inverse relationship between alcohol intake and incidence of depression.</p>
<p>The study participants were aged between 55 and 80 years old,and had never suffered from depression or had alcohol-related problems when the study started.</p>
<p>Their alcohol consumption,mental health and lifestyles were followed for up to seven years through yearly visits,repeated medical exams,interviews with dietitians and questionnaires.</p>
<p>The main alcoholic beverage drunk by the study participants was wine. When analysed,it was shown that those who drank moderate amounts of wine each week were less likely to suffer from depression.</p>
<p>The lowest rates of depression were seen in the group of individuals who drank two to seven small glasses of wine per week. These results remained significant even when the group adjusted them for lifestyle and social factors,such as smoking,diet and marital status.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lower amounts of alcohol intake might exert protection in a similar way to what has been observed for coronary heart disease. In fact,it is believed that depression and coronary heart disease share some common disease mechanisms,&#8221; Professor Miguel A Martinez-Gonzalez,from the University of Navarra (Spain),senior author of the paper,said.</p>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that non-alcoholiccompounds in the wine,such as  resveratrol and other phenolic compounds,may have protective effects on certain areas of the brain.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal BMC Medicine.  </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1162312&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The more alcohol a young woman drinks before motherhood,the greater her risk of future breast cancer,a new study has warned.</p>
<p>If a female averages a drink per day between her first period and her first full-term pregnancy,she increases her risk of breast cancer by 13 per cent,according to a new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis.</p>
<p>This is the first study to link increased breast cancer risk to drinking between early adolescence and first full-term pregnancy.</p>
<p>Previous studies have looked at breast cancer risk and alcohol consumption later in life or at the effect of adolescent drinking on noncancerous breast disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;More and more heavy drinking is occurring on college campuses and during adolescence,and not enough people are considering future risk,&#8221; said study co-author Graham Colditz,associate director for cancer prevention and control at Siteman Cancer Center at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and Washington University School of Medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;But,according to our research,the lesson is clear: If a female averages a drink per day between her first period and her first full-term pregnancy,she increases her risk of breast cancer by 13 per cent,&#8221; Colditz said.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that for every bottle of beer,glass of wine or shot of liquor consumed daily,a young woman increases her risk of proliferative benign breast disease by 15 per cent.</p>
<p>Although such lesions are noncancerous,their presence increases breast cancer risk by as much as 500 per cent,said first author of the study,Ying Liu,a School of Medicine instructor in the Division of Public Health Sciences.</p>
<p>The findings are based on a review of the health histories of 91,005 mothers enrolled in the Nurses&#8217; Health Study II from 1989 to 2009.</p>
<p>Researchers didn&#8217;t consider the effects of adolescent and early adulthood drinking on women who didn&#8217;t have a full-term pregnancy because not enough were represented among those studied,Liu said.</p>
<p>Breast tissue cells are particularly susceptible to cancer-causing substances as they undergo rapid proliferation during adolescence and later.</p>
<p>Adding to the risk is the lengthening time frame between the average age of a girl&#8217;s first menstrual cycle and the average age of a woman&#8217;s first full-term pregnancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reducing drinking to less than one drink per day,especially during this time period,is a key strategy to reducing lifetime risk of breast cancer,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The study is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1161834&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A team of experts have found that those who work more than 50 hours a week,which is considered an addiction,may suffer reduced mental and physical deterioration.</p>
<p>Published in the journal Financial Planning Review,the study reports that well-being is not a priority for workaholics.</p>
<p>It also suggests that there is a relationship between this addiction and deterioration of this aspect,both mental and physical.</p>
<p>It also shows there is a link between workaholism and physical and mental well-being.</p>
<p>The researchers conducted a study using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979.</p>
<p>According to experts,reduced physical well-being is measured by skipped meals.</p>
<p>They also found that workaholism was associated with reduced mental well-being as measured by a self-reported depression score. However,workaholics overwork because they feel that cost of not doing so becomes greater.</p>
<p>Workaholism is a disorder characterized by progressive,excessive work activity of a person,losing the necessary balance between work and leisure for a healthy life.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1161290&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winter blues may no longer serve as an excuse to pull a sickie from work! Winter blues &#8211; getting depressed when it&#8217;s cold and dreary outside &#8211; may not be as common as thought,a new US study has found.</p>
<p>US researchers found that neither time of year nor weather conditions influenced depressive symptoms. However,lead author David Kerr of Oregon State University said this study does not negate the existence of clinically diagnosed seasonal affective disorder,also known as SAD,but instead shows that people may be overestimating the impact that seasons have on depression in the general population.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is clear from prior research that SAD exists. But our research suggests that what we often think of as the winter blues does not affect people nearly as much as we may think, Kerr said.</p>
<p>Kerr and his colleagues analysed data from a sample of 556 community participants in Iowa and 206 people in western Oregon. Participants completed self-report measures of depressive symptoms multiple times over a period of years. These data were then compared with local weather conditions,including sunlight intensity,during the time participants filled out the reports.</p>
<p>In one study,some 92 per cent of Americans reported seasonal changes in mood and behaviour,and 27 per cent reported such changes were a problem. Yet the study suggests that people may be overestimating the impact of wintery skies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found a very small effect during the winter months,but it was much more modest than would be expected if seasonal depression were as common as many people think it is,&#8221; said Columbia University researcher Jeff Shaman,a study co-author and a former OSU faculty member.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were surprised. With a sample of nearly 800 people and very precise measures of the weather,we expected to see a larger effect,&#8221; Shaman said. Kerr believes people may have overestimated the power of the winter blues for a few reasons. </p>
<p>These may include awareness of SAD,the high prevalence of depression in general,and a legitimate dislike of winter weather. &#8220;We may not have as much fun,we can feel cooped up and we may be less active in the winter. But that&#8217;s not the same as long-lasting sadness,hopelessness,and problems with appetite and sleep &#8211; real signs of a clinical depression,&#8221; Kerr said. The study was published in the Journal of Affective Disorders.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1161285&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed a novel patch with tiny,biodegradable needles that can penetrate the skin and accurately diagnose tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The standard diagnostic test for tuberculosis is difficult to give,because a hypodermic needle must be inserted at a precise angle and depth in the arm to successfully check for tuberculosis,researchers said.</p>
<p>Now,a team led by University of Washington engineers has created a patch with tiny,biodegradable needles that can penetrate the skin and precisely deliver a tuberculosis test.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a micro-needle test there&#8217;s little room for user error,because the depth of delivery is determined by the micro-needle length rather than the needle-insertion angle,&#8221; said senior author Marco Rolandi.</p>
<p>&#8220;This test is painless and easier to administer than the traditional skin test with a hypodermic needle,&#8221; said Rolandi.</p>
<p>A tuberculosis test is a common precautionary measure for health care professionals and international travellers. The bacterial infection usually attacks the lungs and can live in an inactive state for years in the body.</p>
<p>A diagnostic test involves an injection in a person&#8217;s arm. Within two or three days,a swollen,firm bump will appear if an infection is present.</p>
<p>Rolandi&#8217;s lab and collaborators at the Infectious Disease Research Institute in Seattle believe this is the first time micro-needles made from biomaterials have been used as a diagnostic tool for tuberculosis.</p>
<p>They say their test will be easier to use,less painful and has the potential to be more successful than the standard tuberculosis skin test.</p>
<p>Researchers tested the patch on guinea pigs and found that after the micro-needles were inserted using the patch,the skin reaction associated with having a tuberculosis infection was the same as using the standard hypodermic needle test.</p>
<p>A micro-needle patch test has potential as a simpler,more reliable option than the traditional tuberculosis test for children who are needle-shy,or in developing countries where medical care is limited,Rolandi said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like putting on a bandage,&#8221; Rolandi said.</p>
<p>With the standard test,if a hypodermic needle is inserted at the wrong angle,the solution to check for tuberculosis is injected too deep or too shallow into the skin,and the test fails.</p>
<p>Micro-needles have been used in recent years as a painless alternative to hypodermic needles to deliver drugs to the body.</p>
<p>Micro-needles on a patch can be placed on an arm or leg,which then create small holes in the skin&#8217;s outermost layer,allowing the drugs coated on each needle to diffuse into the body.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1160798&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teens listening to their preferred music while driving commit a greater number of errors and miscalculations,a new study has warned. Researchers from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel found male novice drivers in particular make more frequent and serious mistakes listening to their preferred music than their less aggressive,female counterparts. </p>
<p>The study evaluated 85 young novice drivers accompanied by a researcher/driving instructor. Each driver took six challenging 40-minute trips; two with music from their own playlists; two with background music designed to increase driver safety (easy listening,soft rock,light jazz),and two additional trips without any music. </p>
<p>The study was conducted by BGU Director of Music Science Research Warren Brodsky and researcher Zack Slor to assess distraction by measuring driver deficiencies (miscalculation,inaccuracy,aggressiveness,and violations) as well as decreased vehicle performance. When the teen drivers listened to their preferred music,almost all (98 per cent)  demonstrated an average of three deficient driving behaviours in at least one of the trips. </p>
<p>Nearly a third of those (32 per cent) required a sudden verbal warning or command for action,and 20 per cent needed an assisted steering or braking manoeuvre to prevent an imminent accident. These errors included speeding,tailgating,careless lane switching,passing vehicles and one-handed driving. </p>
<p>Without listening to any music,92 per cent made errors. However,when driving with an alternative music background designed by Brodsky and Israeli music composer Micha Kisner,deficient driving behaviours decreased by 20 per cent. &#8220;Most drivers worldwide prefer to listen to music in a car and those between ages 16 to 30 choose driving to pop,rock,dance,hip-hop and rap,&#8221; Brodsky said. &#8220;Young drivers also tend to play this highly energetic,fast-paced music very loudly &#8211; approximately 120 to 130 decibels,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>&#8220;Drivers in general are not aware that as they get drawn-in by a song,they move from an extra-personal space involving driving tasks,to a more personal space of active music listening,&#8221; he added. The study will be published in the journal Accident Analysis and Prevention.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1159905&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since the first test-tube baby was born more than three decades ago,In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) has evolved into a highly sophisticated lab procedure. Now,scientists are going back to basics and testing a simpler and cheaper method.</p>
<p>In the West,many would-be parents spend thousands of dollars for IVF,which involves pricey incubators and extensive screening. But European and American scientists say a simplified version of the entire procedure aimed at developing countries could be done for about 200 euros ($265) with generic fertility drugs and basic lab equipment that would fit inside a shoebox.</p>
<p>&#8220;IVF is made to sound complicated,but the fact is that the early embryo is not very demanding,&#8221; said Jonathan Van Blerkom,a fertility expert at the University of Colorado.</p>
<p>A human embryo doesn&#8217;t need much beyond some basic solutions,a steady pH level and constant temperature,he said.</p>
<p>The simpler approach calls for women to take cheaper fertility tablets to stimulate their ovaries to release more than one egg per month. In conventional IVF,expensive,potent drugs that are injected can produce more than 20 eggs.</p>
<p>Van Blerkom developed the simplified technique after European colleagues asked him how IVF could be done in developing countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;My first reaction was,&#8217;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding,&#8217;&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But with two test tubes and special solutions,&#8221;it&#8217;s possible to generate the exact same conditions,or very similar,to what people are generating in a $60,000 incubator.&#8221;</p>
<p>One test tube is used to prepare a solution including carbon dioxide,which creates the ideal conditions for fertilization. That&#8217;s piped into a second tube,where one egg and a few thousand sperm are added,before being placed in a heating block. After about two to three days,any resulting embryo is examined under a microscope before being transferred into the woman.</p>
<p>Van Blerkom and colleagues estimated that about half of all people seeking infertility treatment could potentially be helped by the method. Those who have complicated infertility problems,like men with severe sperm problems or women with very few eggs left,will still need standard IVF.</p>
<p>In an ongoing trial in Belgium,researchers are comparing the techniques. Women under 36 seeking IVF for the first time are given a mild dose of injectable fertility drugs. If at least eight eggs are retrieved,half undergo traditional IVF,and half use the simpler method.</p>
<p>A specialist who doesn&#8217;t know which technique was used picks the best-looking embryo to be transferred.</p>
<p>For the more than 100 women treated so far,the pregnancy rate was about 34 percent for both methods. So far,14 babies have been born using the simplified method and 13 babies from traditional IVF.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization estimates there are between 120 and 160 million couples struggling with infertility worldwide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody thinks that infertility in developing countries is a problem,but it is an even bigger problem there than in (the West),&#8221; WHO reproductive health expert Sheryl Vanderpoel said.</p>
<p>She said more people in developing countries have complications from untreated infections,including sexually spread diseases,than in the West,which can hurt their fertility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making IVF affordable is a public health priority,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Hassan Sallam,director of the Alexandria Fertility and IVF Center in Egypt,said the cheaper IVF method would be welcomed. He said there is considerable social pressure on young Egyptian couples to have children &#8211; and that is compounded by the fact in rural areas,many newlyweds live with the man&#8217;s family.</p>
<p>&#8220;All eyes are on the newlywed couple to see if pregnancy has happened after the first month,&#8221; he said in an email.</p>
<p>He said couples married for two to three months occasionally come to see him &#8220;just to please their in-laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the new IVF strategy is intended for use mainly in developing countries,doctors in rich countries are also interested.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should not have to be rich just to have IVF,&#8221; said Dr. Geeta Nargund,medical director for Create Health Clinics,a private fertility center in London. &#8220;There are so many people who cannot afford the treatment (in the West) that there would be huge demand if there were something cheaper available.&#8221;</p>
<p>In many European countries,national health systems pay for several IVF cycles for eligible couples but it can cost more than $10,000 for those seeking it privately. For many couples,up to three cycles are necessary to create a baby.</p>
<p>She has asked Britain&#8217;s regulatory agency for fertility treatment for permission to test the simpler technique.</p>
<p>Some said the success rates of the cheaper IVF method would likely be lower than those for regular IVF. The simplified method does not include any extensive screening of embryos or any procedures to inject sperm directly into the eggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t producing as many eggs with this (cheap) method so the numbers will not be as high,&#8221; said Ian Cooke,an emeritus professor of reproductive medicine at Sheffield University. Cooke also thought training enough health professionals in developing countries might be an issue.</p>
<p>Still,he said the method was promising. Because doctors were planning to use less potent fertility drugs,he said it was fine to cut back on the regular screening and daily tests used in normal IVF regimens.</p>
<p>&#8220;From a technical point of view,they have proven it works,&#8221; he said,adding it was now necessary to test the technique in developing countries.</p>
<p>Patient groups said doctors should offer the cheaper IVF method if it is approved.</p>
<p>&#8220;IVF is not a one-size-fits-all process,&#8221; said Susan Seenan,deputy chief executive of Infertility Network UK. &#8220;Patients are being told they need all kinds of expensive procedures and this may be a good time to step back and see if that is really the case.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1159169&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists,including one of Indian-origin,have developed a new technique that can be used to convert cells from heart disease patients into heart muscle cells to act as a personalised treatment for their condition. 	Researchers have previously reported the ability to convert scar-forming cells in the heart (called fibroblasts) into new,beating muscle in mice that had experienced heart attacks,thereby regenerating a heart from within. They accomplished this by injecting a combination of three genes into the animals&#8217; fibroblast cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gene therapy approach resulted in new cardiac muscle cells that beat in synchrony with neighbouring muscle cells and ultimately improved the pumping function of the heart,&#8221; said senior author Dr Deepak Srivastava of the Gladstone Institutes and its affiliate,the University of California,San Francisco.</p>
<p>In the new study,Srivastava and his colleagues coaxed fibroblasts from human foetal heart cells,embryonic stem cells,and newborn skin grown in the lab to become heart muscle cells using a slightly different combination of genes,representing an important step toward the use of this technology for regenerative medicine. The team envisions that introducing these genes into damaged hearts by gene therapy might convert fibroblasts into new muscle,thereby improving the function of the heart. </p>
<p>&#8220;Over 50 per cent of the cells in the human heart are fibroblasts,providing a vast pool of cells that could be harnessed to create new muscle,&#8221; said Srivastava. However,additional research is needed to improve the process of reprogramming adult human cells in this way. The research was published in the journal of the International Society of Stem Cell Research,Stem Cell Reports,published by Cell Press.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1159115&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even healthy premature babies may be at high risk for lower academic achievement,especially in math,researchers say.</p>
<p>Premature children who are deemed &#8220;normal&#8221; in terms of their development at infant/toddler stages may still remain at risk for significant math difficulties,as well as deficits in attention,executive functions,and spatial skills,researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even healthy premature babies are at high risk for lower academic achievement,especially in math,&#8221; said researcher Natacha Akshoomoff.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of California,San Diego have received a five-year,grant for a longitudinal study designed to track the developmental trajectory in cognitive,academic and brain measures as very premature children transition from preschool to grade school.</p>
<p>Results will provide the foundation for designing appropriate learning interventions,researchers said.</p>
<p>The scientists predict that specific early perceptual and cognitive deficits will be related to math deficits that emerge as children start school.</p>
<p>They hope their results will greatly enhance understanding of why certain skills appear more vulnerable to premature birth,how this relates to early math deficiency,and how changes seen in the brain account for neurodevelopment outcomes in healthy preterm children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recent studies have identified a common pattern of subtle abnormality in the deep white matter of the brain among children born very premature. These early abnormalities may affect the subsequent development of widely distributed brain areas,and may account for the patterns of cognitive deficit that are observed later in childhood,&#8221; said Akshoomoff.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal of the current study is to provide these essential data as children enter a critical developmental stage when intervention may have the best potential to achieve better outcomes for these children,&#8221; said Akshoomoff.</p>
<p>Akshoomoff and a multidisciplinary team of investigators will utilise MRI imaging techniques to study links between affected brain areas and pathways and levels of performance on a set of neurocognitive and math functions.</p>
<p>Participants will include 60 healthy children born at 25 to 32 gestational weeks with average intelligence,and 40 full-term children matched for age,sex and verbal IQ.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1157152&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian scientists have created a beer which they claim can prevent dehydration and it may even spell the end of the dreaded hangover.</p>
<p>While beer has long been known to contain positive nutrients resulting from its plant origins and fermentation process,the alcohol content means it goes out faster than water which increases dehydration.</p>
<p>Dehydration is one of the main causes of alcohol hangover.</p>
<p>Scientists at the Griffith Health Institute (GHI) created the brew by adding electrolytes &#8211; minerals that keep the body&#8217;s fluid levels in balance and are commonly added in sports drinks.</p>
<p>They also had to reduce alcohol content in the beer to improve hydration.</p>
<p>&#8220;We basically manipulated the electrolyte levels of two commercial beers,one regular strength and one light beer and gave it to research subjects who&#8217;d just lost a significant amount of sweat by exercising. We then used several measures to monitor the participant&#8217;s fluid recovery to the different beers,&#8221; said Associate Professor Ben Desbrow from GHI&#8217;s Centre for Health Practice Innovation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of the four different beers the subjects consumed,our augmented light beer was by far the most well retained by the body,meaning it was the most effective at rehydrating the subjects.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;improved&#8217; light beer was actually a third more effective at hydrating a person than normal beer,&#8221; Desbrow said.</p>
<p>However,researchers warned against drinking beer after strenuous exercise,&#8217;newsmedical.net&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is definitely not a good idea,but what we&#8217;ve found is that many people who sweat a lot,especially tradesmen,knock off work and have a beer; it&#8217;s pretty normal. But alcohol in a dehydrated body can have all sorts of repercussions,including decreased awareness of risk,&#8221; Desbrow said.</p>
<p>The results were published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1156770&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drinking four cups of tea or coffee daily can help those with fatty liver disease keep their organ healthy,scientists,including one of Indian-origin,have found.</p>
<p>An international team of researchers led by Duke- National University of Singapore Graduate Medical School (Duke-NUS) and the Duke University School of Medicine suggest that increased caffeine intake may reduce fatty liver in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).</p>
<p>Worldwide,70 per cent of people diagnosed with diabetes and obesity have NAFLD,the major cause of fatty liver not due to excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>There are no effective treatments for NAFLD except diet and exercise.</p>
<p>Using cell culture and mouse models,the study authors &#8211; led by Paul Yen,associate professor and research fellow,and Rohit Sinha,of the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School&#8217;s Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Programme in Singapore &#8211; observed that caffeine stimulates the metabolisation of lipids stored in liver cells and decreased the fatty liver of mice that were fed a high-fat diet.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that consuming the equivalent caffeine intake of four cups of coffee or tea a day may be beneficial in preventing and protecting against the progression of NAFLD in humans,researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first detailed study of the mechanism for caffeine action on lipids in liver and the results are very interesting,&#8221; Yen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coffee and tea are so commonly consumed and the notion that they may be therapeutic,especially since they have a reputation for being &#8220;bad&#8221; for health,is especially enlightening,&#8221; Yen added.</p>
<p>The team said this research could lead to the development of caffeine-like drugs that do not have the usual side effects related to caffeine,but retain its therapeutic effects on the liver.</p>
<p>The findings will be published in the journal Hepatology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1156752&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The active ingredient in an over-the-counter skin cream may slow or stop the effects of Parkinson&#8217;s disease on brain cells,scientists have found.</p>
<p>Scientists are now testing the drug,called kinetin,in animal models of Parkinson&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kinetin is a great molecule to pursue because it&#8217;s already sold in drugstores as a topical anti-wrinkle cream,&#8221; said Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator Kevan Shokat of the University of California,San Francisco.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s a drug we know has been in people and is safe,&#8221; Shokat said.</p>
<p>Parkinson&#8217;s disease is a degenerative disease that causes the death of neurons in the brain. Initially,the disease affects one&#8217;s movement and causes tremors,difficulty walking,and slurred speech. Later stages of the disease can cause dementia and broader health problems.</p>
<p>In 2004,researchers studying an Italian family with a high prevalence of early-onset Parkinson&#8217;s disease discovered mutations in a protein called PINK1 associated with the inherited form of the disease.</p>
<p>Since then,studies have shown that PINK1 normally wedges into the membrane of damaged mitochondria inside cells that causes another protein,Parkin,to be recruited to the mitochondria,which are organelles responsible for energy generation.</p>
<p>Neurons require high levels of energy production,therefore when mitochondrial damage occurs,it can lead to neuronal death.</p>
<p>However,when Parkin is present on damaged mitochondria,studding the mitochondrial surface,the cell is able to survive the damage.</p>
<p>In people who inherit mutations in PINK1,however,Parkin is never recruited to the organelles,leading to more frequent neuronal death than usual.</p>
<p>Shokat and his colleagues wanted to develop a way to turn on or crank up PINK1 activity,therefore preventing an excess of cell death,in those with inherited Parkinson&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p>Researchers began investigating how PINK1 binds to ATP,the energy molecule that normally turns it on. In one test,instead of adding ATP to the enzymes,they added different ATP analogues,versions of ATP with altered chemical groups that slightly change its shape.</p>
<p>Scientists typically must engineer new versions of proteins to be able to accept these analogs,since they don&#8217;t fit into the typical ATP binding site.</p>
<p>However,one of the analogs &#8211; kinetin triphosphate,or KTP &#8211; turned on the activity of not only normal PINK1,but also the mutated version,which doesn&#8217;t bind ATP.</p>
<p>Adding the precursor of KTP,kinetin,to cells  both those with PINK1 mutations and those with normal physiology &#8211; amplified the activity of PINK1,increased the level of Parkin on damaged mitochondria,and decreased levels of neuron death,researchers found. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1156123&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heavy soft drink consumption is associated with aggression,attention problems and withdrawal behaviour in young children,a new study has found.</p>
<p>The study by researchers at Columbia University&#8217;s Mailman School of Public Health,University of Vermont,and Harvard School of Public Health assessed approximately 3,000 5-year-old children.</p>
<p>The kids were enrolled in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study,a prospective birth cohort that follows mother-child pairs from 20 large US cities.</p>
<p>Mothers reported their child&#8217;s soft drink consumption and completed the Child Behaviour Checklist based on their child&#8217;s behaviour during the previous two months.</p>
<p>The researchers found that 43 per cent of the children consumed at least 1 serving of soft drinks per day,and 4 per cent consumed 4 or more.</p>
<p>Aggression,withdrawal,and attention problems were associated with soda consumption. Even after adjusting for sociodemographic factors,maternal depression,intimate partner violence,and paternal incarceration,any soft drink consumption was linked to increased aggressive behaviour.</p>
<p>Children who drank 4 or more soft drinks per day were more than twice as likely to destroy things belonging to others,get into fights,and physically attack people.</p>
<p>They also had increased attention problems and withdrawal behaviour compared with those who did not consume soft drinks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that the child&#8217;s aggressive behaviour score increased with every increase in soft drinks servings per day,&#8221; said Shakira Suglia,Mailman School assistant professor of Epidemiology.</p>
<p>Although this study cannot identify the exact nature of the association between soft drink consumption and problem behaviours,limiting or eliminating a child&#8217;s soft drink consumption may reduce behavioural problems,researchers said.</p>
<p>The study was published in The Journal of Pediatrics. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1156118&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed a whole new class of drugs that,for the first time,targets the structure of the cancer cell,paving way for new treatments to tackle the disease.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) demonstrated that the therapy is effective in two types of cancers in the animal model &#8211; neuroblastoma,a cancer that affects children,and melanoma,skin cancer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our drug causes the structure of the cancer cell to collapse &#8211; and it happens relatively quickly. We&#8217;ve been surprised and excited by the potential of this treatment,&#8221; said lead study author,Professor Peter Gunning,from UNSW Medicine.</p>
<p>The drug seems to be effective against every type of cancer cell.</p>
<p>The work could lead to an entirely new type of chemotherapy,which could have more positive outcomes for hard-to-treat cancers and have fewer long-term side effects for survivors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Attacking the architecture of the cancer cell has long been an obvious target,but until now,attempts have failed because the building blocks of the structure of the cancer cell are also used to build the heart and muscle,so the toxicity was unacceptable,&#8221; said the first author on the paper,Dr Justine Stehn from the Oncology Research Unit,in the School of Medical Sciences.</p>
<p>But the team recognised there was a second &#8220;building block&#8221;,the protein tropomyosin,in the cancer cell structure that was sufficiently different from those in the heart and muscle,which could be safely targeted.</p>
<p>The study was published in journal Cancer Research.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1156096&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have identified a new type of bone marrow stem cell in mice that is primed to produce large numbers of vital blood-clotting platelets. The breakthrough may eventually lead to the development of new treatments to restore platelets in patients who have undergone chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant. The research was led by the Medical Research Council Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (WIMM),at the University of Oxford.</p>
<p>Blood cells are made by a small pool of stem cells in the bone marrow,which replenish the blood at a rate of millions of cells per second. These cells can self-renew (copy themselves) and give rise to all the different cell types that make up the blood system,including white and red blood cells,and platelets. Platelets help the blood to clot by clumping together at the site of bleeding. Having too few platelets can result in excessive bleeding and is a common side effect in cancer patients,whose natural reservoir of platelets has been destroyed by the disease or by treatment. </p>
<p>This can be life-threatening in the weeks immediately following chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant as it takes time for blood stem cells to replenish platelets to safe levels. Scientists believed there was just one type of blood stem cell. This study,led by Professors Sten Eirik W Jacobsen and Claus Nerlov,has revealed a previously undiscovered subset of platelet-primed blood stem cells that can self-renew and produce some other cell types that make up the blood,but are particularly geared towards platelet production. The researchers also found that different subtypes of blood stem cell are organised into a hierarchy,with platelet-primed cells at the top. These platelet-primed cells are able to also replenish other stem cell types that mostly generate the vital blood cells of the immune system.</p>
<p>Transplanting just one platelet-primed stem cell into mice that lacked their own bone marrow was enough to stably restore more than 10 per cent of their platelets,suggesting that these cells can generate a huge number of platelets in a sustainable manner. Future studies by the group will focus on whether or not this can be achieved quickly enough to benefit patients in a clinical transplantation setting. The study was published in journal Nature.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1155382&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have identified a molecule called interleukin-11 as a potential new target for anti-cancer therapies. Until now,the importance of interleukin-11 in cancer development has been underestimated,but Melbourne researchers have recently identified this molecule as a &#8216;dark horse&#8217; for the development of cancer. Their discovery suggests blocking interleukin-11 signalling could ultimately provide an exciting new approach to the treatment of bowel and stomach cancer,which are two of the most common cancers worldwide. When a tumour develops,the normal (non-cancerous) tissues around it can become inflamed,and produce many different molecules,including the two related proteins interleukin-11 and interleukin-6. These hormone-like signalling molecules,referred to as cytokines,are thought to promote the growth and spread of cancer cells,but interleukin-11 was thought to have only a minor,if any,role during cancer development. </p>
<p>However,Dr Tracy Putoczki and Associate Professor Matthias Ernst from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute&#8217;s Cell Signalling and Cell Death division have now shown that interleukin-11 is one of the most important cytokines that stimulate the growth and spread of cancers. Working with scientists at the Melbourne-based pharmaceutical company CSL Ltd,they discovered that blocking interleukin-11 in models of stomach and bowel cancer stopped tumour growth and could lead to tumour shrinkage,making this cytokine a promising potential new target for treating many types of solid cancers. Putoczki said the team was stunned to discover that interleukin-11 was much more potent in promoting cancer development than interleukin-6. Ernst said the team had begun to explore how the discovery could be applied to potential new anti-cancer  therapies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Treating cancers with agents that block cytokine signalling is an exciting new approach that potentially has advantages over current treatment strategies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Drugs that block the action of cytokines have previously been developed for both inflammatory disease and cancer and,in the case of interleukin-11,our work does not suggest the likelihood of undesirable side-effects. &#8220;Moreover,agents that inhibit interleukin-6 signalling are already in clinical trials for ovarian,kidney,prostate and breast cancer. Our discovery paves the way for trials of agents that stifle interleukin-11,&#8221; Ernst said. The study was published in the journal Cancer Cell.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1155374&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pregnant women who don&#8217;t produce enough thyroid hormone are nearly four times likelier to give birth to autistic children than their healthy peers,a new study has claimed. Scientists from the Houston Methodist Neurological Institute in US and Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam,Netherlands studied more than 4,000 Dutch mothers and their children. Their results support the growing view that autism spectrum disorders can be caused by a lack of maternal thyroid hormone,which past studies have shown is crucial to the migration of foetal brain cells during embryo development.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is increasingly apparent to us that autism is caused by environmental factors in most cases,not by genetics. That gives me hope that prevention is possible,&#8221; said lead author Gustavo Roman,a neurologist and neuroepidemiologist who directs the Nantz National Alzheimer Center. The researchers also found that autistic children had more pronounced symptoms if their mothers were severely deficient for T4,also called thyroxine. Mild T4 deficiencies in mothers produced an insignificant increase in autistic children&#8217;s symptoms. The most common cause of thyroid hormone deficiency is a lack of dietary iodine &#8211; because both the thyroid hormones,T3 and T4,contain that element.</p>
<p>The present work was based on the Generation R Study,conducted by Erasmus Medical Centre doctors and social scientists,in which thousands of pregnant women were voluntarily enrolled between 2002 and 2006. Researchers identified 80 &#8220;probable autistic children&#8221; from a population of 4,039. Around 159 mothers were identified as being severely T4 deficient (defined as having 5 per cent or less of normal T4,but producing a normal amount of thyroid stimulating hormone),and 136 were identified as mildly T4 deficient.</p>
<p>The researchers found a weak association between mild T4 deficiency and the likelihood of producing an autistic child,but a strong association between severe T4 deficiency and autism (3.89 more likely,as compared with mothers with normal thyroid hormone). The study presents a troubling correlation,but it does not prove that the thyroid function of expecting mothers causes autism in their children,researchers said. The study will be published in the journal Annals of Neurology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1155325&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Art collector Charles Saatchi is allegedly threatening to commit suicide in a desperate bid to win back chef Nigella Lawson.</p>
<p>Lawson,53,recently divorced the British art collector after he was photographed choking her at a London restaurant.</p>
<p>Saatchi has been sending Lawson harassing messages,begging her to contact him in the days after the couple were granted a decree nisi in the High Court,reported New York Daily News quoting her friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Charles has been texting and phoning Nigella endlessly. One minute he&#8217;s pleading,the next bullying. Her silence has been driving him crazy,&#8221; a source told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Lawson reportedly received a panicked text message from Saatchi&#8217;s 18-year-old daughter Phoebe too,who expressed concerns about her father&#8217;s behaviour.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1154348&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An emotionally close relationship between grandparents and their grandkids may ward off depression in both,a new study has found.</p>
<p>US researchers found that grandparents and grandchildren have real,measurable effects on each other&#8217;s psychological well-being long into grandchildren&#8217;s adulthood.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that an emotionally close grandparent-adult grandchild relationship was associated with fewer symptoms of depression for both generations,&#8221; said Sara M Moorman,an assistant professor in the Department of Sociology at Boston College.</p>
<p>&#8220;The greater emotional support grandparents and adult grandchildren received from one another,the better their psychological health,&#8221; Moorman said.</p>
<p>The study also found that giving tangible support to or receiving it from their grandchildren affected the psychological well-being of grandparents but not grandchildren.</p>
<p>Tangible support,also called functional solidarity or instrumental support,includes anything from rides to the store and money to assistance with household chores and advice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grandparents who experienced the sharpest increases in depressive symptoms over time received tangible support,but did not give it,&#8221; said Moorman,who co-authored the study with Jeffrey E Stokes,a PhD candidate in sociology at Boston College.</p>
<p>Comparatively,the researchers found that grandparents who both gave and received tangible support experienced the fewest symptoms of depression over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore,encouraging more grandparents and adult grandchildren to engage in this type of exchange may be a fruitful way to reduce depression in older adults,&#8221; said Moorman.</p>
<p>Researchers used data from the Longitudinal Study of Generations,that included seven waves of data collection between 1985 and 2004.</p>
<p>The sample comprised 376 grandparents and 340 grandchildren. The average grandparent was born in 1917 and the average grandchild in 1963,making them 77 years old and 31 years old,respectively,at the midpoint of the study in 1994.</p>
<p>The study was presented at the 108th Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1154337&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have identified genetic mutations linked to Parkinson&#8217;s disease that play a key role in the death of brain cells.</p>
<p>Researchers from University College London,the University of Cambridge and the University of Sheffield showed how defects in the Parkinson&#8217;s gene Fbxo7 cause problems with &#8216;mitaphagy&#8217; &#8211; an essential process through which our bodies are able to get rid of damaged cells.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are the &#8216;energy powerhouses&#8217; of cells. Their function is vital in nerve cells which require a great deal of energy in order to function and survive.</p>
<p>Dysfunctional mitochondria are potentially very harmful and,normally,cells dispose of the damaged mitchondria by self-eating them,a process called mitophagy.</p>
<p>Previously,two genes associated with familial Parkinson&#8217;s disease,PINK1 and Parkin,have been reported to play a role in mitophagy.</p>
<p>The new study shows just how central the role of mitophagy is and how mutations in Fbxo7 are also linked with the disease and interfere with the PINK1-Parkin pathway.</p>
<p>In people with Parkinson&#8217;s,genetic mutations cause defects in mitophagy,leading to a build-up of dysfunctional mitochondria. This is likely to explain,at least partially,the death of brain cells in Parkinson&#8217;s patients with these mutations.</p>
<p>&#8220;These findings suggest that treatment strategies that target mitophagy might be developed to benefit patients with Parkinson&#8217;s disease in the future,&#8221; said one of the lead authors,Dr Helene Plun-Favreau from the UCL Institute of Neurology.</p>
<p>The study was published in journal Nature Neuroscience.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1154313&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using advanced gene technology,Australian scientists along with a US team have claimed to have found new genes and genetic mutation that causes severe childhood epilepsies.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Sam Berkovic,Director of the Epilepsy Research Centre at the University of Melbourne and Melbourne&#8217;s Austin Hospital,said,as well as providing a pathway to treating epilepsy the research provides answers to patients and families who previously had little or no idea where epilepsy had come from,the AAP news agency reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parents often have a belief that they&#8217;ve done something wrong that caused this disease,&#8221; Berkovic said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not knowing why has been one of the most frustrating things. We&#8217;ve never really had the answer. Now we do. This also stops the need for further searching and refines the treatments,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the research has been the ability to sequence the entire human genome,Berkovic said adding &#8220;Until now we&#8217;ve had these complex patients and we didn&#8217;t know what was going on. Now all the genes are known and the jigsaw can be completed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>By using the latest genetic techniques to sequence and analyse DNA of 4,000 epilepsy patients and their relatives,the study known called Epi4Ks shared DNA sequences and patient information among dozens of research institutions.</p>
<p>The researchers compared the exomes,or the complete sets of genes,of 264 children with the sequences of their parents who do not have epilepsy.</p>
<p>Differences in the sequences of parents and children were analysed to identify potential disease-causing mutations.</p>
<p>The study&#8217;s other joint leader Dr David Goldstein,the Director of the Human Genome Variation Centre at Duke University Medical Centre in the US,said his team&#8217;s work identified an unusually large number of disease-causing mutations and provided a wealth of new information.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now headed toward a future where we can find out why people have this disease and tailor the treatment of it. It establishes a clear path to the genetic explanation of epilepsy,&#8221; Dr Goldstein said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1154248&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Woman&#8217;s best friend! Researchers have trained dogs to sniff out the signature chemical compound that indicates the presence of ovarian cancer with 100 per cent accuracy.</p>
<p>Ohlin Frank,a trained chocolate Labrador has been able to detect ovarian cancer tissue 100 per cent of the time,researchers said.</p>
<p>Frank and its fellow trainee,McBaine Chamberlain,a spunky springer spaniel,are a part of an interdisciplinary research project at the University of Pennsylvania to help scientists discover a chemical footprint that might lead to earlier diagnostic tests to save human lives.</p>
<p>They are among 15 carefully bred detection dogs learning to sniff out explosives,drugs and missing people.</p>
<p>Researchers are using the keen sense of smell of the dogs to identify the earliest odour of ovarian cancer,a silent killer often diagnosed too late,&#8217;ABCNews.com&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>Cancer cells leave a detectable bio-marker,just as asparagus can affect the smell of urine when eaten.</p>
<p>Penn Vet founder and executive director Cynthia M Otto hopes the dogs can be trained to narrow down a specific odour within two years,so scientists can design an inexpensive and less-invasive blood test to catch ovarian cancer while it&#8217;s still treatable.</p>
<p>&#8220;All dogs are really good at sniffing,but part of what gives them a huge advantage over us is the surface area of the olfactory receptors,&#8221; Otto said.</p>
<p>The dogs have already been introduced to the cancer tissue smell and were taught to sit when they found it.</p>
<p>Otto&#8217;s work builds on a 2010 Swedish study,which used pet giant schnauzers to detect ovarian cancer. Tissue tests showed sensitivity of 100 per cent and specificity of 95 per cent; blood tests showed sensitivity of 100 per cent and specificity of 98 per cent,the report said.</p>
<p>Dogs with long noses have the largest surface areas of olfactory receptors,said researchers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1153952&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 100,000 people have applied for a one-way trip to Mars,as a part of the ambitious multi-billion dollar project that aims to colonise the Red planet starting in 2022.</p>
<p>While it remains questionable how humans would be able to survive on Mars,it has not stopped a whopping number of people from signing up for the The Mars One project.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is also a very large number of people who are still working on their profile,so either they have decided not to pay the application fee,or they are still making their video or they&#8217;re still filling out the questionnaire or their resume. So the people that you can see on-line are only the ones that have finished and who have set their profiles as public,&#8221; said Bas Lansdorp,Mars One CEO and co-founder.</p>
<p>Lansdorp did not specify how many have paid the fees,completed their profiles and configured them as private.</p>
<p>The application process specifies anyone 18 or older may apply,but the fee depends on a user&#8217;s nationality. For US citizens,the application fee is USD 38,&#8217;CNN&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The company said it sets the price based on the gross domestic product per capita of each nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted it to be high enough for people to have to really think about it and low  enough for anyone to be able to afford it,&#8221; Lansdorp said.</p>
<p>As far as the first crew is concerned,the mission will cost USD 6 billion,Lansdorp said.</p>
<p>He said the idea is for it to be funded by sponsors and media that will pay for broadcasting rights of shows and movies documenting everything from the astronauts&#8217; training on Earth to their deployment and colonisation of Mars.</p>
<p>Mars One said,out of the applicants,it will select a multi-continental group of 40 astronauts this year. Four of them &#8211; two men and two women &#8211; are set to leave for Mars in September 2022,landing in April 2023.</p>
<p>One more group of four will be deployed two years later. None of them will return to Earth,according to the mission plan.</p>
<p>The astronauts will undergo a required eight-year training. They will learn how to repair habitat structures,grow vegetables in confined spaces and address &#8220;both routine and serious medical issues such as dental upkeep,muscle tears and bone fractures,&#8221; according to the project site.</p>
<p>Lansdorp said each lander the project sends will be able to carry about 5,511 pounds of &#8220;useful load&#8221; to Mars.</p>
<p>Despite the risks of space travel,the Mars One founder said he is convinced of the viability of the project.</p>
<p>However,some space travel experts have said the risks are far too high to carry out these manned missions to Mars,a distance that humans have never travelled.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1153930&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost 64 per cent men believe that women should pay their share on a date,even though majority of males feel guilty accepting money from a lady,a new study has found.</p>
<p>Most men feel strongly that women should split the bill on a date. Nearly half of men (44 per cent) said they would stop dating a woman who never shells out any money.</p>
<p>Over half (57 per cent) of women claim they offer to help pay,but many women (39 per cent) confessed they secretly hope men would reject their offers to pay.</p>
<p>Nearly 44 per cent of women were bothered when men expected women to help pay.</p>
<p>The study by Chapman University&#8217;s David Frederick and colleagues from California State University and Wellesley College surveyed more than 17,000 participants.</p>
<p>Researchers found that consistent with conventional norms,most men (84 per cent) and women (58 per cent) reported that men pay for most expenses,even after dating for a while.</p>
<p>A large majority of men (76 per cent),reported feeling guilty accepting women&#8217;s money.</p>
<p>In terms of behaviour,even if men are paying a larger proportion of expenses,4 in 10 men and women agreed that dating expenses were at least partially shared within the first month.</p>
<p>Around three-fourths (74 per cent of men,83 per cent of women) reported some sharing of expenses by six months.</p>
<p>The study was presented at the 108th Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association in New York.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1153928&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new malaria vaccine,which is being developed in the US,has shown promising results in early stage clinical trials,scientists say. Researchers found that high doses of the vaccine protected 12 out of 15 patients from the disease. The vaccine involves injecting live but weakened malaria-causing parasites directly into patients to trigger immunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were excited and thrilled by the result,but it is important that we repeat it,extend it and do it in larger numbers,&#8221; said lead author Dr Robert Seder,from the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health,in Maryland. Previous research has found that exposure to mosquitoes treated with radiation can protect against malaria. But studies have shown that it takes more than 1,000 bites from the insects over time to build up a high level of immunity.</p>
<p>A US biotech company called Sanaria took lab-grown mosquitoes,irradiated them and then extracted the malaria-causing parasite (Plasmodium falciparum),all under the sterile conditions. These living but weakened parasites are then counted and placed in vials,where they can then be injected directly into a patient&#8217;s bloodstream. This vaccine candidate is called PfSPZ.</p>
<p>To carry out the Phase-1 clinical trial,the researchers looked at a group of 57 volunteers,none of whom had had malaria before. Of these,40 received different doses of the vaccine,while 17 did not. They were then all exposed to the malaria-carrying mosquitoes,&#8217;BBC News&#8217; reported. The researchers found that for the participants not given any vaccine,and those given low doses,almost all became infected with malaria.</p>
<p>However,for the small group given the highest dosage,only three of the 15 patients became infected after exposure to malaria. &#8220;Based on the history,we knew dose was important because you needed 1,000 mosquito bites to get protection  this validates that,&#8221; Seder said. &#8220;It allows us in future studies to increase the dose and alter the schedule of the vaccine to further optimise it. The next critical questions will be whether the vaccine is durable over a long period of time and can the vaccine protect against other strains of malaria,&#8221; he said. The results were published in the journal Science.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1153311&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Autism affects brain differently in men and women,a new study has found. Scientists from the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge studied brain scans of 120 men and women,with half of the participants suffering from autism.</p>
<p>Autism is more prevalent in boys,so most research on the condition has focused on the male gender.</p>
<p>The new study used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine how autism affects the brain of males and females.</p>
<p>The study looked at the difference between the brains of healthy males and those with autism &#8211; and then healthy females and those with autism.</p>
<p>They found the brains of females with autism &#8220;look&#8221; more like &#8211; but still not the same as &#8211; healthy males,when compared with healthy females,BBC News reported.</p>
<p>However,the same kind of difference was not seen in males with autism &#8211; so their brains did not show &#8220;extreme&#8221; male characteristics.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have known about autism to date is mainly male-biased. This research shows that it is possible that the effect of autism manifests differently according to one&#8217;s gender,&#8221; said Dr Meng-Chuan Lai,who worked on the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore we should not blindly assume that everything found for males or from male-predominant mixed samples will apply to females,&#8221; Lai said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Brain.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1153304&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed a new system that tells you how likely it is for you to fall ill if you visit a particular restaurant by &#8216;listening&#8217; to the tweets from other restaurant patrons. The University of Rochester researchers said their system,nEmesis,can help people make more informed decisions,and it also has the potential to complement traditional public health methods for monitoring food safety,such as restaurant inspections. The new system combines machine-learning and crowdsourcing techniques to analyse millions of tweets to find people reporting food poisoning symptoms following a restaurant visit. This volume of tweets would be impossible to analyse manually,the researchers noted.</p>
<p>Over a four-month period,the system collected 3.8 million tweets from more than 94,000 unique users in New York City,traced 23,000 restaurant visitors,and found 480 reports of likely food poisoning. They also found they correlate fairly well with public inspection data by the local health department. The system ranks restaurants according to how likely it is for someone to become ill after visiting that restaurant. &#8220;The Twitter reports are not an exact indicator  any individual case could well be due to factors unrelated to the restaurant meal &#8211; but in aggregate the numbers are revealing,&#8221; said Henry Kautz,chair of the computer science department at the University of Rochester and co-author of the paper.</p>
<p>In other words,a &#8220;seemingly random collection of online rants becomes an actionable alert,&#8221; according to Kautz,which can help detect cases of foodborne illness in a timely manner. The system &#8220;listens&#8221; to relevant public tweets and detects restaurant visits by matching up where a person tweets from and the known locations of restaurants. People will often tweet from their phones or other mobile devices,which are GPS enabled. This means that tweets can be &#8220;geotagged&#8221;: the tweet not only provides information in the 140 characters allowed,but also about where the user was at the time.</p>
<p>If a user tweets from a location that is determined to be a restaurant (by using the locations of 24,904 restaurants that had been visited by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in New York City),the system will continue to track this person&#8217;s tweets for 72 hours,even when they&#8217;re not geotagged,or when they are tweeted from a different device. If a user then tweets about feeling ill,the system captures the information that this person is now ill and had visited a specific restaurant.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1152950&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Higher blood-sugar levels  but not high enough to cause diabetes  may increase the risk of developing the memory-robbing disease dementia,a new major study of over 2,000 volunteers has found.</p>
<p>The study suggests a potential way to prevent Alzheimer&#8217;s disease by keeping glucose at a healthy level,researchers said.</p>
<p>Researchers found that blood sugar levels averaged over a five-year period were associated with rising risks for developing dementia,in the report about more than 2,000 Group Health patients aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>For example,in people without diabetes,risk for dementia was 18 per cent higher for people with an average glucose level of 115 milligrams per deciliter compared to those with an average glucose level of 100 mg/dl.</p>
<p>And in people with diabetes,whose blood sugar levels are generally higher,dementia risk was 40 per cent higher for people with an average glucose level of 190 mg/dl compared to those with an average glucose level of 160 mg/dl.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most interesting finding was that every incrementally higher glucose level was associated with a higher risk of dementia in people who did not have diabetes,&#8221; said first author Paul K Crane,from the University of Washington.</p>
<p>&#8220;One major strength of this research is that it is based on the ACT study,a longitudinal cohort study,where we follow people for many years as they lead their lives,&#8221; said senior author Eric B Larson.</p>
<p>&#8220;We combine information from people&#8217;s research visits every other year with data from their visits to Group Health providers whenever they receive care. And this gave us an average of 17 blood sugar measurements per person: very rich data,&#8221; said Larson.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we found was that people with higher levels of glucose had a higher risk of dementia,on average,than did people with lower levels of glucose,&#8221; Crane said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1152879&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parents,please note! Toddlers who watch television daily for more than two hours may risk diminishing their vocabulary and math skills,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>Every hourly increase in daily television watching at 29 months of age is also associated with reduced classroom engagement (which is largely determined by attention skills) and physical prowess at kindergarten,according to Professor Linda Pagani of the University of Montreal and the CHU Sainte-Justine children&#8217;s hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time ever that a stringently controlled associational birth cohort study has looked at and found a relationship between too much toddler screen time and kindergarten risks for poor motor skills and psychosocial difficulties,like victimisation by classmates,&#8221; Pagani said.</p>
<p>&#8220;These findings suggest the need for better parental awareness and compliance with existing viewing recommendations put forth by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).</p>
<p>&#8220;The AAP discourages watching television during infancy and recommends not more than two hours per day beyond age 2. It seems that every extra hour beyond that has a remarkably negative influence,&#8221; Pagani said.</p>
<p>The study included 991 girls and 1,006 boys in Quebec,whose parents reported their television viewing behaviour as part of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development.</p>
<p>Pagani noted that the standard deviation is a commonly used statistic tool that tells us what is within a normal range compared to the average.</p>
<p>One standard deviation from the average daily amount of television viewed by the toddlers in this sample (105 minutes) was taken as 72 minutes.</p>
<p>Some of the children who participated in the study were two or even three standard deviations away from the average,and their kindergarten indicators were correspondingly worse than those who were one standard deviation away,researchers found.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1152871&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have decoded an important molecular signal that guides the development of a key region of the brain known as the neocortex,responsible for long-term memory,reasoning and complex muscle actions.</p>
<p>The largest and most recently evolved region of the brain,the neocortex is particularly well developed in humans.</p>
<p>&#8220;The mammalian neocortex has a distinctive structure featuring six layers of neurons,and our finding helps explain how this layered structure is generated in early life,&#8221; said Ulrich Mueller,chair of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI)&#8217;s Department of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience and director of the Dorris Neuroscience Center at TSRI.</p>
<p>The discovery appearing in the journal Neuron is likely to aid research on autism,schizophrenia and other psychiatric conditions.</p>
<p>The signal uncovered by Mueller&#8217;s team is one that helps guide the migration of baby neurons through the developing neocortex.</p>
<p>Such neurons are born from stem-like cells at the bottom of the neocortex,where it wraps around a large,fluid-filled space in the brain called ventricle.</p>
<p>The newborn neurons then migrate upward,or radially away from the ventricle,being directed to their proper places in the neocortex&#8217;s six-layered,columnar structure by  among others &#8211; special guide cells called Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells.</p>
<p>Previously,scientists had discovered a key signalling protein,reelin,which CR cells secrete and baby neocortical neurons must detect to migrate properly.</p>
<p>There have been hints since then that CR cells and baby neocortical neurons exchange other molecular signals,too.</p>
<p>In a study published in 2011,Mueller and his laboratory colleagues discovered that reelin guides neuronal migration at least in part by boosting baby neurons&#8217; expression of a generic cell-adhesion molecule,cadherin2 (Cdh2).</p>
<p>Since Cdh2 can be expressed by almost any cell type in the developing neocortex,the team then began to look for other factors that would account for the specificity of the</p>
<p>interaction between CR cells and migrating baby neurons.</p>
<p>One set of candidates were the nectins  cell-adhesion proteins known to work with cadherins in other contexts.</p>
<p>&#8220;We observed that nectin1 is expressed specifically by CR cells and nectin3 by migrating neurons. At the same time,we knew from previous research that nectin1 and nectin3 are preferred binding partners,&#8221; said lead author Cristina Gil-Sanz.</p>
<p>Gil-Sanz and her colleagues followed up with other experiments and soon confirmed that the hookup of nectin1 on CR cells with nectin3 on baby neurons is essential for proper neuronal migration.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1152862&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drinking two cups of hot chocolate a day may help older people keep their brains healthy and their thinking skills sharp,according to a new study.</p>
<p>US researchers studied 60 people with an average age of 73 who did not have dementia. The participants drank two cups of hot cocoa per day for 30 days and did not consume any other chocolate during the study.</p>
<p>They were given tests of memory and thinking skills. They also had ultrasounds tests to measure the amount of blood flow to the brain during the tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re learning more about blood flow in the brain and its effect on thinking skills,&#8221; said study author Farzaneh A  Sorond,of Harvard Medical School in Boston and a member of the American Academy of Neurology.</p>
<p>&#8220;As different areas of the brain need more energy to complete their tasks,they also need greater blood flow. This relationship,called neurovascular coupling,may play an important role in diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s,&#8221; Sorond said.</p>
<p>Of the 60 participants,18 had impaired blood flow at the start of the study. Those people had an 8.3 per cent improvement in the blood flow to the working areas of the brain by the end of the study,while there was no improvement for those who started out with regular blood flow.</p>
<p>The people with impaired blood flow also improved their times on a test of working memory,with scores dropping from 167 seconds at the beginning of the study to 116 seconds at the end. There was no change in times for people with regular blood flow.</p>
<p>A total of 24 of the participants also had MRI scans of the brain to look for tiny areas of brain damage. The scans found that people with impaired blood flow were also more likely to have these areas of brain damage.</p>
<p>Half of the study participants received hot cocoa that was rich in the antioxidant flavanol,while the other half received flavanol-poor hot cocoa. There were no differences between the two groups in the results.</p>
<p>&#8220;More work is needed to prove a link between cocoa,blood flow problems and cognitive decline. But this is an important first step that could guide future studies,&#8221; said Paul B Rosenberg,of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore,who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.</p>
<p>The study was published in Neurology,the journal of the American Academy of Neurology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1152839&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 59-year-old UK man claims that he has cured his diabetes in just 11 days after following a miracle &#8216;starvation&#8217; diet developed by scientists from a British university. Richard Doughty,from London,was shocked when a routine health check revealed he had Type 2 diabetes. &#8220;I was stunned. I have always been a healthy weight,5ft 7in and 10st 7lb. I had no family history of diabetes,ate a healthy diet,never smoked and I did not have a sweet tooth,&#8221; Doughty said. While researching on the internet,he found Newcastle University scientists had devised a low-calorie diet said to reverse diabetes in eight weeks.</p>
<p>It involved eating 800 calories a day a man&#8217;s recommended intake is 2,500,the &#8216;Daily Express&#8217; reported. This was made up of 600 calories from meal replacement shakes and soups and 200 calories from green vegetables,plus three litres of water a day. The diet was devised by Roy Taylor,professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle. The diet is based on the fact that Type 2 diabetes is often caused by fat clogging up the liver and pancreas,which are crucial in producing insulin and controlling blood sugar. 	Taylor&#8217;s studies found that drastic dieting causes the body to go into starvation mode and burn fat stores for energy ¿ and the fat around the organs seems to be targeted first.</p>
<p>This leads to the liver and pancreas becoming unclogged and insulin and blood sugar levels returning to normal. With the consent of his general practitioner (GP),Doughty followed the diet,setting a target weight of 8 stones and 12 pounds. &#8220;I stuck to the diet for 11 days and reduced my blood sugar to a healthy non-diabetic level. It has remained that way for the past year and I have kept to just under 9 stones,&#8221; Doughty said. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1152447&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eating raw garlic twice a week can nearly halve the risk of developing lung cancer,even lowering the danger for smokers,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>Chinese researchers found that those who consumed raw garlic as part of their diet were 44 per cent less likely to suffer the disease.</p>
<p>Even when they allowed for whether people smoked  the biggest single cause of lung cancer the scientists found garlic still seemed to reduce the dangers by around 30 per cent,the &#8216;Telegraph&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>Previous research has suggested that the popular herb can ward off stomach cancer and colon cancer,and a study at the University of South Australia suggested that it could reduce the risk of bowel tumours by nearly a third.</p>
<p>Scientists at Jiangsu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention compared 1,424 lung cancer patients with 4,500 healthy adults.</p>
<p>They found that those who ate raw garlic at least twice a week were significantly less likely to get lung cancer,even if they smoked or were exposed to high-temperature cooking oil fumes,which is thought to be another trigger for the disease.</p>
<p>The key ingredient behind this effect seems to be a chemical called allicin,released when the clove is crushed or chopped,according to previous studies.</p>
<p>It is thought to dampen down inflammation in the body and act as an anti-oxidant,reducing damage from so-called free radicals to the body&#8217;s cells.</p>
<p>However,it is not clear whether cooked garlic would have the same effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Garlic may potentially serve as a preventive agent for lung cancer,&#8221; researchers said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1152345&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists studying girls with the eating disorder anorexia have found they show a mild echo of the characteristics of autism &#8211; a finding which could point to new ways of helping anorexics overcome their illness. A study by the leading autism expert Simon Baron-Cohen at Cambridge University&#8217;s Autism Research Centre found that compared to typical girls,those with anorexia have an above-average number of autistic traits.</p>
<p>They were also found to have an above-average interest in systems and order,and below-average scores in empathy &#8211; a profile similar,but less pronounced,to that seen in people with autism,suggesting the two disorders may have common underlying features,Baron-Cohen said. &#8220;Traditionally,anorexia has been viewed purely as an eating disorder. This is quite reasonable,since the girls&#8217; dangerously low weight and their risk of malnutrition or even death has to be the highest priority,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But this new research is suggesting that underlying the surface behaviour,the mind of a person with anorexia may share a lot with the mind of a person with autism. In both conditions,there is a strong interest in systems. In girls with anorexia,they have latched onto a system that concerns body weight,shape,and food intake.&#8221;</p>
<p>People with autism have varying levels of impairment across three main areas &#8211; social interaction and empathy or understanding,repetitive behaviour and interests,and language and communication Cohen noted that autism and anorexia share certain features,such as rigid attitudes and behaviours,a tendency to be very self-focused,and a fascination with detail. Both disorders also share similar differences in the structure and function of brain regions involved in social perception.</p>
<p>OVERLOOKED</p>
<p>As many as one in 50 school age children in the United States are diagnosed with autism. In Europe experts say the rate is around one in 100 children. Most cases are diagnosed in boys. But Bonnie Auyeung,who worked with Baron-Cohen on this latest research,said its findings suggested a proportion of females with autism may be being overlooked or misdiagnosed because doctors see them first with anorexia.</p>
<p>The study,published in the BioMed Central journal Molecular Autism,tested how 66 girls aged 12 to 18 with anorexia but without autism scored on tests to measure autistic traits. The researchers compared them to more than 1,600 typical teenagers in the same age range,measuring their autistic traits using a score called the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ),their &#8220;systemising&#8221; using the Systemising Quotient (SQ),and their empathy using the Empathy Quotient (EQ).</p>
<p>They found that compared to typical girls on the AQ,five times more girls with anorexia scored in the range where people with autism score. On tests of empathy and systemising,girls with anorexia had a higher SQ,and a reduced EQ,a profile the researchers said parallels that seen in autism.</p>
<p>Tony Jaffa,who co-led the study,said acknowledging that some anorexic patients may also have a higher than normal number of autistic traits and a love of systems offers specialists new ideas for ways to treat people with the eating disorder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shifting their interest away from body weight and dieting on to a different but equally systematic topic may be helpful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;(And) recognising that some patients with anorexia may also need help with social skills and communication,and with adapting to change,also gives us a new treatment angle.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1151772&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women across the US are risking their lives for illegal procedures to make their buttocks bigger,often involving home-improvement materials such as silicone injected by people with no medical training.</p>
<p>Some want to fill out a bikini or a pair of jeans. Others believe a bigger bottom will bring them work as music video models or adult entertainers. Whatever the reason,they are seeking cheaper alternatives to plastic surgery sometimes with deadly or disfiguring results.</p>
<p>Deaths from illegal buttocks injections have been reported in Alabama,Georgia,Florida,Pennsylvania,Nevada and New York. An interior decorator in Mississippi faces trial in the deaths of two women who were injected at her house.</p>
<p>Though there is little data on the procedures or injuries they cause,doctors and authorities say they are seeing them more often. Online forums used to set up the illegal procedures have attracted thousands of responses.</p>
<p>Very big buttocks have been popular in hip-hop videos for years. But Dionne Stephens,who studies race,gender and sexuality in hip-hop culture at Florida International University,said celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez,Beyonce and Kim Kardashian are popularizing the look among an increasing number of women of all races and ethnicities.</p>
<p>For 46-year-old Apryl Michelle Brown,the path to an illegal injection started with people teasing her as a child about having a &#8220;pancake butt.&#8221; Years later,a woman walked into Brown&#8217;s beauty salon in California and told her she could make her butt bigger with injections.</p>
<p>The following week,she was at the woman&#8217;s house getting injections.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before the injection sites got hard and painful. Brown eventually began looking for doctors to remove the material,which she learned was an industrial silicone available at a home improvement store.</p>
<p>After surgery in 2011,a staph infection left her near death. Both hands and feet were amputated.</p>
<p>Today,Brown has a website and speaks on the topic,trying to convince others that they are beautiful the way they are. Despite a lack of data,there&#8217;s anecdotal evidence that the illegal procedures are becoming more common.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1151471&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tired,moody and pregnant? Get some exercise!</p>
<p>Exercise may improve the mood of pregnant women and help reduce their levels of fatigue,a new study has found.</p>
<p>The study,by Anca Gaston and Harry Prapavessis at the University of Western Ontario,examined whether a four week exercise intervention programme would result in improvements in the psychological well-being of previously inactive pregnant women.</p>
<p>The results were clear,with participants reporting significant improvements in their mood during the programme.</p>
<p>They also saw reduced levels of fatigue,suggesting that pregnant women should be encouraged to engage in regular exercise to improve both psychological and physical well-being.</p>
<p>While postpartum mood disorders like postnatal depression are widely recognised,rates of depression,anxiety and fatigue are actually higher during pregnancy than following pregnancy.</p>
<p>Possible complications resulting from depression during pregnancy include insufficient weight gain,increased substance use,premature birth,small babies and reduced intention to breastfeed.</p>
<p>The authors highlighted that children of mothers who are depressed or anxious during pregnancy have higher cortisol levels at birth and adolescence,impaired cognition skills and greater risk of developmental and mental disorders.</p>
<p>Moreover,fatigue during pregnancy has been associated with increased risk of caesarean delivery,disturbed sleep,and a negative impact on physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The research was published in journal Psychology &amp; Health.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1151033&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alcoholics release abnormally high levels of the reward chemical dopamine in their brains when they drink,a new study suggests.</p>
<p>The brains of people who are vulnerable to alcoholism react very differently to alcohol than the brains of people who are not vulnerable,according to a new study by Professor Marco Leyton from McGill University.</p>
<p>Compared to people at low risk for alcohol-use problems,those at high risk showed a greater dopamine response in a brain pathway that increases desire for rewards.</p>
<p>These findings could help shed light on why some people are more at risk of suffering from alcoholism and could mark an important step toward the development of treatment options.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is accumulating evidence that there are multiple pathways to alcoholism,each associated with a distinct set of personality traits and neurobiological features,&#8221; said Leyton.</p>
<p>&#8220;These individual differences likely influence a wide range of behaviours,both positive and problematic. Our study suggests that a tendency to experience a large dopamine response when drinking alcohol might contribute to one (or more) of these pathways,&#8221; leyton said.</p>
<p>Researchers recruited 26 healthy social drinkers (18 men,8 women),18 to 30 years of age,from the Montreal area. The higher-risk subjects were then identified based on personality traits and having a lower intoxication response to alcohol.</p>
<p>Finally,each participant underwent two positron emission tomography (PET) brain scan exams after drinking either juice or alcohol (about 3 drinks in 15 minutes).</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that people vulnerable to developing alcoholism experienced an unusually large brain dopamine response when they took a drink,&#8221; said Leyton.</p>
<p>&#8220;This large response might energise reward-seeking behaviours and counteract the sedative effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>Conversely,people who experience minimal dopamine release when they drink might find the sedative effects of alcohol especially pronounced,&#8221; said Leyton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although preliminary,the results are compelling,&#8221; said Leyton.</p>
<p>&#8220;A much larger body of research has identified a role for dopamine in reward-seeking behaviours in general. For example,in both laboratory animals and people,increased dopamine transmission seems to enhance the attractiveness of reward-related stimuli.</p>
<p>&#8220;This effect likely contributes to why having one drink increases the probability of getting a second one  the alcohol-induced dopamine response makes the second drink look all the more desirable. If some people are experiencing unusually large dopamine responses to alcohol,this might put them at risk,&#8221; said Leyton.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical &amp; Experimental Research.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1151025&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prince William for the first time has spoken about fatherhood,saying that his newborn son keeps him and wife Kate on their toes and nappies are there on his mind even while playing polo.</p>
<p>The new father had his first day out since the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth,to play at a polo match with his brother,Prince Harry.</p>
<p>Prince William,31,scored a winning goal for his team,but said his mind was not entirely on the match.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in baby mode out there,thinking about nappies,I wasn&#8217;t really in the zone,&#8221; he was quoted by The Telegraph as saying.</p>
<p>As he was presented with a mini polo stick for Prince George he jokingly asked if it was nappies,and said: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to pick some up on my way home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prince said it was &#8220;good to get out of the house&#8221; for an afternoon.</p>
<p>He and his wife are understood to be staying with her parents in Bucklebury,Berkshire.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to make sure I&#8217;m not too late back,&#8221; William was quoted by the daily as saying.</p>
<p>And asked about son George,who was born on July 22,he said: &#8220;He likes to move around a lot,he wriggles a lot,he keeps us on our toes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Audi Polo Challenge is held each year and this year was in aid of charities SkillForce and The Royal Marsden Cancer Charity,of which William is patron and president respectively.</p>
<p>Kate attended last year&#8217;s match,along with the couple&#8217;s puppy Lupo,to support William and Harry,but there was no sign of her yesterday.</p>
<p>On Friday Kensington Palace announced that the birth of the third-in-line to the throne had been formally registered after a registrar from Westminster City Council visited the palace.</p>
<p>William,signed the birth register entry for his son,listing his and wife Kate&#8217;s jobs as prince and princess of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The RAF search and rescue pilot is currently on paternity leave but is expected to return to work at some point next week.</p>
<p>His next official public engagement will be to visit the Anglesey Show later this month.</p>
<p>An announcement on his future plans is expected within the next fee months.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1151019&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A growing number of Chinese youth are undergoing plastic surgery during their summer vacations,believing that improved looks can give them an edge in education and jobs,official media reported today.</p>
<p>At the Zhongda Hospital at Southeast University,the number of people visiting plastic surgery clinics has increased dramatically in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The hospital&#8217;s plastic surgery clinic received about 200 facial surgery applicants in the week ending on July 31,of which about 70 per cent were students,statistics from the hospital showed,state-run Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
<p>Beijing postgrad Chen Rong received a facelift at a cost of 2,000 yuan (USD 326) after graduating in early July.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have sensed that appearance is an entry requirement for some jobs,&#8221; said Chen,who went on more than ten interviews before securing a job at a bank and believes that he can make a good impression on his new colleagues.</p>
<p>Chen is one of many young people who have sought out eyelid surgery,nose jobs and liposuction during summer break.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nose jobs,eyelid surgery,liposuction and micro-plastic surgery are most popular with students,&#8221; Xiong Meng,head of the clinic,said.</p>
<p>Ting Ting,a 20-year-old who started studying in Europe after finishing high school in China,had a nose job last week. &#8220;The rhinoplasty makes me look more European. It will make my future work and life in Europe easier,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Chinese beauty standards have become increasingly influenced by western standards. Wide and round eyes,white skin and high nose bridges are seen as ideal.</p>
<p>Gao Xue,a consultant at the Qizhi Plastic Surgery Hospital in Nanjing,capital of east China&#8217;s Jiangsu Province,said more students are seeking out plastic surgery,as they believe changing their looks can boost their self-confidence and bring them more opportunities in life.</p>
<p>Li Guimei,head of the plastic surgery clinic at the Qinghai Red Cross Hospital in east China&#8217;s Qinghai Province,said students have accounted for 50 per cent of her clinic&#8217;s visitors so far this summer,adding that more young men have been visiting than in previous years.</p>
<p>&#8220;A graduate visited my clinic for a nose job,as he is about to start a job in south China,where people believe one&#8217;s nose shape correlates with one&#8217;s ability to gain wealth,&#8221; Li said.</p>
<p>Li said students should make decisions regarding plastic surgery in a prudent way and avoid taking unnecessary risks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cosmetic surgery is not the only way to attain beauty. Young people shouldn&#8217;t pin their hopes on cosmetic surgery,&#8221; she told Xinhua.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1151001&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Study found a common thread over centuries: Extreme weather - very hot or dry - means more violence.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1150308&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the world gets warmer,people are more likely to get hot under the collar,scientists say. A massive new study finds that aggressive acts like committing violent crimes and waging war become more likely with each added degree.</p>
<p>Researchers analyzed 60 studies on historic empire collapses,recent wars,violent crime rates in the United States,lab simulations that tested police decisions on when to shoot and even cases where pitchers threw deliberately at batters in baseball. They found a common thread over centuries: Extreme weather &#8211; very hot or dry &#8211; means more violence.</p>
<p>The authors say the results show strong evidence that climate can promote conflict.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the weather gets bad we tend to be more willing to hurt other people,&#8221; said economist Solomon Hsiang of the University of California,Berkeley.</p>
<p>He is the lead author of the study,published online Thursday by the journal Science. Experts in the causes of war gave it a mixed reception.</p>
<p>The team of economists even came up with a formula that predicts how much the risk of different types of violence should increase with extreme weather. In war-torn parts of equatorial Africa,it says,every added degree Fahrenheit or so increases the chance of conflict between groups- rebellion,war,civil unrest &#8211; by 11 percent to 14 percent. For the United States,the formula says that for every increase of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit,the likelihood of violent crime goes up 2 percent to 4 percent.</p>
<p>Temperatures in much of North America and Eurasia are likely to go up by that 5.4 degrees by about 2065 because of increases in carbon dioxide pollution,according to a separate paper published in Science on Thursday.</p>
<p>The same paper sees global averages increasing by about 3.6 degrees in the next half-century. So that implies essentially about 40 percent to 50 percent more chance for African wars than it would be without global warming,said Edward Miguel,another Berkeley economist and study co-author.</p>
<p>When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change updates its report next year on the impacts of global warming,it will address the issue of impacts on war for the first time,said Carnegie Institution scientist Chris Field,who heads that worldwide study group. The new study is likely to play a big role,he said.</p>
<p>Hsiang said that whenever the analyzed studies looked at temperature and conflict,the link was clear,no matter where or when. His analysis examines about a dozen studies on collapses of empires or dynasties,about 15 studies on crime and aggression and more than 30 studies on wars,civil strife or intergroup conflicts.</p>
<p>In one study,police officers in a psychology experiment were more likely to choose to shoot someone in a lab simulation when the room temperature was hotter,Hsiang said. In another study,baseball pitchers were more likely to retaliate against their opponents when a teammate was hit by a pitch on hotter days. Hsiang pointed to the collapse of the Mayan civilization that coincided with periods of historic drought about 1,200 years ago.</p>
<p>People often don&#8217;t consider human conflict when they think about climate change,which is &#8220;an important oversight,&#8221; said Ohio State University psychology professor Brad Bushman,who wasn&#8217;t part of the study but whose work on crime and heat was analyzed by Hsiang.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good reason why people get more aggressive in warmer weather,Bushman said. Although people say they feel sluggish when they are hot,their heart rate and other physical responses are aroused and elevated. They think they are not agitated,when in fact they are,and &#8220;that&#8217;s a recipe for disaster,&#8221; Bushman said.</p>
<p>Experts who research war and peace were split in their reaction to the work.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world will be a very violent place by mid-century if climate change continues as projected,&#8221; said Thomas Homer-Dixon,a professor of diplomacy at the Balsillie School of International Affairs in Ontario.</p>
<p>But Joshua Goldstein,a professor of international relations at American University and author of &#8220;Winning the War on War,&#8221; found faults with the way the study measured conflicts. He said the idea of hotter tempers with hotter temperatures is only one factor in conflict,and that it runs counter to a long and large trend to less violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;To read this you get the impression,if climate change unfolds as we all fear it will,that the world will be beset by violent conflict and that&#8217;s probably not true,&#8221; Goldstein said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of positive changes in technology,economics,politics and health&#8221; conflict is likely to continue to drop,although maybe not as much as it would without climate change,he said.</p>
<p>Miguel acknowledges that many other factors play a role in conflict and said it&#8217;s too soon to see whether conflict from warming will outweigh peace from prosperity: &#8220;It&#8217;s a race against time.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1150308&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Omega-3 fatty acids,found in oily fish such as salmon and trout,selectively inhibit growth and induce cell death in early and late-stage oral and skin cancers,according to a new study.</p>
<p>Scientists from Queen Mary,University of London found omega-3 fatty acids induced cell death in malignant and pre-malignant cells at doses which did not affect normal cells.</p>
<p>This suggests they have the potential to be used in both the treatment and prevention of certain skin and oral cancers. </p>
<p>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids cannot be made by humans in large quantities and must be acquired from diet. </p>
<p>The scientists were studying a particular type of cancer called squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC). Squamous cells are the main part of the outermost layers of the skin,and SCC is one of the major forms of skin cancer.</p>
<p>However,squamous cells also occur in the lining of the digestive tract,lungs,and other areas of the body. Oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) are the sixth most common cancer worldwide and are difficult and very expensive to treat.</p>
<p>In the experiments,the scientists grew cell cultures in the lab from several different cells lines to which they added fatty acids. The cell lines included both malignant oral and skin SCCs,along with pre-malignant cells and normal skin and oral cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that the omega-3 fatty acid selectively inhibited the growth of the malignant and pre-malignant cells at doses which did not affect the normal cells,&#8221; said Professor Kenneth Parkinson,Head of the Oral Cancer Research Group at Queen Mary&#8217;s Institute of Dentistry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surprisingly,we discovered this was partly due to an over-stimulation of a key growth factor (epidermal growth factor) which triggered cell death. This is a novel mechanism of action of these fatty acids,&#8221; Parkinson said.</p>
<p>Dr Zacharoula Nikolakopoulou,carried out the research while studying her PhD at Queen Mary,under the supervision of Parkinson and Professor Adina Michael-Titus.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the doses needed to kill the cancer cells do not affect normal cells,especially with one particular fatty acid we used called Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),there is potential for using omega-3 fatty acids in the prevention and treatment of skin and oral cancers,&#8221; Nikolakopoulou said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be that those at an increased risk of such cancers &#8211; or their recurrence &#8211; could benefit from increased omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover,as the skin and oral cancers are often easily accessible,there is the potential to deliver targeted doses locally via aerosols or gels. However further research is needed to define the appropriate therapeutic doses,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal Carcinogenesis.  </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1150304&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People who quit smoking after a balloon angioplasty to improve blood flow to the heart live an average of two years longer than those who keep smoking,a new study suggests.</p>
<p>Researchers found people who were undergoing balloon angioplasty in their 50s,on average,and quit smoking within one year after the procedure lived another 18.5 years. In contrast,those who continued to smoke lived about 16.4 years,on average,after angioplasty. &#8220;Most (smokers) start smoking in their youth and have a smoking history of 40-50 years,&#8221; said Ron van Domburg,the senior author of the paper and a clinical epidemiologist at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam,The Netherlands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most patients think it is too late to quit smoking,but the major message of our study is that it is never too late to stop smoking,&#8221; he told Reuters Health in an email. &#8220;Even if you&#8217;re not willing to stop smoking (for) yourself,do it for your grandchildren. They can enjoy their grandparents for an additional two years.&#8221; Previous studies have shown that smoking contributes to an increased risk of heart-related illness and death.</p>
<p>But others reflect just how tough it can be to quit smoking. Relapse rates are high,even with medications and behavioral therapies developed to help people kick the habit. According to a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analysis of 2010 survey data,about 69 percent of smokers want to stop smoking,and about half of these make quit attempts each year. But of those,only about six percent successfully stay off cigarettes. To determine whether or not quitting smoking is tied to increased life expectancy after heart surgery,van Domburg and his colleagues collected data on 806 patients who underwent balloon angioplasty at Erasmus Medical Center between 1980 and 1985.</p>
<p>During coronary balloon angioplasty,also known as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),a balloon-tipped catheter is threaded through blood vessels and the balloon is inflated to clear one or more narrowed vessels. The researchers asked patients about their smoking habits before and one year after surgery and followed them for up to 30 years. Of the patients,309 were non-smokers,210 quit smoking after their surgery and 287 smoked before and after.</p>
<p>Non-smokers and people who had smoked but quit after surgery were equally likely to die during the follow-up period,but death rates were significantly higher among those who continued smoking. At 30 years post-surgery,29 percent of quitters were still alive,compared to 14 percent of those who kept smoking,according to findings published in The American Journal of Cardiology. The pattern held after the researchers accounted for health differences between patients at the time of their surgery.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s,new techniques have been developed to treat blocked blood vessels,such as minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and using bare metal or drug eluting stents to permanently prop open blocked vessels. The researchers said it&#8217;s possible these advances still may not make up for the damage done by smoking on the heart and other organs in the body. But it&#8217;s hard to know for sure,according to one researcher not involved in the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;This group from the early 1980s is very different from patients who currently undergo PCI for angina and (heart attack) so the results may not apply today,&#8221; Dr. Timothy Crimmins,director of the Vascular Medicine Laboratory at New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center in New York City,told Reuters Health in an email.</p>
<p>Crimmins noted that the study&#8217;s importance lies in its long-term follow-up. &#8220;This study is most interesting to me,&#8221; he said,&#8221;Because it actually followed up on a cohort of patients until death,and associated a real increase in life expectancy for patients undergoing PCI who quit smoking.&#8221; Crimmins said he planned to use the findings to help encourage his own patients to quit smoking for good. &#8220;Showing patients the deleterious effects of smoking doesn&#8217;t always inspire them like you think it would,&#8221; he said. &#8220;However,the concrete life expectancy gains this study measured could prove to be motivational.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1150249&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Access to clean water and soap not only improves personal hygiene,it may also boost growth in young children,a review of studies conducted in countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh has found.</p>
<p>The review found evidence of small but significant improvements in growth of children under the age of five who have access to clean water and soap.</p>
<p>Researchers from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and WaterAid identified 14 studies conducted in low and middle income countries (Bangladesh,Ethiopia,Nigeria,Chile,Guatemala,Pakistan,Nepal,South Africa,Kenya and Cambodia) that provided data on the effect of water,sanitation and hygiene programmes on the physical growth of 9,469 children.</p>
<p>The authors&#8217; analysis of the data suggested that interventions to improve the quality of the water in the household and provide soap resulted in an average 0.5cm increased height growth in children under the age of five.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first time our analysis suggests that better access to these services may also have a small but important impact on the growth of young children,&#8221; lead author Dr Alan Dangour,said.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there are some important shortcomings in the available evidence base,we estimate that clean drinking water and effective hand washing could reduce the prevalence of stunting in children under the age of five by up to 15 per cent.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is potentially an extremely important finding,that identifies that improving access to water,sanitation and hygiene could be a key part of the tool kit to tackle the global burden of under-nutrition,&#8221; said Dangour.</p>
<p>Poor height growth,or stunting,affects 165 million children worldwide and results in long term impacts on physical and mental development,increasing the risk of mortality and reducing productivity in adulthood.</p>
<p>Researchers said under-nutrition is a cause of 3.1 million deaths annually nearly half (45 per cent) of all deaths in children under five.</p>
<p>&#8220;As well as resulting in hundreds of thousands of under-five deaths every year,there is a growing consensus that unsafe water,inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene can affect the body&#8217;s ability to absorb nutrients,impacting on child development and contributing to their stunting,&#8221;WaterAid chief executive Barbara Frost said.</p>
<p>The authors say that improving access to clean water and soap is likely to have led to the increase in height because of the reduction in microbiological and parasitic infestations in early childhood,which can negatively impact growth.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1149827&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One in three US teens have been victims of dating violence,and around the same have committed relationship violence themselves,a new study has found.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adolescent dating violence is common among young people. It also overlaps between victimisation and perpetration and appears across different forms of dating abuse,&#8221; according to Michele Ybarra from the Center for Innovative Public Health Research in California.</p>
<p>Researchers analysed information collected in 2011 and 2012 from 1,058 youths,aged between 14 to 20,in the Growing Up with Media study,a national on-line survey.</p>
<p>The study defines teen dating violence as physical,sexual or psychological/emotional violence within a dating relationship.</p>
<p>Girls were almost equally likely to be a perpetrator as a victim of violence: 41 per cent reported victimisation and 35 per cent reported perpetration at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>Among boys,37 per cent said they had been on the receiving end,while 29 per cent reported being the perpetrator,Ybarra said.</p>
<p>Twenty-nine per cent of the girls and 24 per cent of the boys reported being both a victim and perpetrator in either the same or in different relationships.</p>
<p>Girls were significantly more likely than boys to say they had been victims of sexual dating violence and that they had committed physical dating violence. Boys were much more likely than girls to report that they had been sexually violent toward a date.</p>
<p>Experiencing psychological dating violence was about equal for boys and girls. Rates generally increased with age but were similar across race,ethnicity and income levels,according to Ybarra.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both boys and girls who engaged in high rates of bullying toward other students at the start of the study were seven times more likely to report being physically violent in dating relationships four years later,&#8221; said Dorothy L Espelage,of the University of Illinois,principal investigator on the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;These findings indicate that bully prevention needs to start early in order to prevent the transmission of violence in dating relationships,&#8221; said Espelage.</p>
<p>The study was presented at the American Psychological Association&#8217;s 121st Annual Convention.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1149797&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prolonged breastfeeding can help babies grow up to be intelligent kids,a new study has found. Breastfeeding longer is associated with better receptive language at 3 years of age and verbal and nonverbal intelligence at age 7 years,US researchers found. Mandy B Belfort of Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital and colleagues examined the relationships of breastfeeding duration and exclusivity with child cognition at ages 3 and 7 years. Researchers found seven-year-olds breastfed for the first year of life were likely to score four points more in a test of verbal IQ. Verbal intelligence scores in seven-year-olds increased by 0.35 points for every extra month of breastfeeding and 0.29 points per month on the nonverbal one. &#8220;In summary,our results support a causal relationship of breastfeeding in infancy with receptive language at age 3 and with verbal and nonverbal IQ at school age,&#8221; researchers said. The study was published by JAMA Pediatrics,a JAMA Network publication.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1148720&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Genistein is a "tyrosine kinase inhibitor" that works by blocking communication.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1148679&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A compound found in soybeans can be used in new treatments to inhibit the deadly HIV infection,scientists claim. Researchers from George Mason University in the US found that genistein,derived from soybeans and other plants,may become an effective HIV treatment without the drug resistance issues faced by current therapies.</p>
<p>Genistein is a &#8220;tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#8221; that works by blocking the communication from a cell&#8217;s surface sensors to its interior. Found on a cell&#8217;s surface,these sensors tell the cell about its environment and also communicate with other cells. HIV uses some of these surface sensors to trick the cell to send signals inside. These signals change cell structure so that the virus can get inside and spread infection.</p>
<p>But genistein blocks the signal and stops HIV from finding a way inside the cell. It takes a different approach than the standard antiretroviral drug used to inhibit HIV.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of directly acting on the virus,genistein interferes with the cellular processes that are necessary for the virus to infect cells,&#8221; said Yuntao Wu,a professor with the George Mason-based National Center for Biodefense and Infectious Diseases and the Department of Molecular and Microbiology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus,it makes the virus more difficult to become resistant to the drug. Our study is currently in its early stage. If clinically proven effective,genistein may be used as a complement treatment for HIV infection,&#8221; Wu said. Researchers caution that this doesn&#8217;t mean people should start eating large amounts of soy products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although genistein is rich in several plants such as soybeans,it is still uncertain whether the amount of genistein we consume from eating soy is sufficient to inhibit HIV,&#8221; Wu said. Wu sees possibilities in this plant-based approach,which may address drug toxicity issues as well. Because genistein is plant-derived,it may be able to sidestep drug toxicity,a common byproduct of the daily and lifelong pharmaceutical regimen faced by patients with HIV to keep the disease at bay,Wu said.</p>
<p>Typically,patients take a combination of multiple drugs to inhibit the virus. The frequency can lead to drug toxicity. Plus,HIV mutates and becomes drug-resistant.</p>
<p>Wu and his team are working at finding out how much genistein is needed to inhibit HIV. It&#8217;s possible that plants may not have high enough levels,so drugs would need to be developed,Wu said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1148679&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers have uncovered the cellular mechanisms behind human brain&#8217;s ability to pay attention to relevant information while ignoring distractions. Despite much study of attention in the brain,the cellular mechanisms responsible for the effects of attention have remained a mystery until now,researchers said.</p>
<p>Researchers from Dartmouth&#8217;s Geisel School of Medicine and the University of California Davis studied communications between synaptically connected neurons under conditions where subjects shifted their attention toward or away from visual stimuli that activated the recorded neurons ,sharpen the precision of these signals,and selectively boost the transmission of attention-grabbing information while reducing the level of noisy or attention-disrupting information.</p>
<p>The results point to a novel mechanism by which attention shapes perception by selectively altering presynaptic weights to highlight sensory features among all the noisy sensory input. &#8220;While our findings are consistent with other reported changes in neuronal firing rates with attention,they go far beyond such descriptions,revealing never-before tested mechanisms at the synaptic level,&#8221; said study co-author Farran</p>
<p>Briggs,assistant professor of Physiology and Neurobiology at the Geisel School of Medicine. In addition to expanding our understanding of brain,this study could help people with attention deficits resulting from brain injury or disease,possibly leading to improved screening and new treatments,researchers said. The study was published in the journal Nature.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1148231&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nature&#8217;s own stress buster! A simple walk in the woods can boost heart health by lowering stress and blood pressure levels. Nature has beneficial effects that help us cope with stress at work,according to new research conducted by Dr Valerie Gladwell at the University of Essex. The study highlights the power of the &#8216;great outdoors&#8217; to improve both physiological and psychological wellbeing. &#8220;The value of nature has long been considered to be advantageous to human health. Early examples of this come in the form of urban parks established by wealthy philanthropists during the 19th century,and in the gardens incorporated into hospital designs,&#8221; Gladwell said. &#8220;Our research supports this,demonstrating an association between improved health outcomes and engagement with surrounding &#8216;green space&#8217;,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>A series of five studies were set up by the researchers to explore the physiological and psychological benefits of nature,and the response to stress during and after viewing nature in simulated and real environments. Individual perceptions of green space surrounding home and work environments were examined,as well as how individuals interact with green space and its impact on their health. One specific study measured how a group of people recovered from a stressful task after they had viewed slides showing scenes of nature. Results showed that recovery from the stressful task was improved compared to when the scenes were of unpleasant built-up environments,according to a statement by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) which funded the study.</p>
<p>In a separate study,a walk in &#8220;green&#8221; environments at lunch time enhanced restorative sleep the following night. Furthermore,if individuals walked regularly in a &#8220;green&#8221; environment,they showed significantly lower levels of blood pressure and perceived stress after just eight weeks. &#8220;It&#8217;s widely accepted that nature is good for us,but we&#8217;re still trying to delve into what it does for us and why,&#8221; concluded Gladwell. &#8220;However,our research has shown that &#8216;green&#8217; environments can be an effective stress buster. If we can encourage more people to enjoy the great outdoors it may help increase their levels of physical activity and,therefore,could also be a powerful tool to help fight the growing incidence of cardiovascular disease,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1148219&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have identified genes that are potential targets for therapeutic drugs against aggressive breast cancer. Out of the 1.5 million women diagnosed with breast cancer in the world annually,nearly one in seven of these is classified as triple negative.</p>
<p>Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have tumours that are missing three important proteins that are found in other types of breast cancer. The absence of these three proteins make TNBC patients succumb to a higher rate of relapse following treatment and have lower overall survival rates. There is currently no effective therapy for TNBC.</p>
<p>Using integrated genomic approaches,researchers at ASTAR&#8217;s Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) led by Dr Qiang Yu,in collaboration with local and international</p>
<p>institutions,set out to search for targets that can be affected by drugs. The scientists discovered that a protein tyrosine phosphatase,called UBASH3B,is overexpressed in one third of TNBC patients. UBASH3B controls the activity of an important breast cancer gene.</p>
<p>The researchers found that deleting this gene expression markedly inhibits TNBC cell invasive growth and lung metastasis in a mouse model. They also showed that patients with TNBC tumours that have high levels of UBASH3B tend to be more likely to have early recurrence and metastasis. &#8220;The identification of target genes is always the most crucial first step towards treating a disease. It is heartening to know that UBASH3B is an important element of the pro-invasive gene network and targeting UBASH3B not only inhibits TNBC invasive growth,but also significantly reduces metastasis,&#8221; said lead author Dr Qiang Yu.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recent large-scale genomic analysis of breast cancer show that triple negative breast cancer are highly heterogeneous and patients tumours can have different molecular profiles,&#8221; said Dr Dave Hoon,Director,Department Molecular Oncology at the John Wayne Cancer Institute,US,and co-author of the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike more common breast cancers that often express oestrogen,progesterone or HER2 can be targeted by specific agents such as hormone therapy or Herceptin.</p>
<p>&#8220;TNBC is the most difficult breast cancer to treat. The finding can help us develop new approaches for targeted therapy for this highly aggressive breast cancer,&#8221; Hoon said. The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1148211&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tooth loss may be associated with memory problems in elderly,a new study has found. Elderly who have fewer natural teeth remaining perform more poorly on memory tests,according to the study. Researchers looked at 273 people ages 55 and older,and found a modest but significant relationship between a person&#8217;s number of natural teeth and his or her performance on memory tests.</p>
<p>The link held when researchers took subjects&#8217; ages into account. In other words,it wasn&#8217;t simply that both teeth and memory abilities tend to disappear with age,&#8217;LiveScience&#8217; reported. While the reason for the link isn&#8217;t entirely clear,the</p>
<p>new findings are in line with previous animal and human studies,suggesting that the presence of natural teeth has an impact on cognitive function,and having fewer teeth may be regarded as a risk factor for memory problems in the elderly,according to the researchers. Animal studies have shown that rats whose teeth were pulled out showed memory and learning problems. The rats that had lost more teeth showed higher neuronal loss,and more damage to the hippocampus,a part of the brain involved in memory formation.</p>
<p>It is possible that loosing natural teeth reduces sensory signals that teeth send to the brain,affecting its functions,including memory,the researchers said. Natural teeth send signals to the brain via a nerve that is responsible for sensation in the face,and for motor functions,such as biting and chewing.</p>
<p>Researchers said it is possible that a common factor could be responsible for the link between teeth and memory. For instance,gum infections that could lead to tooth loss may also cause inflammation,which may,in turn,cause neuronal death and memory loss,they said. Researchers accounted for other factors that can affect memory such as participants&#8217; years of education,type of occupation and medical history but the link between teeth and memory remained significant.</p>
<p>Study participants had an average of 22 natural teeth,almost one-third fewer than a complete set of human teeth,which may have caused them to avoid or eat less of certain foods that contain the nutrients necessary for maintaining a strong memory,researchers said. The study will be published in the European Journal of Oral Sciences.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1148162&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alcohol has different effects on men and women as gender influences which emotions drive heavy drinkers to drink,and how they feel the next day,a new study has found.</p>
<p>For men,anger drove drinking. A man who felt angry was more likely to drink the next day than a man who didn&#8217;t feel as enraged,researchers said.</p>
<p>They found that neither happiness,nor sadness had particular sway as a trigger for drinking in one gender over the other,&#8217;LiveScience&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>Researchers also said that neither of the genders who drink heavily effectively drown their sorrows with alcohol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people say they want to use alcohol to improve their mood,and that&#8217;s not what we found happening,&#8221; said Valerie S Harder,lead author of the study from the University of Vermont.</p>
<p>The study looked at how drinking affected participants&#8217; moods. Researchers guessed that people would report less anger or sadness after drinking,and more happiness a day after drinking. However,the data showed the opposite.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact,it works the other way: People report less happiness as they use more alcohol,&#8221; said Harder.</p>
<p>Both men and women reported feeling less happy the day after drinking,but the effect was much stronger for women.</p>
<p>To track people&#8217;s moods and drinking habits,Harder and her colleagues used an interactive voice-recordings for the 246 study participants who had been flagged by a primary-care doctor as having a possible drinking problem.</p>
<p>The study participants went through an alcohol treatment programme. They were then called in every day for six months and reported their moods,stress level and drinking habits.</p>
<p>The participants&#8217; ages ranged between 21 to 82 years.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that stress can change a person&#8217;s mood and their drinking habits.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147854&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After kidney transplants,the risk of death over the next year falls just as much among obese kidney failure patients as it does for thinner people,says a new study. Researchers found that the risk of an obese person dying during the year after a kidney transplant dropped about 66 percent,compared to obese people who remained on dialysis. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s equal to the benefit thinner people get from a transplant. &#8220;This is good and important news with the changing environment and increasing regulation of transplantation. </p>
<p>It confirms the benefit of transplantation in this high-risk group,&#8221; said Dr. John Gill,the study&#8217;s senior author from the University of British Columbia and St. Paul&#8217;s Hospital in Vancouver,Canada. </p>
<p>The researchers write in the American Journal of Transplantation that kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for people with end-stage kidney disease. </p>
<p>Compared to dialysis,an arduous process for removing waste from a patient&#8217;s blood several times a week,transplants are tied to a lower risk of death and a better quality of life.</p>
<p>But past research has found that obese people with kidney failure do better on dialysis than thinner people,and that they&#8217;re more likely to die following organ transplants &#8211; both issues that would alter the risk-benefit calculation for the decision to do a kidney transplant in those patients.</p>
<p>For men and women,body mass index (BMI) &#8211; a measure of weight relative to height &#8211; of 30 and above is considered obese by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A five-foot,nine-inch person would have a BMI of 30 at 203 pounds and a BMI of 40 above 271 pounds.</p>
<p>The most recent previous analysis of kidney transplants in obese patients found that their survival benefit is comparable to that of thinner patients,but the result was based on data from the 1990s. Since then,according to the researchers,the number of obese people with end-stage kidney disease has grown and the selection of transplant patients has evolved.</p>
<p>For the new study,the researchers analyzed data on U.S. adults with end-stage kidney disease,who had either a kidney transplant or their first dialysis session between April 1995 and September 2007.</p>
<p>About 60 percent of the 145,629 patients with a BMI below 30 received a transplant,compared to about half of the 62,869 obese patients. The researchers found that 12 percent of the thinner patients who received a transplant and 34 percent of those on dialysis died within about three years.</p>
<p>That compared to 14 percent of the obese patients dying after a transplant and 28 percent dying on dialysis. Overall,thin and obese people&#8217;s risk of death in the year following their transplant fell by similar amounts,compared to those who remained on dialysis. &#8220;Another important aspect of this study shows that people do benefit from living-donor transplantation &#8211; especially among obese patients,&#8221; Gill told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>But the researchers found that the benefits of transplant in severely obese people &#8211; those with BMIs of 40 and above &#8211; weren&#8217;t as great as the benefits in thinner people. Whether African Americans with a BMI over 40 benefitted at all could not be determined because there were too few in the study population.</p>
<p>Other high-risk groups,however,did show a benefit,including diabetics,Gill said.&#8221;This is meant to say we&#8217;re not to preempt transplantation in obese patients,&#8221; said Gill,who added that this shouldn&#8217;t stop doctors from encouraging patients to lose weight.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147519&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers may heal faster when they are cleaned out frequently,a new study suggests. So-called debridement involves removing dead or infected tissue and any foreign bodies or bacteria from slow-healing wounds,such as with a scalpel or special cream.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s traditionally performed when a patient first comes in with a wound,said Dr. Robert Kirsner,a dermatologist and wound researcher from the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. &#8220;The real question is,how often do you have to do this?&#8221; added Kirsner,who co-wrote a commentary published with the new study. </p>
<p>Close to seven million Americans each year have a chronic wound,from diabetes or other causes. A few small studies have suggested some types of wounds tend to heal faster with frequent cleaning.</p>
<p>For their report,James Wilcox from Healogics &#8211; a company that runs wound care centers &#8211; and his colleagues tried to expand on those data by reviewing the records of about 155,000 patients treated at one of 525 wound centers.</p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2012,those patients were treated for a total of 313,000 wounds,including diabetic foot and pressure ulcers,surgical wounds and cuts from accidents or other trauma.</p>
<p>The average wound was cleaned out twice. The researchers found that healing time varied by the type of wound,but was typically faster with more frequent debridement.</p>
<p>For example,diabetic foot ulcers healed in an average of 21 days when they were debrided at least weekly and in 76 days,on average,when they were debrided once every two weeks or more. Traumatic wounds healed in 14 days,on average,with frequent debridement and in 49 days when they were cleaned out least often.</p>
<p>Healing time was also longer for deeper and wider wounds,the research team wrote in JAMA Dermatology.Bacteria can grow over wounds in colonies called biofilms,Kirsner said. Much like brushing your teeth prevents biofilms from growing on them,debridement may keep wounds free of bacterial colonies,he added.</p>
<p>But debridement isn&#8217;t quite as easy and innocuous as teeth brushing. &#8220;There&#8217;s effort in doing it &#8211; there&#8217;s effort as far as cost and in theory there could be pain associated with it,&#8221; Kirsner told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you perform a surgical procedure,there&#8217;s always the risk of infection. You wouldn&#8217;t want to do debridements if they weren&#8217;t necessary.&#8221; He said patients in the study who had their wounds cleaned out more frequently may have also been better at sticking to other care recommendations &#8211; so it&#8217;s not clear the faster healing time was due solely to extra debridement.</p>
<p>Or,&#8221;It&#8217;s possible that if you went to a specialized wound center every week and got a lot of treatments including debridement,that debridement may not have been the only critical thing that was done during that treatment.&#8221; Still,Kirsner said,the evidence is pointing toward a benefit from more frequent cleaning. </p>
<p>And having slow-healing wounds regularly evaluated is important,he added,to make sure they continue to improve. Especially among people with diabetes and loss of sensation in the feet,non-healing wounds can become gangrenous and force amputation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147516&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recognising the adverse impact of e-cigarettes which are a new craze along with hookah joints among tobacco users,India and other countries of South-East Asian region today vowed to take measures to check their use including imposing ban.</p>
<p>Participating in the regional meeting of WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC),various nations also were unanimous in admitting that hookah/water pipe is a health hazard and agreed to take appropriate measures to prevent their use,besides also introducing strong legislations and regulations to control the use of smokeless tobacco.</p>
<p>Agreeing to take appropriate legislative,administrative and regulatory measures to prevent the use of water pipes (hookah),countries of this region were unanimous on the fact that smokeless tobacco including use of areca nut poses serious public health problems due to its high use.</p>
<p>Due to high prevalence of its use,the wide diversity,the social acceptance of its use and lack of awareness of its adverse health consequences,they called for introducing</p>
<p>strong legislations and regulations to control the use of smokeless tobacco.</p>
<p>The recommendations made today are in line with obligations under Article 5.2(b) of the WHO FCTC to prevent and reduce nicotine addiction including through banning E- cigarettes or Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS).</p>
<p>The 4-day Regional Meeting on Implementation of WHO FCTC for South-East Asia Region was held here from July 23 and concluded today.</p>
<p>The meeting was organised by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in collaboration with WHO SEARO and Secretariat of WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC),with technical assistance by WHO Country Office.</p>
<p>The key objectives of the meeting were to review implementation of WHO FCTC and major developments related to the treaty in the region and internationally and to facilitate inter country exchanges on implementation achievements and</p>
<p>challenges,including identification of the best practices and the ways of further promoting their dissemination and use.</p>
<p>The participants of the meeting included representatives from 10 South East Asian Countries &#8211; India,Nepal,Bhutan,Bangladesh,Myanmar,Maldives,Indonesia,Thailand,Timor Leste and Sri Lanka,besides those from World Bank,World Customs Organization (WCO),UNDP,Framwork Convention Alliance (FCA).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147129&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The taller a woman is,the more likely she is to get cancer after menopause,a new US study has claimed. In a study of 20,928 postmenopausal women,researchers found that for every 10-centimetre (3.94 inches) increase in height,there was a 13 per cent increase in the risk of developing any cancer.</p>
<p>Among specific cancers,there was a 13 per cent to 17 per cent increase in the risk of getting melanoma and cancers of the breast,ovary,endometrium,and colon. There was a 23 per cent to 29 per cent increase in the risk of developing cancers of the kidney,rectum,thyroid,and blood.</p>
<p>The taller a postmenopausal woman is,the greater her risk for developing cancer,researchers said in the study published in Cancer Epidemiology,Biomarkers &amp; Prevention. </p>
<p>&#8220;We were surprised at the number of cancer sites that were positively associated with height. In this data set,more cancers are associated with height than were associated with body mass index [BMI,&#8221; said Geoffrey Kabat,senior epidemiologist in the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately,cancer is a result of processes having to do with growth,so it makes sense that hormones or other growth factors that influence height may also influence cancer risk,&#8221; Kabat said.</p>
<p>Some genetic variations associated with height are also linked to cancer risk,and more studies are needed to better understand how these height-related genetic variations predispose some men and women to cancer,according to the authors.</p>
<p>The women in the study were identified from a large cohort of 144,701 women recruited to the Women&#8217;s Health Initiative (WHI),a large,multicenter study of postmenopausal women between the ages 50 and 79,between 1993 and 1998. The researchers identified 20,928 women who had been diagnosed with one or more invasive cancers during the follow-up of 12 years.</p>
<p>To study the effect of height,they accounted for many factors influencing cancers,including age,weight,education,smoking habits,alcohol consumption,and hormone therapy.Of the 19 cancers studied,none showed a negative association with height,researchers said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147098&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women prefer to date men with a sense of humour due to evolutionary differences hardwired into the female brain,a new study has found.</p>
<p>Researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine found that women&#8217;s brains show greater activity than men&#8217;s in response to humour.</p>
<p>It is believed women use a man&#8217;s ability to make them laugh as a way to judge his genetic fitness as a suitable partner and potential father,the &#8216;Daily Express&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>The study scanned the brains of 22 girls and boys,aged from six to 13 as they viewed funny videos. During funny clips,girls&#8217; brains showed more heightened activity than the boys,the study found.</p>
<p>Researchers said their findings suggest selecting a mate by responding to humour is more effective in women &#8220;because the female brain,and particularly the reward circuit,is biologically better prepared to respond accordingly.&#8221; The research was published in the journal Social Neuroscience.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147085&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Epilepsies are a group of neurological disorders associated with recurring seizures.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147071&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed silk implants which when placed in the brain release a specific chemical,adenosine,to help stop the progression of epilepsy.</p>
<p>The epilepsies are a group of neurological disorders associated with recurring seizures that tend to become more frequent and severe over time.</p>
<p>Adenosine decreases neuronal excitability and helps stop seizures. Earlier studies have suggested abnormally low levels of adenosine may be linked to epilepsy.</p>
<p>Rebecca L Williams-Karnesky,and her colleagues from Legacy Research Institute,Portland,Oregon Health and Sciences University (OHSU),Portland,and Tufts University,Boston,looked at long-term effects of an adenosine-releasing silk-implant therapy in rats.</p>
<p>They examined the role of adenosine in causing epigenetic changes that may be associated with the development of epilepsy.</p>
<p>They found that adenosine&#8217;s beneficial effects are due to epigenetic modifications (chemical reactions that change the way genes are turned on or off without altering the DNA code,the letters that make up our genetic background).</p>
<p>Specifically,these changes happen when a molecule known as a methyl group blocks a portion of DNA,affecting which genes are accessible and can be turned on. If methyl groups have been taken away (demethylated),genes are more likely to turn on.</p>
<p>Researchers found evidence that changing adenosine levels affects DNA methylation in the brain. Specifically,greater  amounts of adenosine were associated with lower levels of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>They also demonstrated that rats induced to develop epilepsy have higher levels of methylated DNA.</p>
<p>Epileptic rat brains that had received the adenosine-releasing silk implants exhibited DNA methylation levels close to brains of normal rats and this significantly lessened the worsening of the epilepsy over time.</p>
<p>One mechanism involved in a specific type of epilepsy is an increase in mossy fibre sprouting &#8211; the formation of new excitatory circuits in the part of the brain where seizures commonly originate.</p>
<p>At the end of the experiment,animals that had been treated with the adenosine  releasing silk implant showed less sprouting than animals that were not given the drug.</p>
<p>The study found that the adenosine-releasing silk did not completely abolish seizures in their animal model but reduced them four-fold.</p>
<p>The findings show that the implants are safe to use in rats and suggest that they may one day be used in the clinic,the study said.</p>
<p>The research was published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147071&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sex researcher Virginia Johnson,part of the famed Masters and Johnson team who conducted groundbreaking work on human sexuality,has died in St. Louis at the age of 88,her son said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Johnson suffered from various illnesses prior to her death on Wednesday at an assisted living center,Scott Johnson said. </p>
<p>Virginia Johnson and William Masters,who died in 2001,met when she was a researcher for him at Washington University in St. Louis in the 1950s. Masters was a physician at the university and had begun researching sex in 1954.</p>
<p>The couple published the bestselling book &#8220;Human Sexual Response&#8221; in 1966 after years of laboratory research and testing of sexual arousal in couples. They published what was considered a second major study in 1970,&#8221;Human Sexual Inadequacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her son said publication of the two books &#8220;forever changed the study of sex&#8221; and helped in the development of treatments for sexual dysfunction. &#8220;She was very proud of her life&#8217;s work,&#8221; Scott Johnson said.</p>
<p>Masters and Johnson married in 1971,and in 1973 formed the Masters and Johnson Institute in St. Louis to continue their research and reports. They divorced after 20 years,but often appeared on talk shows and other programs to discuss their research.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147035&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Pope Francis on Thursday issued the first social manifesto of his young pontificate.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147032&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pope also urged Brazil&#8217;s youth,who have taken part in recent protests showing discontent with the status quo,to keep alive their &#8220;sensitivity towards injustice&#8221; and be a catalyst in the fight against corruption.</p>
<p>The first Latin American pope,who has rallied the Church on behalf of the poor and who lives more austerely than his predecessors,called for a &#8220;culture of solidarity&#8221; to replace the &#8220;selfishness and individualism&#8221; prevailing in modern society.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one can remain insensitive to the inequalities that persist in the world,&#8221; he told residents of Manguinhos,a sprawling shantytown,or favela,of ramshackle brick dwellings that until recently was overrun by violence and controlled by drug lords.</p>
<p>His speech,under rains that have persisted throughout most of his first trip abroad as pope,came halfway through a week-long visit around World Youth Day,a gathering of young Catholics that is expected to attract more than a million faithful to Rio de Janeiro and nearby sites.</p>
<p>Despite the downpours and unusually chilly weather,tens of thousands of rapturous Brazilians and foreign visitors have turned out to welcome the pope. The World Youth Day events are an effort by the Vatican to inspire Catholics at a time when rival denominations,secularism and sexual and financial scandals continue to lead some to abandon the Church.</p>
<p>Brazil,home to the world&#8217;s biggest population of Catholics with over 120 million faithful,is an apt locale for the pope to remind the world of inequality. A recent decade of economic growth in the country raised incomes for many,but tens of millions of Brazilians still live in poverty or with little more than the basics to get by.</p>
<p>In Manguinhos,Francis,an Argentine known for frequent outings into the slums near Buenos Aires even as a cardinal,smiled and visibly enjoyed the chaotic close contact allowed with residents there. He called for more efforts to end poverty and said authorities must do more than just crack down on the drug trade to ensure opportunities for those at the bottom of the economic ladder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody,according to his or her particular opportunities and responsibilities,should be able to make a personal contribution to putting an end to so many social injustices,&#8221; he said in an address on a muddy,rain-drenched soccer field next to a river smelling of sewer water.</p>
<p>Making the speech after blessing the favela&#8217;s small chapel and visiting one of its homes on a recently cleaned street,the pope challenged the rich and powerful to use their influence to enact lasting change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to make an appeal to those in possession of greater resources,to public authorities and to all people of good will who are working for social justice: never tire of working for a more just world,marked by greater solidarity!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Reflecting his humble personal style,Francis said he would like to have been able to stop in every Brazilian home &#8220;to ask for a glass of cold water,to take a cafezinho,but not a shot of cachaça,&#8221; a mention of Brazilian rum that drew laughter from the crowd.</p>
<p>Driving in an open popemobile,Francis was surrounded by a throng of residents,some barefoot,and leaned out to kiss a woman and shake extended hands as he entered the slum,where there was a heavy presence of police and military.</p>
<p>&#8216;PACIFICATION&#8217; OF POOR NOT ENOUGH</p>
<p>The pope praised Brazil´s efforts over the last decade to reduce poverty in Latin America&#8217;s largest nation,which last month was rocked by massive protests against corruption,the misuse of public money and the high cost of living.</p>
<p>But he said more needed to be done to bridge the gap between rich and poor at the root of social injustice,in a reference to the police occupation of Rio&#8217;s slums started last year to &#8220;pacify&#8221; drug-related violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;No amount of &#8216;pacification&#8217; will be able to last,nor will harmony and happiness be attained in a society that ignores,pushes to the margins or excludes a part of itself,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Manguinhos,home to about 35,000 poor people,was known locally as &#8220;Gaza Strip&#8221; for its frequent shootings. It is one of the slums that have been part of a community policing operation that has reduced violence in the shantytowns of Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>&#8220;In those days,I never knew when I entered the church if I would be alive when I got out,&#8221; said Father Marcio Queiroz,pastor of the local chapel. &#8220;It was like a fruit market but instead of selling fruit on the tables on the street there was guns,crack and other drugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>At one end of the sports field where Francis spoke hung a huge painting of Archbishop Oscar Romero of San Salvador,who often denounced repression and poverty in his weekly homilies and was murdered by a right-wing death squad in 1980.</p>
<p>Francis has decided to unblock the beatification process for Romero,the penultimate step before Catholic sainthood.</p>
<p>From the slum,Francis traveled to Rio&#8217;s modern cathedral,where he received a roaring welcome from tens of thousands of young people from his native country who were in Rio for the Catholic jamboree.</p>
<p>On Thursday evening he is to welcome participants in the World Youth Day from a stage on the crescent shaped Copacabana beach. More than one million people are expected for the event.</p>
<p>On Sunday,he presides at the close of World Youth Day in a pasture outside Rio before leaving for Rome that evening.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147032&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People who are optimistic are better at regulating stress as the hormone cortisol tends to be more stable in those with positive personalities,a new study has found.</p>
<p>Researchers from Concordia University in Canada tracked 135 older adults over six years,and collected their saliva samples five times a day to monitor cortisol levels.</p>
<p>This age group was selected because older adults often face a number of age-related stressors and their cortisol levels have been shown to increase.</p>
<p>Participants were asked to report on the level of stress they perceived in their day-to-day lives,and self-identify along a continuum as optimists or pessimists. Each person&#8217;s stress levels were then measured against their own average.</p>
<p>Measuring the stress levels against participants&#8217; own</p>
<p>average provided a real-world picture of how individuals handle stress because individuals can become accustomed to the typical amount of stress in their lives.</p>
<p>Joelle Jobin,a PhD candidate in clinical psychology who co-authored the study with her supervisor Carsten Wrosch and Michael Scheier from Carnegie Mellon University,noted that pessimists tended to have a higher stress baseline than optimists,but also had trouble regulating their system when they go through particularly stressful situations.</p>
<p>&#8220;On days where they experience higher than average stress,that&#8217;s when we see that the pessimists&#8217; stress response is much elevated,and they have trouble bringing their cortisol levels back down. Optimists,by contrast,were protected in these circumstances,&#8221; said Jobin.</p>
<p>While the study generally confirmed the researchers&#8217; hypotheses about the relation between optimism and stress,one surprising finding was that optimists who generally had more stressful lives secreted higher cortisol levels than expected shortly after they awoke (cortisol peaks just after waking and declines through the day).</p>
<p>Jobin said there are several possible explanations,but also noted that the finding points to the difficulty of classifying these complex hormones as good or bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem with cortisol is that we call it &#8216;the stress hormone&#8217;,but it&#8217;s also our &#8216;get up and do things&#8217; hormone,so we may secrete more if engaged and focused on what&#8217;s</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want a younger looking skin? Get some sleep!</p>
<p>Sleep-deprived people show signs of premature skin ageing and a decrease in their skin&#8217;s ability to recover after exposure to sun,a new study has found. In a first-of-its-kind clinical trial,scientists at University Hospitals (UH) Case Medical Center in US found that sleep quality impacts skin function and ageing.</p>
<p>The demonstrated that poor sleepers had increased signs of skin ageing and slower recovery from a variety of environmental stressors,such as disruption of the skin</p>
<p>barrier or ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Poor sleepers also had worse assessment of their own skin and facial appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our study is the first to conclusively demonstrate that inadequate sleep is correlated with reduced skin health and accelerates skin ageing. Sleep deprived women show signs of premature skin ageing and a decrease in their skin&#8217;s ability to recover after sun exposure,&#8221; said Dr Elma Baron,primary Investigator of the study.</p>
<p>The study involved 60 pre-menopausal women between the ages of 30 and 49,with half of participants falling into thepoor quality sleep category.</p>
<p>The study involved a visual skin evaluation and participation in several non-invasive skin challenge tests including UV light exposure and skin barrier disruption. Additionally,participants filled out a sleep log for one week to quantify sleep duration. The researchers found statistically significant differences between good and poor quality sleepers. Using a skin ageing scoring system,poor quality sleepers</p>
<p>showed increased signs of intrinsic skin ageing including fine lines,uneven pigmentation and slackening of skin and reduced elasticity.</p>
<p>In this system,a higher score means a more aged appearance. The average score in the good quality sleepers was 2.2 versus 4.4 in poor quality sleepers. They found no significant difference betwee n the groups in signs of extrinsic ageing,which are attributed primarily to sun exposure,such as coarse wrinkles and sunburn freckles.</p>
<p>Researchers found that good quality sleepers recovered more efficiently from stressors to the skin. Recovery from sunburn was more sluggish in poor quality sleepers,with erythema (redness) remaining higher over 72 hours,indicating that inflammation is less efficiently resolved.</p>
<p>A Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) test was used at various time points to determine the ability of the skin to serve as an effective barrier against moisture loss.</p>
<p>In measurements 72 hours after a skin barrier stressor (tape-stripping),the recovery of good quality sleepers was 30per cent higher than poor quality sleepers (14 per cent vs 6 per cent) demonstrating that they repair the damage more quickly,researchers said.</p>
<p>Self perception of attractiveness was significantly better in good quality sleepers (mean score of 21 on self evaluation) vs poor quality sleepers (mean score of 18).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1146050&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists,including one of Indian-origin,have found that limiting the function of a gene can stop the spread of breast cancer and reduce the risk of death.</p>
<p>The study by Kiran Chada,professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School,part of Rutgers,The State University of New Jersey,and his team shows that metastasis in breast cancer and the risk of death are reduced when the function of the gene HGMA2,is limited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our research has shown that HGMA2 plays a part in regulating the spread of cancer and could be considered a driver of the process,&#8221; said Chada,who was principal investigator of the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further studies could result in the development of therapeutic treatments for patients with breast cancer which could prevent HGMA2&#8242;s function,reduce the spread of cancer and extend a patient&#8217;s life,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to Chada,only a subset of cancer cells in the primary tumour is potentially metastatic and these cells are found at the edge of the tumour in a region known as the invasive front.</p>
<p>Chada&#8217;s laboratory showed that normal cells do not express HMGA2,and the expression of this gene product converts normal cells into metastatic cells. Furthermore,the majority of cells which express HMGA2 in human breast cancer tissue were found to be at the invasive</p>
<p>front. In additional studies,the researchers showed mice that could not express the HMGA2 gene were found to have a</p>
<p>substantially reduced incidence of breast cancer.</p>
<p>The study was published in Cancer Research,a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1146044&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More and more non-Indians in Singapore are taking to the spicy Indian food,adding to the huge customer base of Indian restaurants. &#8220;Some of the leading Indian restaurants are reporting 90 per cent patronage by non-Indians,and others are 40 per cent,&#8221; V Bimel Ram,Festival Director of the Indian Restaurants Association in Singapore (IRAS) said at the ongoing Food Festival being held July 19-28.</p>
<p>Singapore has about 350 Indian restaurants,according to IRAS. The festival is part of the ongoing Singapore Food Festival which promotes the city state as food paradise among Singaporeans and tourists. &#8220;Spices,food products and dishes of Indian-origin are being promoted at the festival,&#8221; Ram told PTI.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the products,including wines,are imported from India,&#8221; he added. This year,Singapore&#8217;s 21 leading Indian restaurants are participating in the festival,some of whom have made Singapore Indian dishes globally famous such as the blended &#8216;fish head&#8217; curry,and fusion of Indian,Chinese and Malay dishes.</p>
<p>Multi-national Singapore is a good platform to promote fusion food for Chinese and Malay tastes,said Ram last night at the festival&#8217;s Indian wine promotion event. Some 70-80 per cent of Singaporeans,with all adults in the family working,eat at hawker centres,food courts,restaurants and other eatery places,according to Ram.</p>
<p>In fact,Singaporeans start eating food cooked by restaurants and hawkers from early age,starting from the school&#8217;s tuck shops. Cooking food at home has become a major weekend family event in some Singapore households. </p>
<p>To promote home cooked food,the festival held a cooking contest,bringing together parents and their children to build bonds by trying out skills on woks and with laddles. &#8220;Singapore Indian restaurants are doing good businesses with a huge customer base,&#8221; said R Narayanamohan,Chairman of the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,which joined IRAS in organising the food festival.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1146006&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among teens in a new study from Ireland,those who reported hearing voices were at greatly elevated risk of attempting suicide within the year compared to their peers with or without mental disorders who did not experience voices.</p>
<p>Considered a symptom of psychosis,hearing voices was linked to a nearly 70-fold higher likelihood of a suicide attempt over the course of a year in the study of 13-to-16 year olds. That could make the symptom a valuable early-warning sign for parents to act on,according to the study&#8217;s authors.</p>
<p>The relationship between suicide and these symptoms had not previously been known,lead author Dr. Ian Kelleher,of the department of psychiatry at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin,told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>He and colleagues used data they gathered for a larger European study to follow 1,112 Irish adolescents for one year,checking in with them three times over the year and asking them to report any psychotic symptoms or suicide attempts.</p>
<p>At the first assessment,77 of the teens reported having some psychotic symptoms &#8211; which include hearing voices or other sounds that are not there.</p>
<p>Of the kids who had such auditory hallucinations,seven percent reported a suicide attempt by the next check-in three months later,compared to one percent of the kids without psychotic symptoms at the first assessment.</p>
<p>At one year,20 percent of the kids who heard voices reported a suicide attempt compared to 2.5 percent of the other kids,according to the results in JAMA Psychiatry.</p>
<p>The group at highest risk was kids who had other psychiatric illnesses like anxiety,depression or obsessive compulsive disorder,and also reported hearing voices. Thirty-four percent of them reported a suicide attempt by the one-year mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;The important thing here is that we know that individuals with psychiatric illness are at higher risk of suicidal behavior than the rest of the population but still the large majority of these individuals will never attempt suicide,&#8221; Kelleher said.</p>
<p>Just having a psychiatric illness is not a good indicator that someone will attempt suicide,but that in combination with hearing voices is an excellent way to identify high-risk groups,he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it&#8217;s not surprising that people with psychotic symptoms are at higher suicide risk,what&#8217;s really noteworthy in this study is the magnitude of the increase in risk,&#8221; said Ian Colman,who researches mental health epidemiology and suicide risk at the University of Ottawa in Canada.</p>
<p>According to the paper,more than half of teen suicide attempts could be prevented if &#8220;hearing voices&#8221; could be unilaterally cured,said Colman,who was not involved in the study.</p>
<p>There is evidence that many factors contribute to hearing voices,including genetics or a history of physical or sexual abuse in childhood,he said.</p>
<p>Kids who hear voices or sounds that nobody else hears don&#8217;t usually tell their friends or family,but trained doctors can usually get young people to open up Kelleher said.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are clinical symptoms that a doctor should carefully assess in patients presenting with psychiatric illness,just as a doctor would assess for (irregular heart rhythms) in a patient presenting with shortness of breath,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Even with these striking new results,predicting who will attempt suicide remains very difficult,Colman said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suicidal behavior is strongly linked to mental illness,so one of the best things we can do to prevent suicide is to encourage children and their parents to seek treatment if they are concerned about their mental health,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;More generally,we can try to create environments in our homes,our schools and our communities where adolescents feel comfortable to come forward if they are struggling with their mental health or thinking about suicide,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1146003&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bribery is the lubricant that helps keep China&#8217;s public hospitals running,and the health system would struggle to function without illegal payments to poorly paid doctors and administrators,say medical practitioners and industry experts.</p>
<p>They say government policies are partly to blame for a system in which doctors and other staff expect to be paid extra fees to perform operations and take kickbacks from pharmaceutical firms and medical-equipment suppliers.</p>
<p>The profession&#8217;s ugly underbelly was exposed last week when police accused British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline of bribing officials and doctors for six years to boost sales and the price of its medicines. GSK has called the developments &#8220;shameful&#8221; and on Monday said some of its Chinese executives appeared to have broken the law.</p>
<p>China is an appealing market for pharmaceutical firms and medical-equipment makers,with spending in the industry expected to nearly triple to $1 trillion by 2020 from $357 billion in 2011,according to consulting firm McKinsey.</p>
<p>The corruption stems largely from doctors&#8217; low base salaries,which are set in line with a pay scale for government workers. Hospitals can pay bonuses but,given public hospitals are strapped for cash,compensation is usually low,say doctors and industry experts.</p>
<p>A doctor fresh out of medical school in Beijing earns about 3,000 yuan ($490) a month including bonuses &#8212; roughly the same as a taxi driver. A doctor with 10 years experience makes around 10,000 yuan a month,according to Peter Chen,chief executive of privately run Oasis International Hospital in Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without the grey income,doctors would not have the incentive to practice,&#8221; said Yanzhong Huang,a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.</p>
<p>CAN&#8217;T SURVIVE ON SALARIES</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years the Chinese government has made its healthcare sector more market-oriented. That means the country&#8217;s 13,500 public hospitals have to balance their own books.</p>
<p>Medical services accounted for just over 50 percent of public hospital revenue in 2011,according to Health Ministry data. About 40 percent came from prescribing drugs while the rest was from other income as well as government subsidies,which have fallen steadily since the 1980s.</p>
<p>Hospital administrators can set fees for in-patient care,nursing and laboratory tests. But the state fixes the cost of operations to make surgery affordable to ordinary Chinese. And it effectively caps the cost of many prescribed medicines by setting a suggested price. That leaves hospitals little room to top up wages.</p>
<p>One Chinese doctor who used to hold a senior position at a prominent hospital in Beijing said 80 percent of his income came from bribes. Without it,he would have earned less than $600 a month,said the doctor,who left China five years ago to live in Britain where he continues practicing medicine.</p>
<p>&#8220;These sums (bribes) are essential. You cannot survive on your salary,&#8221; said the 50-year-old physician,who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. An industry executive who has worked in China&#8217;s medical sector for more than 15 years said bribery and corruption permeated every level of a public hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are seen as necessities in the current healthcare system,&#8221; said the executive,who also declined to be identified. The Health Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Officials at the National Development and Reform Commission,which sets the prices of prescribed medicines,also declined to comment.</p>
<p>Low base salaries are a legacy of China&#8217;s planned economy,said Jia Xijin,associate professor at the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsinghua University in Beijing,explaining the dilemma faced by the government.</p>
<p>China has also committed to making health care affordable for its 1.37 billion people. The government has spent 2.2 trillion yuan ($358 billion) on the system since 2009,of which more than 680 billion yuan was to provide universal health insurance coverage,state media quoted the Finance Ministry as saying earlier this year.</p>
<p>RED ENVELOPES</p>
<p>Public hospitals say recruiting new doctors is getting harder as many physicians are turned off by the wages at a time when patient numbers are growing. Health Ministry data showed the overall number of doctors rose 13 percent from 2008 to 2011,while patient visits jumped 28 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be no doctors left to treat the current doctors when they retire,&#8221; said the accounting director at a Shanghai hospital who declined to be identified because she was not authorized to speak to the media.</p>
<p>Low salaries have also spawned a system of under-the-table payments from patients. The payments are known as &#8220;hongbao&#8221; &#8212; a reference to the cash-filled red envelopes given as presents during Lunar New Year festivities &#8212; and cover various services from jumping the queue for appointments to extra surgical fees.</p>
<p>Bob Wang,a 35-year-old businessman in Beijing,said he gave the main surgeon who operated on his aunt&#8217;s femur bone transplant last year 5,000 yuan in &#8220;hongbao&#8221; on top of the 100,000 yuan he paid to the hospital because he was worried the doctor would not take the operation seriously otherwise.</p>
<p>There was unstated &#8220;hongbao&#8221; guidance for each type of surgery,he said. &#8220;If my family or myself get sick &#8230; we won&#8217;t just go to the hospital. Everything will take forever &#8212; from registration to waiting for a bed,to getting seen by a doctor to queuing for surgery,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to the doctor now living in Britain,patients and their families could sometimes spend two to three times more than the actual fee in &#8220;hongbao&#8221;. Critics doubt that an anti-corruption campaign by President Xi Jinping will have much impact.</p>
<p>Indeed,a former doctor at a major heart hospital in Beijing said eradicating corruption would be nearly impossible. &#8220;It would be easy to find out who was taking money if the government wanted to,&#8221; said the cardiologist,who has been working in the United States since 2009. &#8220;But everyone would be found guilty. How could the hospitals survive?&#8221; </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1145987&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid much fanfare and chaos,the first Delhi edition of India Bridal Fashion Week (IBFW) kick started here tonight with designers J J Valaya and Shantanu-Nikhil&#8217;s high end couture collection.</p>
<p>Valaya&#8217;s show titled &#8216;The Maharaja Of Madrid&#8217;,which was scheduled to start at 8 pm,was two hours late leaving the guests and media agitated.</p>
<p>Due to the high turnout,many people were left standing to watch Valaya&#8217;s opening show,which was inspired by Indo-Spanish culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an invite for the show which clearly suggests row number and seat but we still had to stand and watch it. After waiting for two hours and standing for an hour,I am highly disappointed,&#8221; said an angry guest.</p>
<p>As the seating began for the event,it was designer&#8217;s VVIP guests who were allowed to enter the show area first,leaving many invitees and media people stranded outside for about an hour.</p>
<p>The event also witnessed an argument between the organisers and media for not reserving seats for the scribes to watch the show. &#8220;They say two rows had been reserved for media but when they allowed me to enter,there were guests sitting on them (seats). The organisers asked me to stand and watch the show. It was a mismanaged event,&#8221; said a journalist.</p>
<p>However,when approached the organisers they said they are following instructions and cannot do much about it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1145973&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;We are still working on a name,so we will have that as soon as we can,&#8221; William told reporters outside St Mary&#8217;s Hospital in London on Tuesday. &#8220;It is the first time we have seen him really,so we are having a proper chance to catch up.&#8221;</p>
<p>George,James,Alexander and Louis are the bookmakers&#8217; favorites for the youngest royal,third in line to the British throne after Prince Charles and William.</p>
<p>The royal couple gave the world its first sight of their baby when they emerged from hospital to cheers from well-wishers and a barrage of camera flashes.</p>
<p>A beaming Kate posed for pictures before handing her son to William who joked that the baby had more hair than him and had inherited his wife&#8217;s good looks.</p>
<p>The birth gave a further boost to the royal family after the celebration last year of Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s 60 years on the throne and the marriage of Kate and William in 2011.</p>
<p>The monarchy&#8217;s popularity sank to a low in the 1990s after a string of divorces and the death of William&#8217;s mother,Diana. Elizabeth was criticized for her response to her death. The Guardian newspaper described the turnaround as &#8220;an incredible recovery&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8216;LITTLE PRINCE&#8217;</p>
<p>Most British newspapers devoted their front pages to big pictures of the baby,with headlines such as &#8220;Hello World&#8221; and &#8220;Our Little Prince&#8221;. The story also received blanket coverage on many TV networks and websites around the world.</p>
<p>Royal precedent suggests there may be no rush to release the infant&#8217;s name. It took a month for Prince Charles&#8217; name to be made public and a week for William. However,his brother Harry&#8217;s name was released a day after his birth.</p>
<p>After weeks of fevered coverage,the couple are expected to keep a low profile.</p>
<p>They have been living in a remote part of Wales,where William works as a rescue helicopter pilot. They are expected to move later this year to London&#8217;s Kensington Palace,William&#8217;s childhood home.</p>
<p>Royal observers say William will shield his son from the obsessive attention that plagued his mother Diana,killed in a car crash in 1997 after her car was chased by photographers.</p>
<p>&#8220;William knows only too well that his baby son will be the new favorite creature in the circus he grew up in,&#8221; wrote Daily Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson. &#8220;Every plan he and Kate have put in place is to protect him.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1145971&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Love hormone has a dark side! The fuzzy,warm hormone oxytocin,long known to promote feelings of love,social bonding and well-being,can also cause emotional pain,by strengthening bad memories and increasing fear and anxiety,a new study has claimed. Oxytocin appears to be the reason stressful social situations,perhaps being bullied at school or tormented by a boss,reverberate long past the event and can trigger fear and anxiety in the future.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the hormone actually strengthens social memory in one specific region of the brain,researchers from Northwestern University in the US have found. If a social experience is negative or stressful,the hormone activates a part of the brain that intensifies the memory. Oxytocin also increases the susceptibility to feeling fearful and anxious during stressful events going forward. The research,which was done in mice,is particularly relevant because oxytocin currently is being tested as an anti-anxiety drug in several clinical trials.</p>
<p>&#8220;By understanding the oxytocin system&#8217;s dual role in triggering or reducing anxiety,depending on the social context,we can optimise oxytocin treatments that improve well-being instead of triggering negative reactions,&#8221; said Jelena Radulovic,the senior author of the study. This is the first study to link oxytocin to social stress and its ability to increase anxiety and fear in response to future stress.</p>
<p>Scientists also discovered the brain region responsible for these effects &#8211; the lateral septum &#8211; and the pathway or route oxytocin uses in this area to amplify fear and anxiety. The scientists discovered that oxytocin strengthens negative social memory and future anxiety by triggering an important signalling molecule &#8211; ERK (extracellular signal regulated kinases) &#8211; that becomes activated for six hours after a negative social experience.ERK causes enhanced fear,Radulovic believes,by stimulating the brain&#8217;s fear pathways,many of which pass through the lateral septum. The region is involved in emotional and stress responses.</p>
<p>The findings surprised the researchers,who were expecting oxytocin to modulate positive emotions in memory,based on its long association with love and social bonding. &#8220;Oxytocin is usually considered a stress-reducing agent based on decades of research,&#8221; said Yomayra Guzman,a doctoral student in Radulovic&#8217;s lab and the study&#8217;s lead author. &#8220;With this novel animal model,we showed how it enhances fear rather than reducing it and where the molecular changes are occurring in our central nervous system,&#8221; Guzman said. The study was published in the journal Nature Neuroscience.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1145502&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clearly there&#8217;s a lack of understanding of what is and isn&#8217;t acceptable in terms of cellphone etiquette. Following is a list of do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts:</p>
<p>- Do respect those who are with you. When you&#8217;re engaged face-to-face with others,either in a meeting or a conversation,give them your complete and undivided attention. Avoid texting or taking calls. If a call is important,apologize and ask permission before accepting it.</p>
<p>- Don&#8217;t yell. The average person talks three times louder on a cellphone than they do in a face-to-face conversation. Always be mindful of your volume.</p>
<p>- Do be a good dining companion. No one wants to be a captive audience to a third-party cellphone conversation,or to sit in silence while their dining companion texts with someone. Always silence and store your phone before being seated. Never put your cellphone on the table.</p>
<p>- Don&#8217;t ignore universal quiet zones such as the theater,church,the library,your daughter&#8217;s dance recital and funerals.</p>
<p>- Do let voicemail do its job. When you&#8217;re in the company of others,let voicemail handle non-urgent calls.</p>
<p>- Don&#8217;t make wait staff wait. Whether it&#8217;s your turn in line or time to order at the table,always make yourself available to the server. Making servers and other patrons wait for you to finish a personal phone call is never acceptable. If the call is important,step away from the table or get out of line.</p>
<p>- Don&#8217;t text and drive. There is no message that is so important.</p>
<p>- Do keep arguments under wraps. Nobody can hear the person on the other end. All they are aware of is a one-sided screaming match a few feet away.</p>
<p>- Don&#8217;t forget to filter your language. A rule of thumb: If you wouldn&#8217;t walk through a busy public place with a particular word or comment printed on your T-shirt,don&#8217;t use it in cellphone conversations.</p>
<p>- Do respect the personal space of others. When you must use your phone in public,try to keep at least 10 feet (three meters) between you and others.</p>
<p>- Do exercise good international calling behavior. The rules of cellphone etiquette vary from country to country.</p>
<p>Good cellphone etiquette is similar to common courtesy. Conversations and text exchanges have a tendency to distract people from what&#8217;s happening in front of them. Cellphone users should be thoughtful,courteous and respect the people around them.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1145474&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A red wine compound called resveratrol blocks many of the cardiovascular benefits of exercise in older men,a new study has claimed. Resveratrol,found in red grapes and other plants,is considered a possible anti-ageing compound and is now widely available as a dietary supplement; much has been made of its role in explaining the cardiovascular health benefits of red wine,and other foods.</p>
<p>Now researchers at The University of Copenhagen surprisingly suggest that eating a diet rich in antioxidants may actually counteract many of the health benefits of exercise,including reduced blood pressure and cholesterol. In contrast to earlier studies in animals in which resveratrol improved the cardiovascular benefits of exercise,this study in humans has provided strong evidence that in older men,resveratrol has the opposite effect. The study suggests that reactive oxygen species,generally thought of as causing ageing and disease,may be a necessary signal that causes healthy adaptations in response to stresses like exercise. So too much of antioxidants in the diet may actually be detrimental to our health,researchers said.</p>
<p>Researchers studied 27 healthy,physically inactive men around 65 years old for eight weeks. During the eight weeks all of the men performed high-intensity exercise training and half of the group received 250 mg of resveratrol daily,whereas the other group received a placebo pill (a pill containing no active ingredient). &#8220;We found that exercise training was highly effective in improving cardiovascular health parameters,but resveratrol supplementation attenuated the positive effects of training on several parameters including blood pressure,plasma lipid concentrations and maximal oxygen uptake,&#8221; said researcher Lasse Gliemann.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were surprised to find that resveratrol supplementation in aged men blunts the positive effects of exercise training on cardiovascular health parameters,in part because our results contradict findings in animal studies,&#8221; said Ylva Hellsten,the leader of the project. &#8220;It should be noted that the quantities of resveratrol given in our research study are much higher than what could be obtained by intake of natural foods,&#8221; Hellsten said. The research adds to the growing body of evidence questioning the positive effects of antioxidant supplementation in humans. The study was published in The Journal of Physiology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1145037&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hair loss is one of chemotherapy&#8217;s most despised side effects,not because of vanity but because it fuels stigma,revealing to the world an illness that many would rather keep private.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t necessarily want to walk around the grocery store answering questions about my cancer,&#8221; recalled Lipton,45. &#8221;If you look OK on the outside,it can help you feel,&#8217;OK,this is manageable,I can get through this.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p>Now U.S. researchers are about to put an experimental hair-preserving treatment to a rigorous test: To see if strapping on a cap so cold it numbs the scalp during chemo,like Lipton did,works well enough to be used widely,as it is in Europe and Canada.</p>
<p>Near-freezing temperatures are supposed to reduce blood flow in the scalp,making it harder for cancer-fighting drugs to reach and harm hair follicles. But while several types of cold caps are sold around the world,the Food and Drug Administration hasn&#8217;t approved their use. Scalping cooling is an idea that&#8217;s been around for decades,but it never became popular in the U.S. in part because of a concern: Could the cold prevent chemotherapy from reaching any stray cancer cells lurking in the scalp?</p>
<p>To Dr. Hope Rugo of the University of California,San Francisco,the impact of hair loss has been overlooked by health providers. She&#8217;s had patients delay crucial treatment to avoid it,and others whose businesses suffered when clients saw they were sick and shied away.</p>
<p>&#8221;Quite frankly,it&#8217;s the first or second question out of most patients&#8217; mouths when I tell them I recommend chemotherapy. It&#8217;s not,&#8217;Is this going to cure me? It&#8217;s,&#8217;Am I going to lose my hair?&#8221;&#8217; said Dr. Susan Melin of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.</p>
<p>Later this summer,Rugo and Melin,along with researchers at a few other hospitals in New York and California,will begin enrolling 110 early stage breast cancer patients in a study of the DigniCap brand of scalp cooling. The tight-fitting,insulated cap is attached to a cooling machine as patients undergo chemo. Participants&#8217; hair will be photographed for experts to assess,and they&#8217;ll be compared with a small group of similarly ill patients who get chemo alone.</p>
<p>Lipton was among 20 U.S. patients who pilot-tested the DigniCap in 2011,most of whom kept more than half of their hair. Lipton&#8217;s thinned quite a bit at the crown,where the cap didn&#8217;t fit snugly. But because her bangs and surrounding hair remained,she covered the thinning with a headband,not a wig. The side effect: Pain and a headache as the cold set in.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t perfect,but it was easier,&#8221; said Lipton,who&#8217;s healthy today. &#8221;I felt normal much more quickly.&#8221; If the larger study is successful,Sweden&#8217;s Dignitana AB plans to seek FDA approval to market the medical device in the U.S. The move could open the way for other brands and insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Clearly there&#8217;s demand: Despite the lack of FDA approval,a growing number of U.S. patients are renting a similar product,called Penguin Cold Caps,from a British company for $455 a month. Patients haul a collection of caps to chemo sessions on dry ice,or store them in special freezers provided by about 50 hospitals. </p>
<p>The FDA declined comment on the Penguin caps. What&#8217;s the evidence behind scalp cooling? A recent review by oncologists in the Netherlands found numerous overseas studies conclude scalp cooling can work _ but it&#8217;s far from clear which patients are most likely to benefit,even how cold the scalp should be. That&#8217;s because most of the research so far has been from observational studies that can&#8217;t provide proof. But it seems harder to save hair with higher doses and certain types of chemo.</p>
<p>Researchers at New York&#8217;s Weill Cornell Breast Center reported at a recent meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology that among just over a dozen Penguin cap users tracked so far,one lost enough hair to use a wig.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1145001&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian researchers have said that a new drug that stops the malaria parasite from using vitamin B1 to multiply is now plausible.</p>
<p>Pharmacologist Kevin Saliba of Australian National University along with his team have reported their findings in recent issue of Nature Communications,the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.</p>
<p>Just like humans,malaria parasites need vitamins to grow and multiply. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is converted in cells to a cofactor,which then binds a number of enzymes involved in energy production.</p>
<p>Saliba and colleagues worked on if it might be possible to inhibit this thiamine metabolism pathway.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can target the pathways by which the parasite takes up the vitamin and metabolises it. These pathways can serve as drug targets,&#8221; Saliba said.</p>
<p>As a &#8216;probe drug&#8217;,they used an analogue of thiamine,which looks similar to the vitamin but cannot actually be used in energy production.</p>
<p>To provide proof of principle they looked at what happens to the pathway involving two enzymes  oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase.</p>
<p>In an invitro experiment,the researchers found that the parasite metabolised the analogue into a cofactor which binds to the enzymes,but they found evidence that the analogue was inhibiting one of the enzymes.</p>
<p>Saliba and the team also gave the thiamine analogue to mice infected with malaria and found they lost weight.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s consistent with the drug having some toxicity,&#8221; said Saliba.</p>
<p>The thiamine analogue used here would interfere with energy metabolism in humans so any anti-malarial drug based on these findings would have to be designed very  carefully,he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is that you come up with a drug that would selectively target the parasite pathway. We would have to rely on slight differences between the human and parasite thiamine metabolism pathways,&#8221; said Saliba.</p>
<p>There are currently anti-malarial drugs that target folate metabolism,which means there is a precedent for having a drug that targets a metabolic pathway in a pathogen that also exists in humans.</p>
<p>A major problem with anti-malarials is the development of resistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The malaria parasite has become resistant to just about all the drugs we&#8217;ve used against it,&#8221; Saliba said.</p>
<p>He said it is exciting to have one drug that is metabolised in the parasite that targets multiple enzymes in energy metabolism.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be more difficult for the parasites to become resistant to a drug that&#8217;s binding to several enzymes,&#8221; said Saliba.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organisation,about 3.3 billion people &#8211; almost half of the world&#8217;s population  are at risk of malaria. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1144994&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Falling televisions sent nearly 200,000 U.S. children to the emergency room over 20 years and the injury rate has climbed substantially for these sometimes deadly accidents,a study found.</p>
<p>Doctors and safety experts say better awareness is needed about the dangers &#8211; especially the risks of putting heavier,older model TV sets on top of dressers and other furniture young children may try to climb on.</p>
<p>Most injuries are in kids under 5; head and neck injuries including concussions are the most common.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a problem that is increasing at an alarming rate,&#8221; said lead author Dr. Gary Smith,a pediatric emergency specialist and president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance in Columbus,Ohio.</p>
<p>Smith said it is unclear from the data what type of TV sets are involved in the accidents or whether older,heavier models are the most common culprit.</p>
<p>The study was published online Monday in the journal Pediatrics.</p>
<p>In 2011,12,300 children nationwide got ER treatment for TV-related injuries,compared with 5,455 in 1990. The injury rate nearly doubled,from 0.85 injuries per 10,000 children aged 17 and younger in 1990 to 1.66 per 10,000 in 2011,the study found.</p>
<p>The researchers examined national ER data on non-fatal television-related injuries to kids from 1990-2011. In many cases,the set had been placed on a dresser and the child used open drawers as stairs to climb up and reach the TV,toppling it.</p>
<p>Over those two decades,215 children died from these injuries,government data show,and news reports indicate that since January 2012,at least six young children have been killed nationwide by falling TVs.</p>
<p>Scott Wolfson,spokesman for the government&#8217;s Consumer Product Safety Commission,said as flat screen TVs have become more popular,many families move heavier old TVs to bedrooms,placing them on dressers or other unsteady furniture not designed to hold them.</p>
<p>The commission urges parents to anchor furniture to the wall or floor with brackets or other specially designed tethers. TVs also should be anchored to sturdy surfaces,the commission recommends.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1144989&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moms-to-be who drink alcohol during pregnancy may be harming their offspring&#8217;s cognitive functions,a new study has warned. Chinese researchers found that maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy has detrimental effects on fetal central nervous system development. Maternal alcohol consumption prior to and during pregnancy significantly affects cognitive functions in offspring,which may be related to changes in the enzyme cyclin-dependent kinase 5. The enzyme is associated with modulation of synaptic plasticity and impaired learning and memory. </p>
<p>Professor Ruiling Zhang and team from Xinxiang Medical University in China explored the correlation between cyclin-dependent kinase 5 expression in the hippocampus and neurological impairments following prenatal ethanol exposure. They found that prenatal ethanol exposure could affect cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and its activator p35 in the hippocampus of offspring rats. The findings were published in the journal Neural Regeneration Research.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1144686&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even a one-time exposure to nicotine may temporarily change how the brain&#8217;s reward system responds to booze,putting smokers at an increased risk of alcohol abuse,a new study has found.</p>
<p>Smoking is a well-known risk factor for subsequent alcohol abuse,but the mechanisms underlying this link were unknown,researchers said.</p>
<p>Now,the study conducted on rats found that even a single exposure to nicotine temporarily changes how the brain&#8217;s reward system responds to alcohol and increases the reinforcing properties of alcohol via stress hormones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings indicate the mechanisms by which nicotine influences the neural systems associated with alcohol abuse,providing a foundation for conceptualising strategies aimed at diminishing the link between smoking and later alcohol abuse,&#8221; said senior author Dr John Dani,of the Baylor College of Medicine in US.</p>
<p>Dani and his team found that rats exposed to nicotine subsequently sought to drink alcohol more often than other rats. Also,signalling in the brain&#8217;s reward system was dampened when the nicotine-exposed animals consumed alcohol.</p>
<p>This decreased reward response to alcohol arose via two mechanisms: an initial activation of stress hormone receptors and a subsequent increase in inhibitory signalling in the brain. These processes were responsible for causing the rats to self-administer more alcohol after nicotine exposure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young people typically experiment with nicotine from tobacco in their teens,and that exposure possibly contributes to a greater vulnerability to alcohol abuse later in life.</p>
<p>Therefore,greater vigilance is called for to prevent the initial exposure to nicotine and to follow those at risk,&#8221; said Dani. &#8220;In addition,our work suggests that stress hormones are candidate targets for prevention or treatment therapies,&#8221; said Dani. The study was published in the Cell Press journal Neuron.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1144651&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a study of older men who had died from causes other than prostate cancer,almost half were found to have prostate tumors.</p>
<p>And up to half of those tumors detected on autopsy would have qualified for treatment had doctors known about them while the men lived,though none had been the cause of death.That suggests the criteria for treatment &#8220;might be worth reexamining,&#8221; according to the study authors,and adds to a growing body of evidence that a wait-and-see approach might be better than treatment for many prostate cancers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The study suggests that the progression of early prostate cancer,including some more aggressive forms of the disease,is far from inevitable within a man&#8217;s lifetime as many such tumors are found in men who died from other causes when their prostate is analyzed on autopsy,&#8221; said lead author Dr. Alexandre Zlotta,director of Uro-oncology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;The study concludes that it is probably worth re-examining our current definitions of clinically unimportant and clinically significant prostate cancer,&#8221; Zlotta told Reuters Health by email.</p>
<p>He and his colleagues examined the prostate glands of more than 300 men over 60 who had died from a variety of causes,but not prostate cancer. They autopsied 220 men in Russia and 100 in Japan,both countries where the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening test is not as commonly used as in the United States.</p>
<p>Medicare currently covers a yearly PSA test for men over 50 who qualify.</p>
<p>Zlotta and his colleagues selected a Caucasian population of Russian men similar in lifestyle and risk factors for prostate cancer to U.S. men in order to look at how common the cancer is in older men who have not been routinely screened.</p>
<p>In the U.S.,the number of tumors they found would have been much lower because many would have been identified by screening and treated or removed before death,Zlotta pointed out.</p>
<p>For comparison,he said,&#8221;we chose an Asian population in Japan because clinically detected prostate cancer and mortality are much lower among Asian men compared with Caucasian men and their lifestyles/diet are dramatically different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though many fewer Japanese men are diagnosed with or die from prostate cancer than men in the U.S.,the new study found that the disease is present in the same proportion of men,and serious tumors are even more common in Japan,based on posthumous prostate examinations.</p>
<p>Almost 40 percent of the Russian men,had tumors of the prostate,compared to 35 percent of the Japanese men,according to the results published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>One in four tumors in the Russian men were deemed serious and would likely have been treated with surgery or radiation in the U.S.,compared to one in two tumors in the Japanese men.</p>
<p>But there are still many differences between Russian and American men,so it is difficult to generalize the results,according to Dr. Stacy Loeb,a urologist at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should be cautious about trying to apply the results to Americans where we have a very heterogeneous population including very high risk groups such as African Americans,&#8221; Loeb told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>In the United States,about 239,000 men are expected to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013,but far fewer &#8211; less than 30,000 &#8211; will die of it,according to the American Cancer Society.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s still more than will die of the disease in Japan,despite the American men getting more screenings and treatments &#8211; a curious inconsistency researchers do not understand and Zlotta called the &#8220;million dollar question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prostate cancer screening does ultimately reduce the number of painful advanced cancers and deaths from the disease,but it also picks up smaller cancers,and treating those aggressively could lead to unnecessary side effects,Loeb said.</p>
<p>Prostate removal costs about $13,000,and may lead to impotence or incontinence.</p>
<p>The study authors note that the lifetime risk of a man in the U.S. being diagnosed with prostate cancer is 17 percent,but his risk of dying from prostate cancer is 3.4 percent.</p>
<p>That suggests many of those cancers would not advance quickly or at all,and something else would kill the man long before the prostate tumor. The problem is how to know which tumors will be harmless.</p>
<p>Experts said a new screening test may be needed that differentiates between more dangerous cancers and the many tumors that will not eventually kill,thereby avoiding the expense and risks of treatment and removal.</p>
<p>&#8220;An example is the Prostate Health Index (phi) which was recently approved by the FDA,&#8221; Loeb said. &#8220;It is a simple blood test that combines PSA with 2 other tests,and was shown to better predict the risk of aggressive cancer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The holy grail is to find only those prostate cancers which are life threatening,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The good news is that this is a very active area of research,and the whole process of screening and assessing continues to improve all the time.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1144013&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The proportion of babies born with a defect called gastroschisis has nearly doubled since 1995,according to a large new study. The cause of gastroschisis &#8211; which is a hole in the baby&#8217;s abdomen &#8211; is unclear,although it&#8217;s known to be more likely in the children of teen mothers. A mother&#8217;s exposure to certain chemicals has also been tied to the malformation,though not conclusively.</p>
<p>In the new study,researchers looked at rates of gastroschisis in millions of live births over an 11-year period in the U.S.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a pattern where the prevalence is very much highest among young women and it&#8217;s growing more rapidly among that group than any other group,&#8221; said Russell Kirby,a professor at the University of South Florida and the lead author of the study.</p>
<p>Kirby&#8217;s study could not explain why the birth defect is becoming more common,and gastroschisis itself is not well understood.</p>
<p>The malformation involves an opening next to the belly button,through which the baby&#8217;s intestines protrude.</p>
<p>Newborns with gastroschisis require immediate surgery to close the hole and put the organs back in place.</p>
<p>Most babies with gastroschisis survive,but Kirby said some children have problems with growth and development and there is not a lot of research about the long term outcomes for these kids.</p>
<p>By general estimates,the condition is relatively rare,with a rate of 2 to 3 cases per 10,000 live births in the U.S. But in recent years,studies have suggested the defect is being seen more often.</p>
<p>To get a better sense of how the numbers have changed over time,Kirby and his colleagues gathered birth defect monitoring data from 15 states.</p>
<p>They found that among 13.2 million births between 1995 and 2005,there were 4,713 babies born with gastroschisis,which translates to about 3.5 out of every 10,000 babies.</p>
<p>This number grew steadily over the study period,however,starting out at 2.3 out of every 10,000 babies in 1995 and climbing to 4.4 out of every 10,000 infants in 2005.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe the numbers,&#8221; said James Robbins,a professor who studies birth defects at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.</p>
<p>The increase in gastroschisis primarily affected mothers under age 25,and especially under age 20,whereas those who gave birth in their 30s had no change in their risk of having a baby with the birth defect.</p>
<p>Mothers who had their babies in their early twenties experienced a 5.8 percent increase each year in the risk of having a child born with gastroschisis,Kirby&#8217;s group reported in the medical journal Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology.</p>
<p>Among these mothers,the number of babies born with gastroschisis went from 4 out of every 10,000 babies in 1995 to 7 in 10,000 babies in 2005.</p>
<p>Teen mothers saw a 6.8 percent yearly increase in the proportion of babies born with gastroschisis.</p>
<p>In 1995,there were 8 babies with gastroschisis out of every 10,000 babies born to women under age 20. By 2005,that number was 15 out of every 10,000 babies.</p>
<p>The proportion of babies with gastroschisis born to Asian women and Native American women remained steady over the study period.</p>
<p>White,black and Hispanic mothers,however,experienced a roughly four to six percent increased risk each year of having a baby with the malformation.</p>
<p>Researchers have not identified what&#8217;s behind these increases.</p>
<p>A previous study of women in Washington state found that exposure to the weed killer atrazine was tied to an increased risk of having a baby with gastroschisis,although it did not show that the chemical caused the malformation (see Reuters Health story of February 8,2010 here: reut.rs/l9aVTl).</p>
<p>Robbins said that smoking is a considered a risk factor,but he doesn&#8217;t think that&#8217;s behind the pattern detected in this study.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a clear explanation for why the rates are going up,&#8221; said Robbins,who was not involved in the current research.</p>
<p>Kirby speculated that it&#8217;s possible nutrition could have something to do with the trend,but more research is needed to figure it out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that there are influences of different vitamins and nutrients that definitely affect fetal development,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But as far as their relation to gastroschisis,&#8221;that&#8217;s just a suspicion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirby&#8217;s research team is currently following up to see how the numbers have changed since 2005.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1144012&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eating less calories may help people extend their lifespan by promoting growth of beneficial bacteria in the body,a new Chinese study claimed today.</p>
<p>In a research conducted on two sets of mice,it was found that the group fed with calorie-restricted low-fat diet lived the longest while those eating high fat food had the shortest lives,a report in the state-run China Daily said.</p>
<p>Analysis of the mice feces showed that some beneficial bacteria that correlate positively with a longer life span are enriched by calorie restriction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scientific research has been pointing to the result that calorie restriction increases life span,but the unanswered questions are why and how,&#8221; said Zhao Liping,a Microbiology professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University,who led the research.&#8221;So this research provides a new angle to explain the relationship between calorie restriction and life span that calorie restriction might take effect via altering gut bacteria,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although we find an association exists between calorie intake and gut bacteria,and bacteria and life span,this is definitely not the only decisive factor for life span,&#8221; Zhao was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Another researcher involved in the study,Liu Yong from the Institute of Nutritional Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences,said it would be some time before the results could be applied to humans too.</p>
<p>However,he pointed out earlier research has shown the influence of gut bacteria on people&#8217;s health. &#8220;The human body is a supraorganism (an organism consisting</p>
<p>of many organisms). There are enormous numbers of microbial communities that influence people&#8217;s health,&#8221; Liu said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example,a lot of research points to the fact that unhealthy gut bacteria plays a role in causing obesity and metabolic disorders,including diabetes,non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and some cardiovascular disease,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1143553&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have discovered a new class of white blood cells in human lung and gut tissues that play a critical role as the first line of defence against harmful fungal and bacterial infections.</p>
<p>The research by Agency for Science,Technology and Research&#8217;s Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN) will have significant impact on the design of vaccines and targeted immunotherapies for diseases caused by infectious microbes such as the hospital-acquired pneumonia.</p>
<p>The scientists also showed for the first time that key immune functions of this new class of white blood cells are similar to those found in mice.</p>
<p>This means that findings in the mouse studies can be applied to develop advanced clinical therapies for the human immune system,researchers said.</p>
<p>All immune responses against infectious agents are activated and regulated by dendritic cells (DCs),a specialised group of white blood cells which present tiny fragments from micro-organisms,vaccines or tumours to the T cells.</p>
<p>T cells are immune cells that circulate around our bodies to scan for cellular abnormalities and infections. Of the different T cells,T helper 17 (Th17) cells specialise in activating a protective response crucial for our body to eliminate harmful bacteria or fungi.</p>
<p>In this study,the scientists identified a new subset of DCs (named CD11b+ DCs),which are capable of activating such protective Th17 response.</p>
<p>They also showed that mice lacking the CD11b+ DCs were unable to induce the protective Th17 response against the Aspergillus fumigatus,one of the most common fungal species in hospital-acquired infections.</p>
<p>&#8220;As dendritic cells have the unique ability to &#8216;sense&#8217; the type of pathogen present in order to activate the appropriate immune response,they are attractive targets to explore for vaccine development,&#8221; said the team leader,Dr Florent Ginhoux from SIgN.</p>
<p>&#8220;This discovery revealed fresh inroads to better exploit dendritic cells for improved vaccine design against life-threatening fungal infections,&#8221; Ginhoux said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Life-threatening fungal infections have increased over the years yet treatment options remain limited,&#8221; said Acting Executive Director of SIgN,Associate Professor Laurent Renia.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study demonstrates how fundamental research that deepens our understanding of the body&#8217;s immune system can translate into potential clinical applications that could save lives and impact healthcare,&#8221; Renia said.</p>
<p>The study done in collaboration with Newcastle University was published in the journal Immunity.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1143541&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Young adults,who are more outgoing or more emotionally stable,are happier in later life than their introverted or less emotionally stable peers,according to a new study.</p>
<p>UK researchers examined the effects of neuroticism and extraversion at ages 16 and 26 years on mental wellbeing and life satisfaction at the age of 60 to 64.</p>
<p>They found that personality dispositions by the time of early adulthood have an enduring influence on well-being decades later.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by Dr Catharine Gale from the Medical Research Council&#8217;s Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit,University of Southampton and a team from the University of Edinburgh and University College London.</p>
<p>&#8220;Few studies have examined the long-term influence of personality traits in youth on happiness and life satisfaction later in life,&#8221; Gale said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found that extroversion in youth had direct,positive effects on well being and life satisfaction in later life. Neuroticism,in contrast,had a negative impact,largely because it tends to make people more susceptible to feelings of anxiety and depression and to physical health problems,&#8221; Gale added.</p>
<p>The study examined data on 4,583 people who are members of the National Survey for Health and Development,conducted by the Medical Research Council. All were born in 1946; they completed a short personality inventory at age 16,and again at age 26.</p>
<p>Extroversion was assessed by questions about their sociability,energy,and activity orientation. Neuroticism was assessed by questions about their emotional stability,mood,and distractibility.</p>
<p>Decades later,when the participants were 60 to 64-years-old,2,529 of them answered a series of questions measuring well-being and their level of satisfaction with life. They also reported on their mental and physical health.</p>
<p>The study found that greater extroversion,as assessed in young adulthood,was directly associated with higher scores for well-being and for satisfaction with life.</p>
<p>Neuroticism,in contrast,predicted poorer levels of well being,but it did so indirectly. People higher in neuroticism as young adults were more susceptible to psychological distress later in life and to a lesser extent,poorer physical health.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding what determines how happy people feel in later life is of particular interest because there is good evidence that happier people tend to live longer,&#8221; Gale said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this study we found that levels of neuroticism and extraversion measured over 40 years earlier were strongly predictive of well-being and life satisfaction in older men and women. Personality in youth appears to have an enduring influence on happiness decades later,&#8221; Gale said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1143536&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain&#8217;s Met Office has issued a heatwave alert for London and south-eastern England as the mercury touched 30 degrees Celsius,a record for the year.</p>
<p>The Level 3 warning,which is one short of a national</p>
<p>emergency,is in place to ensure social and healthcare</p>
<p>services take specific measures targeted at high-risk groups</p>
<p>such as the very young,very old and those who are unwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Temperatures are expected to reach or come very close to</p>
<p>level-three heat-health watch criteria in London and</p>
<p>south-east England. Elsewhere temperatures may come close to criteria; however,certainty is lower,giving a level-two</p>
<p>heat-health watch in all but the north-east and north-west of</p>
<p>England,&#8221; the Met Office said.</p>
<p>Level 3 heat-health warnings are triggered when the</p>
<p>heatwave threshold temperature on average,around 30 degrees Celsius,is reached over the course of one day and the following night,and where forecasters believe there is a 90 per cent chance of it being met again the following day.</p>
<p>A Met Office spokesperson said the mercury could climb as</p>
<p>high as 32 degrees Celsius in London today,which would be the hottest day of the year.</p>
<p>The last time London was issued with a Level 3 warning</p>
<p>was August 18-19 last year.</p>
<p>After five consecutive days of basking in 30 degrees</p>
<p>Celsius and over temperatures,forecasters said Britain was in</p>
<p>the midst of its first prolonged heatwave since 2006.</p>
<p>The alert comes after a series of tragic accidents in which people have died trying to cool off.</p>
<p>Emergency services have reiterated a warning of the</p>
<p>dangers of swimming in open water after the bodies of two men were recovered from the water at a beauty spot in Norfolk,where swimming is banned.</p>
<p>Two Territorial Army soldiers died of suspected heat exhaustion during an SAS military assessment in the Brecon</p>
<p>Beacons in Wales on Saturday. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1143178&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eating a modest amount of walnuts can protect against prostate cancer,a new study has claimed. Researchers from the School of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio injected immune-deficient mice with human prostate cancer cells.</p>
<p>Within three to four weeks,tumours typically started to grow in a large number of these mice. The study asked whether a walnut-enriched diet versus a non-walnut diet would be associated with reduced cancer formation. A previous study found this to be true for breast cancer. The study found that three of 16 mice (18 per cent) eating the walnut-enriched diet developed prostate tumours,compared with 14 of 32 mice (44 per cent) on the non-walnut control diet.</p>
<p>Also,the final average tumour size in the walnut-fed animals was roughly one-fourth the average size of the prostate tumours that developed in the mice eating the control diet.&#8221;We found the results to be stunning because there were so few tumours in animals consuming the walnuts and these tumours grew much more slowly than in the other animals,&#8221; said study senior author Russel Reiter,professor of cellular and structural biology at the Health Science Center.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were absolutely surprised by how highly effective the walnut diet was in terms of inhibition of human prostate cancer,&#8221; Reiter said. The mice consumed a diet typically used in animal studies,except with the addition of a small amount of walnuts pulverised into a fine powder to prevent the rodents from only eating the walnuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The walnut portion was not a large percentage of the diet. It was the equivalent to a human eating about 2 ounces,or two handfuls,a day,which is not a lot of walnuts,&#8221; Reiter said. Study co-author W Elaine Hardman,of the Joan C Edwards School of Medicine at Marshall University,had published a</p>
<p>study in 2011 that showed fewer and smaller tumours among</p>
<p>walnut-fed mice injected with human breast cancer cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;The data to date suggest that using walnuts on a regular</p>
<p>basis in the diet may be beneficial to defer,prevent or delay</p>
<p>some types of cancer,including breast and prostate,&#8221; Reiter</p>
<p>said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1142995&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Children who suffer from arthritis can receive more targeted treatment with Australian researchers claiming to have discovered potential markers for the severity of the disorder. </p>
<p>The early results of a world-first study at University of Adelaide and Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Hospital,looking at 115 children with juvenile arthritis have shown that changes in the levels of particular molecules known as &#8216;prostanoids&#8217; &#8211; which are formed from essential fatty acids &#8211; in the blood of these patients may predict the course of arthritis more accurately,and help provide more individualised treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arthritis in children is almost as common as juvenile diabetes,with up to one in 500 children affected. Despite having many available treatments,not all children with arthritis will respond to standard therapies,&#8221; says the leader of this research,Dr Christina Boros. &#8220;For many children arthritis can be a physically debilitating and emotionally challenging condition. </p>
<p>Some are unable to perform simple tasks because the swelling of their joints can affect their motor skills,&#8221; Boros said.&#8221;Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can present at any age,with some children diagnosed as early as 6-9 months. The longer children go without treatment,the more likely they are to have permanent joint damage,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The relationships between the blood levels of molecules called &#8216;prostanoids&#8217; and disease activity in childhood arthritis has already been established by the researchers. &#8220;This is promising research. We are now expanding our study to look at a larger group of children with arthritis,and how prostanoids may predict arthritis disease activity over time as well as how the use of medications affects prostanoid levels,&#8221; said Boros.</p>
<p>Boros said that having confirmed biomarkers could not only change how we treat the childhood arthritis,but also reduce the physical,emotional and financial burden of the disease. &#8220;There are many medications available for juvenile arthritis but unfortunately there is still no cure. Anything that can improve treatment and prevent joint damage is welcome,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1142035&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Children of obese fathers are at a greater risk of being overweight,a new study by Australian researchers has claimed. Adelaide University&#8217;s Robinson Institute team has found molecular signals in the sperm of obese fathers could produce diabetes-like symptoms and obesity in two generations of offspring,even if those children consumed healthy food.</p>
<p>Researcher Tod Fullston said that this was the first time such a link was found. &#8220;A father&#8217;s diet changes the molecular makeup of the sperm,&#8221; he was quoted by ABC News as saying. &#8220;With obese fathers,the changes in their sperm,in their microRNA molecules,might programme the embryo for obesity or metabolic disease later in life,&#8221; Fullston said.</p>
<p>He said research had used mice and the next step would be human trials. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be proposing to do human studies based around that very thing,whether men with a higher BMI (body mass index) do indeed have a different microRNA profile within their sperm and we&#8217;d also like to have a look at whether diet and exercise return that to what it would be in a normal weight male,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The study found that the second generation could face similar metabolic disorders,including obesity,however,not a severe one. Fullston said even if an obese father had no signs of diabetes,metabolic disease similar to diabetes could turn up in two generations of descendants.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1142012&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists claim to have come closer to developing a cure for cancer using the body&#8217;s own immune system to fight tumour cells. Researchers at a British company Immunocore has developed a way of harnessing the power of the immune system&#8217;s natural-born killer cells: the T-cells of the blood which seek out and kill invading pathogens,such as viruses and bacteria. &#8220;Immunotherapy is radically different,&#8221; said Bent Jakobsen,chief scientific officer of Immunocore.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t do away with the other cancer treatments by any means,but it adds something to the arsenal that has one unique feature it may have the potency to actually cure cancer,&#8221; Jakobsen said. The company has found a way of designing small protein molecules,which it calls ImmTACs,that effectively act as double-ended glue,&#8217;The Independent&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>ImmTACs are effectively independent T-cell receptors that are &#8220;bispecific&#8221;,meaning they bind strongly to cancer cells at one end,and T-cells at the other ¿ so introducing cancer cells to their nemesis,researchers said. &#8220;What we can do is to use that scaffold of the T-cell receptor to make something that is very good at recognising cancer even if it doesn&#8217;t exist naturally,&#8221; said Jakobsen. &#8220;Although T-cells are not very keen at recognising cancer,we can force them to do so. The potential you have if you can engineer T-cell receptors is quite enormous. You can find any type of cell and any kind of target. This means the approach can in theory be used against any cancer,whether it is tumours of the prostate,breast,liver or the pancreas,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The key to the success of the technique is being able to distinguish between a cancer cell and a normal,healthy cell. Immunocore&#8217;s drug does this by recognising small proteins or peptides that stick out from the surface membrane of cancer cells,the report said. Researchers said all cells extrude peptides on their membranes and these peptides act like a shop window,telling scientists what is going on within the cell,and whether it is cancerous. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1141665&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Jogesh Grover,CEO of Retasaan Management Solutions,needed help getting a legal approval,the only thing he had to do was walk over to the next desk at work. Sitting next to him were a bunch of legal experts who solved his query in a jiffy. Grover is one amongst around 100 entrepreneurs and freelancers working out of Delhis 91Springboard that he and two others launched in January this year. According to the website,91Springboard provides an ecosystem where freelancers,entrepreneurs and creative professionals meet to accelerate their start-ups. </p>
<p>Co-working,or people from varied professions working out of one office,was not a common phenomenon till recently. Its only in the past two years,with places like 91Springboard and Moonlighting in Delhi,Bombay Connect and SutraHR Co-working in Mumbai,and CoWorkIndia and Jaaga in Bangalore,that </p>
<p>co-working has witnessed significant growth. </p>
<p>My website stopped working once. I just had to share my problem and someone was there at my desk to help me. The environment,mentoring and support are other factors that suit people like us working here, says Grover working at 91Springboard,which,spread over 10,000 sq ft,offers all that an entrepreneur might need during the course of a regular dayconference rooms,high-speed internet connectivity,in-house IT and administrative support,24&#215;7 power backup and a cafeteria,among other amenities. The co-working space charges R7,000 per seat for a month and R3,999-4,999 for 15 days.</p>
<p>In 2011,Delhi-based entrepreneur Yatin K Thakur opened his small office for co-working to get access to a verified and trusted network of people and common infrastructure that could reduce operational costs. The result was Moonlighting. Besides regular services such as shared desks and internet connectivity,it provides access to start-up mentors,investors,accelerators and incubators. It also provides accommodation at an additional cost of R750 per day. We also have team membership options for groups of three or more people. Under this,each team enjoys a 15% discount on our co-working membership, says Thakur. Moonlighting offers a co-working space for R999-6,000 per seat per month depending on the requirement. </p>
<p>Bangalore-based CoWorkIndia is open to freelancers and small firms that provide services such as design,public relations,digital marketing,development,accounting,human resources,and legal and administrative support. It operates purely on a rental basis and there is no equity involved (although there is a screening process in place). CoWorkIndia,which started last year,offers a co-working space for R3,500 per seat per month. It also has a daily plan starting at R300. A professional office space not only improves productivity,it also helps in gaining a customers confidence and winning the battle of perception against larger companies when it comes to hiring, says one of the founders,Nanda Kishore. A technology start-up begins with two people but grows fast once it finds traction. Therefore,flexibility in an office space is important for </p>
<p>a start-up. </p>
<p>Providing bare and essential office maintenance services to keep its overheads low,CoWorkIndias current capacity is around 150 seats. The founders,however,are planning to add another 60 seats by August-end. We earn around R400 per occupied seat per month. Our break-even point is 80% occupancy, says Kishore,adding,economies of scale for an office space kick in only at 100 or more seats. It was always a challenge to find a professional yet economical office space in Bangalore for less than 15 people. In 2012,when the primary lessee of a shared office space moved out,CoWorkIndia was set up to become a primary lease owner. Since then,it has grown four-fold. Jaaga,another start-up venture in Bangalore,charges R500 per seat per month to R100 per day.</p>
<p>Varun Chawla,one of the three founders of 91Springboard,was himself a struggling entrepreneur before founding the co-working space. I wanted to give a plug-and-play (facility) to all new entrepreneurs. 91Springboard gives people infrastructure,access to service providers,networking and,if required,funding also to new start-ups, says Chawla,whose previous start-up Myguesthouse.com,a travel portal providing quality budget accommodation in India and abroad,was acquired by online travel firm </p>
<p>MakeMyTrip. </p>
<p>However,for most entrepreneurs who have started co-working spaces,its not about profit. The focus is instead on meeting interesting people and creating a network. Moonlighting is a community-driven space where we do not target profits. We look at comfortable sustainability and creating value through a secured network, says Thakur.</p>
<p>Some ventures,in fact,dont even advertise and instead use social networking sites as the only form of marketing. Says Kishore of CoWorkIndia,Our business is based purely on word-of-mouth. We reach out to customers primarily through Facebook. An informal approach to a serious jobbut one that obviously works.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1141450&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Inspired by a few success stories,several farmers in grape country Nashik turned to wine making without a second thought. A tough decade later,more than half the ventures are burdened with 
debt. But the wine makers are not giving up,insisting they will eventually emerge successful<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1141443&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 10 years ago,almost every farmer in Nashik was drunk on the idea of making wine. The inspiration was the success of Sula Vineyards in their backyard,now the top player in the country. The push was the Maharashtra Grape Processing Policy,2001,which played a major role in attracting many to this market. But it was the hitch that most farmers were not aware of. </p>
<p>Back then,not many realised that wine making is very hard work. Farmers jumped on to the bandwagon without understanding the intricacies of the business. This led to sub-standard products and poor marketing. As a result,of the 72 wineries in the state,40 are today facing financial problems,with an accumulated debt of R200 crore.</p>
<p>Most of the wine makers are small players who are either bulk suppliers or making wines in the volume segment,vying desperately for a place among the top brands like Sula Vineyards,Four Seasons by the UB Group,Grover Zampa Vineyards and Pernod Ricard. </p>
<p>One of these is Sahayadri Valley Wines located in Dindori,the hub of winemaking in Nashik. Waiting to make it big,the winery has some 80,000 litres in stock since 2009. Rajesh Borse,the owner,invests heavily in keeping the wine in mint condition. Electricity bills are huge,but the winery is hopeful of getting good buyers soon. </p>
<p>The story of Deshmukh Vineyards is somewhat better. Suresh Deshmukh is a first-generation wine entrepreneur who started with a 1.25-lakh capacity winery in 2005 and a year later expanded it by another 1 lakh litre. He sells wines in the R420-700 per bottle price range and all his wine labels are prefixed with a D (for Deshmukh) to signify his brand. I did feel the pinch in 2008-09 along with the others,but I learnt on the job. Wine making is an expensive business. It takes R40-50 lakh a year just to keep the winery going. Electricity bills come up to R60,000 per month and tanks have to remain chilled, he explains. Deshmukh now has a marketing team in place and says he markets his wine aggressively in Maharashtra. </p>
<p>Unlike others who took the plunge without bothering to learn the business,Deshmukh first visited vineyards in Germany and France to get a feel of wine making. Vying with the big brands is a tall order,but his wines are slowly finding a niche. I started with a 35-acre vineyard for table grapes in 2001. The same year,20 of us went to Italy and visited wineries in Bordeaux and Italy. I added 50 acres for grape wine cultivation and started my winery with 1.25-lakh litre capacity, he says. This season,his winery has produced about 70,000 litres (8,000 cases) of wine and has about 1.50 lakh litres in stock. </p>
<p>Deshmukh says after Sula,there is really no player in the second or third spot and it is this position that his winery is gunning for. The going has been tough all these years,with the total taxes coming up to 30%. Maintenance (keeping the tanks chilled) alone comes to several hundred thousands every month. But the worst is over and the winery is now reaching break-even point. In the next couple of years,we should begin to make profits, Deshmukh says. There are plans to add sparkling wines to the portfolio and the company has applied for a licence for grape spirit as well. We are taking things slowly,one step at a time,and should soon get there, feels Deshmukh. </p>
<p>Located barely a km away from the Sula Vineyards,York Winery has a feel similar to Sula. The expanse of winery with a tasting room overlooks the Gangapur Lake and has a restaurant with a small theatre-type entertainment area. A small resort is in the offing soon. York appears to emulate Sula as a role model,but owner Ravi Gurnani is quick to point out that his winery has established its own brand. And,it was not easy. Establishing a brand takes time. It has been a tough journey. If given a second chance,probably I would have done things differently,like get a better feel of the market before jumping in. I would say we are still some way from succeeding,but our wines are recognised for quality, he says. </p>
<p>Gurnani and his brother-in-law were quick in identifying the need for reasonably-priced export-quality wine,as well as setting up a spot for a quick modern getaway catering to the upwardly mobile middle class. The family bought nine acres in 2004,on which table grapes were growing. They decided to start growing wine grapes and construct a winery on the land. The wine bar and the tasting room came up in 2009 and business has been slowly picking up since. Apart from their own wines,York is also a contract manufacturer and has been making wine for the Good Earth Winery and Mandala Valley wines from Bangalore. The firm also started bottling for Turning Point label and is using the facility for the Chandon sparkling wine for Moet and Chandon. The winery has a capacity of 4 lakh litres,produces about 1.5 lakh litres (barring Chandon) and makes about six varieties. In 2012,the winery made about 15,000-17,000 cases. They export under a very smart Mantra label and have sparkling wine next on the agenda. Domestically,their wine is available in Bangalore and Maharashtra right now,but there are plans to increase presence in Goa and Delhi. </p>
<p>Seeing the rush of wine tourists in the region,the winery is also cashing in on wine tourism and plans to have accommodation for tourists on its premises. On a weekend,York receives around 250 visitors,with an average of 400 tourists every week. The winery is still a couple of years away from profits,but Gurnani says he does not regret the decision to enter this business. </p>
<p>He adds,The sector has been doing alright,but not as well as everyone expected. There has been oversupply and not much demand and that is the reality today. The cheaper wine segment is growing fast,but the margins are wafer-thin. Wines in this category are commodotised since the buyers in this category are not very brand-conscious. Gurnani says establishing a brand takes time and there are limited areas of opportunity for promotions. He agrees that there were many who got into the business without understanding how it works. This resulted in many sub-standard wines and the negative feedback did not help. There are several wineries that supply in bulk or are dormant today, he says. But he insists that many have learnt their lessons and the serious players will prevail. This happens with any industry and it has happened with our industry as well, he sums up. </p>
<p>On the threshold of success</p>
<p>The sentiment is echoed by Jagdish Holkar,chairman,Indian Grape Processing Board (IGPB),who concedes that around 40-odd wineries in the state are in trouble,but quickly adds that all of them are technically viable and in running condition. He says IGPB and All India Wine Producers Association (AIWPA) have appealed to the Maharashtra government to come to the aid of wine makers. The accumulated losses of the wineries amount to R200 crore and these units can become viable if they are permitted to restructure their loans,he feels. </p>
<p>Neeraj Agarwal,vice-president,Sula Vineyards,says although small players have had to approach banks for funds to keep their wineries running,banks are yet to understand the needs of the industry. From making wines to selling them in the market is an 18-month cycle and,therefore,an industry-relevant credit facility is required. This has been explained to the Reserve Bank of India and Planning Commission. Now,the AIWPA is talking to the state government as well, he says. </p>
<p>Wine maker Deshmukh adds that there is no uniform taxation when it comes to wine and every state has a different tax policy,which needs to be regulated. Wine consumption in India is around 10 ml per capita in contrast to 5 litres per capita in Italy and France. Even if we manage to double the existing Indian consumption,there is a huge market waiting to be tapped, he reasons.</p>
<p>However,its not just the smaller players who are struggling. Even some big names are not doing well. The oldest in India,Chowgules  Indage,is today debt-laden and broke. Their wine business,proposed wine bars and wine-inspired hospitality business have all floundered.  </p>
<p>Four Seasons Winery,part of Vijay Mallyas UB Groups United Spirits,started with the Sharad Pawar family and 2,000 grape growers as stakeholders,has not met its ambitious targets. In July 2006,the company had said they would make five million bottles or four lakh cases in five years. But the company has crossed sales of only a lakh cases of premium and semi-premium wine this year. </p>
<p>However,Holkar is optimistic. The first decade of the Indian wine industry went in learning how to make wine. Indian wineries are now on the threshold of another era where the focus will be on quality. Indian wineries will soon begin to adopt quality norms defined by the International Organisation for Vine and Wine (OIV) so that Indian wine is acceptable in international markets, he says. India has become the 45th member of the OIV,a move that is expected to boost its wine exports. </p>
<p>Agarwal also paints a very positive picture for the industry. The market is going to grow. It is a matter of time. This is a transitional phase and education about wine should go a long way in creating a market, he says. Stressing on wine tourism,he says Nashik has an ideal climate for grapes. The terrain and water availability is good here and wine tourism is a big opportunity. Sula alone has some two lakh visitors a year and has established resorts and restaurants to cater to this market.</p>
<p>Manoj Jagtap,coordinator,AIWPA,who also supplies wine accessories for wineries,agrees that wine tourism is the next big thing for Nashik. There are 200 wine tourists visiting Nashik every day and the number is bound to grow with interest in wine growing,he says. Jagtap says he has been advising new entrants to first establish their brands before venturing into setting up physical infrastructure. There are big players coming into the market and the industry is already getting back on its feet, he maintains.</p>
<p>Construction is already well underway near Nashik for Moët Hennessys first winery in India. The company has already produced its maiden 2012 vintage at a separate facility and a launch is scheduled for October this year in Mumbai. Locals say Hindustan Construction Company (HCC),which set up Lavasa (the countrys first planned hill city) in Pune,has also ventured into wine making at Charosa village in Dindori. However,the company is yet to announce this officially. </p>
<p>Agarwal of Sula says there are several other overseas players watching the Indian market with interest and they could soon come here. The Indian wine market has a good potential,and there is a sizeable amount of import as well. This gap provides an opportunity that can be filled with good-quality wines produced domestically, he says. An opportunity clearly waiting to be tapped.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1141443&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[People who witness parental divorce are more likely to contract inflammatory diseases.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1141413&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People who experience parental divorce during childhood have higher levels of an inflammatory marker in the blood which is known to predict future health,according to new research. Researchers from University College London (UCL) found that children who experienced the breakdown in their parent&#8217;s relationship before the age of 16,regardless of whether their parents were married or not,had 16 per cent higher levels of C-reactive protein at age 44. C-reactive protein is a marker of inflammation measured in blood samples. Long-term raised C-reactive protein is a known risk factor for diseases such as coronary heart disease and type II diabetes.</p>
<p>This study is based on data from 7,462 people in the 1958 National Child Development Study,an on-going longitudinal study which has followed a large group of people since their birth in 1958. The authors also looked at why this relationship might exist. They found that the relationship between parental divorce and later inflammation was mainly explained by adolescent material disadvantage and educational attainment,although the specific mechanisms remain unclear. In particular,those who experienced parental separation before the age of 16 were more likely to be materially disadvantaged in adolescence and had lower educational qualifications by adulthood,compared to children who grew up with both parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our study suggests that it is not parental divorce or separation per se which increases the risk of later inflammation but that it is other social disadvantages,such as how well the child does in education,which are triggered by having experienced parental divorce which are important,&#8221; said Dr Rebecca Lacey,Research Associate in the UCL</p>
<p>Department of Epidemiology and Public Health and lead author</p>
<p>of the study. The study was published in journal Psychoneuroendocrinology. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1141413&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While doctors and health officials battle rising cesarean section rates,a fresh look at past research suggests that induction of labor may not be contributing to the problem.</p>
<p>It has been thought that inducing labor in a woman whose pregnancy has lasted too long,but whose water hasn&#8217;t broken,could result in the need for a C-section.</p>
<p>But in a review of 37 studies on labor induction,researchers found that it actually decreased the risk of having a C-section.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite remarkable that the studies do show a slight reduction of C-sections,&#8221; said Dr. Stephen Wood,the report&#8217;s lead author from the University of Calgary in Canada.</p>
<p>Previous studies have linked inducing labor with an increased risk of women having C-sections,which led to the belief that reducing inductions would also reduce the number of cesarean procedures.</p>
<p>That research,however,is mostly based on studies that didn&#8217;t account for other complications that might increase the women&#8217;s risk for C-sections.</p>
<p>Currently,about 32 percent of U.S. births are by C-section,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The procedure increases the chance of bowel or bladder injuries for women and puts babies at risk of breathing problems.</p>
<p>For the new study,Wood and his colleagues reviewed clinical trials that randomly assigned women who were 37 to 42 weeks pregnant to either wait for natural labor to happen or for labor to be induced.</p>
<p>Most of the trials dealt with women who had no problems other than a prolonged labor,but 10 trials did look at women who were having twins or had other health problems,such as diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>The researchers had data on about 6,250 women who were randomized to have labor induced and about 5,920 women who were put in a wait-and-see group.</p>
<p>Overall,about 17 percent of the women who had labor induced ended up having a C-section,compared to about 20 percent of women in the wait-and-see group.</p>
<p>The results suggest that reducing inductions won&#8217;t do much to reduce the number of cesarean procedures,according to Soo Downe,a professor at the University of Central Lancashire in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really premature to try and reach a conclusion about what might make a difference for it,&#8221; said Downe,who published an editorial accompanying the new study in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology.</p>
<p>Wood also warned that the results of the analysis do not mean that all women whose pregnancy lasts too long should be induced,because better studies are needed.</p>
<p>For example,the trials included in the analysis may have excluded the riskiest patients,which could skew the results.</p>
<p>But,he added,there is a message for women.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that they should perhaps worry less about whether or not they&#8217;re going to have a C-section just because they&#8217;re going to be induced,&#8221; Wood said.</p>
<p>Downe added that induction and C-section rates are often regional and women should check their doctor&#8217;s and hospital&#8217;s rates to get a better projection of whether they&#8217;ll be induced or have a C-section.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to tell you about what&#8217;s going to happen to them,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1140999&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four-year-olds with shorter than average sleep times have more behaviour problems,exhibiting aggression and throwing tantrums,a new study has found.</p>
<p>&#8220;Preschool children with shorter nighttime sleep duration had higher odds of parent-reported overactivity,anger,aggression,impulsivity,tantrums,and annoying behaviours,&#8221; according to the study by Dr Rebecca J Scharf of University of Virginia,Charlottesville,and colleagues.</p>
<p>The researchers analysed parent responses from a study of approximately 9,000 children,followed from birth through kindergarten age.</p>
<p>When the children were four years old,nighttime sleep duration was estimated by asking the parents what time their child typically went to bed and woke on weekdays.</p>
<p>On a standard child behaviour questionnaire,parents rated their child on six different &#8220;externalising&#8221; behaviour problems such as anger and aggression.</p>
<p>Externalising behaviour problems are outward behaviours,distinguished from &#8220;internalising&#8221; problems such as depression and anxiety. The relationship between sleep duration and behaviour scores was assessed,with adjustment for other factors that might affect sleep or behaviour.</p>
<p>The average bedtime was 8:39 pm and wake time 7:13 am,giving a mean nighttime sleep duration of about ten and a half hours. Eleven per cent of children were considered to have &#8220;short sleep duration&#8221; of less than 9 hours (calculated as one</p>
<p>standard deviation below the average).</p>
<p>On the child behaviour questionnaire,16 per cent of children had a high score for externalising behaviour problems. Behaviour problems were more common for boys,</p>
<p>children who watched more than two hours of television daily,and those whose mothers reported feeling depressed.</p>
<p>After adjustment for other factors,&#8221;Children in the shortest sleep groups have significantly worse behaviour than children with longer sleep duration,&#8221; Scharf and colleagues said.</p>
<p>The effect was greatest for aggressive behaviour problems,which were about 80 per cent more likely for children with nighttime sleep duration of less than 9 hours.</p>
<p>Shorter sleep times were also associated with 30- to 46-per cent increases in rates of the other externalising behaviours studied,including overactivity,anger,impulsivity,tantrums,and annoying behaviours. In a linear analysis,as sleep duration increased,troubling behaviours decreased.</p>
<p>Although the study can&#8217;t draw any conclusions about causality,&#8221;there is good reason to believe that short nighttime sleep duration leads to externalising behaviours,&#8221; the researchers wrote in the Journal of Developmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1140552&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Glued to your cell phone? It may reduce your fitness and physical activity. High cell phone use is associated with poor fitness in college students,a new study has found.</p>
<p>Researchers from Kent State University in US were interested in the relationship between smartphones and fitness levels because,unlike the television,phones are small and portable,therefore making it possible to use them while doing physical activity.</p>
<p>They found that despite the phone&#8217;s mobility,high use contributed to a sedentary lifestyle for some subjects. More than 300 college students from the Midwest were surveyed on their cell phone usage and activity level. Of those students,49 had their fitness level and body composition tested.</p>
<p>The researchers&#8217; results showed that students who spent large amounts of time on their cell phones &#8211; as much as 14 hours per day &#8211; were less fit than those who averaged a little more than 90 minutes of cell phone use daily.</p>
<p>The study is believed to be the first to assess the relationship between cell phone use and fitness level among any population.</p>
<p>Researchers Jacob Barkley and Andrew Lepp,faculty members in the College of Education,Health and Human Services at the University concluded that their findings suggest that cell phone use may be able to gauge a person&#8217;s risk for a multitude of health issues related to an inactive lifestyle.</p>
<p>The study was published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1140543&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite public health campaigns,smoking remains the leading avoidable cause of death worldwide,killing almost six million people a year,mostly in low- and middle-income countries,the World Health Organization has said.</p>
<p>If current trends hold,the number of deaths blamed on tobacco use will rise to eight million a year in 2030,the WHO said yesterday in a briefing unveiled at a conference in Panama.</p>
<p>About 80 percent of tobacco-related deaths forecast for 2030 are expected in low- and middle-income countries,the report added. &#8220;If we do not close ranks and ban tobacco advertising,promotion and sponsorship,adolescents and young adults will continue to be lured into tobacco consumption by an ever-more aggressive tobacco industry,&#8221; said WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every country has the responsibility to protect its population from tobacco-related illness,disability and death.&#8221; Among the dead this year,five million were tobacco users or former users,while more than 600,000 died from second-hand smoke,according to the WHO.</p>
<p>Tobacco use is believed to have caused the deaths of 100 million people in the 20th century. Barring dramatic change,the tally for this century could soar to one billion people,the WHO warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that only complete bans on tobacco advertising,promotion and sponsorship are effective,&#8221; Dr Douglas Bettcher,the Director of the WHO&#8217;s Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases department,told the Panama conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Countries that introduced complete bans together with other tobacco control measures have been able to cut tobacco use significantly within only a few years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The report noted that 2.3 billion people from 92 countries benefit from some form of smoking restrictions,more than double the number who did five years ago. However,that figure still represents just a third of the world&#8217;s population.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1140495&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women are better at coping with stress than men due to the protective effect of female hormone estrogen,a new study has claimed. Researchers from the University at Buffalo in US found that the enzyme aromatase,which produces estradiol,an estrogen hormone,in the brain,is responsible for female stress resilience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have examined the molecular mechanism underlying gender-specific effects of stress,&#8221; said senior author Zhen Yan,a professor in the Department of Physiology and Biophysics in the university. &#8220;Previous studies have found that females are more resilient to chronic stress and now our research has found the reason why,&#8221; Yan said.</p>
<p>The research showed that in rats exposed to repeated episodes of stress,females respond better than males because of the protective effect of estrogen.</p>
<p>In the UB study,young female rats exposed to one week of periodic physical restraint stress showed no impairment in their ability to remember and recognise objects they had previously been shown. In contrast,young males exposed to the same stress were impaired in their short-term memory.</p>
<p>An impairment in the ability to correctly remember a familiar object signifies some disturbance in the signalling ability of the glutamate receptor in the prefrontal cortex,the brain region that controls working memory,attention,decision-making,emotion and other high-level &#8220;executive&#8221; processes.</p>
<p>Last year,Yan and colleagues published in journal Neuron a paper showing that repeated stress results in loss of the glutamate receptor in the prefrontal cortex of young males. The new study shows that the glutamate receptor in the prefrontal cortex of stressed females is intact.</p>
<p>The findings provide more support for a growing body of research demonstrating that the glutamate receptor is the molecular target of stress,which mediates the stress response,according to the study in the journal Molecular Psychiatry.</p>
<p>The stressors used in the experiments mimic challenging and stressful,but not dangerous,experiences that humans face,such as those causing frustration and feelings of being under pressure,Yan said.</p>
<p>By manipulating the amount of estrogen produced in the brain,the UB researchers were able to make the males respond to stress more like females and the females respond more like males. &#8220;When estrogen signalling in the brains of females was</p>
<p>blocked,stress exhibited detrimental effects on them. When estrogen signalling was activated in males,the detrimental effects of stress were blocked,&#8221; Yan said. &#8220;We still found the protective effect of estrogen in female rats whose ovaries were removed. It suggests that it might be estrogen produced in the brain that protects against the detrimental effects of stress,&#8221; Yan said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1140029&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>E-skin! Researchers have discovered a new and cheaper method to develop &#8216;artificial skin&#8217; which can sense touch,humidity and temperature just like the real skin. Using tiny gold particles and a kind of resin,a team of scientists at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa,Israel has found how to make a new kind of flexible sensor that could be integrated into electronic skin,or e-skin.</p>
<p>The new system is at least 10 times more sensitive in touch than the currently existing touch-based e-skin systems,researchers said. If scientists learn how to attach e-skin to prosthetic limbs,people with amputations might once again be able to feel changes in their environments,they said. The secret lies in the sensor&#8217;s ability to detect three kinds of data simultaneously. While current kinds of e-skin detect only touch,the new invention &#8220;can simultaneously sense touch,humidity,and temperature,as real skin can do,&#8221; said research team leader Professor Hossam Haick.</p>
<p>Additionally,the new system &#8220;is at least 10 times more sensitive in touch than the currently existing touch-based e-skin systems,&#8221; said Haick. Researchers have long been interested in flexible sensors,but have had trouble adapting them for real-world use. To make its way into mainstream society,a flexible sensor would have to run on low voltage (so it would be compatible with the batteries in today&#8217;s portable devices),measure a wide range of pressures,and make more than one measurement at a time,including humidity,temperature,pressure,and the presence of chemicals.</p>
<p>In addition,these sensors would also have to be able to be made quickly,easily,and cheaply,researchers said. The Technion team&#8217;s sensor has all of these qualities. The secret is the use of monolayer-capped nanoparticles that are only 5-8 nanometers in diameter,made of gold and surrounded by connector molecules called ligands. &#8220;Monolayer-capped nanoparticles can be thought of as flowers,where the center of the flower is the gold or metal nanoparticle and the petals are the monolayer of organic ligands that generally protect it,&#8221; said Haick.</p>
<p>The team discovered that when these nanoparticles are laid on top of a substrate &#8211; in this case,made of PET (flexible polyethylene terephthalate) &#8211; the resulting compound conducted electricity differently depending on how the substrate was bent.This electrical property means that the sensor can detect a large range of pressures,from tens of milligrammes to tens of grammes.</p>
<p>And by varying how thick the substrate is,as well as what it is made of,scientists can modify how sensitive the sensor is. The findings appear in the journal ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1139614&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although not thought to be medically dangerous,the flattened head shape can become permanent,researchers said &#8211; which can have psychological implications for kids as they grow up.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is super common,&#8221; said Dr. Lisa Stellwagen,a neonatologist from the University of California,San Diego School of Medicine,who has studied what&#8217;s known as plagiocephaly.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the Back To Sleep (campaign) and the overuse of car seats,and people not holding their babies like they used to,we&#8217;ve sort of rediscovered this problem with infants&#8217; head shapes,&#8221; Stellwagen,who wasn&#8217;t involved in the new study,told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>Pediatricians in the early 1990s began telling parents to put their babies to sleep on their backs,in an effort to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS),also known as crib death.</p>
<p>That campaign was &#8220;enormously successful,&#8221; Stellwagen said &#8211; and the new findings do not mean parents should stop following that advice.</p>
<p>But there are steps they can take &#8211; such as holding their baby as often as possible and having &#8220;tummy time&#8221; when the baby is awake and supervised &#8211; to limit skull deformations,she added.</p>
<p>For their study,Aliyah Mawji from Mount Royal University in Calgary,Alberta,and her colleagues examined the heads of 440 healthy infants seen for their two-month well-child visit at one of four clinics.</p>
<p>They found that 205 babies,or about 47 percent,had some sort of head deformation visible to the naked eye. More than three-quarters of those were mild,the researchers wrote Monday in Pediatrics.</p>
<p>Prior studies suggested that anywhere from 3 percent to 61 percent of babies have a flat spot on their head,Mawji and her colleagues noted.</p>
<p>Some research has tied plagiocephaly to delayed crawling or rolling over,but babies tend to catch up by 18 months,Mawji said &#8211; so it&#8217;s the potential for being bullied as a child that&#8217;s more of a concern.</p>
<p>She said the deformation can be corrected with a helmet &#8211; but those typically cost $1,000 to $3,000,so they should only be a &#8220;last resort.&#8221;</p>
<p>For young babies,treatment for a flat spot looks a lot like prevention,researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to vary the side of the head that you&#8217;re putting your infant to sleep on,&#8221; Mawji told Reuters Health. &#8220;If their head automatically turns to the right  what you need to do the next night is turn their head to the left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like Stellwagen,Mawji recommended parents keep their baby out of a car seat when they&#8217;re not driving. She also said they should alternate the hand they hold the baby in while feeding.</p>
<p>Parents might not notice a small head deformation because they get used to how their baby looks,Stellwagen said,so it&#8217;s important for doctors to take a close look at the skull at early well-child visits.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1139515&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bugs may be among the last survivors of the end of the world,researchers say. Thermophilic or heat-loving bacteria may be amongst the last life on Earth,perhaps surviving 2.8 billion years into the future,according to a new study.</p>
<p>In two billion years&#8217; time,life on Earth will be confined to pockets of liquid water deep underground,according to astrobiologist Jack O&#8217;Malley James of the University of St Andrews.</p>
<p>The new research also suggests that though the hardiest forms of life may have a foothold on similar worlds in orbit around other stars,evidence for it may be very subtle. Ultimately,a combination of slow and rapid environmental changes will result in the extinction of all species on Earth,with the last inhabitants disappearing within 2.8 billion years from now.</p>
<p>The main driver for these changes will be the Sun. As it ages over the next few billion years,the Sun will remain stable but become steadily more luminous,increasing the intensity of its heat felt on Earth and warming the planet to such an extent that the oceans evaporate.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Malley James has created a computer model to simulate these extremely long-range temperature forecasts and has used the results to predict the time-line of future extinctions. Within the next billion years,increased evaporation ratesand chemical reactions with rainwater will draw more and more carbon dioxide from the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. The falling levels of CO2 will lead to the disappearance of plants and animals and our home planet will become a world of microbes.</p>
<p> At the same time the Earth will be depleted of oxygen and will be drying out as the rising temperatures lead to the evaporation of the oceans. A billion years after that the oceans will have gone completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;The far-future Earth will be very hostile to life by this point. All living things require liquid water,so any remaining life will be restricted to pockets of liquid water,perhaps at cooler,higher altitudes or in caves or underground,&#8221; said O&#8217;Malley-James. This life will need to cope with many extremes like high temperatures and intense ultraviolet radiation and only a few microbial species known on Earth today could cope with this. The new model not only tells us a lot about our own planet&#8217;s future,but it can also help us to recognise other inhabited planets that may be approaching the end of their habitable lifetimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have now simulated a dying biosphere composed of populations of the species that are most likely to survive to determine what types of gases they would release to the atmosphere. By the point at which all life disappears from the planet,we&#8217;re left with a nitrogen:carbon-dioxide atmosphere with methane being the only sign of active life,&#8221; said O&#8217;Malley-James.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1139096&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smokers and single men are more likely to acquire cancer-causing oral human papillomavirus (HPV),according to a new study.</p>
<p>Researchers from Moffitt Cancer Center,the National Cancer Institute,Mexico and Brazil report that newly acquired oral HPV infections in healthy men are rare and when present,usually resolve within one year.</p>
<p>HPV infection is known to cause virtually all cervical cancers,most anal cancers and some genital cancers. It has recently been established as a cause of the majority of oropharyngeal cancers,a malignancy of the tonsils and base of tongue.</p>
<p>HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer is rare,but rates have been increasing rapidly,especially among men. To determine the pattern of HPV acquisition and persistence in the oral region,researchers evaluated the HPV infection status in oral mouthwash samples collected as part of the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) Study.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some types of HPV,such as HPV16,are known to cause cancer at multiple places in the body,including the oral cavity,&#8221; said study lead author Christine M Pierce Campbell.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that HPV infection is associated with oropharyngeal cancer,but we don&#8217;t know how the virus progresses from initial infection to cancer in the oral cavity,&#8221; said Campbell.</p>
<p>During the first 12 months,nearly 4.5 per cent of men in the study acquired an oral HPV infection. Less than 1 per cent of men in the study had an HPV16 infection,the most commonly acquired type,and less than 2 per cent had a cancer-causing type of oral HPV.</p>
<p>Their findings are consistent with previous studies showing a low prevalence of oral HPV cancers. However,this study shows the acquisition of cancer-causing oral HPV appeared greater among smokers and unmarried men.</p>
<p><i>The study results appeared in The Lancet journal.</i></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138753&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Younger female employees are more likely to perceive themselves as equal to their male colleagues at workplace,a new international study has found. The study found that because women from the so-called Generation Y &#8211; or those born between the early 1980s and early 2000s &#8211; have been raised with a &#8220;girls can do anything boys can do&#8221; attitude,they perceive greater gender equality in workplace skills,opportunities and accomplishments than their older peers do. The study was based on surveys of more than 1,000 women and 500 men in the US,as well as more than 3,000 females in the UK,France,Germany and China. The research conducted by communications firm FleishmanHillard and Hearst Magazines,found that 70 per cent of Gen Y women describe themselves as smart,compared with only 54 per cent of Gen Y men.</p>
<p>That gender gap shrinks among Gen X females &#8211; those born between the early 1960s and the early 1980s &#8211; and disappears among baby boomers,&#8217;BusinessNewsDaily&#8217; reported. While younger women see themselves in a more positive light,they still lag behind when it comes to their salaries. In each of the five countries surveyed,more than 80 per cent of the women said men are often paid more than women,even for doing the same work,while about half said many men resent the advancements women have made in recent years.</p>
<p>Overall,women see themselves as stronger than men in areas of emotional strength,which includes things like difficult conversations or rebounding from setbacks,but they acknowledge that men often have more success in negotiating and proactively asking for salary increases. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138742&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The powerful painkillers,which include codeine and oxycodone,have been in the spotlight recently as deaths from overdoses rise and more drugs end up in the hands of people taking them for non-medical purposes.</p>
<p>Past studies have found that blacks in pain don&#8217;t receive opioids as often as whites,but the new study suggests economic differences matter in addition to racial ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;The disparities are concerning and definitely warrant further investigation,&#8221; said Dr. Michael Joynt,who led the study at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in New York.</p>
<p>However,he added,there&#8217;s probably not &#8220;any one single factor&#8221; that explains those disparities.</p>
<p>One researcher not involved in the study said cultural differences between doctors and patients and a lack of time to closely evaluate each person in the emergency room may encourage unconscious stereotypes that affect doctors&#8217; treatment decisions.</p>
<p>Lack of standardized guidelines on how to treat pain may also be a factor,Joynt told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>He and his colleagues analyzed data from about 1,400 hospital ERs between 2006 and 2009. During that span,the ERs prescribed opioids to just over 50,000 people reporting moderate or severe pain.</p>
<p>Both race and income were linked to a pain patient&#8217;s chance of being prescribed an opioid.</p>
<p>For example,46 percent of white patients with moderate or severe pain were given opioids,compared to 39 percent of black patients. And 45 percent of non-Hispanic people received the drugs,versus 40 percent of Hispanics.</p>
<p>Likewise,47 percent of pain patients from the wealthiest neighborhoods,based on zip code,were prescribed opioids,compared to 41 percent from the poorest areas,the study team reports in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.</p>
<p>The disparities held after the researchers took into account patients&#8217; injuries and the severity of their pain.</p>
<p>Michelle van Ryn said very few doctors have overt negative attitudes toward minorities or poor people,and all strive to provide equal care.</p>
<p>Prescribing disparities are not about &#8220;a conscious,intentional process of harm,&#8221; van Ryn,from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,Minnesota,told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that there are factors that prevent clinicians from behaving in ways that are consistent with their best intentions and goals,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>That can include busy,crowded ERs and misunderstandings between patients and doctors from different cultural backgrounds,said van Ryn,who has also studied racial disparities in opioid prescribing.</p>
<p>The researchers said they hope their study will spark a conversation about pain control and differences in care on a societal scale. But patients can initiate those talks in the ER too,they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s important for patients presenting for pain to have an open and honest discussion with their providers,&#8221; said Dr. Robert Fortuna,who also worked on the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue of gauging pain is very nuanced.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138679&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Babies need LC-PUFAs for brain growth and development,but studies such as ours show that the benefits persist after infancy and can affect later development,&#8221; lead author Dr. Peter Willatts of the University of Dundee in the UK told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>Fatty acids are important components of nerve cell membranes and are found naturally in breastmilk. They are thought to play an important role in brain development,but are not included in many infant formulas.</p>
<p>In previous studies,babies on PUFA formula tended to learn faster and be more attentive,and the evidence for benefits in older kids is growing,Willatts said by email.</p>
<p>For his team&#8217;s new study,infants in several European countries were randomly divided into three groups of 70 for four months: one group was given formula containing the fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA),one was given regular formula and a third was breastfed.</p>
<p>The researchers later measured the children&#8217;s intelligence,attention control and mental processing speed.</p>
<p>The two formula groups had the same average IQ scores,but the PUFA group processed information faster in a picture-matching game.</p>
<p>Kids in the PUFA group were quickest to match pictures when they got it right,followed by the breastfed group and then the regular formula group,according to the results published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The PUFA children were 20 percent faster at solving the problems,&#8221; than the other formula group,Willatts said. &#8220;You probably wouldn&#8217;t notice this when watching them complete the tests,but the fact that there is an improvement which can be measured is a very important finding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Researchers can&#8217;t say for certain that faster processing would affect all areas of learning in later life,but the measure is related to better performance on reading and math,he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Long term cognitive benefits of including DHA and ARA (two important PUFAs) in infant formula have now been shown in two studies that differ in many aspects of design and were conducted in different parts of the world,&#8221; said Susan Carlson,a nutritionist at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City,who recently authored a similar study in the same journal.</p>
<p>Carlson&#8217;s study in Kansas and Missouri did find a difference in IQ between formula groups at six years of age,but,she said,that may be because Carlson gave infants higher percentages of important PUFAs and continued the supplementation for the first 12 months of life,versus four months in European study.</p>
<p>In most studies,breastfed kids score on average three to five points higher on IQ tests than formula babies,regardless of PUFAs they consume,which Willatts said can&#8217;t easily be explained. The difference may result from other factors,such as the fact that mothers who breastfeed are more often highly educated with higher incomes than mothers who do not.</p>
<p>Both Willatts and Carlson strongly recommend that parents who choose not to breastfeed choose PUFA formulas,which isn&#8217;t difficult to do in the U.S. and Europe,they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost all formulas now contain PUFAs,although the amount varies,&#8221; Willatts said of UK brands. In some countries there are cheaper formulas available without PUFAs,he said.</p>
<p>Carlson said she is not aware of any formulas in the U.S. that do not contain the fatty acids,but some mothers still make their own formulas with evaporated milk,corn syrup and water,which would not contain PUFAs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138677&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good news for those who dread a visit to the dentist!</p>
<p>Scientists have developed a nasal spray that could do away with painful anaesthetic injections for dental procedures. The spray,Kovacaine Mist,was as effective as standard anaesthetics in four out of five patients,according to researchers at the University of Buffalo.</p>
<p>The product has passed phase two clinical trials in the US,&#8217;The Independent&#8217; reported. Safety trials with the US Food and Drugs Administration could be complete by the end of the summer and final product approval in the US could be achieved by next year,according to the manufacturer,St Renatus LLC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patients anxious of the dentist are,in theory,likely to have poorer oral health than those who get regular check-ups,&#8221; said Dr Nigel Carter,chief executive of the British Dental Health Foundation said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This nasal spray could be a very promising addition to any dental practice,&#8221; Carter said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138065&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8216;Taste of Britain Curry Festival&#8217; is all set to travel to the home of curries,India,with leading British chefs aiming to recreate an exclusive selection of dishes that have become a hit in the European country.</p>
<p>Beginning on August 23 at Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kolkata,the festival will see seven British chefs produce as many as 70 dishes including high street favourites like British Chicken Tikka Masala,Lamb chops with plum and coriander sauce and Bengal Lancers shrimp curry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might sound a little odd taking curry to its birthplace but the festival has had an enthusiastic reception in the past from countries such as far afield as America,Bangladesh,Malaysia,Spain,UAE and Eastern Europe,&#8221; said Editor of Curry Life Magazine and Director of the Festival Syed Belal Ahmed at the press launch of the festival here.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister David Cameron in a message of support for the festival said: &#8220;Curry,which of course originated in the Indian subcontinent,is now one of the most popular foods in the UK and has become part of the British way of life. And,those involved in the industry our high streets,boost local economies and contribute to local communities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our shared passion for curry,as with cricket and business,only goes to reinforce the close ties between our countries,&#8221; he added. Labour party leader Ed Miliband too praised the role of curry is the British life both on the high street and in homes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Britain&#8217;s curry sector has not just changed our taste buds,it has also enabled thousands to build businesses,learn new skills,train apprentices,create jobs,build community,and bring people from different cultures together,&#8221; his statement said.</p>
<p>The festival is now in its tenth year. Among the acclaimed team of chefs heading to India will be Michelin star British chef Dominic Chapman who has worked with world renowned names in the industry like Heston Blumenthal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138060&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s more,13 U.S. fertility centers out of 341 accounted for half of those excluded cycles,and they reported significantly better overall pregnancy rates than the average clinic.</p>
<p>Researchers said some cycles may disappear from the data when clinics take frozen embryos from multiple rounds of fertility treatments and only implant the one that looks best &#8211; either as a treatment strategy,or to make their success rate look better.</p>
<p>That may be done most often with older women or others who have a lower chance of conceiving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among this group of outlier clinics were very well known clinics,many of which are considered leaders in the field of ART in the United States,&#8221; said Dr. Vitaly Kushnir,who led the study at New York&#8217;s Center for Human Reproduction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly,their pregnancy rates are significantly better than those of other clinics in the whole country,and it seems that a large part of that is these clinics have been excluding poor prognosis patients from outcome reporting,&#8221; he told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably a combination of clinics that are doing this unconsciously and some that are doing it intentionally.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fertility clinics are required to report data on completed IVF cycles to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),and can choose to report initiated and completed cycles to SART,the researchers noted.</p>
<p>Because they were interested in comparing the number of started and finished cycles,Kushnir and his colleagues used SART data,which covered close to three-quarters of U.S. fertility centers in 2010 and 812,400 cycles during the whole study period.</p>
<p>They found the number of excluded cycles &#8211; those that had initiation but not final data &#8211; increased from about 3 percent in 2005 to more than 7 percent in 2010.</p>
<p>Among the 13 outlier centers,excluded cycles accounted for more than one-third of all those initiated.</p>
<p>Those clinics reported higher pregnancy rates than others &#8211; 59 percent for fresh embryo transfer in younger women,for example,compared to 48 percent in the rest of the SART database.</p>
<p>They also increased their market share during the study period,from 9 to 10 percent of all IVF cycles performed in the U.S.,according to findings published in Fertility and Sterility.</p>
<p>Kushnir said he and his colleagues decided not to release the names of those fertility centers,but that their findings were based on publicly available data.</p>
<p>Dr. James Goldfarb,a member of SART&#8217;s executive council,said the group is &#8220;well aware&#8221; there are flaws in the reporting process that could skew success rates,especially when it comes to freezing and selectively implanting embryos.</p>
<p>However,that doesn&#8217;t mean clinics with lots of excluded cycles are trying to game the system,he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;People do feel that there are some reasons for doing it this way,and that they are trying to benefit the patients,&#8221; Goldfarb,from University Hospitals Fertility Center in Beachwood,Ohio,told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>He and Kushnir agreed that the findings mean potential clients shouldn&#8217;t rely solely on reported success rates when they&#8217;re deciding where to have fertility treatment.</p>
<p>&#8220;These rates were never intended for comparison shopping,if you will,&#8221; Kushnir said.</p>
<p>Each cycle of IVF runs for about $15,000,and may or may not be covered by insurance.</p>
<p>Kushnir said in the future,the CDC &#8211; for whom he works as a consultant &#8211; could improve its reporting data by requiring clinics to disclose every initiated cycle and its outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;There needs to be better transparency and better accountability of what&#8217;s going on,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138040&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although some of these infections can be treated easily,others &#8211; like the superbug MRSA and other drug-resistant bugs &#8211; can be fatal or affect patients&#8217; health very seriously,taking several months of costly hospital care and medication to beat.</p>
<p>A survey by the European Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control (ECDC) found that on any given day,one in 18 patients in European hospitals has at least one hospital-acquired infection &#8211; amounting to around 3.2 million patients per year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Healthcare-associated infections pose a major public health problem and a threat to European patients,&#8221; said Marc Sprenger,director of the Stockholm-based ECDC.</p>
<p>He said many of these infections could be prevented by well thought-out,sustained and multi-pronged prevention and control programs and he urged hospitals to step up the fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such programs,as well as prudent use of antibiotics,will help all actors involved to protect the patients of European hospitals,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ECDC warned last year that doctors are increasingly having to turn to last-ditch antibiotics due to growing drug-resistant superbug infections in Europe &#8211; many of them acquired in hospitals.</p>
<p>The latest survey,which covered 1,000 hospitals in 30 European countries,found the highest rates of hospital-acquired infections were among patients admitted to intensive care units,where 19.5 percent of patients had at least one bug they had picked up from the hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;SUPERBUGS&#8221;</p>
<p>The most common types of infection are respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and infections of the bloodstream. These are often caused by Klebsiella pneumonia and E. coli bacteria,both of which have shown an ability to develop resistance to some of the most powerful antibiotics.</p>
<p>Among a total 15,000 reported healthcare-associated infections,surgical site infections and urinary tract infections are also common. Many of the infections are also found to be drug-resistant &#8220;superbugs&#8221;,the survey showed.</p>
<p>Among all infections with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria in which full testing was carried out,more than 40 percent were reported as resistant to methicillin &#8211; in other words they were MRSA infections,the ECDC said.</p>
<p>Worldwide,MRSA infects an estimated 53 million people annually and costs more than $20 billion a year to treat. It kills around 20,000 people a year in the United States and a similar number in Europe.</p>
<p>EU health and consumer affairs commissioner Paola Testori Coggi said the findings of the European survey were &#8220;worrying&#8221; and urged health authorities to do more to protect patients in hospital and to step up the fight against antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>Drug resistance is driven by the misuse and overuse of antibiotics,which encourages bacteria to develop new ways of overcoming them.</p>
<p>Experts say hospitals are often guilty of overusing antibiotics,giving them as &#8220;blanket&#8221; treatments before full testing has established which drugs are really needed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138033&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Overweight men ate about 200 fewer calories following a vigorous workout after rest.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138029&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some studies have shown that high intensity exercise is tied to appetite suppression and changes in hormones that regulate hunger and fullness,and the new research found different effects on those hormones among the various exercise regimens.</p>
<p>In the latest research,published in the International Journal of Obesity by Aaron Sim,a graduate student at the University of Western Australia,and his colleagues,17 overweight men volunteered to participate in four 30-minute exercise sessions: one in which they only rested and three involving stationary cycling at either moderate,high or very high intensity.</p>
<p>The moderate exercise involved continuous cycling,while the more intense workouts alternated between short bursts of speed and longer stretches of pedaling at a lower speed.</p>
<p>After each session the men drank a liquid meal of about 267 calories. Then,a little over an hour later,the researchers offered the participants oatmeal and told them to eat until they were &#8220;comfortably full.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men ate fewer calories after the high and very high intensity workouts compared to the times when they rested.</p>
<p>They also ate less after the very high intensity workout than after the moderate exercise,while the difference between the high intensity workout and the moderate workout was small enough that it could have occurred by chance.</p>
<p>After the sessions,the men ate 764 calories after resting,710 calories after the moderate exercise,621 calories after the high intensity workout and 594 calories after the very high intensity workout.</p>
<p>The men also reported eating fewer calories on the day following the highest intensity workout than they did on the days following the other exercise sessions.</p>
<p>They ate 2,000 calories during the day following the very high intensity workout,while they ate a little more than 2,300 calories during the day after the moderate exercise and more than 2,600 during the day following the resting session.</p>
<p>SURPRISING BUT PRELIMINARY</p>
<p>While the study shows promising cuts in calorie intake in the short-term,it&#8217;s unclear whether high intensity exercise can affect longer term weight loss.</p>
<p>David Stensel,a researcher at Loughborough University in the UK who has studied exercise&#8217;s effect on food intake,cautioned that this was a small study that needs to be repeated before any conclusions can be drawn.</p>
<p>Other studies,including Stensel&#8217;s,have not shown a difference in how much people eat following a period of exercise or of rest,he said.</p>
<p>Stensel said the findings were somewhat surprising,because his own research has not shown that people&#8217;s food intake is reduced following exercise.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing that&#8217;s different is they&#8217;ve done this in an overweight or obese population. Most of the research that&#8217;s been done is in normal weight or healthy weight individuals,&#8221; Stensel told Reuters Health.</p>
<p>&#8220;This study provides some promising preliminary support for this notion,but further research is needed to investigate this in a longer-term study,&#8221; Sim said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138029&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smokers are unlikely to extend their lifespan if they choose to smoke fewer cigarettes instead of kicking the habit altogether,researchers have found.</p>
<p>The conclusion was reached by researchers at the Universities of Glasgow and Stirling who examined data from more than 5,200 men and women living in the central belt of Scotland who were smoking when first recruited to two studies in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>All of the participants were re-contacted a few years later and asked again about their smoking.</p>
<p>Some had stopped altogether,some had reduced the number of cigarettes they smoked,while others had maintained or increased the level of their smoking.</p>
<p>All deaths were logged between the second screening and 2010,enabling the researchers to see whether there was any difference in the mortality rates between the quitters,reducers and maintainers.</p>
<p>The researchers found that,compared to maintainers,the quitters had lower mortality rates,but there was no significant difference between the reducers and the maintainers.</p>
<p>In one of the two studies,a sub-group of the reducers who had been among the heaviest smokers at the start did show lower mortality rates but this was not seen in the other study.</p>
<p>The Scottish findings,published in the American Journal of Epidemiology,do not support those of a similar long-term study in Israel where smoking reduction did appear to reduce mortality rates,but are consistent with larger studies of shorter duration in Denmark and Norway where it did not.</p>
<p>Professor Linda Bauld from Stirling University,one of the paper&#8217;s authors said,&#8221;Our results support the view that reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke is not a reliable way of improving your health in the long term. However,what we do now know is that it may have a valuable role as a step toward giving up altogether  through cutting down to quit,an approach that has been recommended in recent guidance in the UK&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137707&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parents taking part in interactive and arts-related activities with their toddlers could boost their kids&#8217; happiness and everyday skills,a new study has found. Researchers at Oxford University and The Open University found that child happiness,as reported by their parents,was linked to how frequently the children were engaged in activities such as reading,storytelling,shopping,painting and doing arts and crafts.</p>
<p>In contrast,passive activities like looking at picture books or watching television brought no discernible benefits. Watching television appeared,in this analysis,to have a negative impact on child happiness that was statistically significant. The results also suggested that more active activities may boost the development of a child&#8217;s motor and social skills.</p>
<p>For example,painting or engaging in arts and crafts could promote the development of movement skills,while reading,telling stories and singing had a significant impact on both talking ability and social skills. More passive activities did not appear to contribute to the development of these skills. The researchers applied economic models to data drawn from the German Household Survey in the years 2007 to 2010. </p>
<p>The data included responses from over 800 German parents about the happiness and wellbeing of their two and three-year-olds,the activities they took part in and their development of talking,movement,and social skills. &#8220;We applied standard economic tools to analyse children&#8217;s wellbeing and development at a very early age. </p>
<p>An economic study of very young children is relatively novel,but if our findings are replicated in other research,they could have significant implications for parenting education,&#8221; Professor Paul Anand of The Open University said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It should allow us to reassess the role of arts in the development of skills and human potential,&#8221; Anand said. &#8220;Our results suggest that parents may face difficult trade-offs with regard to time spent actively engaging with their children,versus providing for them materially via the labour market,&#8221; said Dr Laurence Roope of the Health Economics Research Centre at Oxford University.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course parents can&#8217;t engage their young children in these activities every hour of the day,but it is encouraging that time spent reading books to them,painting or joining in with a nursery rhyme could help their development. &#8220;It will be interesting to see whether similar results emerge for slightly older children and using other datasets,&#8221; Roope said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137634&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reading books,writing and participating in brain-stimulating activities may help preserve your memory into old age,a new study has found.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our study suggests that exercising your brain by taking part in activities such as these across a person&#8217;s lifetime,from childhood through old age,is important for brain health in old age,&#8221; said study author Robert S Wilson,with Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.</p>
<p>For the study,294 people were given tests that measured memory and thinking every year for about six years before their deaths at an average age of 89.</p>
<p>They also answered a questionnaire about whether they read books,wrote and participated in other mentally stimulating activities during childhood,adolescence,middle age and at their current age. After they died,their brains were examined at autopsy for evidence of the physical signs of dementia,such as lesions,brain plaques and tangles.</p>
<p>The research found that people who participated in mentally stimulating activities both early and late in life had a slower rate of decline in memory compared to those who did not participate in such activities across their lifetime,after adjusting for differing levels of plaques and tangles in the brain.</p>
<p>Mental activity accounted for nearly 15 per cent of the difference in decline beyond what is explained by plaques and tangles in the brain. &#8220;Based on this,we shouldn&#8217;t underestimate the effects of everyday activities,such as reading and writing,on our children,ourselves and our parents or grandparents,&#8221; said Wilson.</p>
<p>The study found that the rate of decline was reduced by 32 per cent in people with frequent mental activity in late life,compared to people with average mental activity,while the rate of decline of those with infrequent activity was 48 per cent faster than those with average activity. The study was published in Neurology,the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137611&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exercise reorganises the brain so that its response to stress is reduced and it is less likely to interfere with normal brain function,scientists claim. Researchers led by Princeton University found that when mice allowed to exercise regularly experienced a stressor exposure to cold water their brains exhibited a spike in the activity of neurons that shut off excitement in the ventral hippocampus,a brain region shown to regulate anxiety.</p>
<p>These findings potentially resolve a discrepancy in research related to the effect of exercise on the brain namely that exercise reduces anxiety while also promoting the growth of new neurons in the ventral hippocampus. Because these young neurons are typically more excitable than their more mature counterparts,exercise should result in more anxiety,not less.</p>
<p>The researchers,however,found that exercise also strengthens the mechanisms that prevent these brain cells from firing. The impact of physical activity on the ventral hippocampus specifically has not been deeply explored,said senior author Elizabeth Gould,Princeton&#8217;s Dorman T Warren Professor of Psychology.</p>
<p>By doing so,members of Gould&#8217;s laboratory pinpointed brain cells and regions important to anxiety regulation that may help scientists better understand and treat human anxiety disorders,she said. From an evolutionary standpoint,the research also shows that the brain can be extremely adaptive and tailor its own processes to an organism&#8217;s lifestyle or surroundings,Gould said.</p>
<p>A higher likelihood of anxious behaviour may have an adaptive advantage for less physically fit creatures. Anxiety often manifests itself in avoidant behaviour and avoiding potentially dangerous situations would increase the likelihood of survival,particularly for those less capable of responding with a &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; reaction,she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding how the brain regulates anxious behaviour gives us potential clues about helping people with anxiety disorders. It also tells us something about how the brain modifies itself to respond optimally to its own environment,&#8221; said Gould. The study was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137600&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Exercise reorganises the brain so that its response to stress is reduced and it is less likely to interfere with normal brain function,scientists claim. Researchers led by Princeton University found that when mice allowed to exercise regularly experienced a stressor exposure to cold water their brains exhibited a spike in the activity of neurons that shut off excitement in the ventral hippocampus,a brain region shown to regulate anxiety.</p>
<p>These findings potentially resolve a discrepancy in research related to the effect of exercise on the brain namely that exercise reduces anxiety while also promoting the growth of new neurons in the ventral hippocampus. Because these young neurons are typically more excitable than their more mature counterparts,exercise should result in more anxiety,not less.</p>
<p>The researchers,however,found that exercise also strengthens the mechanisms that prevent these brain cells from firing. The impact of physical activity on the ventral hippocampus specifically has not been deeply explored,said senior author Elizabeth Gould,Princeton&#8217;s Dorman T Warren Professor of Psychology.</p>
<p>By doing so,members of Gould&#8217;s laboratory pinpointed brain cells and regions important to anxiety regulation that may help scientists better understand and treat human anxiety disorders,she said. From an evolutionary standpoint,the research also shows that the brain can be extremely adaptive and tailor its own processes to an organism&#8217;s lifestyle or surroundings,Gould said.</p>
<p>A higher likelihood of anxious behaviour may have an adaptive advantage for less physically fit creatures. Anxiety often manifests itself in avoidant behaviour and avoiding potentially dangerous situations would increase the likelihood of survival,particularly for those less capable of responding with a &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; reaction,she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understanding how the brain regulates anxious behaviour gives us potential clues about helping people with anxiety disorders. It also tells us something about how the brain modifies itself to respond optimally to its own environment,&#8221; said Gould. The study was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137599&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drinking a pint of beer a day improves the condition of blood vessels around the heart,boosts blood flow and makes the arteries more flexible,a new study has claimed. Greek scientists found that arteries became more flexible and blood flow improved within a couple of hours of drinking the equivalent of two-thirds of a pint.</p>
<p>However,they found that alcohol-free beer did not have the same effect,&#8217;The Sun&#8217; reported. The findings support previous evidence that moderate beer consumption may protect against heart disease. Previous research has suggested a pint a day reduces the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 30 per cent.</p>
<p>In the new study,scientists at Harokopio University in Athens recruited 17 non-smoking men in their late twenties and early thirties. Each one had their cardiovascular health measured within an hour or two of drinking 400 milliliters of beer &#8211; equivalent to just over two-thirds of a pint. </p>
<p>They later had the same tests done after the same amount of alcohol-free beer or a measure of vodka. Researchers tested for endothelial function a measure of how easily blood passes through major arteries as well as aortic stiffness,a check designed to assess whether blood vessels are nice and relaxed or beginning to harden. </p>
<p>The results showed all three had some beneficial effect on the stiffness of arteries but beer had the most benefits. Researchers said the combination of alcohol and antioxidants in beer may be crucial to the drink&#8217;s healthy effects. Darker beers,like stouts and ales,have been shown to be better for the heart than lager. The study was published in the journal Nutrition. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137595&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists in Japan today said they had grown human liver tissue from stem cells in a first that holds promise for alleviating the critical shortage of donor organs. Creating lab-grown tissue to replenish organs damaged by accident or disease is a Holy Grail for the pioneering field of research into the premature cells known as stem cells.</p>
<p>Now Takanori Takebe of the Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine and team report in the journal Nature that they grew tissue &#8220;resembling the (human) adult liver&#8221; in a lab mouse. &#8220;To our knowledge,this is the first report demonstrating the generation of a functional human organ from pluripotent stem (iPS) cells,&#8221; said the report.</p>
<p>The technique has yet to be tested in humans,but serves as an important proof of concept,it added. Stem cells are infant cells that can develop into any part of the body. Until a few years ago,when iPS cells were created,the only way to obtain stem cells was to harvest them from human embryos. This is controversial because it requires the destruction of the embryo,a process to which religious conservatives and others object.</p>
<p>iPS cells are easily-obtainable mature cells that are &#8220;reprogrammed&#8221; into a versatile,primitive state from where they can develop into any kind of cell in the body. According to Takebe,the liver developed blood vessels which fused with those of the animal. It also performed certain human-specific liver functions ¿ producing proteins and processing certain drugs. &#8220;We have concluded that this liver is functioning,&#8221; the scientist said. </p>
<p>&#8220;We think this is enough for improving survival after liver failure.&#8221; Scientists commenting on the research described it as promising. &#8220;This science opens up the distinct possibility of being able to create mini-livers from the skin cells of a patient dying of liver failure,&#8221; said Malcolm Alison,professor of stem cell biology at the Queen Mary University of London. Takebe said the method may also work in organs like the pancreas,kidneys or lungs,but it would be another 10 years before trials are done in humans. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137534&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If a child complains of recurrent pain in abdomen,diarrhoea,chronic anaemia and growth retardation,then there are chances that the child is suffering from gluten sensitivity,a disease,according to doctors,common in north India.</p>
<p>Gluten is a protein composite found in wheat,rye and barley. Gluten sensitivity is also popularly known as wheat allergy or celiac disease. It is common in northern India,as wheat is one of the main crops grown here. </p>
<p>In this,a persons body becomes intolerant to the gluten. Patients normally suffer damage to the lining epithelium of the small intestines,resulting in malabsorption of nutrients.</p>
<p>It is a kind of gastrointestinal allergy (GI),which is because of the patients sensitivity to gluten. On an average,a doctor treats seven to eight wheat allergic patients. The number has increased in the last few years, said Dr Meenu Singh of paediatrics department,PGIMER. </p>
<p>She added,Usually,a child starts showing the symptoms of Gluten sensitivity from the day he/she is given gluten-based food like wheat,barley and rye. The symptoms of the disease vary from person to person,which is one of the reasons of it being difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>A lot of doctors are also unaware of this problem. Parents usually come to us when their child is 6-10 years old. By this time,a lot of damage has already been done, the doctor added. </p>
<p>The main symptoms are diarrhoea,pain in abdomen,anaemia,short stature,constipation and retarded growth. </p>
<p>Dr Arpinder Singh,incharge of Paediatrics department,Max hospital,said,In severe cases,the symptoms can be rashes,difficulty in breathing,swollen mouth and throat,chronic fatigue,difficulty in concentrating and failure to thrive.</p>
<p>He added,Gluten insensitivity can be diagnosed by blood tests,endoscopy and biopsy. If diagnosed,the only treatment is a gluten-free diet. People are advised to avoid wheat,rye and barley products,especially biscuits and cakes. Positive results are seen as soon as people stop taking gluten.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137474&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Curcumin,a substance in turmeric,may provide lasting protection against potentially deadly lung damage in premature infants,a new study led by an Indian-origin scientist has claimed.</p>
<p>Turmeric,a key ingredient in spicy curry dishes,has long been known to have medicinal values. Premature infants often need the assistance of ventilators and forced oxygen therapy because they&#8217;re frequently born with inadequate lung function. These therapies can cause the infants to suffer lasting lung damage and even death.</p>
<p>Researchers at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center (LA BioMed),using disease models,found curcumin provided long-term protection against this damage.</p>
<p>The study,published in the American Journal of Physiology,Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology,found curcumin provided protection against bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BDP),a condition characterised by scarring and inflammation,and against hyperoxia,in which too much oxygen enters the body through the lungs,for up to 21 days after birth.</p>
<p>A previous LA BioMed study had found curcumin provided protection for up to seven days after birth. &#8220;This is the first study to find long-term benefits of using curcumin to protect lung function in premature infants,&#8221; said Virender K Rehan,the LA BioMed lead researcher who authored the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curcumin is known to have potent antioxidant,anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties,making it a promising therapy for premature infants who require oxygen therapy after birth,&#8221; Rehan said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137102&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The faded beauty of a crumbling theater,whose curtain opened to reveal an ultra-modern skyline,was the backdrop to Chanel&#8217;s haute couture show on Tuesday which designer Karl Lagerfeld described as a mix of &#8220;tradition with the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Models walking across the stage and into the audience seated in old wooden theatre chairs showed off a glittery collection that played with proportions. Marked by doubled short skirts and wide low-slung belts,Lagerfeld also added long columned dresses in grays,silvers and blacks and a high dose of gunmetal blue. luxurious sparkling tweeds and embroidered fabrics for Autumn/Winter 2013-2014 provided a theatrical contrast to the set,which elicited gasps from the audience of fashion regulars,including singer Rihanna,draped in strings of pearls over a floor-length cream cardigan.</p>
<p>The abandoned,derelict theatre created by Lagerfeld &#8211; known for his extravagant sets built under the soaring iron and glass atrium of the sumptuous Grand Palais &#8211; was complete with peeling paint,overturned benches and blocks of collapsed concrete,imparting a decaying beauty to the high-fashion catwalk.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the contrast between the old world and the new,&#8221; Lagerfeld told reporters after the show. &#8220;Fashion is the only thing that can travel between both.&#8221;</p>
<p>Model and actress Milla Jovovich said she had never seen a fashion show set &#8220;deconstructed&#8221; in this way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Walking in I made a joke and said &#8216;Karl really forgot to do the place up. It&#8217;s a bit of a mess. It&#8217;s a hot mess.&#8217;&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Chanel is perhaps the most heavily marketed label in France&#8217;s pool of fashion brands,with fiercely loyal clientele across the globe. Haute couture,in which garments are meticulously hand sewn by highly skilled artisans,is the creme de la creme of the $275 billion global luxury industry.</p>
<p>Lagerfeld presented a series of short,slightly A-line skirts worn over another skirt underneath.</p>
<p>&#8220;One goes in this direction and one goes in that direction. You have one dress for the price of three,&#8221; quipped Lagerfeld.</p>
<p>Bold constructed shoulders found their way into boleros and Mod-influenced cropped jackets with standing collars and tight sleeves cut above the wrist.</p>
<p>Most dresses and suits incorporated a wide black belt that anchored the multiple layers and lengths.</p>
<p>&#8220;The belt is not a low,hippy belt from the &#8217;60s. It&#8217;s a very refined belt,&#8221; said the German designer,who wore a diamond and emerald pin in the shape of a jungle cat on his tie.</p>
<p>Surrounded by a phalanx of well-wishers onstage after the show,Lagerfeld chatted gamely in front of the massive projected image of a futuristic city.</p>
<p>Asked by a journalist if the idea behind the show recalled a &#8220;Fritz Lang moment&#8221;,referring to the 20th century Austrian film director dubbed the &#8220;Master of Darkness,&#8221; Lagerfeld lost no time with a deadpan response.</p>
<p>&#8220;My whole life is a Fritz Lang moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also futuristic were the sinewy gowns at Stephane Rolland,whose dramatic pieces are popular with Middle Eastern women.</p>
<p>The French designer,who opened his first ready-to-wear boutique in Abu Dhabi in May,used his favorite motifs of exposed backs and flamboyant embellishments for a collection inspired by the somber mood of Spanish painter Diego Velasquez.</p>
<p>Elaborate starched white collars folded like origami,exaggerated sleeves and shiny,sculptural decoration marked the exclusively black,white and navy collection.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137085&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) are at a 30 per cent higher risk of developing brain tumours,a new study has claimed. The risk increases the longer a woman is on the treatment and those who used HRT for ten years or more had a 70 per cent chance of getting a tumour,according to researchers from The Danish Cancer Research Centre. HRT medications contain female hormones to replace the ones the body no longer makes after menopause. It is used by women to treat menopausal symptoms and protect long-term health.</p>
<p>Researchers said the findings may explain why meningioma &#8211; the most common brain tumour &#8211; is found more frequently in women,&#8217;The Sun&#8217; reported. It may also explain why cases of the tumour have risen in recent years. &#8220;Long-term HRT use,particularly of combined oestrogen-progestogen,may increase the risk of meningioma,&#8221; the researchers said. Women with meningioma also have a higher risk of breast cancer. </p>
<p>About 85 per cent of meningiomas are benign but the tumours still cause symptoms including headaches,seizures,loss of balance and hearing loss. &#8220;HRT has risks,so women should try to use the lowest dose for as short as possible,&#8221; Dr Sarah Hazell,of Cancer Research UK,said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1136729&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human head transplants may now be possible using the latest advances in cell engineering,an Italian scientist has claimed.</p>
<p>The research on the complicated surgery could see results in just two years,said Dr Sergio Canavero,of the Turin Advanced Neuromodulation Group in Italy.</p>
<p>In a project proposal published in the medical journal Surgical Neurology International,Canavero described his method for the &#8216;Head Anastomosis Venture&#8217; &#8211; or HEAVEN.</p>
<p>The project would involve severing the heads of two human patients simultaneously using an &#8216;ultra-sharp blade&#8217;,cooling and flushing out the &#8216;recipient&#8217; head before attaching its new body with an advanced polymer &#8216;glue&#8217;,'The Independent&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>Canavero suggested that the realigning of head and body could also be achieved using &#8216;electrofusion&#8217;,in an approach not entirely unlike that used in Mary Shelley&#8217;s 18th Century novel &#8216;Frankenstein&#8217;.</p>
<p>The scientist has based his project on a similar experiment on Rhesus monkeys in the 1970s in which the patient survived for eight days.</p>
<p>In laying out what he said is &#8220;the groundwork for the first successful human head transplant&#8221;,Canavero admitted that his polymer gel reattachment method (known as GEMINI) would not be perfect.</p>
<p>However,he noted that &#8220;as little as 10 per cent of descending spinal tracts are sufficient for some voluntary control of locomotion in man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canavero said that full and open research on the topic could bear fruit in just two years,and that the first patient should be someone young,with a fully-functioning brain,but suffering from &#8220;progressive muscular dystrophies or even several genetic and metabolic disorders&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;HEAVEN appears to have grown into a feasible enterprise early in the 21st century,&#8221; he said but added that he has not considered the ethical implications of his proposal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1136702&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People who drink four cups of tea or coffee a day have lower blood pressure than those who drink none,a new 10-year study has found. French scientists in the long-term study found heavy tea drinkers had lower blood pressure,pulse pressure and heart rate than lighter drinkers.</p>
<p>The research analysed 176,437 men and women aged between 16 to 95 years. The participants answered how much coffee or tea they drank per day in a questionnaire. Based on the consumption of these beverages,individuals were classified into three groups: those who drank no coffee/tea,those who drank one to four cups,and those who drank more than four cups.</p>
<p>Researchers found that heavy coffee drinkers were found to have slightly higher blood pressure than normal but non-drinkers had the highest readings,the &#8216;Daily Express&#8217; reported. Study author Bruno Pannier,from the Preventive and Clinical Investigations Centre in Paris,said it was possible that the flavonoids in tea had a relaxing effect on blood vessels.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vasorelaxing compounds included in these beverages might be involved in these results,something that has been suggested by the experimental data,&#8221; he said. The study was presented to the European Society of Hypertension in Milan. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1136639&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed unique &#8216;talking&#8217; cigarette packets with recorded messages that encourage people to quit smoking. Researchers from Stirling University&#8217;s Center for Tobacco Control Research in the UK created two talking cigarette packets with different messages.</p>
<p>One packet offered smokers a phone number for advice on quitting smoking and another warned that smoking reduces fertility,&#8217;The Mirror&#8217; reported. The technology behind the recorded messages is similar to the one used in singing birthday cards where a message plays when the lid is opened.</p>
<p>The packs are fitted with a voice recording and playback unit so that the message will be replayed whenever the packet is opened. The researchers were inspired by tobacco companies who have been making packaging more attractive for consumers They wanted to find out if similar tactics could work against the companies and encourage people to give up the habit,rather than keep buying.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible in the future we may see packs that play music or talk,so we wanted to see if that could be used for our purposes,&#8221; Crawford Moodie,one of the researchers,said. The devices have been tested on young women,between the ages of 16 and 24,as this remains one of the groups with high smoking rates in the UK.</p>
<p>Volunteers said that they found the messages about fertility &#8220;hard-hitting&#8221; and &#8220;off-putting&#8221;. Girls aged 16-17 in particular said that it would make them think about quitting. However,other volunteers said that the messages could lead them to quitting or cutting back simply because they were so annoying. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1136172&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have found that a protein shown to function in the liver has a key role in human menstrual cycle and may also play a crucial role in pregnancy.</p>
<p>According to researchers at the University of Montreal in Canada,mice that were genetically engineered not to produce the liver receptor homolog-1 (Lrh-1) molecule were unable to create the uterine conditions necessary for establishing and sustaining pregnancy,resulting in the formation of defective placentas. The researchers then showed that Lhr-1 was present in the human uterus and the essential processes related to the success of early gestation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We previously showed that Lrh-1 is essential for ovulation. Our newest studies have revealed that it plays an important role in the uterus,raising the possibility that Lrh-1 deficiency contributes to human gestational failure,&#8221; said lead author Bruce Murphy,of the university&#8217;s Animal Reproduction Research Centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;We worked with mice before looking at human tissues. I believe it premature to propose determination of Lrh-1 in uterine biopsies as a diagnostic tool,but we are working on determining the receptor&#8217;s pattern of expression across the menstrual cycle,&#8221; Murphy said. The researchers also looked at whether hormone replacement therapy might restore normal uterine functions in the mice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Progesterone did not make a difference. Although hormone therapy allowed for the embryos to implant,we saw problems with the lining in the uterus,compromised formation of the placenta,foetal growth retardation and foetal death,&#8221; Murphy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;However,there are new Lrh-1 agonists and antagonists,currently in clinical trials to treat hepatic consequences of type II diabetes,and thus therapeutic intervention might be possible,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1136154&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anti-smoking measures including higher taxes on tobacco products,bans on adverts and controls on lighting up in public places could prevent tens of millions of premature deaths across the world,researchers said on Monday.</p>
<p>Similar steps taken by Turkey,Romania and 39 other countries between 2007 and 2010 were already saving lives,the independent study published by the World Health Organization (WHO) said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the progress attained by these &#8230; countries were extended globally,tens of millions of smoking-related deaths could be averted,&#8221; Professor David Levy,the study&#8217;s lead author from Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington,said in the WHO&#8217;s monthly bulletin.</p>
<p>Wider use of the controls could also lead to lower health care costs and higher birth weights for babies,he added.</p>
<p>Tobacco-control measures already introduced in the 41 countries,that also included Pakistan,Argentina and Italy,were on track to persuade an estimated 15 million people not to smoke,the study said. That would prevent around 7.4 million smoking-related deaths by 2050,it added.</p>
<p>The researchers found the most effective measures were increasing taxes and banning smoking in offices,restaurants and other public places. The first method would prevent 3.5 million smoking-attributable deaths,while the second would prevent 2.5 million,they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything it is an under-estimate,&#8221; Dr. Douglas Bettcher,director of WHO&#8217;s department of noncommunicable diseases,told Reuters in an interview in his Geneva office.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a win-win situation for health and finance ministries to generate revenues that have a major impact on improving health and productivity,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Turkey&#8217;s steps led to a sharp drop in smoking rates to 41.5 percent among men in 2012 from 47.9 percent in 2008,he said.</p>
<p>Six million people die every year from smoking and the toll is projected to rise to eight million by 2030,according to the WHO,a United Nations agency waging war on &#8220;Big Tobacco&#8221;.</p>
<p>The WHO&#8217;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control,which came into force in 2005,lays down measures to curb smoking and tobacco use. About 175 countries have ratified the pact,shunned by others that are home to large tobacco companies,including the United States,Switzerland and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Measures include raising taxes on tobacco products to 75 percent of the final retail price,smoke-free air policies,warnings on cigarette packages,bans on advertising,promotion and sponsorship,and offering treatments to kick the habit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that in many poor countries,the poor spend a lot of money on tobacco. They would be able to use it for nutrition and education which is a huge opportunity cost,&#8221; said Dr. Edouard Tursan d&#8217;Espaignet,from WHO&#8217;s Tobacco Free Initiative.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1136113&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bed rest immediately after an in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure,despite being common practice,did not help women ultimately have a baby in a new study.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old wives&#8217; tale of bed rest should be debunked once and for all,that you don&#8217;t need bed rest in any way,shape or form,&#8221; said Dr. Jani Jensen,a fertility expert at the Mayo Clinic,who was not part of the study.</p>
<p>The researchers found that women who continued to lie down for 10 minutes after embryos were transferred to their uterus were actually less likely to have a baby than women who got up and walked around right away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It demonstrates that there is no need to keep patients at bed rest after a transfer. They can immediately get up and leave,&#8221; said Dr. Richard Reindollar,the chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth.</p>
<p>IVF involves inserting fertilized embryos into a woman&#8217;s uterus using a thin catheter.</p>
<p>Women lie down and prop their feet in footrests,and the procedure takes about five to 10 minutes,said Jensen.</p>
<p>Following the procedure,women are sometimes wheeled on a gurney to a recovery room,where they rest for several minutes up to several hours. Other times,women are asked to stand and walk out of the room on their own.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past there were a number of people who felt strongly that patients have bed rest. Some had patients go to bed for five days,&#8221; said Reindollar,who did not participate in the study.</p>
<p>Some previous research has suggested that bed rest actually does no good,and could harm women&#8217;s chances for getting pregnant.</p>
<p>In the latest study,researchers in Spain,led by Dr. José Remohi at the Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad,Valencia,and the Universidad de Valencia,randomly assigned patients to bed rest or to get up immediately following the procedure.</p>
<p>Half of the women in the study,120 of them,stayed on the bed for 10 minutes after the embryos were transferred,while the other 120 women got up and walked out of the room.</p>
<p>Fifty women in the bed rest group went on to have babies,while 68 women in the other group delivered a baby.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not clear why,&#8221; said Jensen.</p>
<p>The pregnancy rates were similar in both groups,but miscarriage rates in the bed rest group were 27.5 percent compared to 18 percent in the other group. Statistically,though,that difference could have been due to chance,the researchers noted.</p>
<p>The authors point out that when a woman is standing,her uterus is in a horizontal position and speculate that may be better for successful embryo transfer.</p>
<p>They also propose that stress reduction from walking around after the procedure might play a role in the differing birth rates.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that encouraging patients to follow their daily routine immediately after (embryo transfer) may help them to cope with anxiety during treatment and thereafter to increase their skills in maintaining relaxation throughout the treatment,and this may be one possible reason behind our obtained results,&#8221; they write in the journal Fertility and Sterility.</p>
<p>Jensen agreed that stress reduction is important for would-be mothers.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think that the intervention is too small to say that the 10 minutes of bed rest was detrimental,&#8221; said Jensen. &#8220;The better message is probably that you really don&#8217;t need any bed rest at all to still have good outcomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reindollar,who is also the president-elect of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine,said the study is important in developing a cache of evidence about the benefits and harms of bed rest</p>
<p>He said that with enough data the Society might consider issuing practice guidelines that recommend physicians discourage bed rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;This paper showed that it certainly does not hurt patients to get up and walk away,and it suggests that it might hurt to keep them there,&#8221; Reindollar told Reuters Health.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1136103&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Software for processing satellite pictures taken from space may help medical researchers to establish a simple method for wide-scale screening for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Used in analysing magnetic resonance images (MRIs),the AlzTools 3D Slicer tool was produced by scientists at Spain&#8217;s Elecnor Deimos.</p>
<p>The researchers drew on years of experience developing software for European Space Agency&#8217;s Envisat satellite to create a programme that adapted the space routines to analyse human brain scans. Working for ESA,the team gained experience in processing raw satellite image data by using sophisticated software routines,then homing in on and identifying specific elements.Looking at and analysing satellite images can be compared to what medical doctors have to do to understand scans like MRIs,&#8221; said Carlos Fernandez de la Pena of Deimos.</p>
<p>&#8220;They also need to identify features indicating malfunctions according to specific characteristics,&#8221; he said.The tool is now used for Alzheimer&#8217;s research at the Medicine Faculty at the University of Castilla La Mancha in Albacete in Spain. &#8220;We work closely with Spanish industry and also with Elecnor Deimos though ProEspacio,the Spanish Association of Space Sector Companies,to support the spin-off of space technologies like this one,&#8221; said Richard Seddon from Tecnalia,the technology broker for Spain for ESA&#8217;s Technology Transfer Programme.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if being developed for specific applications,we often see that space technologies turn out to provide innovative and intelligent solutions to problems in non-space sectors,such as this one.&#8221;It is incredible to see that the experience and technologies gained from analysing satellite images can help doctors to understand Alzheimer&#8217;s disease,&#8221; Seddon said. Using AlzTools,Deimos scientists work with raw data from a brain scan rather than satellite images. Instead of a field or a road in a satellite image,they look at brain areas like the hippocampus,where atrophy is associated with Alzheimer&#8217;s.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1135510&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Living in damp or mouldy houses is associated with asthma,allergies,hay fever and eczema in children,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>The largest-ever worldwide study of the link between damp homes and respiratory and allergic conditions,involved 46,000 children in 20 countries and provided extensive evidence that living in damp or mouldy homes is tied to asthma.</p>
<p>Levels of house dust mites were also higher in damp homes and children were more likely to become allergic to house dust mites in damp homes,but the increased levels of house dust mites were not associated with wheezing.</p>
<p>Instead,it is dampness itself that appears to be the problem,said researchers from University of Otago,Wellington (UOW),who were involved in the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;The associations were found regardless of how affluent the countries were,and were not associated with allergy itself,suggesting that these effects are not as a result of allergy to moulds or house dust mites,&#8221; UOW researcher Professor Julian Crane said.</p>
<p>Furthermore,if a child already has asthma it is made more severe by dampness and mould in the home,he said.</p>
<p><i>The study was published in the journal Clinical and Experimental Allergy.</i></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1135190&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When actress Tara Deshpande Tennebaum conceived the idea of a cookbook,she first tried to contemporise a tattered manuscript of her great-grandmother&#8217;s recipes but finally ended up with a delightful tale of food and family across three generations and a study of Konkani cuisine and culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Sense for Spice&#8221; takes the reader from the washed plains of the Konkan coast to fishing villages in Karwar to mango plantations in Ratnagiri and chilli gardens in Goa to metropolitan Mumbai. &#8220;It was on a bench in Boston Common that the idea for &#8216;A Sense for Spice&#8217; was conceived. Armed with crumbs for my squirrel friends and a coffee for myself,I attempted initially only to translate and contemporise a precious,tattered manuscript of my great-grandmother&#8217;s recipes,from Marathi to English.</p>
<p>&#8220;But of the many literary projects I began in recent years,this one has changed the most. It grew indulgently into the story of a childhood in family kitchens and then into a study of Konkani cuisine and culture. I embarked upon a journey of discovery that led me through the monsoon-washed plains of the Konkan coast,fishing villages in Karwar,mango plantations in Ratnagiri and chilli gardens in Goa,&#8221; Tara,who lives in Mumbai and New York and is working on her first novel,says.</p>
<p>The book,published by Westland,is at once an introduction to Konkan cuisine and a fast-paced story of a family with a passion for good food and good times. As India modernizes furiously,the author captures the fading way of life of the idiosyncratic Konkan diaspora,a complex of uniquely tolerant cultures with quirky and mysterious histories. The community and its food are brought to life through both her grandmothers&#8217; meticulously recorded recipes,some dating back to the 1800s,all adapted to suit modern kitchens.</p>
<p>&#8220;A Sense for Spice&#8221; is Tara&#8217;s second book after &#8220;Fifty and Done&#8221;,a collection of short stories and verse. She has acted in movies like &#8220;Iss Raat Ki Subah Nahin&#8221;,&#8221;Bombay Boys&#8221; and &#8220;Style&#8221;.  Besides the recipes,Tara goes on to describe the culinary habits and customs of various tribes of Konkan region: Gambit,Tuleris,Warli,Kulchas and many sub-communities: Karwaris,Kannadiga,Maratha,Koli,Malwani,Kayastha,Chitrapur and Rajpur Saraswat,Tulvas and her community,Goud Saraswat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Konkani Jewish families,also known as Bene Israelis,have their own mix of Jewish Konkani practices. Their version of &#8216;pohe&#8217;,a staple Konkani dish,is called &#8216;mailda&#8217; and is served on religious occasions. Like local Hindus,they too use coconut milk but as a substitute for dairy products since Kashrut dietary laws don&#8217;t permit the mixing of meat and milk,&#8221; she writes.</p>
<p>On the culinary habit of Goud Saraswats,she writes,&#8221;The diet of Saraswats is unusual on account of their origin and migrations. They are among the few fish-eating vegetarian Brahmins in the country&#8230; &#8220;One theory explains that it was acceptable to introduce fish to an otherwise meatless diet because Kshatriyas,on account of their military duties are permitted flesh. The Saraswats,who had these responsibilities thrust upon them by Parshurama,were allowed to eat seafood.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Konkani cooking,Tara says,great importance is given to sensory satisfaction. &#8220;There is a complex combination of sweet,spicy,salty,bitter and sour. Soft is paired with hard,smoky with sweet and deep-fried with raw&#8230; A traditional Konkan meal is well-balanced with stir-fried vegetables,starches,protein-rich lentils and a raw salad.&#8221; Konkan cuisine is distinguished from Marathi cuisine,largely by its seafood,she writes.</p>
<p>Fish &#8216;kadis&#8217; made with coconut milk and a ground paste of coriander and dried red chillies,pan-fried fish fillets and shrimp rolled in semolina or rice flour,stuffed crabs,dry coconuts clams and deep-fried mussels think old-fashioned New England fare with lots of spice and coconut!&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1134591&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our perception of how food tastes is influenced by the size,shape and colour of the cutlery we use,a new Oxford research suggests.</p>
<p>Food tastes saltier when eaten from a knife,and denser and more expensive from a light plastic spoon. Taste was also affected by the colour of the cutlery,researchers said.</p>
<p>The crockery we use has been shown to alter our perception of food and drink. Beverages in cold coloured glasses were rated more refreshing and the weight and colour of a plate can alter how dense,salty or sweet food tastes,they said.</p>
<p>Researchers from the University of Oxford demonstrated that cutlery can also have an impact on how we experience food.</p>
<p>They found that when the weight of the cutlery confirms expectations (eg a plastic spoon is light),yogurt seemed denser and more expensive. Colour contrast is also an important factor: white yoghurt when eaten from a white spoon was rated sweeter,more liked,and more expensive than pink-coloured yoghurt.</p>
<p>These effects were reversed for yoghurt tasted from a black spoon,which suggests that colour contrast mediates the effects of cutlery on flavor perception. Similarly,when offered cheese on a knife,spoon,fork or toothpick,the cheese from a knife tasted saltiest.</p>
<p>&#8220;How we experience food is a multi-sensory experience involving taste,feel of the food in our mouths,aroma,and the feasting of our eyes. Even before we put food into our mouths our brains have made a judgment about it,which affects our overall experience,&#8221; researchers Vanessa Harrar and Charles Spence said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Subtly changing eating implements and tableware can affect how pleasurable,or filling,food appears. So,when serving a dish,one should keep in mind that the colour of the food appears different depending on the background on which it is presented (plate or cutlery) and,therefore,tastes different,&#8221; Harrar said.</p>
<p>Researchers said this may also be used to help control eating patterns such as portion size or how much salt is added to food.</p>
<p>Alternatively,people may be able to make better food choices if their ingrained colour associations are disrupted by less constant advertising and packaging,they said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1134128&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Children who are breast-fed may be 24 per cent more likely to reach a higher social class than their parents,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at about 34,000 people in the UK,either born in 1958 or in 1970,and compared their social class at the age 33 or 34 with that of their fathers when they were children.</p>
<p>Among the study participants,those who had been breast-fed were more likely to have moved up the social hierarchy in adulthood,which the researchers defined as having a job of higher social status than their fathers.</p>
<p>While breast-feeding increased the chance of moving upward socially by 24 per cent,it also reduced the chance of sliding downward by 20 per cent,according to the study.</p>
<p>The results suggest that breast-feeding improved children&#8217;s neurological development,resulting in better cognitive abilities,which in turn helped them with their upward move in the society,the researchers said,&#8217;LiveScience&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>Breast-fed children in the study also had fewer signs of emotional stress,which could have contributed to their success later in the life,the study said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the combination of physical contact and the most appropriate nutrients required for growth and brain development is implicated in the better neurocognitive and adult outcomes of breast-fed infants,&#8221; the researchers wrote in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood.</p>
<p>In the study,researchers asked mothers of two large groups of people born 12 years apart whether they had breast-fed their children.</p>
<p>They then compared people&#8217;s social class as children &#8211; based on the social class of their father when they were 10 or 11 &#8211; with their social class as adults,measured when they were 33 or 34.</p>
<p>Social class was based on different categories of occupations,from unskilled and manual,to managerial and professional jobs.</p>
<p>The researchers measured children&#8217;s cognitive performance and stress response every few years. They found that cognitive abilities and stress scores accounted for about a third of the total impact of breast-feeding.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1133614&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women find a man in a plain white T-shirt up to 10 per cent more attractive,according to new research.</p>
<p>Researchers at Nottingham Trent University in UK found that wearing a plain white t-shirt with a black letter &#8216;T&#8217; on the front significantly improves the appearance of the wearer&#8217;s waist: chest ratio (WCR) a major signal of masculinity and attractiveness to females.</p>
<p>The study showed 30 female participants images of different male body shapes,wearing a plain white T-shirt,and asking them to mark their perceived attractiveness,health and intelligence.</p>
<p>They were then asked to do the same when shown the bodies again but with upright and inverted T-illusions of varying shapes and sizes on the t-shirts.</p>
<p>The results showed that upright T-illusions increased attractiveness and health by about 10 per cent,while inverted T-illusions resulted in a drop of attractiveness by the same amount.</p>
<p>The upright and inverted &#8216;T&#8217; with wider horizontal bars showed a bigger average effect,both positive and negative. The size of the effect depended on how close the individual body was to the ideal WCR &#8211; bodies closer to the optimal ratio received less benefit than those further away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wider barred &#8216;T&#8217; seems to emphasise the upper chest when upright,which accentuates men&#8217;s optimum shape. The opposite happens when inverted,&#8221; psychologist Dr Andrew Dunn from the University said.</p>
<p>&#8220;WCR is one of just a number of body measures that humans use to judge attractiveness and health. Our ability to detect,process and use this information appears to be implicit. &#8220;The brain and sensory mechanism underpinning this are probably evolved and are almost certainly managing what we look for and how we respond,&#8221; Dunn said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1133562&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modified citrus pectin &#8211; developed from the skin of citrus fruits &#8211; could act as a potent anti-cancer therapy,a new research has found.</p>
<p>Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine highlighted a large body of published research demonstrating how modified citrus pectin (MCP),works against cancer.</p>
<p>&#8220;This review does an excellent job consolidating our knowledge about modified citrus pectin&#8217;s remarkable therapeutic impact,&#8221; said Isaac Eliaz,integrative medicine researcher and MCP co-developer.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular,it identifies MCP&#8217;s different mechanisms of action against metastatic cancer,heavy metal toxicity and chronic,life threatening illnesses related to excess galectin-3,&#8221; Eliaz said.</p>
<p>While plant pectins have long been known to support digestive and immune health through their actions in the GI tract,the main obstacle preventing them from exerting systemic benefits in the body has been their bio-availability. The long complex soluble fibers in regular pectin are simply too large to be absorbed into the circulation. This problem was solved with the development of MCP,which is prepared from regular citrus pectin using a modification process to reduce the size and cross branching of the pectin molecules.</p>
<p>The modification allows MCP to easily absorb into the circulation and exert numerous therapeutic effects throughout the body,now demonstrated in multiple peer reviewed studies.</p>
<p>The review discussed MCP&#8217;s ability to control metastatic melanoma,as well as prostate,breast and colon cancers. These outcomes have been confirmed in multiple published studies,which have also shown MCP&#8217;s ability to suppress angiogenesis (new blood vessel growth to tumours). Blocking angiogenesis is a key factor in preventing cancer metastasis.</p>
<p>MCP has also been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Apoptosis,known as programmed cell death,is suppressed in tumours,allowing them to grow uncontrollably. Numerous studies show MCP supports apoptosis in cancer,including a 2010 study from Columbia University which found  that MCP induced apoptosis in both androgen dependent and androgen independent prostate cancer cells. This is particularly significant because androgen independent prostate cancer is a highly aggressive,difficult-to-treat cancer.</p>
<p>Other important findings demonstrate MCP&#8217;s abilities to make chemotherapy more effective. Co-administering MCP with cisplatin,etoposide or doxorubicin makes cancer cells more sensitive to these front-line treatments. MCP is also useful during radiation therapy,helping to protect organs from the damaging inflammatory effects of radiation,researchers said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1133120&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women on testosterone therapy,after menopause showed a significant improvement in verbal learning and memory,a study by Australian researchers has said.</p>
<p>The research led by Susan Davis,Director of the Women&#8217;s Health Research Program at Monash University is the first large radomised,placebo-controlled investigation into the effects of testosterone on cognitive function in postmenopausal women which offer a promising avenue for research into memory and ageing,said a statement by the University.</p>
<p>Testosterone has been implicated as being important for brain function in men and these results indicate that it has a role in optimising learning and memory in women. Dementia which was estimated to affect more than 35 million people worldwide in 2010,is more common in women than men. There are no effective treatments to prevent memory decline.</p>
<p>In the study,96 postmenopausal women recruited from the community were randomly allocated to receive a testosterone gel or a visually identical placebo gel to be applied to the skin. Participants underwent a comprehensive series of cognitive tests at the beginning of the study and 26 weeks later.</p>
<p>All women performed in the normal range for their age at the beginning of the trial. There was a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in verbal learning and memory amongst the women using the testosterone gel after 26 weeks.</p>
<p>Davis said the results indicated that testosterone played an important role in women&#8217;s health. &#8220;Much of the research on testosterone in women to date has focused on sexual function. But testosterone has widespread effects in women,including,it appears,significant favourable effects on verbal learning and memory,&#8221; Davis said</p>
<p>&#8220;Our findings provide compelling evidence for the conduct of larger clinical studies to further investigate the role of testosterone in cognitive function in women,&#8221; she said. Androgen levels did increase in the cohort on testosterone therapy,but on average,remained in the normal female range.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1133088&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well-rested teenagers tend to make more healthy food choices than their sleep-deprived peers,according to a new study. The findings led by Lauren Hale,Associate Professor of Preventive Medicine at Stony Brook University School of Medicine in US may be key to understanding the link between sleep and obesity. &#8220;Not only do sleepy teens on average eat more food that&#8217;s bad for them,they also eat less food that is good for them,&#8221; said Hale.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we already know that sleep duration is associated with a range of health consequences,this study speaks to some of the mechanisms,ie,nutrition and decision making,through which health outcomes are affected,&#8221; said Hale.</p>
<p>The study examined the association between sleep duration and food choices in a national representative sample of 13,284 teenagers in the second wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The data were collected in 1996 when the interview subjects had a mean age of 16 years.</p>
<p>Researchers found that those teens who reported sleeping fewer than seven hours per night &#8211; 18 per cent of respondents &#8211; were more likely to consume fast food two or more times per week and less likely to eat healthful food such as fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>The results took into account factors such as age,gender,race and ethnicity,socioeconomic status,physical activity and family structure,and found that short sleep duration had an independent effect on both healthy and unhealthy food choices.</p>
<p>The respondents fell into one of three categories: short sleepers,who received fewer than seven hours per night; mid-range sleepers,who had seven to eight hours per night; and recommended sleepers,who received more than eight hours per night. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends that adolescents get between nine and 10 hours of sleep per night. The study was presented at the annual meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1132429&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have discovered the chemical that makes naked mole rats cancer-proof,a finding that could eventually lead to new cancer treatments. Naked mole rats are small,hairless,subterranean rodents that have never been known to get cancer,despite having a 30-year lifespan.</p>
<p>Researchers led by Andrei Seluanov and Vera Gorbunova from the University of Rochester discovered that these rodents are protected from cancer because their tissues are very rich with high molecular weight hyaluronan (HMW-HA).</p>
<p>The biologists&#8217; focus on HMW-HA began after they noticed that a gooey substance in the naked mole rat culture was clogging the vacuum pumps and tubing. They also observed that,unlike the naked mole rat culture,other media containing cells from humans,mice,and guinea pigs were not viscous.</p>
<p>&#8220;We needed to understand what the goo was,&#8221; said Seluanov. Gorbunova and Seluanov identified the substance as HMW-HA,which caused them to test its possible role in naked mole rat&#8217;s cancer resistance.</p>
<p>They then showed that when HMW-HA was removed,the cells became susceptible to tumours,confirming that the chemical did play a role in making naked mole rats cancer-proof.</p>
<p>The team also identified the gene,named HAS2,responsible for making HMW-HA in the naked mole rat. Surprisingly,the naked mole rat gene was different from HAS2 in all other animals. In addition the naked mole rats were very slow at recycling HMW-HA,which contributed to the accumulation of the chemical in the animals&#8217; tissues.</p>
<p>The next step will be to test the effectiveness of HMW-HA in mice. If that test goes well,Seluanov and Gorbunova hope to try the chemical on human cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s indirect evidence that HMW-HA would work in people. It&#8217;s used in anti-wrinkle injections and to relieve pain from arthritis in knee joints,without any adverse effects. Our hope is that it can also induce an anti-cancer response,&#8221; said Seluanov.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s possible to learn strategies for preventing tumours by studying animals that are cancer-proof,&#8221; said Gorbunova.</p>
<p>The two biologists identified HMW-HA as the chemical that activates the anti-cancer response of the p16 gene. The study appears in the journal Nature.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1131636&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiny amounts of silver added to antibiotics could make them 10 to 1,000 times more effective and enable them to fight drug-resistant infections,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>Scientists at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University found treating bacteria with a silver-containing compound boosted the efficacy of a broad range of widely used antibiotics and helped them stop otherwise lethal infections in mice.</p>
<p>It also helped make an antibiotic-resistant strain of bacteria sensitive to antibiotics again. And it expanded the power of an antibiotic called vancomycin that is usually only effective in killing pathogens called Gram-positive bacteria,such as Staph and Strep.</p>
<p>Silver allowed vancomycin for the first time to penetrate and kill Gram-negative bacteria,a group that includes microbes that can cause food poisoning and dangerous hospital-acquired infections. </p>
<p>Silver also proved useful for two types of stubborn infections that usually require repeated rounds of antibiotic treatment and multiple visits to the clinic: dormant bacteria that lie low during antibiotic treatment and rebound to cause recurrent infections,and microbial slime layers called biofilms that coat catheters and prosthetic joints.</p>
<p>&#8220;The results suggest that silver could be incredibly valuable as an adjunct to existing antibiotic treatments,&#8221; said Jim Collins,a pioneer of synthetic biology and Core Faculty member at the Wyss Institute.</p>
<p>In the study,researcher Ruben Morones-Ramirez treated normal and mutant strains of E coli bacteria with a silver compound. Then he observed them under the electron microscope and ran a series of biochemical tests.</p>
<p>He found that silver compounds cause bacteria to produce more reactive oxygen species &#8211; chemically reactive molecules that damage the bacterial cell&#8217;s DNA and enzymes,as well as the membrane that encloses the cell.</p>
<p>The results showed that a small amount of silver made E coli bacteria between 10 and 1000 times more sensitive to three commonly used antibiotics: gentamycin,ofloxacin,and ampicillin.</p>
<p>In mice,silver also helped antibiotics fight E coli-induced urinary-tract infections. It made a previously impervious strain of E coli sensitive to the antibiotic tetracycline.</p>
<p>It allowed vancomycin to save the lives of 90 per cent of mice with life-threatening cases of peritonitis  inflammation caused by infections of the abdominal space surrounding the internal organs. Without silver,only 10 per cent of the mice survived.</p>
<p>The scientists also found that the doses of silver needed to help antibiotics did not harm cultured human cells,suggesting that oral and injectable silver could be safe for humans as well.</p>
<p>The study was published in Science Translational Medicine. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1131635&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humans may be able to upload their brains to computers by as early as 2045,some futurists believe.</p>
<p>This notion formed the basis for the Global Future 2045 International Congress,a futuristic conference held in New York,last week.</p>
<p>The conference,which is the brainchild of Russian multimillionaire Dmitry Itskov,featured Ray Kurzweil  an inventor,futurist and now director of engineering at Google &#8211; who predicted that by 2045,technology will have surpassed human brainpower to create a kind of superintelligence an event known as the singularity.</p>
<p>Other scientists have said that robots will overtake humans by 2100,&#8217;LiveScience&#8217; reported. According to Moore&#8217;s law,computing power doubles approximately every two years. Several technologies are undergoing similar exponential advances,from genetic sequencing to 3D printing,Kurzweil told conference attendees.</p>
<p>By 2045,&#8221;based on conservative estimates of the amount of computation you need to functionally simulate a human brain,we&#8217;ll be able to expand the scope of our intelligence a billion-fold,&#8221; Kurzweil said.</p>
<p>Substantial achievements have already been made in the field of brain-computer interfaces,or BCIs (also called brain-machine interfaces).</p>
<p>Jose Carmena and Michel Maharbiz,electrical engineers at the University of California,Berkeley,are working to develop state-of-the-art motor BCIs.</p>
<p>These devices consist of pill-size electrode arrays that record neural signals from the brain&#8217;s motor areas,which are then decoded by a computer and used to control a computer cursor or prosthetic limb (such as a robotic arm).</p>
<p>Theodore Berger,a neural engineer at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles,is taking BCIs to a new level by developing a memory prosthesis. Berger aims to replace part of the brain&#8217;s hippocampus,the region that converts short-term memories into long-term ones,with a BCI.</p>
<p>The device records the electrical activity that encodes a simple short-term memory (such as pushing a button) and converts it to a digital signal. That signal is passed into a computer where it is mathematically transformed and then fed back into the brain,where it gets sealed in as a long-term memory.</p>
<p>Martine Rothblatt &#8211; a lawyer,author and entrepreneur,and CEO of biotech company United Therapeutics Corp introduced the concept of &#8220;mindclones&#8221; &#8211; digital versions of humans that can live forever &#8211; in the conference.</p>
<p>She described how the mind clones are created from a &#8220;mindfile,&#8221; a sort of online repository of our personalities,which she argued humans already have (in the form of Facebook,for example).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists led by Oxford researchers have identified a mysterious new virus in patients with severe brain infections in Vietnam. Further research is needed to determine whether the virus is responsible for the symptoms of disease,researchers said. The virus was found in 28 out of 644 patients with severe brain infections in the study,but not in any of the 122 patients with non-infectious brain disorders that were tested.</p>
<p>Scientists identified the virus,tentatively named CyCV-VN,in the fluid around the brain of two patients with brain infections of unknown cause. The virus was subsequently detected in an additional 26 out of 642 patients with brain infections of known and unknown causes. Using next-generation DNA sequencing techniques,the team sequenced the entire genetic material of the virus,confirming that it represents a new species that has not been isolated before. They found that it belongs to a family of viruses called the Circoviridae,which have previously only been associated with disease in animals,including birds and pigs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t yet know whether this virus is responsible for causing the serious brain infections we see in these patients,but finding an infectious agent like this in a normally sterile environment like the fluid around the brain is extremely important,&#8221; Dr Rogier van Doorn,Head of Emerging Infections at the Wellcome Trust Vietnam Research Programme and Oxford University Clinical Research Unit Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Vietnam,said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to understand the potential threat of this virus to human and animal health,&#8221; van Doorn said. The researchers were not able to detect CyCV-VN in blood samples from the patients but it was present in eight out of 188 faecal samples from healthy children. The virus was also detected in more than half of fecal samples from chickens and pigs taken from the local area of one of the patients from whom the virus was initially isolated,which may suggest an animal source of infection.</p>
<p>&#8220;The evidence so far seems to suggest that CyCV-VN may have crossed into humans from animals,another example of a potential zoonotic infection,&#8221; Dr Le Van Tan of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Vietnam said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1131608&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A mysterious new respiratory virus that originated in the Middle East spreads easily between people and appears more deadly than SARS,doctors reported Wednesday after investigating the biggest outbreak in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>More than 60 cases of what is now called MERS,including 38 deaths,have been recorded by the World Health Organization in the past year,mostly in Saudi Arabia. So far,illnesses haven&#8217;t spread as quickly as SARS did in 2003,ultimately triggering a global outbreak that killed about 800 people.</p>
<p>An international team of doctors who investigated nearly two dozen cases in eastern Saudi Arabia found the new coronavirus has some striking similarities to SARS. Unlike SARS,though,scientists remain baffled as to the source of MERS.</p>
<p>In a worrying finding,the team said MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) not only spreads easily between people,but within hospitals. That was also the case with SARS,a distant relative of the new virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;To me,this felt a lot like SARS did,&#8221; said Dr. Trish Perl,a senior hospital epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine,who was part of the team. Their report was published online Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>Perl said they couldn&#8217;t nail down how it was spread in every case &#8211; through droplets from sneezing or coughing,or a more indirect route. Some of the hospital patients weren&#8217;t close to the infected person,but somehow picked up the virus.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the right circumstances,the spread could be explosive,&#8221; said Perl,while emphasizing that the team only had a snapshot of one MERS cluster in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Cases have continued to trickle in,and there appears to be an ongoing outbreak in Saudi Arabia. MERS cases have also been reported in Jordan,Qatar,the United Arab Emirates,Britain,France,Germany,Italy and Tunisia. Most have had a direct connection to the Middle East region.</p>
<p>In the Saudi cluster that was investigated,certain patients infected many more people than would be expected,Perl said. One patient who was receiving dialysis treatment spread MERS to seven others,including fellow dialysis patients at the same hospital. During SARS,such patients were known as &#8220;superspreaders&#8221; and effectively seeded outbreaks in numerous countries.</p>
<p>Perl and colleagues also concluded that symptoms of both diseases are similar,with an initial fever and cough that may last for a few days before pneumonia develops.</p>
<p>But MERS appears far more lethal. Compared to SARS&#8217; 8 percent death rate,the fatality rate for MERS in the Saudi outbreak was about 65 percent,though the experts could be missing mild cases that might skew the figures.</p>
<p>While SARS was traced to bats before jumping to humans via civet cats,the source of the MERS virus remains a mystery. It is most closely related to a bat virus though some experts suspect people may be getting sick from animals like camels or goats. Another hypothesis is that infected bats may be contaminating foods like dates,commonly harvested and eaten in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Doctors around the world have struggled to treat patients. &#8220;We need more information from other countries to find out what the best treatment is,&#8221; said Dr. Clemens Wendtner,who treated a MERS patient who later died in Munich. &#8220;Our patient got everything possible and it still didn&#8217;t help him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other experts said there are enough worrying signs about MERS that it can&#8217;t yet be written off,despite the relatively small number of cases it has caused.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as it is around,it has every opportunity at the genetic roulette table to turn into something more dangerous,&#8221; said Michael Osterholm,an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan has previously called MERS the single biggest public health threat and acknowledged officials were &#8220;empty-handed&#8221; regarding prevention measures.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand too little about this virus when viewed against the magnitude of its potential threat,&#8221; she said last month in Geneva.</p>
<p>At a meeting this weekend in Cairo,WHO will meet with other experts to discuss MERS and to possibly develop guidelines for next month&#8217;s Ramadan,when millions of Muslim pilgrims will be visiting Saudi Arabia.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1131529&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A vaccine against a cervical cancer virus cut infections in teen girls by half in the first study to measure the shot&#8217;s impact since it came on the market. The results impressed health experts and a top government top health official called them striking.</p>
<p>The research released Wednesday echoes studies done before the HPV vaccine became available in 2006. But the new study is the first evidence of just how well it works now that it is in general use.</p>
<p>Only about half of teen girls in the U.S. have gotten at least one dose of the expensive vaccine,and just a third of teen girls have had all three shots,according to the latest government figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are striking results and I think they should be a wake-up call that we need to increase vaccination rates,&#8221; said Dr. Thomas Frieden,director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Cervical cancer is caused by certain types of the common sexually transmitted virus called HPV,for human papillomavirus. The vaccine,which costs about $130 per dose,protects against a few of those strains,including two blamed for 70 percent of cervical cancers. The shots work best if given before someone is sexually active so the emphasis has been on giving the shots to 11- and 12-year olds.</p>
<p>The CDC study compared infection rates in girls ages 14 to 19 before and after the vaccine became available. The proportion infected with the targeted HPV strains dropped 56 percent,from about 12 percent before the vaccine was sold to 5 percent. That result was for all teens after it was on the market,whether or not they were vaccinated.</p>
<p>Among girls who had gotten the vaccine,the drop in HPV infections was higher &#8211; 88 percent.</p>
<p>There are two vaccines against HPV,but the study mainly reflects the impact of Gardasil,the Merck &amp; Co. vaccine that came on the market in 2006. A second vaccine approved in 2009 &#8211; GlaxoSmithKline&#8217;s Cervarix &#8211; probably had relatively little bearing on the results,said the CDC&#8217;s Dr. Lauri Markowitz,the study&#8217;s lead author.</p>
<p>Both vaccines are approved for use in males and females &#8211; in ages 9 to 26 for females,and 9 to 21 in males. The vaccine was only recommended for boys in late 2011,and the CDC has not yet reported data on how many boys have gotten the shot since then. HPV vaccination requires three shots over 6 months.</p>
<p>An estimated 75 to 80 percent of men and women are infected with HPV during their lifetime. Most don&#8217;t develop symptoms and clear it on their own. But some infections lead to genital warts,cervical cancer and other cancers. The study didn&#8217;t look at cervical cancer rates. It can take many years for such cancers to develop,and not enough time has passed to know the vaccine&#8217;s impact on cancer rates,CDC officials said.</p>
<p>The study involved interviews and physical examinations of nearly 1,400 teen girls in 2003 through 2006 and of 740 girls in 2007 through 2010.</p>
<p>The vaccine&#8217;s impact was seen even though only 34 percent of the teens in the second group had received any vaccine. That could be due to &#8220;herd immunity&#8221; &#8211; when a population is protected from an infection because a large or important smaller group is immune.</p>
<p>Only about 20 percent of those vaccinated got all three doses. That result will likely feed an ongoing discussion about whether all three doses are necessary,Markowitz said.</p>
<p>Overall,the study found no significant change over time in the proportion of teens who&#8217;d ever had sex and in those who had multiple sex partners. However,it did find that a higher percentage of vaccinated teens said they&#8217;d had three or more sex partners.</p>
<p>That could have driven down infection rates,Markowitz noted,if the teens who got vaccinated were the ones at highest risk of getting an infection and spreading it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1131520&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Newborn babies who grow faster in the first four weeks are likely to have a higher IQ later in life,a new study has found.</p>
<p>Weight gain and increased head size in the first month of a baby&#8217;s life is linked to a higher intelligence quotient (IQ) at early school age,the study led by University of Adelaide Public Health researchers found.</p>
<p>They analysed data from more than 13,800 children who were born full-term.</p>
<p>They found that babies who put on 40 per cent of their birth weight in the first four weeks had an IQ 1.5 points higher by the time they were six years of age,compared with babies who only put on 15 per cent of their birth weight.</p>
<p>Those with the biggest growth in head circumference also had the highest IQs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Head circumference is an indicator of brain volume,so a greater increase in head circumference in a newborn baby suggests more rapid brain growth,&#8221; said the lead author of the study,Dr Lisa Smithers from the University of Adelaide&#8217;s School of Population Health.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall,newborn children who grew faster in the first four weeks had higher IQ scores later in life,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those children who gained the most weight scored especially high on verbal IQ at age 6. This may be because the neural structures for verbal IQ develop earlier in life,which means the rapid weight gain during that neonatal period could be having a direct cognitive benefit for the child,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown the association between early postnatal diet and IQ,but this is the first study of its kind to focus on the IQ benefits of rapid weight gain in the first month of life for healthy newborn babies. </p>
<p>Smithers said the study further highlights the need for successful feeding of newborn babies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that many mothers have difficulty establishing breastfeeding in the first weeks of their baby&#8217;s life,&#8221; Smithers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The findings of our study suggest that if infants are having feeding problems,there needs to be early intervention in the management of that feeding,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal <i>Pediatrics</i>. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1131039&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Catching up on lost sleep may help men lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>Researchers from Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institut  (LA BioMed) found that insulin sensitivity,the body&#8217;s ability to clear glucose (blood sugar) from the bloodstream,significantly improved after three nights of &#8220;catch-up sleep&#8221; on the weekend in men with long-term,weekday sleep restrictions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all know we need to get adequate sleep,but that is often impossible because of work demands and busy lifestyles,&#8221; said lead researcher Dr Peter Liu. &#8220;Our study found extending the hours of sleep can improve the body&#8217;s use of insulin,thereby reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes in adult men,&#8221; Liu said.</p>
<p>Insulin is a hormone that regulates a person&#8217;s blood sugar level. The body of a patient with type 2 diabetes cannot effectively use the insulin it produces,or it becomes &#8220;resistant&#8221; to insulin.</p>
<p>Retaining the body&#8217;s sensitivity to insulin reduces the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. &#8220;The good news is that by extending the hours they sleep,adult men &#8211; who over a long period of time do not get enough sleep during the working week &#8211; can still improve their insulin sensitivity,&#8221; Liu said.</p>
<p>Liu and researchers from the University of Sydney in Australia studied 19 non-diabetic men,with an average age of 28.6 years,who for six months or longer (average,5.1 years) self-reported inadequate sleep during the workweek.</p>
<p>On average,the men received only 6.2 hours of sleep each work night. But they regularly caught up on their sleep on the weekends,sleeping an extra 37.4 per cent,or 2.3 hours,per night,the authors reported. The researchers randomly assigned the men to two of three sleep conditions: (1) 10 hours of sleep,(2) six hours of sleep or (3) 10 hours in bed,in which noises during deep sleep aroused them into shallow sleep without waking them. The six hours of sleep tested persistent sleep restriction.</p>
<p>The study found that when the men slept 10 hours a night on each of three nights of catch-up sleep,their insulin sensitivity was much better than when they had persistent sleep restriction. Their insulin resistance test score also improved (decreased) with sleep extension.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1131034&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two young scientists from IIT-Delhi have received a provisional patent for the prototype of a prosthetic limb that will enable amputees to walk without having to drag their leg.</p>
<p>Deepak Joshi and Ramandeep Singh,research scholars at the Centre for Biomedical Engineering in IIT-Delhi,have developed a control strategy for speed adaptive walking in an above-knee prosthesis. With the use of a transmitter,people who have received below-knee amputations will be able to walk with ease and without disturbing their gait as the prosthetic leg would mimic the action of the good leg.</p>
<p>To control the prosthetic limb,two variables were measured,namely,knee angle and the walking speed. Knee angle (how much the knee bends) of the normal limb was measured by using a potentiometer fitted with the micro-controller, Singh said.</p>
<p>A heel switch placed at the shoe of the normal limb identifies the walking speed,converts it to an algorithm and transmits it to through wireless module to the prosthetic limb. The radio frequency (RF) wireless transmission is used to transfer the data from normal limb to prosthetic limb, Singh said.</p>
<p>He said the algorithm has been successfully implemented in a prototype. It consists of three parts: knee joint,leg and foot. A stepper motor is incorporated with the knee joint itself. As the stepper motor receives the signal from the circuit,it rotates the knee joint.</p>
<p>The patent has been filed by Foundation of Innovation and Technology Transfer (IIT-Delhi) and complete provisional specifications were received on February 13.</p>
<p>The two research scholars have been mentored by Professor Sneh Anand from IIT-Delhi and Dr U Singh from the All India Institute for Medical Sciences. The Centre for Biomedical Engineering,set up in 1971,is a joint venture of the two institutes. </p>
<p>The project is unique not only in its application,but also in its hardware and software design, Prof Anand,who heads the Centre for Biomedical Engineering,said. </p>
<p>The USP of the project is the use of minimum number of sensors with maximum accuracy in prediction that will help increase a persons adaptability to the prosthetic limb.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1130819&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>South Asians are five times more likely to be severely depressed following cancer diagnosis in Britain,according to a new research.</p>
<p>The first study of its kind to investigate depression among British white people and South Asians in the UK found that people of Indian,Pakistani,Bangladeshi or Sri Lankan origin,classified as British South Asians,appeared to suffer more pain.</p>
<p>It has led researchers to conclude that this could be a way of drawing attention to their psychological distress.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first study that has compared how British South Asians and British white patients cope with cancer. Our findings are strictly only relevant to the study group and patients from the county of Leicestershire.</p>
<p>However,we think it is highly likely that there is a higher incidence of depression among British South Asian cancer patients elsewhere in the UK and our findings have important implications for the NHS,&#8221; said Prof Paul Symonds from the University of Leicester,the lead author of the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;Depression is one of the strongest determinants of health-related quality of life and it can influence medical care and participation in treatment. It may also be linked with other serious outcomes including mortality.</p>
<p>It should be of major concern to healthcare policymakers in the UK that this study provides evidence that there is a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms among South Asian patients,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Overall,53.8 per cent of the British South Asian samples used were born in the Indian subcontinent,33 per cent in Africa and 12.9 per cent in the UK.</p>
<p>The researchers investigated whether there are differences in depressive symptoms among 94 British South Asian patients with cancer compared to 185 British white patients over a nine-month period.</p>
<p>The research,led by the University of Leicester,was part funded by Leicestershire and Rutland based charity Hope Against Cancer and the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust,and is published in &#8216;British Medical Journal Open&#8217;.</p>
<p>British South Asian patients had twice the self-reported rate of depressive symptoms than British White patients and five times the incidence of severe depression.</p>
<p>These differences persisted for nine months after the baseline assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reasons for the difference in the incidence of depressive symptoms are complex. British South Asian patients use potentially maladaptive coping strategies more frequently than British white patients,particularly hopelessness,helplessness,fatalism,avoidance and denial.</p>
<p>At baseline the use of these maladaptive strategies correlated with a higher incidence of depression&#8230; It is most likely that the rates of depressive symptoms are under-reported since anecdotally those who were most distressed often did not feel able to participate in this study,&#8221; said Prof Symonds,who worked with colleagues from University Hospital of Leicester NHS Trust on the study.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1130602&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Babies in the womb respond to their mothers&#8217; voice,even paying attention when they&#8217;re read a story,a new study has found. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University in US asked 74 women who were 36 weeks pregnant to read for two minutes while their babies&#8217; heart rate and movements were monitored.</p>
<p>They found babies stopped moving and lowered their heart rate when their mother started reading aloud to them,study lead author Kristin Voegtline said. &#8220;It is quite fascinating how the foetus learns to recognise and react to the mother&#8217;s voice before prior to birth &#8211; here,we showed that they can detect onset of maternal voice and differences in maternal voice,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some women were napping prior to asking them to read aloud from a passage &#8211; these foetuses showed a brief startle to onset of maternal voice,&#8221; she said. Voegtline said the heart rate of foetuses lowered and movement stopped when mothers switched from chatting to reading aloud,the &#8216;Herald Sun&#8217; reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;The near-term foetus has a mature auditory system that reliably detects and responds to sound,&#8221; she said. The researchers concluded a mother&#8217;s voice &#8220;shapes auditory learning in utero with implications for postnatal recognition of,and preference for,the maternal voice&#8221;. The study was published in the Infant Behaviour and Development journal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1130558&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Overweight women who regularly skip breakfast may develop chronic insulin resistance which could increase their risk for type 2 diabetes,a new study has warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our study found that acute insulin resistance developed after only one day of skipping breakfast,&#8221; said the study&#8217;s lead author,Elizabeth Thomas,an endocrinology fellow at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora.</p>
<p>In insulin resistance,a person requires more insulin to bring their glucose,or blood sugar,into a normal range,she explained. Thomas and co-workers studied nine non diabetic women,with an average age of 29,who were overweight or obese. The study took place on two days about a month apart.</p>
<p>Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either breakfast or no breakfast at the first visit and the opposite at the second visit. Four hours later,all subjects ate the same standardised lunch at each visit. </p>
<p>They had blood samples taken every 30 minutes after lunch for three hours to test their insulin and glucose levels. It is normal for glucose levels to rise after eating a meal,which then triggers insulin production. The researchers found,however,that the women&#8217;s insulin and glucose levels after lunch were significantly higher on the day they skipped breakfast than on the day when participants ate breakfast.</p>
<p>The higher levels demonstrated acute insulin resistance because of skipping breakfast,according to Thomas. It was not clear if this &#8220;heightened metabolic response&#8221; was temporary or lasting,but it may contribute to the development of chronic insulin resistance,she said. When the body becomes permanently resistant to the effects of the hormone insulin,sugar builds up in the blood,which can lead to prediabetes and diabetes over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;This information should help health care providers in counselling patients as to why it is better to eat a healthy,balanced breakfast than to skip breakfast,&#8221; Thomas said. The results were presented at The Endocrine Society&#8217;s 95th Annual Meeting in San Francisco. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1130538&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The increasing trend of sharing photographs online on social networking sites heralds the end of the traditional family photo album,a new UK study has found. Two-thirds of Britons now prefer to catalogue their pictures on computers,tablets or smartphones instead of displaying their photos in old-fashioned albums.</p>
<p>Just a third of those questioned said they still displayed images using an old-fashioned book,while 53 per cent claimed they preferred to use Facebook. The South Korean firm,Samsung,analysed the responses of 3,000 people collected by OnePoll for the study. It found that a mere 13 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds had ever used an album,The Telegraph reported.</p>
<p>Around one in five people said they take photos with the intention of posting them on sites such as Facebook,Twitter or Instagram,with 10 per cent saying their snaps were uploaded onto a website in less than a 60 seconds after they had been shot on a smartphone.</p>
<p>Another trend that was observed in the study was that young people now take more pictures of themselves than friends and family. The &#8220;selfies&#8221;,where the photographer takes photos of themselves by holding their camera at arm&#8217;s length,have become the most popular image captured by young people.</p>
<p>They now account for 30 per cent of pictures taken by those aged 18-24,with men taking more photos of themselves than women,according to the poll. &#8220;The growing trend in sharing photography online is also resulting in the death of the photo album,&#8221; Samsung said. People are now taking more pictures than ever before,with an average of 1.9 billion photographs captured each month in Britain and 328 million of these shared online,the poll found.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1130132&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new smartphone app that lets busy Catholic priests update their statuses to let people know when and where they are available to listen to their confessions has been developed in the US.</p>
<p>Father Richard Heilman in Madison,Wisconsin,is launching a My Confessor App that will let his parishioners know when and where he is available to listen to their sins. A red status box means &#8216;Father is OUT&#8217;. A green status box means &#8216;Father is IN&#8217;. And priests have a special log in that lets them easily update their statuses and even post messages,according to app developer Mary Hoerr,New York Daily News reported.</p>
<p>The app also has a section explaining the sacrament of confession,as well as another place where users can read priests&#8217; bios. Heilman is the only priest on the app for now but he says several other priests have reached out and asked to get involved.</p>
<p>The app currently serves people in the Madison area. However,Heilman sees this going national. The number of Catholic priests in America has declined in recent decades,according to data collected by the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate.</p>
<p>In 1965,more than 58,000 Catholic priests belonged to the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. In 2012,that number was closer to 39,000.</p>
<p>On the other hand,the number of people who self-identify as Catholics has grown from 48.5 million to 78.2 million. &#8220;It&#8217;s challenging sometimes for priests to find time for confession because they have work to do. And parishioners are trying to go easy on Father because they see us trying to handle multiple things,&#8221; Heilman said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1130115&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researchers claim to have discovered a new memory-boosting chemical in mice,a finding that could pave way for drug targets to improve memory in humans. In one memory test,normal mice were able to relocate a submerged platform about three times faster after receiving injections of the potent chemical than mice that received sham injections,researchers said.</p>
<p>The mice that received the chemical also better remembered cues associated with unpleasant stimuli  the sort of fear conditioning that could help a mouse avoid being preyed upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears that the process of evolution has not optimised memory consolidation,otherwise I don&#8217;t think we could have improved upon it the way we did in our study with normal,healthy mice,&#8221; senior study author,Peter Walter from the University of California,San Francisco (UCSF) said.</p>
<p>The memory-boosting chemical was singled out from among 100,000 chemicals screened for their potential to perturb a protective biochemical pathway within cells that is activated when cells are unable to keep up with the need to fold proteins into their working forms.</p>
<p>Researcher Carmela Sidrauski discovered that the chemical acts within the cell beyond the biochemical pathway that activates this unfolded protein response,to more broadly impact what&#8217;s known as the integrated stress response. In this response,several biochemical pathways converge on a single molecular lynchpin,a protein called eIF2 alpha. </p>
<p>&#8220;Among other things,the inactivation of eIF2 alpha is a brake on memory consolidation,&#8221; Walter said,perhaps an evolutionary consequence of a cell or organism becoming better able to adapt in other ways.</p>
<p>Turning off eIF2 alpha dials down production of most proteins,some of which may be needed for memory formation,Walter said. Its inactivation also ramps up production of a few key proteins that help cells cope with stress. Study co-author Nahum Sonenberg,of McGill University previously linked memory and eIF2 alpha in genetic studies of mice.</p>
<p>The chemical integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB) counters the effects of eIF2 alpha inactivation inside cells,the researchers found. &#8220;ISRIB shows good pharmacokinetic properties (how a drug is absorbed,distributed and eliminated),readily crosses the blood-brain barrier,and exhibits no overt toxicity in mice,</p>
<p>which makes it very useful for studies in mice,&#8221; Walter said. These properties also indicate that ISRIB might serve as a good starting point for human drug development,said Walter. The study was published in the journal eLife. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1130087&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Your sweet tooth may be damaging your heart!</i></p>
<p>Eating too much sugar can set people down a pathway to heart failure,a new study has warned.</p>
<p>A single small molecule,the glucose metabolite glucose 6-phosphate (G6P),causes stress to the heart that changes the muscle proteins and induces poor pump function leading to heart failure,according to the researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth).</p>
<p>G6P can accumulate from eating too much starch and/or sugar,researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Treatment is difficult. Physicians can give diuretics to control the fluid,and beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors to lower the stress on the heart and allow it to pump more economically,&#8221; said Heinrich Taegtmeyer,principal investigator and professor of cardiology at the UTHealth Medical School.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we still have these terrible statistics and no new treatment for the past 20 years,&#8221; said Taegtmeyer.</p>
<p>Taegtmeyer performed preclinical trials in animal models,as well as tests on tissue taken from patients at the Texas Heart Institute,who had a piece of the heart muscle removed in order to implant a left ventricle assist device. Both led to the discovery of the damage caused by G6P.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the heart muscle is already stressed from high blood pressure or other diseases,and then takes in too much glucose,it adds insult to injury,&#8221; Taegtmeyer said.</p>
<p>Researchers said the study has opened doors to possible new treatments. Two drugs,rapamycin (an immunosuppressant) and metformin (a diabetes medication) disrupt signalling of G6P and improved cardiac power in small animal studies,they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;These drugs have a potential for treatment and this has now cleared a path to future studies with patients,&#8221; Taegtmeyer said.</p>
<p><i>The study was published in the Journal of the American heart Association. </i></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1129467&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have developed a new technique to trigger reproduction in the laboratory of clusters of human cells that make insulin,potentially removing a significant obstacle to transplanting the cells as treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>Efforts to make this treatment possible have been limited by a dearth of insulin-producing beta cells that can be removed from donors after death,and by the stubborn refusal of human beta cells to proliferate in the laboratory after harvesting.</p>
<p>The new technique by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis uses a cell conditioning solution originally developed to trigger reproduction of cells from the lining of the intestine. </p>
<p>&#8220;Until now,there didn&#8217;t seem to be a way to reliably make the limited supply of human beta cells proliferate in the laboratory and remain functional,&#8221; said Michael McDaniel,professor of pathology and immunology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have not only found a technique to make the cells willing to multiply,we&#8217;ve done it in a way that preserves their ability to make insulin,&#8221; McDaniel said.</p>
<p>The current method for harvesting human islets,which are comprised primarily of the insulin-producing beta cells,makes it necessary to find two or three donors to extract enough cells to produce an adequate supply of insulin to treat a single patient with diabetes.</p>
<p>Lead author Haytham Aly,a postdoctoral research scholar,reported on his work with beta cells and was approached by Thaddeus Stappenbeck,associate professor of pathology and immunology,who studies autoimmune problems in the gut. </p>
<p>Stappenbeck had developed a medium that causes cells from the intestine&#8217;s lining to proliferate in test tubes. </p>
<p>&#8220;He said,why don&#8217;t you try it,and he gave us some samples. We put the solution in our freezer for a month or so,and when we finally gave it a try,we were amazed at the results: human beta cells in Dr Stappenbeck&#8217;s solution reproduced at a rate that was 20 times higher than beta cells in a solution that contained the sugar glucose,&#8221; Aly said.</p>
<p>The ability to produce large quantities of human beta cells in the laboratory gives the researchers hope that they could one day be transplanted into patients with type 1 diabetes. </p>
<p>The advantage of Stappenbeck&#8217;s solution may be that it is designed to activate multiple growth signalling pathways in cells,according to the researchers. Earlier attempts to make beta cells proliferate focused on one or two growth pathways. The solution also activates genes that help prevent beta cells from dying.</p>
<p>The findings are published in journal PLOS ONE. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1129070&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Testing women for the human papillomavirus (HPV) first,instead of using the traditional cervical screening test to detect abnormal cells in the cervix,could cut cervical cancer cases by a third in UK,a new study has claimed. The tests can prevent around 600 cases of cervical cancer a year in England,according to Cancer Research UK scientists,based at Queen Mary,University of London.</p>
<p>Scientists identified more than 8,750 women with cervical cancer and looked back at their screening records. They found almost 40 per cent had a negative cytology test result  the existing cervical screening test &#8211; within six years of their diagnosis.</p>
<p>They then used these data to predict how many more cases of cervical cancer could have been prevented if HPV testing had been used as primary screening test instead of the cytology test.</p>
<p>Assuming that primary HPV1 testing would pick up 95 per cent of the cases missed by cytology,the researchers estimate that it could prevent up to 33 per cent of cervical cancer cases in women aged 25-64 if introduced in England. The cervical screening programme prevents cases of cervical cancer by detecting and treating abnormal changes in the cells of the cervix,which can be the precursors of cancer. At the moment cervical cells are studied under a microscope to detect abnormalities  this is known as cytology. HPV testing is only used when women&#8217;s cells display mild or borderline abnormalities.</p>
<p>Primary HPV testing is done in the same way but is better at identifying women at risk of cervical cancer. In England around 1,800 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in women aged 25-64. This research suggests that HPV testing could cut that number by around a third predicting that around an additional 600 women might have their cancer prevented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cervical cancer screening is already hugely effective but our study shows how much better it could be by swapping to primary HPV testing,&#8221; said Professor Peter Sasieni,the study author. &#8220;Not only would introducing primary HPV testing prevent more cases of cancer,it would also mean women who tested negative wouldn&#8217;t need to be checked as often,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1129037&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Women can now blame men for hot flushes,mood swings and other symptoms of menopause they suffer from! Men&#8217;s preference for younger women in selecting mates may have led to menopause in older females,a new study led by an Indian-origin researcher has claimed.</p>
<p>Human males have shown a preference for younger women in selecting mates,stacking the Darwinian deck against continued fertility in older women,found researchers from McMaster University in Canada. While conventional thinking has held that menopause prevents older women from continuing to reproduce,in fact,the researchers&#8217; new theory said it is the lack of reproduction that has given rise to menopause.</p>
<p>Menopause is actually an unintended outcome of natural selection the result of its effects having become relaxed in older women,said the team led by biologist Rama Singh. &#8220;In a sense it is like ageing,but it is different because it is an all-or-nothing process that has been accelerated because of preferential mating,&#8221; said Singh.</p>
<p>Menopause is believed to be unique to humans,but no one had yet been able to offer a satisfactory explanation for why it occurs,Singh said. The prevailing &#8220;grandmother theory&#8221; holds that women have evolved to become infertile after a certain age to allow them to assist with rearing grandchildren,thus improving the survival of kin. Singh said that does not add up from an evolutionary perspective. &#8220;How do you evolve infertility? It is contrary to the whole notion of natural selection. Natural selection selects for fertility,for reproduction &#8211; not for stopping it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The new theory holds that,over time,competition among men of all ages for younger mates has left older females with much less chance of reproducing. The forces of natural selection,Singh said,are concerned only with the survival of the species through individual fitness,so they protect fertility in women while they are most likely to reproduce. After that period,natural selection ceases to quell the genetic mutations that ultimately bring on menopause,leaving women not only infertile,but also vulnerable to a host of health problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;This theory says that natural selection doesn&#8217;t have to do anything. If women were reproducing all along,and there were no preference against older women,women would be reproducing like men are for their whole lives,&#8221; Singh said.</p>
<p>The development of menopause,then,was not a change that improved the survival of the species,but one that merely recognised that fertility did not serve any ongoing purpose beyond a certain age. Singh pointed out that if women had historically been the ones to select younger mates,the situation would have been reversed,with men losing fertility.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1129034&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an article printed this week,British Medical Journal has raised questions about the safety of a class of new-age drugs touted not only as a wonder cure for type 2 diabetes but also hailed for its possible potential as a weight loss agent. The BMJ article talks about heightened risk of pancreatic cancer in mice models and hints that companies marketing the drugs may not be telling doctors the whole truth about it. </p>
<p>Coming after an announcement in March that the US Food and Drug Administration is evaluating unpublished data that suggest an increased risk of pancreatitis or inflammation of the pancreas,and pre-cancerous cellular changes called pancreatic duct metaplasia in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with drugs called incretin mimetics  Januvia by Merck is the best known in its class in India  the BMJ article,doctors here say,is creating waves. Merck says in absence of any compelling evidence on the contrary,it stands by the drugs safety profile. </p>
<p>An independent analysis of health insurance data published in February found that people taking exenatide and sitagliptin were at twice the risk for acute pancreatitis compared with people taking other antidiabetic drugs&#8230; the absolute risk 0.6 per cent. And in April an analysis of data from the US Food and Drug Administrations adverse event reporting system showed an increase in reports for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer in people taking incretin mimetics compared with those taking other antidiabetic drugs, reads the article. </p>
<p>Drugs in the incretin mimetic class include exenatide (Byetta,Bydureon),liraglutide (Victoza),sitagliptin (Januvia,Janumet,Janumet XR,Juvisync),saxagliptin (Onglyza,Kombiglyze XR),alogliptin (Nesina,Kazano,Oseni),linagliptin (Tradjenta,Jentadueto). They work by mimicking the incretin hormones to stimulate the release of insulin in response to a meal. They are used along with diet and exercise to lower blood sugar in adults with type 2 diabetes. Many of these drugs come with a warning of possible risk of pancreatitis,but the spectre of pancreatic cancer raised by the article that may have been kept away from doctors and patients is disturbing,says Dr Amrish Mithal,chairman of the department of endocrinology and diabetes at Medanta &#8211; the Medicity. This class of drugs has changed diabetes management. That there is a mild risk of pancreatitis is well known and we take precautions while prescribing even though it has never been proved in large clinical trials. The reports of pancreatic cancer are disturbing and even more so are the claims made in the article that companies may be hiding data, he said. </p>
<p>Dr Anoop Misra chairman,department of diabetes and metabolic diseases,Fortis Hospitals,however,points out that all the quoted data is in animals and nothing has been proven yet. </p>
<p>In an e-mailed response,Merck,which markets sitagliptin in India as Januvia,said: Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our medicines and the people who take them&#8230; The weight of all available evidence supports the current safety profile of sitagliptin,and we find no compelling evidence of a causal relationship between sitagliptin and pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1128957&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Tobacco ads were the strongest influence when a range of influences for taking up smoking was factored in.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1128659&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every 10 tobacco ad sightings may increase teens&#8217; risk of starting to smoke by almost 40 per cent and their chances of daily smoking by 30 per cent,a new study has warned. The researchers based their findings on over 1,300 ten- to 15-year-old non-smokers whose exposure to tobacco advertising and subsequent behaviour were monitored over a period of 2.5 years.</p>
<p>In 2008,the children,who were pupils at 21 public schools in three different regions of Germany,were asked how often they had seen particular ads. These included images for six of the most popular cigarette brands in Germany and eight other products,such as chocolate,clothes,mobile phones,and cars.</p>
<p>In 2011,30 months later,they were asked the same question,as well as how many cigarettes they had smoked to date,and whether they smoked regularly. One in three (406) admitted to having tried smoking during the 30 month period,with one in 10 (138) saying that they had smoked within the preceding month. One in 20 (66) kids said they had smoked more than 100 cigarettes,and were therefore classified as &#8220;established&#8221; smokers,while a similar proportion (58) said they now smoked every day. A third of the daily smokers were aged 14 or younger; one in four was 16 or older.</p>
<p>Exposure to cigarettes ads was much lower than that for the other non-tobacco products,but an ad for one particular cigarette brand was seen by almost half the kids at least once,and more than 10 times by 13 per cent of the sample.</p>
<p>When a range of well known influences for taking up smoking was factored in,smoking among peers proved the strongest influence,followed closely by exposure to tobacco ads.</p>
<p>The greater the exposure to tobacco ads,the greater was the likelihood that the teen would take up smoking,the analysis showed. Teens who saw the most tobacco ads (11 to 55) were around twice as likely to become established smokers and daily smokers as those who saw the least (0 to 2.5).</p>
<p>Moreover,for each additional 10 sightings of a tobacco ad,a teen was 38 per cent more likely to become an established smoker,and 30 per cent more likely to smoke every day compared with sightings for non-tobacco product ads. After taking account of other influential factors,the overall risk of becoming an established smoker was between 3 per cent and 7.3 per cent greater,while that of taking up daily smoking was between 3 per cent and 6.4 per cent greater,depending on how many ads the teen had seen.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the data from their study support the content-specific association between tobacco advertising and smoking behaviour and,therefore,the total ban on tobacco advertising advocated by the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1128659&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Infants as young as ten months old express sympathy for others in distress in non-verbal ways,according to a new research Infants at this age are known to assign goals and intentions to geometric figures; hence the researchers used a series of animated sequences to test infants&#8217; responses to aggression.</p>
<p>In their experiments,researchers showed infants an aggressive &#8216;social interaction&#8217; between a blue ball that attacked and violently crushed a yellow cube and found that the babies preferentially reached for the victim rather than the aggressor.</p>
<p>Infants&#8217; behaviour remained consistent when the roles of the shapes were reversed and when a neutral,non-aggressive shape was introduced in the video,suggesting that their preference for the victim was not out of fear of the aggressive shape,according to Yasuhiro Kanakogi and colleagues from Kyoto University and Toyohashi University of Technology,Japan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten-month olds not only evaluate the roles of victims and aggressors in interactions but also show rudimentary sympathy toward others in distress based on that evaluation,&#8221; the authors said. &#8220;This simple preference may function as a foundation for full-fledged sympathetic behaviour later on,&#8221; they added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1128630&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cocoa,commonly consumed in chocolate,can help obese people better control inflammation-related diseases,such as diabetes,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>Penn State University researchers found mice that were fed cocoa with a high-fat diet experienced less obesity-related inflammation than mice fed the same high-fat diet without the supplement.</p>
<p>The mice ate the human equivalent of 10 tablespoons of cocoa powder &#8211; about four or five cups of hot cocoa during a 10-week period.</p>
<p>&#8220;What surprised me was the magnitude of the effect. There wasn&#8217;t as big of an effect on the body weight as we expected,but I was surprised at the dramatic reduction of inflammation and fatty liver disease,&#8221; said Joshua Lambert,associate professor of food science.</p>
<p>Researchers reported that several indicators of inflammation and diabetes in the mice that were fed the cocoa supplement were much lower than the mice that were fed the high-fat diet without the cocoa powder and almost identical to the ones found that were fed a low-fat diet in the control group.</p>
<p>For example,they had about 27 per cent lower plasma insulin levels than the mice that were not fed cocoa. High levels of insulin can signal that a patient has diabetes.</p>
<p>The cocoa powder supplement also reduced the levels of liver triglycerides in mice by a little more than 32 per cent,according to Lambert,who worked with Yeyi Gu,graduate student in food science,and Shan Yu,a graduate student in physiology.</p>
<p>Elevated triglyceride levels are a sign of fatty liver disease and are related to inflammation and diabetes.</p>
<p>The mice also saw a slight but significant drop in the rate of body weight gain,according to the researchers,who reported their findings in the European Journal of Nutrition.</p>
<p>While researchers have linked obesity-related chronic inflammation to several diseases,including type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease,the reason for the inflammation response is not completely known.</p>
<p>Lambert said two theories on inflammation and obesity that have emerged may help explain cocoa&#8217;s role in mitigating inflammation.</p>
<p>In one theory,Lambert said excess fat may activate a distress signal that causes immune cells to become activated and cause inflammation. The cocoa may reduce the precursors that act as a distress signal to initiate this inflammatory response.</p>
<p>Lambert said that another theory is that excess fat in the diet interferes with the body&#8217;s ability to keep a bacterial component called endotoxin from entering the bloodstream through gaps between cells in the digestive system gut barrier function &#8211; and alerting an immune response. The cocoa in this case may help improve gut barrier function. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1128624&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dads-to-be,please note! Stress felt by the father whether as a preadolescent or adult  leaves a lasting impression on his sperm that can affect his offspring&#8217;s brain development,a new study has found.</p>
<p>The findings by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania,point to a never-before-seen epigenetic link to stress-related diseases such as anxiety and depression passed from father to child.</p>
<p>While environmental challenges,like diet,drug abuse,and chronic stress,felt by mothers during pregnancy have been shown to affect offspring neurodevelopment and increase the risk for certain diseases,dad&#8217;s influence on his children are less well understood.</p>
<p>The team of researchers led by Tracy L Bale,associate professor of neuroscience in the Perelman School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry and the School of Veterinary Medicine Department of Animal Biology have shown that stress on preadolescent and adult male mice induced an epigenetic mark in their sperm that reprogrammed their offspring&#8217;s hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis,a region of the brain that governs responses to stress.</p>
<p>Surprisingly,both male and female offspring had abnormally low reactivity to stress.</p>
<p>This stress pathway dysregulation when reactivity is either heightened or reduced &#8211; is a sign that an organism doesn&#8217;t have the ability to respond appropriately to a changing environment.</p>
<p>And as a result,their stress response becomes irregular,which can lead to stress-related disorders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t matter if dads were going through puberty or in adulthood when stressed before they mated. We&#8217;ve shown here for the first time that stress can produce long-term changes to sperm that reprogramme the offspring HPA stress axis regulation,&#8221; said Bale.</p>
<p>&#8220;These findings suggest one way in which paternal-stress exposure may be linked to such neuropsychiatric diseases,&#8221; Bale said.</p>
<p>In the study,male mice were exposed to six weeks of chronic stress,before breeding,either throughout puberty or only in adulthood.</p>
<p>Researchers found that offspring from paternal stress groups displayed significantly blunted levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in humans,it is cortisol in</p>
<p>response to stress.</p>
<p>The authors pointed out that a reduced physiological stress response may reflect some adaptive evolutionary benefit passed on to offspring to ensure survival in what is expected to be a more stressful environment. The findings were published in the Journal of Neuroscience. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1128619&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain will start regulating electronic cigarettes and other products containing nicotine as medicines,according to the country&#8217;s top regulator.</p>
<p>E-cigarettes are battery-operated products that turn nicotine into a vapor inhaled by the user.</p>
<p>The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said in a statement Wednesday it would treat e-cigarettes as medicines,&#8221;so that people using these products have the confidence they are safe,are of the right quality and work.&#8221;</p>
<p>E-cigarettes and other nicotine products will be licensed in the U.K. from 2016,giving manufacturers time to ensure their products comply with all standards for medicines. The U.K. regulator says e-cigarettes aren&#8217;t recommended for use until then,but it won&#8217;t ban them entirely.</p>
<p>&#8220;While it&#8217;s best to quit completely,I realize that not every smoker can and it is much better to get nicotine from safer sources such as nicotine replacement therapy,&#8221; Britain&#8217;s chief medical officer,Sally Davies,said in a statement. &#8220;It&#8217;s only right (e-cigarettes) are properly regulated to be safe and work effectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cigarettes are exempt from the regulation.</p>
<p>Last week,Britain&#8217;s independent health watchdog said smokers unable to go cold turkey should be encouraged to use nicotine products like gum and patches to help them cut down. It hadn&#8217;t recommended e-cigarettes,because they weren&#8217;t yet regulated. Experts say smokers are at risk from the toxins and tar in cigarettes,not the nicotine.</p>
<p>Smoking is the biggest cause of preventable deaths in England,killing about 80,000 people every year. Once e-cigarettes and other nicotine products are licensed by the U.K. regulator,they will be available for sale as over-the-counter medicines. Britain said it will now push for European law to recognize nicotine products as medicines.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers said they were concerned about the new classification. Damien Scott,commercial manager of e-cigarette maker SKYCIG,said the products have been self-regulated to ensure they meet consumer standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;Medical regulation,which could restrict access to these lifestyle products,is entirely unjustified,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the U.S.,the Food and Drug Administration announced in 2011 that it would regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products and won&#8217;t try to regulate them under stricter rules for medical drug-delivery devices following a legal battle.</p>
<p>The FDA,however,plans to assert regulatory authority over the fast-growing category in the near future.</p>
<p>E-cigarettes could also still be regulated as drugs or drug-delivery devices,if they are &#8220;marketed for therapeutic purposes&#8221; &#8211; for example,as a stop-smoking aid.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1128555&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Obese or overweight mothers are more likely to give birth prematurely,a new study has warned. Swedish researchers found the risk of preterm delivery increases with maternal overweight and obesity.</p>
<p>Women with the highest Body Mass Index (BMI) also had the highest statistical risk of giving preterm birth  and especially extremely preterm birth,the study found.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the individual woman who is overweight or obese,the risk of an extremely preterm delivery is still small,&#8221; said Dr Sven Cnattingius,Professor at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden,who led the study.</p>
<p>&#8220;However,these findings are important from a population perspective. Preterm infants and,above all,extremely preterm infants account for a substantial fraction of infant mortality and morbidity in high income countries,&#8221; Cnattingius said.</p>
<p>Cnattingius and colleagues at Karolinska Institutet and the University of Michigan,US,used information from 1.5 million singleton deliveries included in the population-based Swedish Medical Birth Register from 1992 through 2010.</p>
<p>Information about maternal weight at first visit to prenatal care and height was used to calculate women&#8217;s BMI,defined as weight in kilogrammes divided by height in square metres.</p>
<p>BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 was assessed as normal,25 to 29.9 as overweight,and a BMI of 30 or more as obesity. Among young Swedish women of normal length (167 cm),a weight from 70 to 83 kilogrammes is considered overweight and more than 83 kilogrammes is considered obesity. Compared to women of normal weight,overweight women had a 25 per cent increased risk of extremely preterm delivery.</p>
<p>Women with mild obesity had a 60 per cent increased risk of giving birth extremely preterm. For women with severe obesity (BMI 35-39.9) or extreme obesity (BMI 40 or more) the corresponding risk was doubled and tripled,respectively. Risks of very and moderately preterm deliveries also increased with BMI. &#8220;34 per cent of all pregnant women in Sweden are either overweight or obese,and this impacts the number of preterm born infants,&#8221; said Cnattingius. &#8220;Overweight and obesity also increase the risk of maternal pregnancy complications,including preeclampsia,gestational diabetes,and Cesarean delivery,&#8221; Cnattingius said.</p>
<p>The researchers hypothesise that the increased inflammatory state in obese women may make them more susceptible to infections,which may increase their risk of spontaneous extremely preterm delivery. The study was published in Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1128171&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Providing universal HIV testing for India&#8217;s billion-plus population every five years can save millions of lives and prove to be a cost-effective approach to managing the epidemic,scientists,including Indian researchers,claim in a new study.</p>
<p>It would meet international standards of cost-effectiveness  and save millions of lives for decades to test every person in the huge population of India every five years,according to the study. The findings are based on a careful analysis of India&#8217;s Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic using the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) International model,a sophisticated statistical tool that has already been used in HIV policy making in France,South Africa,</p>
<p>and other countries.</p>
<p>A team of researchers at Brown,Yale,Massachusetts General Hospital,Harvard,and in Chennai,India,integrated scores of factors specific to the country to find that testing for the whole country,with greater frequency for high-risk groups and areas,would pay off despite India&#8217;s huge population of 1.21 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Testing even 800 million adults is a public health undertaking of a historic magnitude,&#8221; said study co-lead author Dr Kartik Venkatesh,a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University and Women &amp; Infants Hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what we were able to show is that even if you increase the cost of HIV treatment and care pretty significantly and really decrease the number of individuals who would link to care,even under those dire circumstances,testing this frequently and this widely still was reasonable,&#8221; Venkatesh said. Co-author Dr Soumya Swaminathan,director of the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis in Chennai,India,said the projections of the model will help the country in its battle with the epidemic,one of the world&#8217;s largest.</p>
<p>&#8220;As India moves ahead in its HIV prevention activities and aims for zero new infections,expanding testing will be a key priority and this analysis should help policymakers make the best decisions,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>After extensive research to determine the best possible data for the country,researchers coded several other parameters into the model including what percentage of people would refuse the test (18 per cent),how many patients who test positive would get care (50 per cent),the prevalence of HIV in the population (0.29 per cent) etc. </p>
<p>As they ran the numbers to determine the costs and effects on patients of broader and more frequent testing,they compared the results to what would happen under the status quo,in which there is less-than-universal testing.</p>
<p>They found that testing the population every five years would be &#8216;cost-effective&#8217; with a price of USD 1,900 per year of life saved (YLS) in general,and USD 1,300 per YLS among  high-risk groups. The study was published in the journal PLoS One.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1127691&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Men with prostate cancer may significantly improve their survival chances by adding healthy vegetable fats to their diet,a new study has claimed.</p>
<p>By substituting healthy vegetable fats &#8211; such as olive and canola oils,nuts,seeds and avocados &#8211; for animal fats and carbohydrates,men with the disease had a markedly lower risk of developing lethal prostate cancer and dying from other causes,according to the study led by University of California,San Francisco. The research,involving nearly 4,600 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer,could help with the development of dietary guidelines for men with the disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Consumption of healthy oils and nuts increases plasma antioxidants and reduces insulin and inflammation,which may deter prostate cancer progression,&#8221; said lead author Erin L Richman,a post-doctoral scholar in the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. &#8220;The beneficial effects of unsaturated fats and harmful effects of saturated and trans fats on cardiovascular health are well known,&#8221; Richman said. &#8220;Now our research has shown additional potential benefits of consuming unsaturated fats among men with prostate cancer,&#8221; Richman said.</p>
<p>The study analysed intake of saturated,monounsaturated,polyunsaturated and trans fats as well as fats from animal and vegetable sources.</p>
<p>The data were derived from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study,which began in 1986. The fat intake study involved 4,577 men who had been diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer between 1986 and 2010. During the study timeframe,1,064 men died,primarily from cardiovascular disease (31 per cent),prostate cancer (21 per cent) and other cancers (nearly 21 per cent). The authors uncovered a striking benefit: Men who replaced 10 per cent of their total daily calories from carbohydrates</p>
<p>with healthy vegetable fats had a 29 per cent lower risk of developing lethal prostate cancer and a 26 per cent lower risk of dying from all causes.</p>
<p>Adding a single serving of oil-based dressing a day (one tablespoon) was associated with a 29 per cent lower risk of lethal prostate cancer and a 13 per cent lower risk of death,the authors found.</p>
<p>And adding one serving of nuts a day (28 g) was associated with an 18 per cent lower risk of lethal prostate cancer and an 11 per cent lower risk of death. &#8220;Overall,our findings support counselling men with prostate cancer to follow a heart-healthy diet in which carbohydrate calories are replaced with unsaturated oils and nuts to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality,&#8221; said Richman.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1127665&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have discovered how a liver enzyme protects cells from damage caused by jaundice,a find that may lead to development of new treatments for the condition. University of Guelph researchers in Canada believe the discovery may ultimately lead to an alternative treatment for jaundice,such as a new drug or supplement.</p>
<p>Almost two out of three newborns contract jaundice,with its telltale skin yellowing. Normal treatment involves use of ultraviolet light but it doesn&#8217;t always work. Although the condition is usually benign,severe cases can cause permanent brain damage and lead to cerebral palsy and hearing loss.</p>
<p>Jaundice can also affect people with liver disease or increased breakdown of red blood cells,as in malaria. In all cases,a substance called bilirubin collects in the blood. High amounts can be toxic and can cause permanent brain damage,said Gordon Kirby,co-author of the study.</p>
<p>Previous research had found a naturally occurring enzyme that breaks down bilirubin. Called cytochrome P450 2A5,the enzyme is known to increase in people with liver ailments. The Guelph team has shown that more bilirubin in the blood activates the gene to make this enzyme. The enzyme helps remove bilirubin and prevents liver cells from dying,said Kirby. The researchers used cultured liver cells from mice for their study.</p>
<p>Scientists need to determine safe and effective levels of the enzyme before developing any treatment,said Kirby. &#8220;We need to fine-tune our ability to manipulate this enzyme and fully understand its role in bilirubin removal,&#8221; he said. The study was published in the journal Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1127284&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Atomic medicine has &#8220;fantastic potential&#8221; for fighting deadly,difficult to treat cancers,the head of French nuclear giant Areva&#8217;s medical said. &#8220;We are interested in tumours against which the current therapeutic arsenal is very limited  like ovarian,gastric and pancreatic cancers  where the needs are huge and patients are waiting,&#8221; explained Areva Med chief Patrick Bourdet. </p>
<p>Based in a Maryland suburb of the US capital,not far from the National Institutes of Health,Areva Med is pitting its hopes on a rare radioactive isotope that may be capable of selectively annihilating cancer cells. This new weapon against these aggressive cancers is a variety of lead: the isotope Pb 212. It is extremely rare,extracted from an equally rare metal called thorium.</p>
<p>Only the few major nuclear powers have stocks of the radioactive metal  France,being one of them,with a considerable cache,Bourdet said.  France&#8217;s stock can be traced back half a decade to its nuclear subsidiary. At that time,the Commissary of Atomic Energy,or CEA,a government-funded research group,decided to hold on to thorium after it extracted uranium  which has become the principal material used in nuclear power plants. </p>
<p>In 2003,researchers had the idea of extracting the isotope Pb 212 from the thorium,with Areva&#8217;s scientists among them,looking in part for possible applications against cancer.  Convinced of the great medical potential of this isotope,Areva created its medical affiliate in 2009 in the United States,which,since then,hasn&#8217;t stopped growing.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1127279&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
