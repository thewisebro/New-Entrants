<p dir="ltr">The shameful violent clashes between AAP and BJP workers on the very day that the election dates were announced proved that cricket might be a gentleman’s game, but politics definitely is not.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002791" alt="1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=533" width="480" height="533" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">In fact, so overblown and violent were the visuals that came out of the incidents, that we think their talents are best used in a different place, a more noble land &#8211; where violence is always staged, and good always triumphs over evil.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002792" alt="2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=487" width="480" height="487" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are a few pictures showing why those BJP and AAP workers could possibly follow the Great Khali into superstardom in the WWE.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sushma.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002774" alt="sushma" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sushma.jpg" /></a> Swaraj tweeted, “I am opposed to the BSR alliance or merger with BJP in Karnataka. I have conveyed to Shri Raj Nath Singhji in writing that BJP must not permit this.” (AP)
<p>Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj on Thursday objected publicly to the planned merger of B. Sriramulu’s BSR Congress with the BJP in Karnataka, and Haryana’s rebel Congress MLA Venod Sharma’s attempt to enter the NDA through the Haryana Janhit Congress.</p>
<p>Sriramulu, a close associate of jailed mining baron Janardhana Reddy, on Wednesday announced plans to merge his BSR Congress with the BJP.</p>
<p>A day later, Swaraj tweeted, “I am opposed to the BSR alliance or merger with BJP in Karnataka. I have conveyed to Shri Raj Nath Singhji in writing that BJP must not permit this.” The BJP has not officially confirmed the merger, but Sriramulu was learnt to have got the green signal from the party. Following Swaraj’s tweets, however, spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi declined to comment on the matter on Thursday.</p>
<p>On the entry of Haryana MLA Venod Sharma into Kuldeep Bishnoi’s HJC, Swaraj tweeted, “I am strongly opposed to this. I have conveyed my views to Shri Kuldeep Bishnoi,” leading to the cancellation of Sharma’s induction into the party on Thursday.<br />
Sharma is considered a close associate of Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The HJC, which was expected to field Sharma from Karnal, is a BJP ally.</p>
<p>Swaraj was learnt to have objected to Sriramulu’s return when it was first proposed after former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa came back to the BJP in January. Senior Karnataka BJP leaders accompanied by Yeddyurappa met Rajnath Singh in early February to ask him to let Sriramulu’s BSR Congress into the BJP. But Rajnath, who knew of Swaraj’s objections, gave them no assurance.</p>
<p>Party sources indicated that Narendra Modi, who addressed a rally with Yeddyurappa last month, was keen to get Sriramulu back to bolster prospects in Karnataka. Yeddyurappa, the sources said, had also lobbied with Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley to get Swaraj to soften her line on Sriramulu.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002772&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lieutenant Governor of Delhi Najeeb Jung on Thursday met Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde to discuss the clashes between activists of Aam Aadmi Party and BJP following brief detention of Arvind Kejriwal in Gujarat.</p>
<p>Sources said Jung, who supervises Delhi Police, briefed about yesterday&#8217;s clashes that took place after AAP members staged a protest outside BJP headquarters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though the meeting was not exclusively about yesterday&#8217;s incident outside the BJP HQs, the issue did figure in the discussion,&#8221; a source said. The LG and Home Minister are believed to have expressed concern over the street violence during the electoral process as it can have dangerous repercussions if it escalates.</p>
<p>They are said to be have been worried as such clashes may lead to serious injury to political workers as well as passersby. Following the imposition of President&#8217;s rule, the LG is overall in-charge of the Delhi administration, besides Delhi Police.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002764&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI photo)
<p>The Election Commission on Thursday said prima facie Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal violated the Model Code of Conduct by not seeking police permission before holding his road show in Gujarat on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Election Commissioner H.S Brahma said strictly going by the law, Kejriwal &#8220;violated&#8221; the Model Code.</p>
<p>He said the whole country knew that the election schedule has been announced on Wednesday morning and the Model Code was enforced.</p>
<p>He said according to the Deputy Commissioner&#8217;s report, police had stopped him to find out whether he has taken permission before holding his road show.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was not detained. Since election dates were announced, we just wanted to make sure that he followed the Model Code of Conduct and took due permission. Thus, we took him to police station to brief him about the same,&#8221; Superintendent of Police, Patan, Parikshita Rathod had said.</p>
<p>News of Kejriwal&#8217;s detention led to clashes between AAP and Bharatiya Janata Party workers in New Delhi, Lucknow and Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>Kejriwal&#8217;s car was attacked in Kharohi village of Gujarat and its windshield was damaged, which resulted in a scuffle between BJP workers and those in Kejriwal&#8217;s convoy.</p>
<p>Brahma said the EC would ensure that such incidents don&#8217;t recur. &#8221;We will implement the law strictly. We appeal to political parties not to use harsh language and action,&#8221; the EC said.</p>
<p>Brahma yesterday urged campaigners of political parties and other leaders to refrain from making personal comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would appeal to all the political parties, their star campaigners and other leaders that they should not use words which will hurt somebody. They should avoid using such comments,&#8221; Brahma had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002759&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;Bahuguna government was no doubt a failure but Harish Rawat government is a bigger failure. All the new man in command is doing is visiting areas hit by calamity and laying foundation stones of projects. No development is visible on the ground,&#8221; Pradesh BJP president Tirath Singh Rawat told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laying foundation stones would not heal the wounds of people of Uttarakhand who are looking for concrete measures to rebuild their shattered lives,&#8221; the BJP leader said.</p>
<p>It is nine months since unprecedented flashfloods wreaked havoc on the people of the state but still a large number of people are living under makeshift tents in biting cold, he alleged.</p>
<p>He also accused the state government of having the panchayat polls deferred by the Supreme Court as &#8220;it did not have the guts to face the electorate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charging the state government with being &#8220;steeped in corruption&#8221;, the BJP leader alleged large scale exchange of money in the appointment of teachers in the state recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rs eight to 14 lakh were taken as bribe in the recent appointment of teachers,&#8221; Rawat said, adding when 86 such cases came to the notice of Pauri district magistrate, he ordered cancellation of the appointments.</p>
<p>However, when the matter came to the notice of the state education minister he spoke to the Garhwal Commissioner and asked him to order reappointment of teachers whose appointment had been cancelled by the Pauri DM.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the matter now hangs in the balance as an RTI activist has sought information from the education department on the issue,&#8221; he said. Claiming that BJP will sweep all the five Lok Sabha seats in the state, he said the ruling Congress will have to pay a heavy price for its misrule at the hustings.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002750&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The sessions court conducting the Shakti Mills photojournalist gangrape case trial, completed recording statements of the accused on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Shakti Mills case pertains to the alleged gangrape of a 22-year-old magazine photojournalist who had gone out on an official assignment with her male colleague, to the deserted Shakti Mills compound in Central Mumbai, on August 22 last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court has completed recording statements of the four accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC),&#8221; special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam told PTI. Under Section 313 of the CrPC, the accused is given a chance to explain the circumstances and allegations against them, through their statements.</p>
<p>The accused, namely Vijay Jadhav, Kasim Bengali, Salim Ansari and Siraj Rehman as well as a minor boy, were charged with rape, conspiracy, common intention, unnatural sex and other sections under the Information Technology Act. On September 19, 2013, the Mumbai police crime branch had filed a 600-page chargesheet against the four accused.</p>
<p>Allegedly, the five accused, (including a juvenile, whose case has been separated) gangraped her at the abandoned Shakti Mills compound, after assaulting her male colleague. Defence advocate Prakash Salsingikar said that the court had asked about 970 questions to the accused.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nikam began his final arguments in the related Shakti Mills telephone operator gangrape case and it will continue tomorrow. This case is of an 18-year-old telephone operator also allegedly gangraped by five accused (including three of those who were charged for raping the photojournalist).</p>
<p>On July 31 last year, the police had arrested Mohammed Ashfaq Sheikh, Mohammed Kasim Hafiz Sheikh alias Kasim Bengali, Salim Ansari, Vijay Jadhav and a minor for the alleged gangrape of the telephone operator.</p>
<p>The police had filed a 362-page chargesheet on October 8 last year, against the four accused, in connection with the telephone operator&#8217;s gangrape case. Later on, the minor&#8217;s case was separated.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002747&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Delhi court today dismissed the bail plea of a suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba operative who was arrested from Haryana&#8217;s Mewat region in December last year and directed police to conclude its investigation in the case by March 26.</p>
<p>Additional Sessions Judge Daya Prakash rejected the bail plea of Shahid, saying the provision of statutory bail lies only after expiry of 180 days, after the arrest, during which the prosecution has to file the charge sheet. Meanwhile the court allowed the police plea for more time to conclude its investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen the application (of police) as well as considered the arguments advanced and my inference is that let the application be allowed. Investigating agency is granted further 20 days time to conclude the investigation with effect from March 7 to March 26. &#8220;Under section 167 (2) CrPC, the period of 90 days has been extended to 180 days. The statutory bail lies only on 180 days or after,&#8221; the court said, adding that the bail plea is dismissed.</p>
<p>Delhi Police special cell had arrested Rashid and Shahid, alleged LeT members in December last year and had claimed that they had met two persons in UP&#8217;s Muzaffarnagar region after the riots. The court gave its order while hearing the two different pleas moved by Delhi Police and Shahid, who sought reliefs. Delhi Police in its application has requested more time to conclude its probe in the case saying some more accused are to be arrested as they are still absconding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Accused Rashid and wanted Abdul Subhan (presently lodged in Kolkata jail to execute some terrorist action in India and investigation of which is still pending) were in touch with LeT terrorist Javed Baluchi, based in Pakistan through mobile numbers,&#8221; police said, while seeking more time to conclude the probe in the matter.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002749&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mulayamm4.jpg" /></a> Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav at the swearing-in function of Governor B L Joshi shot back at the reporters over the issue of doctor&#8217;s strike in UP.
<p>Apparently upset with the media coverage of the strike of junior doctors in Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav today snapped at journalists when questioned about deaths due to the agitation, asking them &#8220;Has someone in your family died&#8221;?</p>
<p>After the swearing-in function of Governor B L Joshi here, when asked by reporters about the number of deaths due to strike of junior doctors, Yadav shot back, &#8220;Kaun mara hai&#8230; apke pariwar me koi mara hai (Who has died? Has someone in your family died?)&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aap doctors ki hadtal ko mahatva de rahe hain, doctors ko hadtal nahi karni chahiye thi (You are giving so much importance to the strike, the doctors should not have gone on the strike),&#8221; he added. Blaming the media for the way it has covered the strike, the Samajwadi Party supremo said, &#8220;If you report properly then strikes will end. Why hype the doctors&#8217; strike so much?&#8221;</p>
<p>The agitating junior doctors in Uttar Pradesh called off their strike after Uttar Pradesh government today transferred SSP Kanpur Yashaswi Yadav and constituted a one-member inquiry commission to probe incidents at the GSVM medical college Kanpur on February 28.</p>
<p>The seven-day strike adversely impacted medical services in several parts of the state. The strike was taken up after medicos at GSV Medical College were allegedly beaten up by Kanpur police and supporters of SP MLA Irfan Solanki following an altercation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002736&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad on Thursday decided to field his wife Rabri Devi and eldest daughter Misa Bharti from Saran and Pataliputra Lok Sabha seats respectively.</p>
<p>In the first list of 25 candidates released today, Rabri Devi, a former chief minister, seeks to retain her husband&#8217;s bastion in Saran which he had to vacate after being convicted in the fodder scam last year.</p>
<p>The surprise element in the list was, however, Misa Bharti.</p>
<p>Though her candidature has come as a major surprise to one and all within the RJD and outside, Prasad said the decision was taken on popular demand from his supporters and the voters of that constituency.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Maine parivar ko ticket dene ka dushsahas kiya hai</em> (I have dared to give tickets to my family members),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To woo his traditional support base of Yadavs and Muslims, Prasad has given tickets to eight candidates from his caste and six from the minority community.</p>
<p>According to sources, a few party leaders expressed resentment over the choice of candidates. Senior leaders Gulam Gaus and Ramkripal Yadav might leave the party.</p>
<p>From Madhubani parliamentary seat, which was a bone of contention between RJD and Congress till inking of seat-sharing agreement on Wednesday, Prasad has fielded the party&#8217;s prominent Muslim face Abdul Bari Siddique, who is the leader of the RJD legislature party in the assembly.</p>
<p>Journalist Pragati Mehta, a political greenhorn, will contest from Munger while former minister in the Nitish Kumar government Bhagwan Singh Kushwaha from Arrah Lok Sabha seat.</p>
<p>Kushwaha, a senior JD(U) leader, joined the RJD this evening only.</p>
<p>Former union ministers A.A Fatmi and Mohammed Taslimuddin will contest from Darbhanga and Araria respectively.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002735&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alvi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002729" alt="alvi" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alvi.jpg" /></a> &#8220;To award reservation to a particular community after massive riots in Muzaffarnagar has given a wrong signal to the people at large and Muslim community in particular,&#8221; Rashid Alvi. (PTI photo)
<p>Congress leader Rashid Alvi on Thursday struck a discordant note on Jat reservation issue, saying it sent a &#8220;wrong signal&#8221; to the Muslim community after the Muzaffarnagar riots but the party disagreed noting an entire community cannot be blamed for the acts of few rioters.</p>
<p>&#8220;To award reservation to a particular community after massive riots in Muzaffarnagar has given a wrong signal to the people at large and Muslim community in particular,&#8221; Rashid Alvi, a former spokesperson said in a letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi.</p>
<p>At the AICC briefing, party spokesperson Shashi Tharoor, however, vehemently disagreed with the contention.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not believe that crimes are committed by an entire community or caste. I do not think you can ascribe such conduct to an entire community.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot blame all Jats and all Hindus for what happened in Muzaffarnagar as we do not blame all Gujaratis for 2002 riots,&#8221; Tharoor told reporters.</p>
<p>Alvi, who hails from Uttar Pradesh, however, noted in his letter to Gandhi that Muslims see Jats as &#8220;perpetrators&#8221; of violence in Muzaffarnagar.</p>
<p>Alvi said that the Muslims have not only lost their family members but also their livelihood and land. He recalled that more than 50,000 have been forced to live in camps after the riots.</p>
<p>&#8220;UP is a highly polarised polity at this juncture. The decision to award reservation to Jats not only hurts the sentiments of the Muslims but also other backward castes,&#8221; he claimed. He, however, made it clear that he was not opposed to reservation for any community per se.</p>
<p>He also faulted the party over the failure to turn the Prevention of Communal Violence Bill into an Act. &#8220;Passage of the bill would have showcased our commitment to our core values,&#8221; he said, adding that Congress has had a long standing commitment towards secular values.</p>
<p>At the outset, he told Gandhi that some of the steps taken by the government recently are &#8220;detrimental&#8221; to the interests of the party when the Lok Sabha polls are just a month away.</p>
<p>Alvi, who was the lone leader dropped last year as party spokesman, also expressed apprehensions that some of the party leaders were &#8220;working overtime&#8221; to weaken the party and strengthen the communal forces.</p>
<p>Union Cabinet had on Monday given its nod for inclusion of Jat community in the central list of OBCs in nine states including UP, a decision that is expected to benefit about nine crore people from the community.</p>
<p>Alvi failed to get a Rajya Sabha renomination and he was also dropped as party spokesperson last year. Before joining Congress in April 2004, Alvi was with BSP from which he was expelled after he had accused party president Mayawati of working under BJP pressure and taking bribes for allotting party tickets.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002726&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kejriwal-llll.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001329" alt="Kejriwal is doing a job that media should also be doing, said Shashi Tharoor." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kejriwal-llll.jpg" /></a> Kejriwal is doing a job that media should also be doing, said Shashi Tharoor.
<p>Congress on Thursday hailed AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal&#8217;s tour of Gujarat contending that there is another voice in the country exposing the &#8220;deficiencies&#8221; and development &#8220;myth&#8221; of Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>&#8220;If AAP, a voice other than Congress has been showing the deficiencies of Gujarat, exposing hype and myth of Gujarat. We welcome that Kejriwal is going to villages of Gujarat&#8230;. Kejriwal is doing a job that media should also be doing. If Kejriwal is going there and finding out the truth of Modi&#8217;s&#8217; claims, we completely welcome that,&#8221; party spokesperson Shashi Tharoor told reporters at the AICC meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;If Kejriwal&#8217;s antics have helped draw the attention, we welcome it. We welcome Indians being well-informed before casting their votes. We want the Indian voter to be aware of the reality,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The party, however, condemned the clashes between BJP and AAP workers on Wednesday saying it is a case of &#8220;politics of violence&#8221; countering the &#8220;forces of anarchy&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a revelation to the nation about the kind of alternative politics that is being talked about,&#8221; the Union Minister said.</p>
<p>AAP workers had fought pitched battles with BJP activists outside the saffron party headquarters in Delhi and Lucknow hours after party leader Arvind Kejriwal was detained briefly in Gujarat.</p>
<p>Kejriwal, who set out on a four-day tour of Gujarat on Wednesday, alleged there is no evidence of &#8220;development&#8221; in the state as claimed by its Chief Minister and BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate, Modi, and people there are unhappy. Tharoor seconded Kejriwal&#8217;s claims saying the situation in Gujarat is &#8220;utterly condemnable&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002721&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Thursday tried influencing youngsters to wipe out of Congress in the Loksabha polls and make SP led third front government at the Centre, in his addressal on culmination of party&#8217;s Cycle rally in New Delhi.</p>
<p>&#8220;When in leadership of Lok Nayak Jaiprakash youth rose in 1974, it wiped out Congress in 1977. You all have to repeat the history and make a third front government led by SP at the centre&#8221;, Yadav said while addressing a programme organised on the culmination of party&#8217;s Cycle rally, which started from New Delhi on February 23.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the best opportunity for SP as the public is with us. If we failed at this moment, you have to repent. If party leaders and workers got united, SP will get good number of seats&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p>Attacking BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, he said that &#8220;some liars&#8221; have arrived here and making false claims of development.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has he (Modi) done in Gujarat, where 89 per cent women and 90 per cent men are working as labourers&#8230;SP doeswhat it used to promise&#8221;, Yadav claimed.</p>
<p>SP state president and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav said that a number of forces were trying to stop SP from getting good seats from here but youths would give them befitting reply in elections.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002707&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/naidu-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002717" alt="Naidu said AAP was creating tension before polls in order to be amidst headlines. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/naidu-med.jpg" /></a> Naidu said AAP was creating tension before polls in order to be amidst headlines. (PTI)
<p>The BJP on Thursday said the Third Front was like a &#8220;parking lot&#8221; where parties come and go and ruled out any chance of it forming a government at the Centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a mirage for the Third Front to form government at the Centre as it had already been tried before and had ended in a failure. It was just like a &#8216;parking lot&#8217; where political parties come and go,&#8221; Senior BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu said while addressing a press conference.</p>
<p>He said the parties in Third Front have no common agenda, they have no commitment. &#8220;They will fight election against each other and later join together to block the BJP. They have no leader. Everybody wants to become prime minister,&#8221; Naidu said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, if it comes to power, will there be a rotational PM everyday in a week?&#8221; he wondered. Naidu also noted that the member-parties of the Third Front were equally responsible for the sins and corruption of the Congress-led UPA because they had been supporting parties in the alliance in both the two terms of the UPA.</p>
<p>&#8220;The parties making up the Third Front, whether its Left or the SP, they can&#8217;t absolve themselves of the sins of the UPA as they all have supported UPA I and UPA II,&#8221; he said. Naidu also attacked the AAP by terming it as the B-Team of the Congress. &#8220;AAP has been discredited after it joined hands with the Congress party against whom they had taken the vow to send them to jail for corruption,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Commenting on the violence between AAP workers and BJP activists in New Delhi outside the saffron party headquarters after Arvind Kejriwal was detained briefly in Gujarat, Naidu said AAP was creating tension before polls in order to be amidst headlines.</p>
<p>Accusing the UPA of ruining and betraying the nation, Naidu said, &#8220;Congress has betrayed and ruined the nation. They have not only betrayed the people, but also made Parliament a laughing stock. They have ruined relation with neighbours and brought down the prestige of the country in world fora.&#8221;</p>
<p>He claimed that not the Third Front or Congress, but only BJP and Narendra Modi could provide an alternative to the nation.<br />
Asked if BJP has lost its nationalist credentials after aligning with the LJP which a few years back had tried to appease a particular community by taking a jeep ride with people dressed as Osama Bin Laden, Naidu said, &#8220;It is an old issue, we need to move forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the alliance between TMC Chief Mamata Banerjee and Gandhian activist Anna Hazare, he said it would not have any impact nationwide and noted that the JD(U), TMC, BSP and SP were all fighting for the third slot. Asked to comment on Banerjee&#8217;s claim that TMC would emerge as the single largest party after the polls, Naidu said, &#8220;TMC is claiming to be third largest party, BSP is claiming to be third largest party, SP is claiming to be third largest party, JD(U) is claiming to be third largest party. I think they all should sit together and discuss who will come third, fourth or fifth.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Narendra Modi&#8217;s rally in Kolkata where he went soft on Banerjee, Naidu said,&#8221;none should try to misinterpret Narendra Modi&#8217;s comment. We believe in the federal structure. We believe in working together with all the states. We don&#8217;t believe in threats to dismiss state governments once we come to power,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002708&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A professor of a city based deemed university set a world record on Thursday by delivering a marathon non-stop lecture for more than 130 hours at the varsity auditorium.</p>
<p>26-year-old Arvind Mishra, an assistant professor at Dehradun&#8217;s Graphic Era University where he teaches Mechanical Engineering completed 130 hours of his lecture at 4 pm this evening, surpassing the world record of non-stop lecture which stood in the name of a Polish teacher who delivered a lecture for 121 hours in 2009, HoD of the University&#8217;s Media and Mass Communications department Subhash Gupta said.</p>
<p>The young professor is still going on as he wants to increase the margin between his record and that of the Polish teacher Errol Muzawazi whose feat of 121-hour non-stop teaching still adorns the pages of Guinness Book of World Records, Gupta said.</p>
<p>A panel of the Guiness Book of World Records is also keeping an eye through live streaming on the marathon lecture being held by Mishra at the University&#8217;s MBA auditorium to a mixed audience of students and teachers.</p>
<p>The university&#8217;s chairman Kamal Ghanshala has announced a cash award of Rs 1 lakh and two out-of-turn promotions for the assistant professor for his rare feat.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002694&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Health services in the city were affected on Thursday, as doctors went on a day&#8217;s strike in protest against the assault on medical students in Kanpur.</p>
<p>OPDs were closed and only emergency services were kept open in hospitals. Demanding unconditional release of the arrested students and withdrawal of charges framed against them allegedly at the behest of an MLA, the doctors gathered at the Parade Ground in Dehradun and held a demonstration in protest against the incident terming it as &#8220;highly condemnable and shameful&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This approach by concerned authorities’ smacks of an arrogant, vindictive attitude and gross misuse of powers. This act against medical students or any human being is illegal and in contravention to human right and gross abuse of authority,&#8221;the doctors said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002688&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Election Commission has placed orders estimated at more than Rs 300 crore with Electronics Corporation of India Ltd and Bharat Electronics Ltd to deliver EVMs for the Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Election Commission needs 16 lakh EVMs for the Lok Sabha elections to be held in April and May. We placed order for 2.5 lakh controlling units and around 4 lakh ballot units with ECIL Hyderabad and BEL, Bangalore, on a 50-50 basis,&#8221; a commission official said, adding that delivery is expected to be completed by the month-end.</p>
<p>Each electronic voting machine (EVM) consists of one controlling unit and one ballot unit. Although the price is yet to be fixed by the Ministry of Finance, the orders were placed with a tentative tag of Rs 10,500 per EVM. &#8220;The price will be fixed by the Finance Ministry. The Law Ministry will have to send a request to the Finance Ministry.</p>
<p>The price the EC said was tentative,&#8221; the official said, adding that 30 per cent of the total order has already been supplied to the EC. ECIL confirmed it received orders for 1.91 lakh ballot units and 1.25 lakh controlling units and said it is fully geared up to supply them before March end.</p>
<p>The PSU has supplied 7.4 lakh EVMs to the EC since its introduction in the poll process. Announcing the Lok Sabha poll schedule on Wednesday, Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath said voters will have the option of not voting for any of the candidates. Each EVM will have a None of the Above (NOTA) button for electors to use if they don&#8217;t want to vote for any of the contestants.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002641&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Doctors across Uttar Pradesh called off their six-day strike against the attack on their colleagues in Kanpur, a day after the UP government clamped ESMA against striking medicos and the Allahabad High Court stepped in to resolve the deadlock.</p>
<p>Twenty-four junior doctors, who were arrested in connection with the clash with police and supporters of a SP MLA, have been released.</p>
<p>The six-day strike, which adversely impacted medical services in several parts of the state, was called up after medicos at GSV Medical College were allegedly beaten up by Kanpur Police and supporters of SP MLA Irfan Solanki following an altercation.</p>
<p>Amidst reports of deaths in different districts of the state due to the strike, UP government yesterday decided to invoke the Essential Services Maintenance Act.</p>
<p>The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court had yesterday directed UP government to transfer SSP, Kanpur, Yashaswi Yadav, and other officials involved in the February 28 clash, but clarified that it was only to resolve the situation and should not be taken as a &#8220;stigma&#8221; on the officials.</p>

<p>After its UK premiere at the prestigious Edinburgh Fringe Festival last year, a play based on the brutal gangrape of a para-medical student in Delhi has opened in London.</p>
<p>&#8216;Nirbhaya&#8217;, a dramatisation of the true events that took place on the night of December 16, 2012, has been created by internationally acclaimed playwright and director Yael Farber.</p>
<p>&#8220;India is where the play comes from. The revolution on the streets (following the student&#8217;s death) is exactly the spirit that the play captures. It is a protest against the conspiracy of silence,&#8221; says actress and producer Poorna Jagannathan, who had contacted Farber in the aftermath of the incident that triggered worldwide protests.</p>
<p>The play, which bagged the Amnesty International Freedom of Expression Award 2013 after its opening in Scotland, will have a short run at the Southbank Centre in London until March 12.</p>
<p>It will then travel to Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore over the coming months. Funds for the tour were crowdsourced through Kickstarter.com, and supplemented by grants from the British Council and Oxfam.</p>
<p>&#8220;With an extraordinary cast and creative team from India, Farber brings us a blistering evocation of that terrible night and the ripples of change it set in motion. Tearing away the shame that keeps the survivors silent &#8217;Nirbhaya&#8217; is a voyage into a tapestry of personal testimonies that speaks for both a nation and a world no longer able to hold the tides of change at bay,&#8221; the Southbank Centre said in a statement.</p>
<p>The work follows five women as they share their stories of sexual violence, emboldened to break their silence after the attack on Nirbhaya –- the name given to the Delhi student who eventually succumbed to her injuries in a Singapore hospital.</p>
<p>Canada-based Farber had travelled to India to create the production and conduct workshops, and is looking forward to<br />
taking the play back home.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002584&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, along with his Cabinet colleagues, on Thursday observed fast here against the Centre&#8217;s &#8220;apathy&#8221; towards rain-hit farmers in the state.</p>
<p>The four-hour fast was part of the statewide bandh call till 2 PM, given by the BJP in protest against Centre&#8217;s<br />
&#8220;indifferent&#8221; attitude towards farmers hit by unseasonal rains and hailstorm in parts of the state recently. Chouhan appealed to Centre to provide a special package of Rs 5,000 crore for Madhya Pradesh to deal with the crisis. &#8220;Our entire Cabinet would go to Delhi to apprise the Union government about the current situation,&#8221; the chief minister said in his address.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have already earmarked Rs 2000 crore for providing relief to farmers and this is just the beginning&#8230;We will take all possible measures to provide aid to affected farmers,&#8221; Chouhan said, adding that various organisations and people have donated Rs 7.42 crore for the cause of farmers during the sit-in protest held at a ground near New Market are.</p>
<p>Chouhan said even as the Centre cold-shouldered farmers, people of Madhya Pradesh stood behind them in the hour of crisis. On the occasion, he demanded to constitute a permanent National Disaster Relief Fund to deal with such crises and also appealed to people to donate generously in the Chief Minister&#8217;s disaster relief fund.</p>
<p>Chouhan also hit out at opposition Congress for describing his visit to the affected villages as &#8220;Ola paryatan&#8221; (hail tourism) and alleged that Congress leaders were insensitive towards the plight of farmers. He also asked Centre to rationalise&#8221; the current crop insurance scheme by making it more practical so that farmers get actual damage caused to their crop.</p>
<p>Chouhan also criticised Centre for not providing any relief to the loss caused to soybean crops, not purchasing gram crop on minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3100 per quintal and also not recognising Madhya Pradesh as basmati rice producing region.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002537&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI Photo)
<p>Escalating his attack against the Bharatiya Janata Party Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi over his development claims, Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal on Thrusday said he is a &#8220;vikaspurush&#8221; (development man) only for industrialists.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modi is a <em>vikaspurush</em>, but only for Adanis and Ambanis,&#8221; said Kejriwal after meeting farmers in Mundra taluka where Adani Port and Special Economic zone (SEZ) is located.</p>
<p>&#8220;Big industries in a nexus with government started acquiring lands, he alleged, while adding that &#8220;it seems that the entire land of Gujarat is on sale.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Industries have earned so much black money that they will flee to Switzerland any day,&#8221; he further alleged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through media he (Modi) conspires a propaganda of development. But have you heard voices of content here? People are only talking about their agony,&#8221; Kejriwal said.</p>
<p>The former Delhi chief minister also met Sikh farmers in Abdasa earlier and told them, &#8220;Gujarat government does not want to give Sikh farmers their land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gujarat government froze their land in 2010, they approached court and have hired big lawyers so that Sikh farmers remained deprived of their land,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Prithvi Singh, a farmers&#8217; representative, said, &#8220;We put our issue before Kejriwal regarding anti-farmers&#8217; policy of the state. He assured us that he will raise our issue, though we know model code of conduct has come into effect, anyone cannot do anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have given many representations to the state government but it didn&#8217;t help us, instead Modi is fighting till the Supreme Court,&#8221; Singh said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this political scenario, we have some hope from AAP and Kejriwal,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Kejriwal also met representatives from the fishermen community and tried to visit a hospital in Bhuj, but could not reach there due to a blockade set-up by a mob shouting pro-Modi slogans.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Kejriwal was briefly &#8220;detained&#8221; in Radhanpur and his car was damaged in an attack by alleged BJP workers in Kutch.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002532&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The enrolment column depicts &#8220;Others&#8221; for transgender category of people apart from the regular options meant for &#8216;Male&#8217; or &#8216;Female&#8217; voters. This category was introduced by EC in 2012. The poll body, which announced the election schedule yesterday with the first polling day being April 7, said the country at present has a total electorate of 81.4 crore (ten crore more than the last Parliamentary elections) compared with 1.76 crore during the first Lok Sabha polls in 1952.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been a remarkable increase in the enrolment of electors in the age group of 18 to 19 years. Over 2.3 crore electors are in this age group. Electors in the age group of 18-19 years now constitute 2.88 per cent of total electors, against 0.75 per cent in 2009,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>At present there are 11,844 overseas electors in the country and Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) V S Sampath had said that all such voters who are in the country during the day of polling can vote.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002539&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Goa Congress unit on Thursday alleged that the Parrikar government is promoting RSS-backed NGOs which would be funded through state exchequer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parrikar wants to promote NGOs which exist outside Goa and are affiliated to Sangh Parivar,&#8221; Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president John Fernandes alleged while addressing a press conference here.</p>
<p>&#8220;I warn the BJP not to vitiate the communal harmony by saffronising the state,&#8221; he said, adding that the &#8220;Goa government was funding the RSS-backed NGOs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fernandes was responding to a question on government&#8217;s announcement for funding NGOs to tackle stray cattle menace.</p>
<p>The chief minister has proposed to devise a scheme for five-year term to tackle stray cattle problem in collaboration with NGOs, including one run by Yoga Guru Ramdev – Bharat Swabhiman Kisan Sanstha.</p>
<p>When asked to comment on Congress&#8217; allegation, BJP spokesman Dr Wilfred Mesqueita said that since Congress has no issues, it is banking on non-issues for its political survival.</p>
<p>&#8220;BJP is happy with the budget and we feel the government has done maximum considering the financial constraints,&#8221; Mesqueita said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002544&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(IE Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bjpleaders.jpg" /></a> <br />BJP also alleged that some foreign forces were behind such violent incidents. (IE Photo)
<p>Accusing Aam Aadmi Party of spreading anarchy and vitiating the atmosphere ahead of polls, BJP on Thursday approached the Election Commission and demanded strict action against it, including the party&#8217;s derecognition.</p>
<p>BJP also alleged that some foreign forces were behind such violent incidents to create instability in the country and demanded a probe.</p>
<p>A delegation of BJP leaders including party Vice President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Shyam Jaju and Delhi unit chief Harshvardhan met Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath and ECs H S Brahma and S N A Zaidi and handed over a memorandum to them against AAP.</p>
<p>&#8220;AAP and its workers have indulged in violence and anarchy on the first day of the Model Code of Conduct that came into force yesterday. AAP has tried to spread anarchy and instability through its violence and wants to further vitiate the peaceful atmosphere ahead of Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have asked the Election Commission to initiate steps against the new outfit to stop it from disturbing the peaceful atmosphere. We fear more such incidents in the coming days and have asked the EC to take steps so that such instability and anarchy is not spread by AAP.</p>
<p>It seems some foreign forces are conspiring to create instability in the country,&#8221; Naqvi said.</p>
<p>He said the EC assured the delegation that stern steps will be taken against such incidents and those involved in yesterday&#8217;s violence and that no one will be permitted to vitiate and disturb the peaceful atmosphere during polls.</p>
<p>He accused AAP of being &#8220;the gentle face of Maoism&#8221; and said they think they are a law unto themselves. &#8220;They are trying to hijack democracy through anarchy,&#8221; he charged.</p>
<p>The BJP delegation also handed over a CD of yesterday&#8217;s violent incidents outside the BJP headquarters here and demanded a probe and action against those working at the behest of &#8220;some foreign forces&#8221; that threaten democratic system in the country.</p>
<p>Harshvardhan said the EC told the delegation that it will look into the complaint and that no political outfit will be allowed to disturb the democratic traditions in the country.</p>
<p>He said the Delhi BJP unit in a meeting of all senior leaders today passed a resolution against the violence by AAP and urged the President of India and the Union Home Minister to take serious note of yesterday&#8217;s incidents and take stern steps, including derecognition of AAP in national interest.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002522&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Taking potshots once again at BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid on Thursday said that though the Gujarat leader has no problem in donning the traditional attire of other states, he is &#8220;wary&#8221; of wearing a &#8220;small cap&#8221;.</p>
<p>Referring to an incident in Gujarat where Modi had refused to wear a cap being presented by Muslim leaders, Khurshid said that though he (Modi) wears dresses, pagdi and saafa of other states, &#8220;he is wary of a small cap&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Respecting each other does not harm anyone&#8217;s religion but makes one closer to the local people of that region and also provides an opportunity to establish harmony and amity&#8221;, Khurshid, who was on a day-long visit to his parliamentary constituency, said.</p>
<p>When asked to respond on BJP president Rajnath Singh&#8217;s offer of an apology to Muslims, Khurshid said that he has<br />
&#8220;proved to be a very weak person&#8221;.</p>
<p>To a question on the outcome of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, he said that they would be surprising. &#8220;There is a bend towards Congress,&#8221; he said alleging, &#8220;The crowd in Modi&#8217;s rallies is brought on payment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khurshid claimed that the work which has been done in his parliamentary constituency in the past five years had not been achieved in the past 20 years.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002508&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(IE Photo: Prashant Nadkar)
<p>A local court on Thursday fixed the hearing on four different applications filed by Tehelka founder editor Tarun Tejpal, accused of sexually assaulting a junior woman colleague, and the Crime Branch to March 21.</p>
<p>The Fast Track Court ordered that it will hear the three applications by Tejpal and an application by Crime Branch filed before it on March 21.</p>
<p>The judge today adjourned the matter giving time to the prosecution to file reply on the applications filed by the defence.</p>
<p>Tejpal, 50, has moved three different applications before the fast track court, including one wherein he has stated that the charge sheet filed against him by Crime Branch has disclosed the identity of the victim.</p>
<p>The charge sheet, he said, is a public document.</p>
<p>The journalist has also sought the entire evidence produced against him by the probing agency and the third application mentions that the investigating officer had not taken defence into confidence during committal of the case.</p>
<p>The crime branch has also applied to the court seeking to file supplementary charge sheet in the case.</p>
<p>The investigating officer has said that they are yet to get more evidence, like statement from Hollywood actor Robert de Niro (who was present in the hotel during the incident), and forensic report of the material collected from the accused, victim and other witnesses.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Goa bench of Bombay High Court had fixed the hearing on bail plea of Tejpal for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tejpal has been behind bars for allegedly raping a junior woman colleague during Tehelka&#8217;s Thinkfest in Goa in November last year.</p>
<p>He is presently lodged in Sada sub-jail in Vasco, about 35 kms from here.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002512&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sr-med.jpg" /></a> According to Tihar Spokesperson,  Subrata Roy was given a bed to sleep as he is above 60 years of age. (AP)
<p>Far from the opulence he is known to be addicted to, Sahara Chief Subrata Roy is being treated like any other prisoner in Tihar jail. He spent the day meeting his son, brother and a top company official besides reading newspapers in his cell.</p>
<p>Subrata Roy who was brought to Tihar jail last evening and has been kept in ward number four of prison 3, the same ward where all accused of the 2G scam were kept.</p>
<p>The Sahara chief Subrata Roy has been provided a bed to sleep as he is above 60 years of age, a jail official said.</p>
<p>Subrata Roy, who was sent in judicial custody for a week in Delhi by the Supreme Court on Wednesday, had reached Tihar prison at around 8 PM following which doctors examined him and he was found to be in good health.</p>
<p>According to Tihar Spokesperson Sunil Gupta, as per rules, Subrata Roy was given a bed to sleep as he is above 60 years of age.</p>
<p>Tihar authorities had yesterday said that Subrata Roy would have to sleep on floor but when he reached the prison complex, they came to know that he was above 60 following which a bed was given to him as per prison rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had a sound sleep. In the morning he read newspapers in his ward. He took bread and tea in breakfast. He also ate jail food. Later, he also ordered something to eat from the jail canteen,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gupta also said that his son and brother met him in the morning. Later, a woman from one of his companies also met him.</p>
<p>&#8220;As per prison rules, a prisoner is served chapati of 400 gm grain, 250 gm vegetable and 90 gm dal every day. According to this rule, he is being served food,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jail authorities maintained that Subrata Roy will be treated like any other prisoner and no preferential treatment will be given to him.</p>
<p>Subrata Roy too has so far not put forth any special demand before the jail authorities.</p>
<p>Subrata Roy was yesterday ordered to remain in custody for a week in Delhi by the Supreme Court which was unhappy that no concrete proposal on the refund of investors&#8217; money was put forward by the company.</p>
<p>Apart from Subrata Roy, the bench had also ordered that the Group&#8217;s other two Directors Ravi Shankar Dubey and Ashok Roy Choudhary be taken into custody letting the woman Director, Vandana Bhargava free.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002455&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Making his Prime ministerial ambition clear for the first time, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday said that he was &#8220;much better than the declared PM candidates&#8221; as he has experience of working both at the Centre and the state.</p>
<p>Without naming either the BJP Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi or Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi, he said &#8220;While one does not have the experience of Parliament another has no experience of running a state&#8230;I have both experiences &#8230;Am I less qualified than them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked categorically if he was a Prime Ministerial candidate, Kumar said his party JD(U) was small and modest and did not make tall claims, but believed in working sincerely for the people.</p>
<p>Speaking to a local TV channel, Nitish said one who is declared the prime ministerial candidate does not become so. Asked if the Third front of non-BJP and non-Congress parties would have benefitted if he was declared its PM candidate, Kumar said that one should wait and watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The non-Congress and non-BJP parties will have the largest numbers after the polls,&#8221; he said, referring to the Federal Front of 11 non-Congress and non-BJP parties for which he has been a prime mover.</p>
<p>He categorically ruled out siding either with Congress or BJP after the polls.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ruling Left Front and Trinamool Congress (TMC) have announced their party candidates for the two Lok Sabha constituencies in Tripura where elections would be held on April 7 and 12 respectively.</p>
<p>Convener of the Left Front and sitting MP Khagen Das said, state Industries and Commerce Minister Jitendra Chowdhuri would contest from the Tripura (East) ST constituency and Shankar Prasad Dutta, former MLA, would contest from the Tripura (West) constituency.</p>
<p>Both the candidates belonged to CPI-M, the dominant partner of the Left Front. Das said this decision was taken at the meeting of the Left Front committee held here yesterday. Both the candidates are new faces. &#8220;We have selected new faces because I am 76 and suffering from some old age problems and Bajuban Reang, MP from East Tripura constituency is also above 70 and is facing the same problem,&#8221; Das told reporters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Trinamool Congress has announced that former Congress Minister and Chairman of the Tripura unit of TMC, Ratan Chakraborty would contest from Tripura West constituency and Bhriguram Reang, a former leader of opposition Congress would contest from Tripura East constituency.</p>
<p>The opposition Congress and BJP are yet to announce their candidates for the fray. A total of 23,83,146 voters will exercise their franchise in the general elections from Tripura where elections for the two parliamentary seats will be held on April 7 and 12 respectively. Keeping in view the security arrangements, elections would be held on two days, Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), Ashutosh Jindal said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002462&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/crowdm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002470  " alt="Fans cheer during the India-Pakistan match, picture for representation purpose. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/crowdm.jpg" /></a> Fans cheer during the India-Pakistan match, picture for representation purpose. (Reuters)
<p>The Uttar Pradesh police on Thursday slapped sedition charges on a group of <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/for-cheering-pakistan-in-india-match-university-in-meerut-suspends-67-kashmiri-students/" target="_blank">Kashmiri students</a> of a private university in Meerut for reportedly cheering Pakistan’s victory against India during a cricket match on Sunday. The action sparked outrage in Kashmir, where both the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rallied behind the students.</p>
<p>While the Swami Vivekananda Subharti University (SVSU) in Meerut suspended 65 students for three days earlier this week, the university authorities on Wednesday evening lodged an FIR at the Jaani police station against “unidentified students of a particular group”.</p>
<p>Following the FIR, the police have registered a case against “unidentified students of a particular group” under Sections 124-A (sedition),153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.) and 427 (damage to government property). The minimum punishment for a sedition offence is three years and the maximum is life sentence.</p>
<p>Meerut SSP Onkar Singh said a case of sedition was registered based on the details provided by the university authorities. “The case will be investigated and action can be taken if anyone is found guilty. But how can we investigate a case against unidentified students,” he said.</p>
<p>Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted that the “sedition charge against Kashmiri students is an unacceptably harsh punishment that will ruin their futures and will further alienate them”.</p>
<p>While stating that “what the boys may have done in Meerut is misguided, (but) it certainly isn’t illegal,” Abdullah tweeted, “Have just spoken to CM UP who has assured me he will personally look into the matter of the Kashmiri students in Meerut.”</p>
<p>He further tweeted, “I believe the university did what it had to to control the situation but this action by the UP Govt is uncalled for &amp; should be reversed.”</p>
<p>PDP spokesperson Nayeem Akhar said the UP government’s action would lead to further alienation. The separatist leadership also expressed concern. “This reflects that Kashmiri people are under suppression in every place’’ said Syed Ali Geelani. Hurriyat Conference Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq termed it as a reflection of communal mindset and racial bias.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Meerut SSP said a magisterial inquiry is already underway. “We are waiting for the findings of the magisterial inquiry and will take action after that,” said District Magistrate Pankaj Yadav.</p>
<p>Mukesh Wallia ,general secretary, Meerut Bar Association, said the FIR filed by the SVSU was “weak”. Pointing out that the FIR was lodged against “unidentified” students, he said, “If that particular group is unidentified, how can these students be suspended?” he said.</p>
<p>Most of the students who returned to their homes in the Valley said they would not go back to the university as they feared for their lives.</p>
<p>Ajaz Ahmad, a student, alleged that the Kashmiri students were targeted after the match. “The window panes of our hostel were broken. We all slept in one room as we were afraid that we would be attacked at night,’’ he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002452&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/election-medd.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002453" alt="According to procedures notified by the EC, after filing the affidavit on line, a candidate has to provide the Returning Officer an attested hard copy." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/election-medd.gif" /></a> According to procedures notified by the EC, after filing the affidavit on line, a candidate has to provide the Returning Officer an attested hard copy.
<p>In a maiden initiative, the Election Commission (EC) has introduced e-filing of affidavits by candidates for the forthcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly polls.</p>
<p>The affidavits (Form 26) are supposed to be furnished by the candidates at the time of filing of their nomination for contesting a Parliamentary or an Assembly seat.The e-filing of affidavits, sources said, has been introduced keeping in mind an error-free and customer-friendly filing of data by a candidate trying luck at the hustings.</p>
<p>A typical affidavit filed by a candidate includes his personal information like details of assets (including movable and immovable properties), properties and accounts under his or her name in a foreign land, liabilities of the candidate, name of the spouse and dependants, educational qualifications and criminal antecedents, if any.</p>
<p>The filing of the affidavit is a mandatory exercise notified by the EC under the Representation of People Act and if it is not done correctly, the Returning Officer has the powers to reject a nomination. &#8220;The e-filing facility, however, will be optional for candidates this time. We have seen a number of tech-savvy candidates entering the poll fray and, hence, the EC has introduced it as a test case. If it succeeds, its scope would be enlarged,&#8221; a senior official said.</p>
<p>According to procedures notified by the EC, after filing the affidavit on line, a candidate has to provide the Returning Officer an attested hard copy. The e-filing procedures is much like the I-T returns filing on the computer, the official said.</p>
<p>The EC had late last year run a pilot-project in two Assembly constituencies in south India before deciding to roll it out in a full-fledged manner for the general elections, the schedule for which was announced on Wednesday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002440&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Archive)
<p>In a major setback to an already beleaguered Congress in Seemandhra, former Union Minister D Purandeswari is likely to join BJP.</p>
<p>Purandeswari, Lok Sabha member from Visakhapatnam, held a meeting with her supporters on Thursday after which she said she would meet top BJP leaders in Delhi on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come here to share my decision. I have spoken to all. I am not exerting pressure on anybody to be with me and come with me. I have left it to them. The situation is such that we have to take a painful decision,&#8221; said the Union Minister of State for Commerce.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow, I am going to Delhi. I will meet Advaniji, Sushma Swarajji and Arun Jaitleyji. I will have to talk to them first,&#8221; said Purandeswari, daughter of TDP founder late N T Rama Rao.</p>
<p>&#8220;From my side, there won&#8217;t be any conditions. All have supported me in the last five years since I came to Visakhapatnam,&#8221; she said in response to a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel Congress is thinking of taking the support of KCR (TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao) and indirectly, if we may say so, with YSRCP here (Seemandhra) if they (Congress) do not get adequate number of seats. So, alliances, it happens,&#8221; she said when pointed out about possible alliance of BJP with TDP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to contest from here (Visakhapatnam in the coming Lok Sabha elections),&#8221; added Purandeswari.</p>
<p>A number of Congress MLAs and other leaders in Seemandhra have joined TDP and YSRCP in protest against the division of Andhra Pradesh.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002434&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Communist Party of India (M) state secretariat has nominated former Gujarat cadre IAS officer Christy Fernandez, who was the secretary to former President Prathibha Patil, as the party candidate to contest from the Ernakulam constituency. A formal announcement will be made only after the CPI (M) state committee ratifies the list of party candidates. </p>
<p>Fernandez will take on sitting MP and minister K.V Thomas. Both belong to the Latin Catholic community, which has a sizeable presence in Ernakulam. </p>
<p>Although a formal announcement is due, Fernandez on Thursday met Cardinal George Alanchery in Kochi (Ernakulam). After meeting the Cardinal, the former IAS officer told the media that &#8220;the Left has better prospects in Ernakulam. The anti-incumbency factors against the Congress governments in state and the Centre are enough to ensure LDF success, who ever be the candidate.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said his meeting had little to do with him contesting in the upcoming election. &#8220;It was a routine visit,&#8221; he said. Cardinal Alanchery is the head of Kerala-based Syro-Malabar Roman Catholic Church, which is also has a sizeable number of voters from the constituency. </p>
<p>Fernandez is a native of Clappana in Kollam district.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nagmani, a known-party hopper, on Thursday resigned from the NCP praising Narendra Modi, a first fall-out of Congress-RJD-NCP alliance in Bihar, where he could not be accommodated as a candidate for Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>Nagmani, who was heading the Bihar unit of NCP and was looking after Jharkhand affairs of the party as well, said he was in touch with the BJP for more than two-and-a-half months.</p>
<p>He said that he had decided to work for Modi even when there was a talk that NCP could be given two seats under the &#8220;secular alliance&#8221; with Congress and RJD.</p>
<p>NCP wanted the second seat for Nagmani but it could get only one from where Union Minister Tarique Anwar will contest.</p>
<p>Nagmani, son of Jagdev Prasad, a legendary firebrand leader of backward castes in Bihar, had served in almost all parties including Congress, BJP, JD(U), RJD and LJP and is now all set to re-join the BJP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have met all senior leaders of BJP except Narendra Modi. I have met BJP President Rajnath Singh, its former President Nitin Gadkari, organisational secretary Ramlal and senior BJP leaders from Bihar. I was never in favour of joining hands with Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even when there was a talk that NCP will be given two seats, I had told BJP leaders that I wanted to contest from their party. Today it is the nation&#8217;s dream to see some backward or Dalit leader as Prime Minister. Modi fulfils the criteria. I will leave no stone unturned to ensure that he becomes Prime Minister,&#8221; Nagmani said.</p>
<p>NCP general secretary Tarique Anwar, said party chief Sharad Pawar has dissolved the Bihar unit and has asked national secretary Mohal Lal Agrawal to look after its affairs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002415&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kr-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002399" alt="The court had declined to accept the contention that it can now go into the issue of Telangana as the Bill was before Parliament. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kr-med.jpg" /></a> The court had declined to accept the contention that it can now go into the issue of Telangana as the Bill was before Parliament. (PTI)
<p>Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Kiran Reddy moved the Supreme Court Thursday, seeking a direction to declare the Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act for creation of Telangana as “unconstitutional for being violative of the basic structure of the Constitution of India.” The court will hear the plea Friday.</p>
<p>In a petition filed jointly by him and two other former ministers of his Cabinet, Reddy, who had resigned as Chief Minister over Telangana issue and floated a new political party Thursday, contended that the impugned enactment violated the basic feature of federalism.</p>
<p>“The President without applying mind, simply acted on the aid and advise of the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister in introducing the Bill in the Parliament  after the State Legislature returned back by Resolution dated January 30,” stated his petition, drawn by advocate A D N Rao.</p>
<p>The plea claimed that in the absence of an affirmative resolution by the State Legislature, no state could be bifurcated or its boundaries affected and a law to be made in that regard must also have the assent of one half of the states of the Union.</p>
<p>“The Bill is vitiated as the President failed to exercise his discretion and simply acted upon the advise of the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The said action is unjust, unfair and unreasonable and hit at the doctrine of basic structure and equality clause,” it said.</p>
<p>Reddy has also sought an inquiry into as to what transpired in the Lok Sabha when the Telangana Bill was introduced since the proceedings were not telecast and a blackout was declared on the ground of technical reasons. The petition has requested the court to summon the proceedings and records of the Lok Sabha in respect to the discussion on the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill.</p>
<p>“The entire process went in hurry with a view to prevailing situation that the sitting  of the Parliament almost comes to end and the announcement for the process of General Elections for 2014 was fast approaching.  The matter has not received such scrutiny and attention as it demanded at all levels,” he claimed.</p>
<p>Reddy urged the court to scrutinise the “real purpose” behind the Act, which he said was liable to be struck down as violative of basic structure of the Constitution, unjust, unfair and unreasonable to the people of Andhra region.</p>
<p>The petition also invoked an assurance made by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the Parliament in 1972 that the state would not be divided under any circumstances. It questioned if this assurance “could be over turned by bifurcation of the State of Andhra Pradesh without any rational basis unsupported by the findings of an expert body as to the necessity of bifurcation.”</p>
<p>“When a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court declared that the Indian States are permanent entities, destroying one entity by splitting up the same into two is obviously an unconstitutional act forbidden by the federal principle, a basic feature of the Constitution,” it added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002361&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday apologised for his party workers&#8217; behaviour in Delhi and Lucknow while protesting his &#8220;detention&#8221; and urged them to stick to non-violence.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was going to happen&#8230;some of them retaliated after they were attacked&#8230;I apologise for their behaviour and I<br />
once again urge them to remain non-violent,&#8221; he told reporters here in response to a query on the arrest of over a dozen AAP workers in Delhi.</p>
<p>AAP workers on Wednesday had clashed with BJP activists outside the saffron party headquarters in Delhi and Lucknow after Kejriwal&#8217;s car was damaged in Gujarat in retaliation to protests against his brief &#8220;detention&#8221; in the state.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Kejriwal,who began his four-day tour of Gujarat, was detained for alleged violation of the model code of conduct by travelling in a long carcade. Shortly later, he was allowed to go.</p>
<p>Fourteen AAP members were arrested after Delhi Police registered an FIR in connection with the clashes between<br />
supporters of the two parties in the national capital that left 28 people injured.</p>
<p>AAP workers had stormed the BJP head office on Ashoka Road in central Delhi protesting against Kejriwal&#8217;s<br />
&#8216;detention&#8217; in Radhanpur in North Gujarat where he has gone to &#8220;assess&#8221; the development claims made by CM Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>In Lucknow, workers of Aam Aadmi Party, armed with brooms, had clashed with lathi-wielding activists of BJP and<br />
fought pitched street battles outside BJP office on Vidhan Sabha Marg in protest against their chief&#8217;s detention.</p>
<p>Kejriwal during his second day of Gujarat sojourn today, will meet Sikh farmers settled in the state&#8217;s Kutch district.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002347&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ashu-med1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002690" alt="Aam Aadmi Party leader taken to the Parliament Street police station for questioning in connection with violence clashes outside the Bharatiya Janata Party office in Delhi on Wednesday.(Express Photo: Amit Mehra)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ashu-med1.jpg" /></a> AAP  leader taken to the Parliament Street police station for questioning in connection with violence clashes outside the BJP office in Delhi.  (Express Photo: Amit Mehra)
<p>AAP leaders Ashutosh and Shazia Ilmi, booked for rioting and damaging public property during clashes with BJP workers, have been brought for questioning by Delhi Police.</p>
<p>Ilmi, who was picked up by a team of women police personnel from her Greater Kailash residence, was brought to Parliament Street Police station for questioning, police said.</p>
<p>Journalist-turned politician Ashutosh, picked up from AAP&#8217;s Model Town office, is on his way to the Parliament Street police station. AAP leader and former Delhi Law Minister Somnath Bharti has also reached the police station.</p>
<p>An FIR was lodged last night at Parliament Street Police station against Ilmi and Ashutosh and other AAP volunteers in connection with clashes outside BJP headquarters. Police had initially detained 33 people out of which 14 were arrested late last night while others were allowed to go. A local court granted bail to those 14 AAP volunteers this afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;All those identifiable and present at the protest site have been named in the FIR,&#8221; a senior Delhi Police official said.<br />
Around 28 people, including 13 AAP activists and 10 BJP supporters, were injured in the clashes, police said.</p>
<p>Ilmi accused the Delhi Police of targeting the AAP and wondered why no action was being taken against BJP activists. &#8220;Yesterday, we got to see the discrimination of Delhi Police, which joined BJP to disperse AAP supporters staging silent protest. Police could not see bricks, stones and chairs being thrown from the inside of BJP Headquarter&#8230; They could only see people much later retaliating. Police were protecting BJP supporters,&#8221; Ilmi claimed.</p>
<p>Police have termed the AAP protest as completely illegal as no prior permission was sought by the party. Ashutosh also accused Delhi Police of bias against AAP workers. &#8220;AAP supporters were injured in the clash. BJP leaders beat up our supporters. Delhi Police takes action when flower pots at BJP office were damaged but they didn&#8217;t take action when our supporters were injured,&#8221; he claimed. Police said they have got the entire sequence of events videographed. Senior officials said more arrests are likely in the case.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Here are the highlights:</strong></p>
<p># After Ashutosh, Shazia Ilmi taken away for questioning over clashes between AAP and BJP supporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p># AAP supporters blocking the police vehicle.</p>
<p># Somnath Bharti says AAP will file FIR against BJP workers over Wednesday&#8217;s clashes.</p>
<p># Meanwhile, the 14 AAP workers arrested in connection with yesterday&#8217;s clashes granted bail.</p>
<p># Delhi Police reach AAP leader Shazia Ilmi&#8217;s residence for questioning her over clashes between her party and BJP supporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p># AAP leader Ashutosh accompanies Delhi Police for investigations over AAP-BJP clashes, says I am a law abiding citizen of India&#8230;I will fully cooperate.</p>
<p># Ashutosh appeals AAP supporters not to indulge into violence, maintain peace.</p>
<p># Delhi Police reach AAP&#8217;s office to arrest Ashutosh.</p>
<p># Election Commission issues notice to AAP for holding protests.</p>
<p># The AAP is gearing up to file a complaint with the Election Commission against the saffron party, AAP&#8217;s media coordinator Deepak Bajpai said.</p>
<p># According to Bajpai, the party is also mulling filing a police complaint against the BJP supporters.</p>
<p># Ilmi accused the Delhi Police of targeting the AAP and wondered why no action was being taken against BJP activists.</p>
<p># Ashutosh also accused Delhi police of bias against AAP workers.</p>
<p># AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday apologised for his party workers’ behaviour in Delhi and Lucknow while protesting his “detention” and urged them to stick to non-violence.</p>
<p># Fourteen AAP members were arrested after Delhi Police registered an FIR in connection with the clashes.</p>
<p># Police had initially detained 33 people out of which 14 were arrested late last night while others were allowed to go.</p>
<p>AAP workers had on Wednesday clashed with BJP activists outside the saffron party headquarters in Delhi and Lucknow after Arvind Kejriwal’s car was damaged in Gujarat in retaliation to protests against his brief detention in the state. 28 people, including 13 AAP activists and 10 BJP supporters, were injured in the clashes, police said.</p>
<p>Clashes began after Kejriwal was briefly detained in Gujarat as he began a four-day tour to “assess” development in Narendra Modi’s home state. Around 3 pm, when he was at his third stop at Radhanpur in Patan district, he was taken to the police station for an alleged violation of the model code of conduct.</p>
<p>Senior AAP leaders including Ashutosh and Anand Kumar — both candidates in the Lok Sabha elections — former Delhi minister Rakhi Birla, and Shazia Ilmi too joined the protest. Ilmi denied that AAP supporters were responsible for the violence, and said the protest was a reaction to the detention of Kejriwal in Gujarat.</p>
<p>Police had termed the AAP protest as completely illegal as no prior permission was sought in this connection by the party.</p>
<p>Police have also got the entire sequence of events videographed and senior officials said that more arrests are possible after identification in the video footage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Day 2 in Gujarat-state police is spying on me. Troubling, questioning, threatening people I&#8217;m meeting since last evening in Gujarat,&#8221; he tweeted.</p>
<p>Kejriwal on Wednesday had accused Modi of trying to stall his visit to Gujarat meant to &#8220;inspect&#8221; development.</p>
<p>After he embarked on his tour to &#8220;verify&#8221; Modi&#8217;s claims of providing water, power, education and healthcare to people in Gujarat, the former Delhi Chief Minister was taken to Radhanpur police station in North Gujarat and allowed to leave after half an hour.</p>
<p>Gujarat state AAP convenor Sukhdev Patel had claimed that Kejriwal was detained, though the police denied it by saying that they had only &#8220;briefed&#8221; Kejriwal on the model code of conduct which came into force after declaration of the poll schedule.</p>
<p>However, Kejriwal alleged that the police had acted after &#8220;orders from the top&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came to know in the morning itself that all District Superintendents of Police (DSPs) were instructed to stop Kejriwal under any circumstances. Modi also sent some people with black flags. We knew that they would resort to such tactics,&#8221; Kejriwal had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002289&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Archive)
<p>The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned till March 26 the Centre’s plea on restraining the Tamil Nadu government from releasing all the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.</p>
<p>The top court deferred the plea as the Centre sought time to bring more facts on record</p>
<p>Earlier, the court had restrained the Tamil Nadu government from releasing three of the seven convicts, whose death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment as it agreed to examine if the state had complied with procedure when it decided to remit their sentence.</p>
<p>Admitting a petition by the Centre, a bench led by Chief Justice P Sathasivam had ordered the state government to “maintain status quo prevailing as on date” in respect of convicts Murugan, Santhan and Perarivalan until March 6.</p>
<p>While issuing notices to the Tamil Nadu government and the three convicts, the bench had turned down Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran’s plea to also stay the state’s decision to free the other four convicts in the case.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002239&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(IE Photo: Praveen Khanna)
<p>Fourteen <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/arvind-kejriwal-detained-in-gujarat-bjp-aap-clashes/">AAP members</a> were arrested after Delhi Police registered an FIR in connection with the clashes outside the BJP national headquarters here between supporters of the two parties that left 28 people injured.</p>
<p>According to police sources, an FIR has been lodged at Parliament Street Police Station on Wednesday night against the AAP protesters including leaders Ashutosh and Shazia Ilmi.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash3_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002069" alt="AAPclash3_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash3_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>Charges of rioting, obstructing a public servant from performing his duty and damaging public property have been slapped against them, the sources said.</p>
<p>Police had initially detained 33 people out of which 14 were arrested late last night while others were allowed to go.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclashes.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001994 alignnone" alt="" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclashes.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;All those indetifiable and present at the protest site have been named in the FIR,&#8221; said a senior Delhi police official.</p>
<p>Those arrested will be produced before a local court here in the afternoon.</p>
<p>28 people, including 13 AAP activists and 10 BJP supporters, were injured in the clashes, police said.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002068" alt="AAPclash_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=270" width="480" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>Police have termed the AAP protest as completely illegal as no prior permission was sought in this connection by the party.</p>
<p>Police have also got the entire sequence of events videographed and senior officials said that more arrests are possible after identification in the video footage.</p>
<p>AAP workers had yesterday clashed with BJP activists outside the saffron party headquarters in Delhi and Lucknow after Arvind Kejriwal&#8217;s car was damaged in Gujarat in retaliation to protests against his brief detention in the state.</p>
<p>Kejriwal, who began a 4-day tour of Gujarat yesterday, was yesterday detained for alleged violation of the model code of conduct by travelling in a long carcade. Shortly later, he was allowed to go.</p>
<p>Accusing Narendra Modi of getting scared of Kejriwal and initiating police action, AAP workers had stormed the BJP head office on Ashoka Road in central Delhi protesting against Kejriwal&#8217;s detention in Radhanpur in North Gujarat where he has gone to &#8220;inspect&#8221; development that has been claimed by Chief Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>The rival sides had attacked each other indulging in pelting of stones. Plastic chairs were hurled from inside BJP office on the protesters outside.Police had used water canons to disperse the warring activists.</p>
<p>In Lucknow, workers of Aam Aadmi Party, armed with brooms, had clashed with lathi-wielding activists of BJP and fought pitched street battles outside BJP office on Vidhan Sabha Marg in protest against detention of Kejriwal.</p>
<p>Around three dozen AAP workers had staged a demonstration outside the BJP headquarters and allegedly attacked the saffron party office with bricks, drawing retaliation as BJP workers, carrying canes, took to the streets.</p>
<p>Kejriwal had yesterday accused the BJP of instigating violence in front of its headquarters in Delhi even as he apologised for some AAP activists &#8220;retaliating&#8221; while protesting his detention.</p>
<p>Kejriwal claimed that AAP workers were first attacked by BJP supporters. Some of the agitated AAP workers had responded by pelting &#8220;two or three stones&#8221;..</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry for the mistakes committed by the AAP workers. They should not have resorted to violence on my detention,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He also blamed BJP workers for attacking his entourage while travelling in Gujarat and said the glass panes of his car were broken.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002116&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/express5_march06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002089" alt="Arvind Kejriwal's detention sparks violent clashes between BJP and AAP and other Indian Express special stories." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/express5_march06.jpg" /></a> Arvind Kejriwal&#8217;s detention sparks violent clashes between BJP and AAP and other Indian Express special stories.
<p>We bring you five best stories of the Indian Express you must read before you begin your day.</p>
<p><strong>1. Kejriwal&#8217;s detention fallout:</strong> Hours after Lok Sabha elections were announced, members of the Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP came to blows on Wednesday evening in Gujarat, Delhi and Lucknow. In Gujarat, BJP supporters damaged AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal’s car. In Delhi and Lucknow, workers of the rival parties threw stones and chairs at each other, attacked each other with sticks, and shouted slogans. <a title="Kejriwal’s detention in Modi land sparks violent clashes between BJP, AAP in three states" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/arvind-kejriwal-detained-in-gujarat-bjp-aap-clashes/" target="_blank">Kejriwal detained in Gujarat, BJP, AAP clash in three states</a><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002068" alt="AAPclash_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=270" width="480" height="270" /></a></p>
<p><strong><br />
2. Fixing Accountability:</strong> The navy is moving in fast to fix accountability for the spate of accidents that recently hit its frontline warship with rapid-pace inquiries that have now thrown up several reasons for the incidents — from errors by the captains commanding the ships to faulty equipment and substandard quality of material. <a title="Captains’ errors to quality issues, Navy inquiries list reasons for spate of mishaps" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/captains-errors-to-quality-issues-navy-inquiries-list-reasons-for-spate-of-mishaps/" target="_blank">Captains’ errors to quality issues, Navy inquiries list reasons for spate of mishaps</a>, a report by Manu Pubby<br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sindhuratna.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996706" alt="Sindhuratna" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sindhuratna.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Clash of the Titans:</strong> In Varanasi, widely talked about as the seat Narendra Modi could contest from, supporters of Murli Manohar Joshi have put up hundreds of hoardings and banners with slogans such as “Atankwad par lage lagaaam, Dr Joshi ka paigam”, and “Bole Kashi Vishwanath, Dr Joshi ka denge saath”. Varanasi saw terror attacks in 2006 and in 2010, hence the reference to atankwad. Lalmani Verma tells in <a title="Modi fans vs Joshi fans in battle for Varanasi" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/modi-fans-vs-joshi-fans-in-battle-for-varanasi/" target="_blank">Modi fans vs Joshi fans in battle for Varanasi</a><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modijoshim.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002073" alt="MODIJOSHIM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modijoshim.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p>4. Asia Cup 2014: At the innings break, Varun Aaron sought out Wasim Akram for some bowling advice. He might have been better off playing this game against Afghanistan instead. In fact, not only Aaron, it was inexplicable that India didn’t go with Cheteshwar Pujara and Ishwar Pandey today and named an unchanged squad for their first ever ODI against Afghanistan. It was a perfect opportunity to give the reserves some game time in a dead rubber. <a title="Asia Cup 2014: India exit on the right note" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-after-spin-show-india-seal-dead-rubber/" target="_blank">India exit on the right note</a>, match report by Shamik Chakrabarty.<br />

<p><strong>5. Opinion:</strong> The EC is now a very experienced institution, with a well-oiled machinery. Its foremost concern every time is, of course, a peaceful poll. The safety of voters, of polling staff and even of security forces is always an overriding concern. We cannot afford to lose any lives. The muscle power of the proverbial bahubali or strongman is now history. Vulnerability mapping, deployment of paramilitary forces and the 24×7 video watch on them ensures that they behave. S Y Quraishi writes about Election Commission’s mobilisation of youth, women could define the 2014 polls. <a title="The stage is set" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-stage-is-set-7/" target="_blank">The stage is set</a><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">India&#8217;s unimpressive run at global academic rankings continued as no higher education institute from the country found place among top 200 reputed universities of the world in a list based on a survey of senior academics across the globe. </span></p>
<p>The 2014 World Reputation Rankings, released by the UK-based Times Higher Education on Friday, was dominated by the American and British institutions, but it also had a few universities from Asian nations like China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.</p>
<p>In the World Reputation Rankings, described as a definitive list of the world’s 100 most prestigious universities, the famed IITs and the Indian Institute of Science have slid below the 200 mark.</p>
<p>Phil Baty, the editor of Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, told The Indian Express that India is clearly “some way off the pace”.</p>
<p>He pointed out, “India’s most prestigious institution, based on the results of our expert global opinion poll, is the Indian Institute of Science, but it sits roughly around the 200th position and fell further since last year. IITs &#8211; Bombay, Delhi and Kanpur &#8211; are also top of India’s ranking, but they have slipped in the global list”.</p>
<p>Baty said India’s absence from the list could affect its ability to attract globally reputed faculty.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001914&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">As the Election Commission (EC) announced the dates for one of the longest phase of Lok Sabha polls ever, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has also pitched in Department of Telecommunications (DoT) and Ministry of Railways, so that the security forces have a smooth run.</span></p>
<p>To ensure that forces are “not harassed for time”, their movement has been sketched meticulously with plans to keep a track of them through GPS devices and also use UAV&#8217;s in areas affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE).</p>
<p>Apart from local police and battalions already deployed in the states, at least 12,000 central forces will be on the move for 72 days during which elections will be held between April 7 and May 12.</p>
<p>The EC has already said that all LWE-affected districts in Jharkhand, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Orissa, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh would go to polls simultaneously on April 10, 17 and 24.</p>
<p>The DoT will give 2,000 closed user group (CUG) SIM cards to company commanders to tide over communication problems when the forces move. These would be &#8220;permanent numbers that would be active for the election period.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have decided to customise the kind of arms and weapons to be carried by security personnel. As the forces will not face the same kind of hostility on the ground everywhere, so the number of weapons being carried by the men will also be rationalised. For example, forces in Gujarat will not need to be equipped with the kind of assault weapons that they will require in a Maoist-affected Chattisgarh,&#8221; said Dilip Trivedi, DG, CRPF.</p>
<p>Railways have also been asked to reserve train berths for the jawans. Different strategies have been chalked out for LWE areas, Jammu and Kashmir and north-east parts of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;For rebel-hit areas, forces who have already worked in such locations and are familiar with the terrain and operational requirements will be deputed. Pre-induction of forces in the difficult areas has already started,&#8221; said the officer. He added that during the last Lok Sabha elections, the most common grouse of the forces was transport, accommodation and food.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001903&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Initiating one of its biggest criminal actions in a money laundering case, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday attached assets worth Rs 863 crore of YSR Congress leader Jaganmohan Reddy and his associates in connection with its probe into alleged corruption in an infrastructure project in Andhra Pradesh.</span></p>
<p>The agency slapped separate notices against Jagan and Nimmagada Prasad whose companies were allegedly favoured by the then AP government (when Jagan’s father Y S Rajasekhara Reddy was chief minister) in the Vad­arevu and Nizampatnam Industrial Corridor (VANPIC) project whose aim was to develop sea ports and a green field airport in coastal areas of the southern state and industrial corridors in Prak­asam and Guntur districts.</p>
<p>The ED had in 2012 registered a criminal probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against the individuals and associated firms based on a CBI FIR in this case. The ED probe said there was ‘quid pro quo’ in this deal and hence illegal money exchanged hands.</p>
<p>“Various concessions were extended to the VANPIC project in the form of alienation of huge chunks of assigned government land to the companies floated by Nimmagadda Prasad, development of shipyard, green fil­ed airport, exemptions from levy of stamp duty and registration charges, seigniorage (deed-signing) fee and other un­due benefits were exte­n­ded,” the ED probe report said.</p>
<p>The CBI chargesheet, which the ED relied upon, said “illegal gains to the tune of Rs 1426.17 crore was made to Prasad in the acquisition of lands and Rs 854.54 crore was made to Jagan and his companies as quid pro quo by Prasad and his companies.”<br />
“This is one of the biggest attachments done by the ED in a money laundering case. The assets will now be seized,” sources privy to the development told PTI.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001889&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In Varanasi, widely talked about as the seat <a title="Modi welcomes LS polls dates, urges voters to make the right choice" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/modi-welcomes-ls-polls-dates-urges-voters-to-make-the-right-choice/" target="_blank">Narendra Modi</a> could contest from, supporters of <a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/picture-gallery-others/modi-and-joshi-swap-names/#modi_manohar" target="_blank">Murli Manohar Joshi</a> have put up hundreds of hoardings and banners with slogans such as “Atankwad par lage lagaaam, Dr Joshi ka paigam”, and “Bole Kashi Vishwanath, Dr Joshi ka denge saath”. Varanasi saw terror attacks in 2006 and in 2010, hence the reference to atankwad.</span></p>
<p>The speculation has been that a candidacy for <a title="Eye on Muslim votes, Modi’s Chai pe Charcha moves closer to home" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/eye-on-muslim-votes-modis-chai-pe-charcha-moves-closer-to-home/" target="_blank">Modi</a> here would mean Joshi, the siting MP, shifting to Kanpur. At Modi’s recent Lucknow rally, a group of party workers in the crowd chanted, “Modiji tum raaj karo, Joshiji tyag karo.”</p>
<p>Hoardings by Joshi’s supporters describe the work done in the constituency from his local area development fund. They say he spent Rs 19 crore at 732 places; the slogan goes “Janata ka dhan, janata ko hisaab.”</p>
<p>Joshi has frequently visited Varanasi in the past two months since the party started to discuss the possibility of Modi being fielded began. Modi had addressed a Vijay Shankhnad rally there in January.</p>
<p>Joshi also met Mohan Bhagwat in Varanasi last month. He has been there since March 3 and called a meeting of party workers Wednesday.</p>
<p>Joshi could not be reached for comment. An aide said, “Who else will contest here? Joshiji has started preparations and these hoardings are part of the campaign. Only a formal announcement remains.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001890&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The BJP seems to be the favourite of many and the party attributes it to Narendra Modi.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001881&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Bihar and Jharkhand are witnessing a number of former bureaucrats trying to enter the poll race. What is new is that several have taken voluntary retirement. These states have at least a dozen former bureaucrats in the race. In at least one seat, a former IPS officer and an IAS officer are locked in a battle to be the BJP candidate. The BJP seems to be the favourite of many and the party attributes it to Narendra Modi. “These people, who want to serve people, are attracted by the work of Modi,” said BJP legislator Raghubar Das.</span></p>
<p>In Bihar, former union home secretary R K Singh is likely to contest on a BJP ticket, and former Tirhut Range commissioner K P Ramaiah is the probable JD(U) candidate in Sasaram. Petroleum secretary R S Pandey is a BJP probable from Valmiki Nagar, and another Bihar cadre IAS officer, Pancham Lal, who recently took voluntary retirement, is eager to contest the elections. Former Bihar DGP Ashish Ranjan Sinha is the likely RJD nominee from Nalanda.</p>
<p>In Jharkhand, former DGP V D Ram is looking at contesting from Palamu as BJP candidate. He has competition from retired IAS officer Mukhtiar Singh, who was chairperson of the Jharkhand Electricity Regulatory Commission. He wants the same ticket.</p>
<p>Sasaram in Bihar, represented by Lok Sabha speaker and former IFS officer Meira Kumar, could present an interesting battle. Ramaiah, who took VRS four months before retirement, is seeking the JD(U) ticket. Lal, a 1974 batch IAS officer who once got into controversy by saying 90 per cent cases against Naxals are fake, is aspiring to be a candidate from Sasaram. There are signs of JD(U) rebel and former minister Chhedi Paswan joining BJP and wanting to contest from Sasaram.</p>
<p>In Jharkhand, former additional DGP Amitabh Choudhary joined JVM(P) after bidding for the BJP ticket for Ranchi.</p>
<p>Former union home secretary Singh, who turned down an offer to be adviser to Nitish Kumar and joined the BJP instead, is the likely BJP candidate from Ara in Bihar. New BJP ally LJP had sought Ara, but the BJP did not cede it. Caste equations favour Singh’s chances in Ara rather than home turf Supaul. Valimiki Nagar has at least four BJP hopefuls including veteran MLA Chandramohan Roy, independent MLA Dilip Verma and former petroleum secretary R S Pandey. Pandey and Verma seem frontrunners.</p>
<p>In Jharkhand, besides Choudhary, BJP’s Yashwant Sinha and JVM(P)’s Ajoy Kumar are strong contenders. Sinha, a veteran, was a bureaucrat earlier. Ajoy Kumar had resigned as SP and won the byelection from Jamshedpur in 2011.</p>
<p>Choudhary, who joined JVM(P) on February 27, had seven years of service left. He said in an interview, “There is a distinction between somebody who had an option and left that option to choose this (politics) and those who did not have an option, but were superannuated, had a few months’ service left or there was no chance they would have reached the top.”</p>
<p>Punjab cadre IPS officer Arun Oraon, whose in-laws are from Lohardagga, is waiting to contest as a BJP candidate. “I requested my home cadre to relieve me by March 10. I know Lohardagga well; apart from the history my in-laws have, I have served there,” Arun Oraon said. His wife Geetashree Oraon represents the constituency now.</p>
<p>Jharkhand’s former energy secretary Vimal Kirti Singh intends joining BJP. His choice of constituency is not clear yet and there were indications he wanted to contest from Bihar. It is likely he would settle for Dhanbad.</p>
<p>The Congress Monday inducted former IAS officer Binod Kispotta, of the Manipur cadre, who retired as Jharkhand additional secretary in 2012. Congress sources, however, say he is not likely to contest.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001881&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Left Front Wednesday carried out the expected purge in its candidate list for West Bengal. In a front led by a party whose candidates are frequently between ages 60 and 70, at least 16 candidates this time are below 40. The CPM-led front also introduced 25 new faces among 42, though it also has retained 10 sitting MPs.</span></p>
<p>The youngest candidate in 2009 was 50, and that for 2014 is 25. “This is the first election in three decades that we are not in power. People always ask us why there are so many older candidates. So we have introduced 25 new faces,” said Left Front chairman Biman Bose. Senior CPM leaders said former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been pressing for a long time for young faces in the election.</p>
<p>The party has fielded a dozen MLAs and former MLAs. Of these, the most prominent are ministers Ashim Dasgupta, Debesh Das and Mortaza Hossain.</p>
<p>Unlike the Trinamool Congress list, the Left Front one has no singers or actors. “We never thought of this that. We wanted to field those comrades who have worked for the people,” said Bose.</p>
<p>The youngest in the list is Sheikh Ibrahim Ali, 25, the CPM candidate from Tamluk, who he will fight against sitting MP Subhendu Adhikary. Another young candidate is Rinku Sarkar, 28, who is a councillor in Kolkata.</p>
<p>“Ibrahim is a very good organiser. Rinku, a Jadavpur University alumnus, roams around her ward on a bicycle, and is dedicated and fearless,” said Sujan Chakraborty, CPM candidate from Jadavpur.</p>
<p>The sitting MPs retained include Pulin Behai Baskey, Probodh Panda, Narahari Mahato, Basudeb Acharia in Bankura and Sushmita Barui. The Left Front list has 12 Muslims and six women.</p>
<p>The Samajwadi Party, which had asked for a couple of seats, has not been accommodated in the list. “We have some allies who asked for seats, but we could not accommodate them. We will talk to them ,” Bose said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001878&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Mamata Banerjee is taking her battle to Narendra Modi’s home turf. She will hold a “mega rally” in Ahmedabad, tentatively scheduled March 20, and field 16 candidates in Gujarat. With her at the rally will be Anna Hazare, whose support she has won. And to add some punch to Anna’s public appearances across North India, especially in places where she may not travel herself, Mamata has deputed Mithun Chakraborty to accompany him.</span></p>
<p>Every Mamata rally will be followed up with a Anna-Mithun rally at constituencies where the party fancies its chances of either winning or garnering a larger chunk of votes.</p>
<p>The Anna-Mamata drive is being organised with a tie-up with the Samata Party. The Samata Party’s Praveen Singh Jadeja will meet Mamata in Delhi next week ahead of her rally on Ramlila Maidan and discuss the specifics.</p>
<p>Mithun, who has been close not only to Mamata but also to Pranab Mukherjee and some Left leaders, was roped into the Trinamool Congress earlier this year with a Rajya Sabha ticket from West Bengal. He is yet to take oath. He will lend his star power to the rallies with Anna much before that, starting next week at Delhi’s Kanjhawala.</p>
<p>The party has composed three songs, in Hindi, in Bhojpuri, and a qawwali, on “The power of Mamata” (Mamata ka dum) to be aired at these rallies. So far over 200 people have applied for tickets to Delhi’s seven seats, the party says.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001872&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;"><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/bjp-will-not-come-to-power-mamata/" target="_blank">Mamata Banerjee </a>released her list of 42 candidates for <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/dissension-brews-in-bjp-over-bengals-first-list/" target="_blank">West Bengal </a>Wednesday, one that was a surprise mixture of career politicians, celebrities from sport, film, music and theatre, and even a Harvard professor who is also a member of Netaji’s family.</span></p>
<p>“I have combined all — caste, creed, culture, people from the fields of education and entertainment, sports and football and of course youth,” said <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/west-bengal/no-force-with-cpm-viable-not-third-front-but-tired-front/" target="_blank">Mamata</a>. “In my list are 11 women or 26.19 per cent, and 10 SC candidates or 23.81 per cent. Seven candidates are from the Muslim community, which is 17 per cent and up two since last time.”</p>
<p>She has retained all but two sitting MPs, and brought in a number of young candidates that include her nephew Abhishek Banerjee from Diamond Harbour, the seat vacated by Somen Mitra when he went back to the Congress. Fighting now from Kolkata North, Mitra said: “The seeds of family rule have been sown&#8230; He (Abhishek) is too junior for me to comment.”</p>
<p>The five film stars include Moon Moon Sen, daughter of Suchitra Sen, from Bankura. Dipak Adhikari or “Deb”, an emerging actor, will contest from Ghatal. And Sandhya Roy, an actress of an earlier generation, got the ticket to Midnapore.</p>
<p>One big surprise was Baichung Bhutia for Darjeeling. There was speculation about the Gorkha Janamukti Morcha putting up a common candidate with the Trinamool, but this makes it clear the GJM will either have to accept Bhutia or look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Harvard history professor Dr Sugato Bose, son of former MP Krishna Bose, will contest from Jadavpur with sitting MP Suman Chattopadhyay, a singer, having fallen out with Mamata.</p>
<p>Bhoomi band singer Soumitra Roy will contest Maldaha Uttar and singer Indranil Sen from Baharampur, where the sitting MP is Adhir Choudhury. Arpita Ghosh, a stage artiste, will contest Balurghat, and a member of the Dasmunsi family, Satya Ranjan, from Raigunj.</p>
<p>Asked how many seats she hopes to win and if she is in the running for the PM’s post, she said: “I am not an astrologer to predict how many seats we will win. Neither am I in the competition for the PM’s chair. But of course, if there is any opportunity, the people will decide.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001866&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Sampath during a press conference to announce dates for the Lok Sabha elections. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">From last minute “praise releases” that extolled the achievements of ministers to the rushed appointment of a Governor well past midnight, an early morning rapid-fire round of inaugurations and policy announcements, politicians and bureaucrats alike burnt the midnight oil to beat the model code of conduct that came into effect just before noon on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>With the Election Commission making it clear that the poll dates would be announced on Wednesday morning, a flurry of announcements and events took place, most of them narrowly missing the start of the code of conduct.</p>
<p>Rashtrapati Bhawan, it seems, worked well past midnight, formally announcing the appointment of Sheila Dikshit as the Kerala governor at 3.20 am. The defence ministry created a record of sorts by sending a press release at as early as 7.30 am — a detailed 28-page eulogy on the “achievements” of Defence Minister A K Antony over the past eight years that included “breaching the barriers in the allocation of eggs and fruits to jawans”.</p>
<p>The home ministry too started work early on Wednesday, announcing that the <span style="line-height:1.5em;">central government has decided to withdraw from the acquisition of Wakf properties in Delhi based on certain conditions. The announcement missed the start of the EC’s press conference by just 10 minutes.</span></p>
<p>Senior law ministry officials worked till the early hours of Wednesday, giving the final touches to the notification on reservation of jobs for Jats.</p>
<p>The busiest minister in the morning seemed to be Sports Minister Jitendra Singh, who managed a quick round of inaugurations that beat the code of conduct. Singh launched a swimming pool project, the National Cycling Academy at Indira Gandhi Sports Complex and a Community Connect Scheme. This, despite a busy Tuesday inaugurating a central library and laying the foundation stone of the New Academic &amp; Residential Complex of RGNIYD at Sriperumbudur.</p>
<p>HRD Minister Pallam Raju inaugurated a new guest house of the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) at 10 am — just half-an-hour before the poll schedule was announced. The event was apparently scheduled at the last minute — the media invites were sent at 8:35 pm on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In fact, Raju was on an inauguration spree through the week, with three back-to-back events on Monday, and also appointed members and officials of the University Grants Commission and directors of IITs. However, he could not appoint Vice Chancellors of 12 new central universities due to procedural delays. His ministry also managed to push in last-minute half-page advertisements in newspapers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The rural development ministry beat the code deadline by a day, posting a detailed press communique on its website on Tuesday, listing the number of projects for skill development of rural youth approved by the ministry under its flagship National Rural Livelihoods Mission &#8211; Aajeevika.</p>
<p>Environment Minister Veerappa Moily ensured that his ministry put out a significant statement late on Tuesday night, announcing that it accepts the Kerala government’s recommendations to keep agricultural land, plantations and habitations out of the “Ecologically Sensitive Areas” as identified by the Kasturirangan Committee on Western Ghats. Taking a lenient view on this politically sensitive issue, the ministry also announced that it would consider similar proposals of other states in the region if forwarded within 60 days of issuance of the draft notification.</p>
<p>The culture ministry led by Chandresh Kumari Katoch announced on Tuesday evening that its Secretary, Ravindra Singh, would inaugurate the Festival of India in Vietnam on March 5, 2014 in Hanoi.</p>
<p>Two vacancies in the National Commission of Minorities, including that of the chairman, were filled over the last two days, bypassing mandatory clearances. NCM chairman Naseem Ahmed Khan and Parsi member Dadar Mistry have taken charge, but the requisite clearances from the home ministry and the Central Board of Direct Taxes are yet to reach the commission. “It has happened in the past that members have been denied appointment over security concerns. So this is a precedent that cannot be encouraged,” said NCM sources.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who for the greater part of his tenure played the role of the Congress’s crisis manager, woke up to his ministerial responsibilities at the turn of the new year, going on an inauguration spree over the last month or so. He unveiled a flurry of ICMR products, from diabetes testing strips to an instrument to detect cervical cancer. Two days before the code of conduct, he inaugurated the generic drugs pharmacy and convergence block of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. In fact, when facing media fire for the last-minute transfer of former Health Secretary Keshav Desiraju, Azad hit back by saying the media had not highlighted the good work that he had unveiled over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Railways Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury worked till midnight on Tuesday to push through his wishlist. He made sure that long-distance trains in tribal and backward areas in West Bengal got additional stoppages.</p>
<p>There were, however, last-minute hiccups too, with several plans having to be put off by the announcement of the polls. MoS for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions V Narayanasamy was scheduled to hold a press conference at 1.30 pm at the Civil Services Officers’ Institute. The programme was cancelled just minutes before the EC’s press conference.</p>
<p>Oil Minister M Veerappa Moily was forced to cancel three events in his home state of Karnataka, including the inauguration of a strategic oil storage facility and an R&amp;D centre of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd in Bangalore.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001857&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">To cater to the rising needs of major metropolises, it is important to create urban “agglomerations” by linking small towns and cities with the megacities, said noted economist and author Dr Isher Judge Ahluwalia at the Express Adda in Mumbai on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>Ahluwalia and Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan discussed various issues related to urban planning and growth at the Adda, which was moderated by Shekhar Gupta, Editor-in-Chief of the Express Group.</p>
<p>“While I am all for creating new cities, planned cities, the challenge of renewing existing cities also needs to be tackled&#8230; We need linkage of cities with each other. We need to create agglomerations around major cities,” said Ahluwalia, whose book, Transforming our Cities: Postcards of Change, was launched last month as part of the Express Book series.</p>
<p>Chavan said his government was trying to do this in Mumbai — creating an agglomeration around the city by including areas such as Thane, <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombiwali and Mira-Bhayander.</span></p>
<p>However, he pointed out that there are several political differences that the government has to deal with. “We are thinking of bifurcating the Thane district for better administration. I was to do that today, but I don’t think it will be possible. There are some political compulsions,” he said.</p>
<p>Citing the example of the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, Chavan said, “Ruling parties don’t want to spend money on building roads in industrial areas because they don’t have voters there.”</p>
<p>He said the government is also focussing on empty areas, creating social and physical infrastructure as well as economic opportunities to draw people. The state government is creating an industrial township in Aurangabad, along the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, and new settlements in Navi Mumbai and Nagpur, he said.</p>
<p>“There is rapid urbanisation in Maharashtra. The state is almost 50 per cent urban today. Just yesterday, we decided to convert 138 gram panchayats into nagar palikas,” he said.</p>
<p>Ahluwalia said in other states, the gram panchayats resist any move to convert them into municipalities. “There are about 2,000 towns that the Census has declared as being ready to become nagar panchayats, but the political establishment is not giving them a local government strong enough to support the growth,” she said.</p>
<p>“Maharashtra, as a state, has a good capacity to manage and Gujarat has developed a good capacity to plan. There are many states where the local governments are completely dependent on the state governments. When you do not have a guaranteed revenue base, it is not possible to plan,” she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001849&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gurudaskamatm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002006" alt="The articles highlighted Kamat’s proximity to the Gandhi family. (Express Archive)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gurudaskamatm.jpg" /></a> The articles highlighted Kamat’s proximity to the Gandhi family. (Express Archive)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">On March 1, the day after the Maharashtra government legalized slums that came up in Mumbai between 1995 and 2000, several local dailies carried large, adulatory pieces on veteran Congress leader Gurudas Kamat, crediting him with the “achievement”.</span></p>
<p>The articles highlighted Kamat’s proximity to the Gandhi family, and lauded his secular credentials and dedication to his Mumbai North-West Lok Sabha constituency, and to the Congress party.</p>
<p>The articles looked and read like political ads, but they weren’t marked as ads in any of the publications. Sources in two of the publications, including an editor and an executive, said that these “news items” had been paid for.</p>
<p>Kamat, who is also a Congress national general secretary, rubbished the “allegations”. “I know the rules,” he told The Indian Express when asked if he had paid for the coverage.</p>
<p>“I did not pay any money to any publication,” Kamat said, adding, “Some of my friends and well wishers compiled a report of my work which was circulated as a press release to newspapers. Some chose to publish it, some didn’t.”</p>
<p>The headlines, narratives, pictures and display of the reports in the newspapers were however, much more than a routine reproduction of a press release.</p>
<p>“Gurudas Kamat ki rang laayi mehnat, gareebon ka hua aashiyana”, said the headline in the Hindi daily Hamara Mahanagar, which devoted half of its page 3 to the report. The piece in Navabharat was accompanied by several boxes lauding Kamat’s work in his constituency and party.</p>
<p>One box said: “Many a time Congress president Sonia Gandhi doesn’t even consult chief ministers on big decisions, but she always confers with Gurudas Kamat&#8230; Kamat is part of <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Similar “reports” appeared in at least half a dozen other local newspapers, mostly Urdu. The Urdu Times carried the “news item” on page 12. The placement and pictures were similar to those in Hamara Mahanagar. Both the newspapers carried pictures of Sonia, Rahul, Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan and Kamat.</span></p>
<p>The “package” also appeared on the same day in several other publications like Inquilab and Avadhnama.</p>
<p>Hamara Mahanagar editor Raghvendra Nath Dwivedi denied any money had changed hands. He said: “It was an important development. Obviously, we will give it prominent display.” Besides the celebratory coverage spread across the bottom half of page 3, the daily did carry an objective news report on page 1.</p>
<p>Reached for a comment, the editor of Inquilab, an Urdu daily run by Mid-Day Infomedia Ltd, part of the Dainik Jagran Group, hung up the phone saying he would call back. He did not. He also took no more calls from The Indian Express.</p>
<p>Khalil Zahid, editor of Avadhnama, said: “I had met him (Kamat) after the announcement (of legalization of slums). After that I sent a reporter for the interview. We weren’t paid for the items we carried.” Avadhnama gave prominent display to the “interview-cum-news story” on its page 3.</p>
<p>An editor who did not want to be identified, however, confirmed that the “package” had been paid for. “What you have heard is true. Several dailies got this advertisement. The directive was to carry it in the form of a news story,” he said.</p>
<p>The Aam Aadmi Party has filed a complaint with both the Press Council of India (PCI) and the Media Certification and Monitoring Committee of the State Election Commission about the alleged paid news.</p>
<p>The complaint names Hindi dailies Navbharat and Hamara Mahanagar, and four Urdu dailies — Inquilab, Urdu Times, Sahafat and Avadhnama.</p>
<p>“We noticed that similar half-page news articles have been published in several Urdu, Hindi, Marathi and Gujarati newspapers. There were also a few television segments on a similarly positive note on Kamat but we had no real proof to report such cases,” AAP national executive member Mayank Gandhi said. Gandhi is the AAP candidate at Kamat’s seat.</p>
<p>Jatin Desai, who is part of the seven-member monitoring committee of the state election commission, said the panel would look into AAP’s complaint. “In case we find that this is paid news, we will write to the returning officer, who will in turn ask the candidate for his defence. If the candidate pleads guilty, which happens in 80 per cent of cases, the expense will be included in his election expenditure of Rs 40 lakh,” Desai said.</p>
<p>PCI chairman Justice Markandey Katju denied any knowledge of the development, but said action will be taken if anybody is found guilty.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001838&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sub-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001813" alt="sub-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sub-480.jpg" /></a> INS Sindhuratna at the naval dockyard in Mumbai after the mishap. (PTI Photo)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The navy is moving in fast to fix accountability for the spate of accidents that recently hit its frontline warship with rapid-pace inquiries that have now thrown up several reasons for the <a title="No battery malfunction, fire in sailors’ cabin behind Sindhuratna mishap" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/ins-sindhuratna-submarine-mishap-due-to-fire-in-cables-navy/" target="_blank">incidents</a> — from errors by the captains commanding the ships to faulty equipment and substandard quality of material.</span></p>
<p>With serious concern being raised by the highest levels of the government on the safety record of the navy that last month led to the resignation of Navy Chief Admiral <a title="INS Sindhuratna mishap: One more disaster under his watch, Navy Chief Admiral D K Joshi resigns" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/ins-sindhuratna-mishap-disaster-navy-chief-admiral-d-k-joshi-resigns/" target="_blank">D K Joshi</a>, expedited boards of inquiry have been instituted that have now come up with preliminary reasons for incidents.</p>
<p><a title="What ails the Indian Navy: 10 mishaps that led to the Navy Chief’s resignation" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/what-ails-the-navy-warships-10-mishaps-in-last-seven-months/" target="_blank">ALSO READ: What ails the Indian Navy</a></p>
<p>Sources said strict action would be taken in accordance with the findings of the inquiries and accountability is being fixed at the earliest to ensure that these are not repeated. Other than the sinking of the Sindhurakshak, which has still not been salvaged, most other major accidents have been investigated, officials have confirmed.</p>
<p>Consider the following: In the most recent case — the fire on board the <a title="INS Sindhuratna mishap: Two officers feared dead, 7 sailors injured" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/submarine-ins-sindhuratna-mishap-two-officers-trapped-inside-feared-dead-7-sailors-injured/" target="_blank">Sindhuratna submarine </a>that led to the death of two officers — it has emerged that an electrical cable caught fire after a possible short circuit. The fire is believed to have taken place at an electrical cable that is concealed behind a panel that is not supposed to be checked during the entire life of the Kilo class submarine.</p>
<p>Reports of issues in the batteries of the boat were incorrect since its batteries had been replaced with those brought from Vizag on the insistence of the Western Naval Command. The navy has found that the incident involving INS Talwar, the frontline frigate that smashed through a fishing vessel on December 23 resulting in injuries to several people, took place due to inadequate organisation on board the warship. The commanding officer of the ship has now been removed.</p>
<p>The Tarkash incident, when it met with an accident while berthing at the Mumbai naval base and suffered a gash in its hull, has been blamed by the inquiry on a ship handling error by the commanding officer, who is believed to since have been posted out. The INS Betwa accident, the Brahmaputra class guided missile frigate that was suspected to have either run aground or collided with an unidentified object on its approach to the Mumbai naval base and suffered a crack on its sonar dome mounted on the hull, has been attributed to a navigational error by its commanding officer who has since been removed from duty by the board of inquiry.</p>
<p>The incident involving the INS Sindhughosh, the leading submarine of the Kilo class that was ‘grounded’ near the Mumbai naval base on January 17, has been found to have occurred as the Mumbai harbour has not been dredged for four years due to objections by the Financial Advisor that have since been overruled by the Western Naval Command HQ.</p>
<p>The cause of the incident on board the INS Vipul, the Veer class corvette that suffered a breach in its tiller compartment, has been found to have occurred due to faults in the steel plates that were made by SAIL. The plates apparently cracked, leading to flooding in the ship that has since been sent back for repairs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001808&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Congress decision to send former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit to Kerala Raj Bhawan, virtually a post-retirement home for a 75-year-old politician who was seeking a fourth consecutive term in office just weeks ago, highlights the increasing despair in the ruling camp ahead of the elections.</p>
<p>Few would be inclined to lend credence to conspiracy theories linking gubernatorial immunity with alleged Commonwealth Games scams, and there are no plausible explanations for the haste with which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was required to choose Nikhil Kumar’s replacement shortly after his return from abroad Tuesday.</p>
<p>Despite the Congress’s drubbing in the assembly elections, Dikshit remained the party’s face in Delhi. Given her political experience, she was expected to be inducted into the Congress Working Committee with a key role at national level. In fact, both Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were praising the Dikshit government for transforming Delhi and at one point she was under consideration for a berth in the union cabinet.</p>
<p>Instead, she has been asked to join a list of party colleagues such as Shivraj Patil, Margaret Alva and H R Bhardwaj who were all rehabilitated in Raj Bhavans only because they remained Nehru-Gandhi family loyalists even when they had lost the party’s confidence in various situations. In terms of political relevance and administrative acumen, the Congress has leaders who would have served the country better from Raj Bhawans: A K Antony, Sushil Kumar Shinde, V Narayansamy, and, in fact, half the union council of ministers.</p>
<p>The shunting of a leader of Dikshit’s stature out of active politics weeks before the polls betrays what many Congressmen have been increasingly feeling : that Rahul has his sight set on the 2019 elections. The pervading sense of insecurity was amplified recently when the party nominated Sanjay Singh to the Rajya Sabha from Assam, just to shield Rahul Gandhi in Amethi where the AAP has fielded Kumar Vishwas. Singh had met Narendra Modi in January but couldn’t get any assurance about a Rajya Sabha berth if he, as a BJP candidate, loses to Rahul, according to BJP sources. A desperate Singh gleefully accepted the Congress’s offer to play Rahul’s saviour.</p>
<p>For now, Dikshit’s quick-fix appointment has sent out a wrong message: that the Congress does not expect to come back to power in this election.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/deepadasmunsim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002173" alt="Deepa Dasmunsi said people elect parties that will somehow go to the Centre.(Courtesy: PIB)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/deepadasmunsim.jpg" /></a> Deepa Dasmunsi said people elect parties that will somehow go to the Centre.(Courtesy: PIB)
<p><em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In this interview, union minister Deepa Dasmunsi mocks Mamata Banerjee for enlisting Anna Hazare’s support and explains why the Bengal Congress prevailed on Rahul Gandhi not to ally with the Trinamool Congress:</span></em></p>
<p><strong>What did Bengal Congress leaders discuss in the meeting with Rahul Gandhi in Delhi?</strong><br />
The consensus was that there should be no alliance. Though there are feelers from the state government (Trinamool Congress), Rahul Gandhi took a decision that since the Bengal PCC does not want any alliance&#8230; even if we are not organisationally very strong, we will fight on our own. (Because of the alliance), in a 200 km radius from Kolkata, we are totally washed out because we could not put up a candidate in (earlier) elections. To revive the party, regain the organisational strength, we have decided this.</p>
<p><strong>So what will the electoral strategy be?</strong><br />
The senior leadership will have to fight and face the challenge. If they are fighting the morale of the workers will get a boost.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Who will be contesting?</strong><br />
All senior leaders such as former PCC presidents, district presidents and even AICC office-bearers.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bengal PCC has a new president. What impact will that have?</strong><br />
Adhir Ranjan Choudhury is a hardcore Congressman. He has never bowed before the Trinamool. The morale of workers have gone up after his appointment. But one must realise that there is little time left and you cannot expect him to do some magic in such a short time. But it is a good move, the best possible move.</p>
<p><strong>Won’t the cases pending against him affect the party’s image?</strong><br />
He is a minister. And if he can be a minister with all the pending cases, which have not been proved in the court, how does it affect? Besides, all these are political cases. We all have political cases against us. The Trinamool Government has been foisting false cases on us. The Left Front government too had done that&#8230; These days most of our time and energy is spent on bailing out our workers.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you see Anna Hazare coming out in support of Mamata Banerjee?</strong><br />
Initially, Mamata projected herself as the symbol of honesty. She is a little hesitant about projecting that image now because of the chit fund cases and the way money flowed in the panchayat elections. People have come to know she may not be that honest. She always wears chappals, but look at her brother and nephew who have crores. Therefore she is hiring honesty from Maharashtra through Anna Hazare.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>There is also a view that she is using Anna to expand her footprint outside Bengal.</strong><br />
Maybe she thinks that Arvind Kejriwal, who had the support of Anna Hazare, has become chief minister of Delhi and is fighting national elections. So she too can use Hazare as the rope to reach Delhi. It is clear that her ambition is to become the prime minister.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>But how will it play out in Bengal?</strong><br />
If there are free and fair elections, then obviously issues such as the chit fund scam, teacher recruitment scam and the increase in rapes will go against the Trinamool. There is huge anti-incumbency against the state government. The Bengal electorate will also see who is coming to power at the Centre.</p>
<p><strong>Mamata Banerjee has been talking about the federal front.</strong></p>
<p>Who else is there? Only Chandrababu Naidu has met her. The third front has already been formed. Where is the federal front now? The people elect parties that will somehow go to the Centre.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001805&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The Supreme Court on Wednesday lashed out at Justice C S Karnan and termed his conduct as “indecorous” and “uncharitable”. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001802&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/supremecourtm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1976034" alt="SUPREMECOURTM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/supremecourtm.jpg" /></a> A bench led by Justice B S Chauhan said Justice Karnan’s “raw unconventional protest” was despicable.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Supreme Court on Wednesday came down heavily on Justice C S Karnan, who had stormed a Madras High Court room in January alleging the selection of judges was “not fair” and “irregular”, and termed his conduct as “indecorous” and “uncharitable”. </span></p>
<p>A bench led by Justice B S Chauhan said Justice Karnan’s “raw unconventional protest” of walking into a courtroom and making statements when a division bench was hearing a writ petition against the appointments of judges to the High Court “raised a negative murmur about the maintenance of propriety in judicial proceedings.”</p>
<p>The court said: “The sudden unfamiliar incident made us fume inwardly on this raw unconventional protest that was unexpected, uncharitable and ungenerous, and to say the least it was indecorous.”</p>
<p>On Justice Karnan’s complaints of an upper caste bias in appointment of judges, the bench said that he may have “found himself caught in a conflict of class or caste structure and it appears that matured patience might have given way to injure rules of protocol.”</p>
<p>The court observed that such conduct may require a more serious judicial assessment in future. The apex court pointed out that immense dignity was expected from the judges, and that weaknesses or personal notions should not be exposed so as to affect judicial proceedings.</p>
<p>With a “dignified reluctance touching disapproval,” the court refrained from passing any order against Justice Karnan, saying that it was presently concerned with a larger constitutional issue and such matters could be decided at an appropriate time.<br />
Justice Karnan is not new to controversies.</p>
<p>Last June, he had ruled that a couple indulging in “sexual gratification” could be legally considered husband and wife, setting off a furious debate about its implications.</p>
<p>In November 2011, he had created a flutter by alleging that fellow judges had humiliated him. He said dalit judges were targeted and their reputation tarnished whenever they asserted their self-respect. He had claimed that four-five HC judges had humiliated him on the basis of caste.</p>
<p>Justice Karnan, 59, set a precedent at that point in time by addressing a crowded press conference at his chambers in the High Court, where he said he was facing humiliation and embarrassment since April 2009.</p>
<p>He also was the first sitting judge in India to lodge a complaint of caste bias with the National Commission for SC/ST. “Some judges are very narrow-minded; they seek to dominate dalit judges,” Karnan had said.</p>
<p>In January this year, Karnan had sent a complaint to the Commission for Scheduled Castes in New Delhi against former Madras HC Chief Justice R K Agrawal, who has since been elevated to the apex court.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001802&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">JD(U) president Sharad Yadav Wednesday urged his workers not to have high expectations from the third front and said he may form another front if his party members don’t get a chance to contest Lok Sabha polls.</span></p>
<p>The front was constituted last month after 11 non-Congress, non-BJP parties came together to fight the elections together.</p>
<p>The JD(U) chief’s announcement is likely to come as a jolt to his allies, including SP chief Mulayam Chief Yadav, who has been eyeing a bigger national role.</p>
<p>Addressing party workers at a closed door meeting of the state executive committee in Lucknow, Sharad Yadav said, “Don’t have much expectations (from the third front). At the moment, the two parties (Congress and BJP) are engaged in their qawwali, which was given too much importance, so I also initiated one more qawwali. I am an expert in such work&#8230; bahut asha mat lagao (don’t pin high hopes).”</p>
<p>He also told party workers they are free to contest Lok Sabha elections in UP. “The arrangement of the third front is restricted to Delhi and no setting has been done at a local level. Those who want to contest polls should submit their applications,” he added.</p>
<p>“There are three ways — either there will be some adjustment in the third front, another is going alone in the polls. Lastly, if nothing materialises, we will form another front,” he said, reminding workers that the JD(U) had contested the 2009 Lok Sabha polls in UP.</p>
<p><strong>AGP to go it alone this Time</strong></p>
<p>The Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) has announced it would go alone in the elections. Efforts to work out an alliance with the BJP had failed after several rounds of parleys after the latter’s state unit made it clear that it was against taking the regional party on board.</p>
<p>“We had tried for a tie-up in the greater interest of preventing split in the anti-Congress votes. We know it would have benefitted the BJP more than us. But now that that BJP’s state unit has clearly opposed an alliance, we are going it alone,” said AGP’s working president Atul Bora in Guwahati on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bora said the party has finalised its list of candidates for all the 14 Lok Sabha seats from the state. In 2009, the AGP had won one out of four seats it had contested, while the BJP had bagged four out of nine.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi may have touted Guwahati ‘primaries’ as one of the most successful attempts of his new experiment for selecting party candidates, but Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi doesn’t clearly think so.</p>
<p>Congress sources said the chief minister has informed the party high command that it would not be possible for him to assure the victory of Manas Bora, who had won the Guwahati primary to be nominated as the party’s official candidate for the Lok Sabha seat.</p>
<p>It is understood that Gogoi has the backing of at least seven Congress MLAs under Guwahati Lok Sabha constituency who have made it known to the party that they were not in a position to guarantee Bora’s victory.</p>
<p>Sources in state unit said Gogoi wants either Guwahati (East) MLA Captain Robin Bordoloi or state Congress chief Bhubaneswar Kalita to be given the party ticket from Guwahati so that they could wrest the prestigious constituency from the BJP.</p>
<p>While Bordoloi had lost to BJP’s Bijoya Chakravarty in 2009 Lok Sabha polls, Kalita had represented Guwahati in the 12th Lok Sabha.</p>
<p>Gogoi is understood to have impressed the party high command that Bordoloi has a better chance of winning this time since he had lost by a narrow margin of 11,855 votes against the BJP and AGP’s joint candidate in 2009. With the BJP and AGP fighting the polls separately this time, Gogoi feels the chances of Bordoloi’s victory are bright.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001801&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shiv Sena Wednesday called Nitin Gadkari an astute “businessman” adept at setting up deals after the BJP leader reached out to rival MNS Chief Raj Thackeray and it also ruled out expanding the Opposition’s grand alliance.</p>
<p>Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, who is said to be upset over the recent meeting between Gadkari and Raj, targeted the former BJP president in an editorial of his party mouthpiece Saamana. “Gadkari is so skilled that without offering any dakshina (money offered for one’s services) to the MNS chief, he has sought his support. There is no doubt in the mind of the people of Maharashtra that Gadkari is an adept businessman. In the field of politics also, he has developed a skill to get whatever he wants without investing any capital,” Uddhav was quoted as saying in Saamana.</p>
<p>Gadkari had met Raj two days back, triggering speculation that BJP was trying to win over the MNS chief into the NDA.</p>
<p>“Gadkari asked the MNS chief not to field his nominees to avoid division in anti-Congress votes, which may harm Narendra Modi’s chances of becoming the PM,” Uddhav said. “If Gadkari has such reservations, then it may also give rise to questions whether the Modi wave is really strong enough.”</p>
<p><strong>Time to move ahead of Gujarat riots: Paswan</strong><br />
LJP Chief Ramvilas Paswan, who parted ways with the BJP in the wake of the 2002 Gujarat riots, Wednesday said in Patna that it is “time to move ahead”. “It has been 12 years since the Gujarat riots and it is time to move ahead. And why should 2002 be talked about in isolation? There was the Emergency against the Congress when people vowed not to support them,” he said.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Congress leader Ashok Chavan, who had to resign as the chief minister of Maharashtra following allegations of wrongdoings in Adarsh Society scam, returned to the centre stage of state as he shared the dais with party vice-president Rahul Gandhi at a rally in Aurangabad on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p>He was seen exchanging greetings and warm handshake with Rahul before occupying a seat next to him. Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan was also present.</p>
<p>While Congress sources said the public appearance of Chavan with Rahul signaled the party’s decision to forget Adarsh scam ahead of the elections, many within the ruling Congress-NCP alliance were taken aback by the development.</p>
<p>About three months ago, Rahul had publicly rebuked the state cabinet’s decision to reject the Adarsh panel report and said that he didn’t agree with it.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the state government reversed its decision and accepted the recomendations of the panel.</p>
<p>“Having Ashok on the dais with Rahul is perceived in the state Congress as a tactical shift to re-look the alleged role of Ashok Chavan in Adarsh (case) more objectively,” said a senior party leader. Over the last few months, both state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre and general secretary in-charge of Maharashtra Mohan Prakash have impressed upon the leadership that the former CM cannot be kept out of campaigning. A highly-placed source in the state unit said, “The party has recommended Ashok Chavan’s candidature to the central screening committee for Nanded seat.”</p>
<p>The Opposition, however, did not lose an opportunity to criticise the Congress. State BJP president Devendra Fadnavis said, “This exposes the double standards of Congress leadership, both at Centre and state on corruption. If Rahul is willing to forget the Adarsh scam, it shows power politics assumes more significant than corruption.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001796&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/trsm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002041" alt="Even as the TRS rejected the demand for merger and set up a committee under Keshava Rao to explore the option of alliances, Congress was preparing to go it alone in Telangana. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/trsm1.jpg" /></a> Even as the TRS rejected the demand for merger and set up a committee under Keshava Rao to explore the option of alliances, Congress was preparing to go it alone in Telangana. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Apprehensive of<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/congress-readies-to-walk-alone-in-andhra-as-trs-rules-out-merger/"> Telangana Rashtra Samiti </a>(TRS) chief K Chandrasekhar Rao “doing a Ramvilas Paswan” in Andhra Pradesh, a jittery Congress on Wednesday gave up its “merger-or-fight” stance vis-a-vis the TRS, saying that it is also open to an alliance.</span></p>
<p>While stressing that the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/trs-chief-chandrasekhara-rao-man-with-the-muscle-in-telangana/">TRS</a> had promised to merge with the Congress after the creation of Telangana state, AICC general secretary in charge of Andhra Pradesh Digvijaya Singh said the party was ready to have an alliance with the TRS and would form a group of senior leaders to explore this option. It was a significant departure from the stance the party took in its negotiations with TRS leaders in the days after Parliament’s approval of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill.</p>
<p>The TRS, which rejected the demand for merger Monday, chose to play it hard with the Congress making no reaction to its latest overtures. “Our committee will meet tomorrow to discuss who we should go with. The committee has been authorised to decide all pre- or post-poll alliances,” Keshav Rao, who heads the TRS panel on alliances, told The Indian Express. Asked if there is a possibility of the TRS going with the BJP, he said, “Nothing has been decided. I have also heard Digvijaya Singh talking about alliance but there are no talks yet. We haven’t discussed anything.”</p>
<p>During KCR’s meetings with top Congress leaders after Parliament’s approval of the Telangana Bill, the ruling party had told him categorically that he should abide by his stand about merger with the Congress after the creation of Telangana or “we should fight against each other”. The Congress had also rejected KCR’s demand that elections should be conducted for two separate states and before that he be appointed CM of Telangana if the TRS were to merge with the Congress. Even as the TRS rejected the demand for merger and set up a committee under Keshava Rao to explore the option of alliances, the Congress was preparing to go it alone in Telangana.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, however, the Congress blinked as the TRS reportedly started exploring the option of allying with the BJP, which had also supported Telangana Bill. The BJP was said to be keen as it would provide the party a launching pad in Telangana. With TDP reportedly reconsidering its option of an alliance with BJP in residuary Andhra state, the latter may find a more receptive partner in the TRS in Telangana.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001791&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">After hobnobbing with Aam Aadmi Party and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, whom he met only a day earlier, Maulana Tauqueer Raza Khan — the Barelvi cleric who had issued a fatwa against Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen — on Wednesday floated a new party, Hindustan United Movement (HUM), along with Acharya Pramod Krishnam of the Bharatiya Sant Samiti. Both had met Kejriwal for two hours on Tuesday. </span></p>
<p>HUM has decided to field candidates for Lok Sabha elections across the country, but if Kejriwal contests against BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, the party would not field a candidate against him.</p>
<p>Raza already has a party, Ittihad-e-Millat Council, which was part of the Samajwadi Party government in Uttar Pradesh, but parted ways after Muzaffarnagar riots. Krishnam had this year lodged a police complaint against RSS leader Indresh Kumar for threatening him.</p>
<p>“There are two kinds of corruption in the country, commercial and communal. Kejriwal raised the issue of commercial corruption but there is also a need to talk about communal corruption. Hence HUM,” Krishnam said. The two asked BSP and SP not to field candidates, if Kejriwal takes on Modi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001784&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>From Mahatma Gandhi to Rahul Gandhi, the Congress says it gets inspiration from its pantheon of illustrous past and present leaders. But P V Narasimha Rao is certainly not inspiring enough for the Congress. The revamped Congress website has a section titled “Our inspiration”.</p>
<p>Besides the Mahatma, it names Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel, Subhash Chandra Bose, Maulana Azad, K Kamaraj, B R Ambedkar, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Jagjivan Ram, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi and provides their profiles. Rao is missing and perhaps it is not surprising given the Congress’s reluctance to acknowledge his contributions, the most important being the opening up of the economy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">FAMILY TIES<br />
</span></strong>FOUNDER of popular Bengali folk band “Bhoomi” and renowned percussionist Soumitra Roy’s name in the list of TMC candidates surprised many in the party. He is being fielded from Malda North, a Congress bastion. His mother Manjula Ray was the South Kolkata Youth Congress chief back in the days when Mamata started her political career in the Congress and both shared a good rapport. TMC insiders said that in many ways Roy’s mother happened to be Mamata’s “first boss” and the family went back to the days when Mamata was a teenager.</p>
<p><strong>PARADING CHAMPS<br />
</strong>AFTER many months in the party organisation, Congress general secretary Ajay Maken is banking on his tenure as sports minister to romp home this elections. Maken has lined up a slew of sportspersons, including Olympic medal winners M C Mary Kom, Vijender Singh, and former sprint queen P T Usha lauding his commitment to sports in radio ads. Mary Kom and Vijender credit him with the infrastructure that helped them prepare for medal-winning performances.</p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER EXTENSION</strong><br />
THE environment ministry appears to have a dearth of talent as far as animal-related experts are concerned. That alone can explain why Maj Gen (Retd) Dr R M Kharb, a distinguished veterinarian, has won a fourth consecutive term as chairman, Animal Welfare Board of India. Not to be left behind, his deputy Dr S Chinny Krishna has been appointed vice-chairman of AWBI for the third time. AWBI, incidentally, comes with a rather illustrious Board which has for its members, the Prime Minister, the President, founder chairman AWBI Rukmini Arundale and the sitting chairman.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001779&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had an eventful Day 1 on his first tour to Gujarat since his Delhi victory. He was “detained” for 30 minutes at Radhanpur police station in north Gujarat and his car was attacked in Kutch.</span></p>
<p>Kejriwal’s four-day tour to “assess” Gujarat’s development model coincided with the announcement of Lok Sabha elections and the enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At Radhanpur, after Kejriwal finished his third public interaction at Gayatri Shaktipeeth, he was taken to the police station around 3 pm and told that his convoy was violating traffic rules and the MCC. He was told he would have to be detained on orders of the collector.</p>
<p>Patan district SP Parikshita Rathod, however, told The Indian Express, “He was asked if he had the necessary permissions for the road show since the MCC is in effect now. There was no detention or arrest.”</p>
<p>A commotion ensued as Kejriwal asked for papers ordering his detention. In the meanwhile, AAP supporters staged a dharna outside the Radhanpur police station, shouting anti-Modi slogans. After Kejriwal was let off, the convoy proceeded towards Kutch where at Kharoi village in Bhachau, he was greeted with black flags — the fourth such demonstration on Wednesday, after Sankheshwar (Surendranagar district), Sami and Radhanpur (Patan district). Later, one of the flag-weilders threw the mast at the Innova car that Kejriwal was riding, shattering the windshield.</p>
<p>Before this, Kejriwal had declared at Echchwada village that his party would fight all 26 LS seats in Gujarat and later told mediapersons that he had not ruled out an electoral contest against BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001781&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To cater to the rising needs of major metropolises, it is important to create urban “agglomerations” by linking small towns and cities with the megacities, said noted economist and author Dr Isher Judge Ahluwalia at the Express Adda in Mumbai on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ahluwalia and Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan discussed various issues related to urban planning and growth at the Adda, which was moderated by Shekhar Gupta, Editor-in-Chief of the Express Group.</p>
<p>“While I am all for creating new cities, planned cities, the challenge of renewing existing cities also needs to be tackled&#8230; We need linkage of cities with each other. We need to create agglomerations around major cities,” said Ahluwalia, whose book, Transforming our Cities: Postcards of Change, was launched last month as part of the Express Book series.</p>
<p>Chavan said his government was trying to do this in Mumbai — creating an agglomeration around the city by including areas such as Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombiwali and Mira-Bhayander.</p>
<p>However, he pointed out that there are several political differences that the government has to deal with. “We are thinking of bifurcating the Thane district for better administration. I was to do that today, but I don’t think it will be possible. There are some political compulsions,” he said.</p>
<p>Citing the example of the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation, Chavan said, “Ruling parties don’t want to spend money on building roads in industrial areas because they don’t have voters there.”</p>
<p>He said the government is also focussing on empty areas, creating social and physical infrastructure as well as economic opportunities to draw people. The state government is creating an industrial township in Aurangabad, along the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, and new settlements in Navi Mumbai and Nagpur, he said.</p>
<p>“There is rapid urbanisation in Maharashtra. The state is almost 50 per cent urban today. Just yesterday, we decided to convert 138 gram panchayats into nagar palikas,” he said. Ahluwalia said in other states, the gram panchayats resist any move to convert them into municipalities. “There are about 2,000 towns that the Census has declared as being ready to become nagar panchayats, but the political establishment is not giving them a local government strong enough to support the growth,” she said.</p>
<p>“Maharashtra, as a state, has a good capacity to manage and Gujarat has developed a good capacity to plan. There are many states where the local governments are completely dependent on the state governments. When you do not have a guaranteed revenue base, it is not possible to plan,” she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001740&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p> Condemning the attack on its office, BJP on Monday accused Aam Aadmi Party of attempting to vitiate the environment ahead of Lok Sabha polls and urged the Election Commission to take note of it.<br />    <br />&#8220;I strongly condemn the AAP’s violent protest at the gates of BJP office today in Delhi. It shows AAP&#8217;s undemocratic and anarchist character,&#8221; BJP President Rajnath Singh said.<br />  <br />BJP Vice President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, &#8220;AAP has displayed anarchy and violence on the day election has been declared in the country. They are trying to disturb and vitiate the peaceful atmosphere in the country which could affect free, fair and peaceful conduct of polls, which is the hallmark of democracy.&#8221;<br />    <br />He said, &#8220;It is the duty of the Election Commission to check that the party to which it has given recognition recently is not ready to accept the Constitution, democratic values, the law of the land as well as the Model Code of Conduct.&#8221;<br />    <br />Naqvi accused AAP of being &#8220;the gentle face of Maoism&#8221; and said they think they are a law unto themselves.<br />    <br />&#8220;They are trying to hijack democracy through anarchy,&#8221; he charged.<br />   <br />Rajnath Singh said on twitter, &#8220;Being a responsible political party the BJP does not believe in anarchy and violence.&#8221;He also appealed to the BJP workers across the country to stay calm and peaceful.<br />    <br />Talking about AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, who was detained in Gujarat after the Model Code was enforced with the declaration of Lok Sabha poll schedule, Naqvi said some people think they are a law unto themselves.<br />    <br />&#8220;For any programme that has to take place during the Model Code of Conduct, prior permission of the Chief Electoral Officer has to be taken, which Kejriwal had not,&#8221; he said, adding no one is stopping Kejriwal from seeing the development that has taken place in Gujarat.<br />    <br />AAP workers today fought pitched battles with BJP activists outside the saffron party headquarters here hours after Kejriwal was detained briefly in Gujarat.<br />   <br />Kejriwal also accused Modi of trying to stall his visit to Gujarat after he was briefly &#8220;detained&#8221; by police and said he did not find any evidence of development claimed by Chief Minister Narendra Modi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001725&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/votingm2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001995" alt="The total electorate is 814 million, 10 crores more than the last Parliament elections. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/votingm2.jpg" /></a> The total electorate is 814 million, 10 crores more than the last Parliament elections. (Reuters)
<p>For the first time, the<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/lok-sabha-polls-on-april-10-three-way-fight-begins/"> Lok Sabha elections</a> will be held in nine phases — from April 7 to May 12. Announcing the poll schedule on Wednesday, the Election Commisson of India said counting of votes will be done on May 16 and the results will be announced on the same day.</p>
<p>Assembly elections will also be held simultaneously in the states of Andhra Pradesh, including the Telangana region, Orissa and Sikkim.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/elections-2014-map-web.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2002143" alt="elections-2014-map-web" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/elections-2014-map-web.jpg?w=358&#038;h=600"   /></a></p>
<p>While a bulk of the polling — in as many as 525 constituencies — will take place on six days, only 18 constituencies will vote on the remaining three polling days. The maximum number of constituencies (122 across 13 states) will vote on April 17, followed by 117 constituencies across 12 states on April 24.</p>
<p>Most of the constituencies in the Naxal-affected states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and Bihar will vote on April 10, April 17 and April 24. In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, polling will be held on six days. In West Bengal and Jammu &amp; Kashmir (which has only six constituencies), polling will be held on five days.</p>
<p>The total number of days for the entire electoral process has been brought down from 75 days in 2009 to 72 days this time.<br />
EC officials said various factors like school examinations, holidays, festivals (mainly Bihu in Assam), harvest season in some parts of the country and the weather forecast, particularly about monsoon, had to be taken into consideration. Moreover, the availability of security forces and time taken by them to move from one state to another were also important, they said.</p>
<p>“Keeping in view the interests of the students and also the fact that polling stations are mostly located in school buildings and teachers are engaged as polling personnel, the commission has consciously factored in the examination schedules of various state boards, including the Central Board of Secondary Education, in the process of finalising the poll dates,” said Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath.</p>
<p>He said “other relevant factors like various holidays and festivals falling in the months of March, April and May, harvest season in certain parts of the country and the inputs obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department on the pre-monsoon rainfall, onset and spread of monsoon and acute hot weather conditions in certain parts of the country” had also been taken into consideration.</p>
<p>A staggering 81.4 crore voters, almost 10 crore more than the last Lok Sabha polls, will be eligible to cast their votes this time. According to EC officials, there been a remarkable increase in the enrolment of voters in the age group of 18 to 19 years, with over 2.3 crore voters falling in this age group.</p>
<p>As many as 28,314 transgenders enrolled as “others”, 11,844 overseas electors and 13.28 lakh service electors will also vote during these polls. With an almost 12 per cent increase from last time, the number of polling stations has increased from 8.3 lakh to 9.3 lakh.</p>
<p>The model code of conduct came into force as soon as the poll schedule was announced. “We don’t agree that the model code of conduct is not effective. There is no reason to doubt its efficacy. Also, we never hesitate to use the powers available, but the commission cannot use the powers which are not available to it,” said the CEC. He added that the “model code of conduct is an instrument to ensure that the “level-playing field is not disturbed”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001723&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Confident that BJP would not come to power in thisd year&#8217;s Lok Sabha polls, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said that her party Trinamool Congress would emerge as the third largest party in the country.<br />   <br />&#8220;Trinamool Congress will be the third largest party in the country and will play a key role in forming government,&#8221; she said, while releasing the list of her party&#8217;s candidates for the Lok Sabha poll in West Bengal and some other states.</p>
<p>Trinamool Congress is not part of the third front floated recently by 11 parties incluing the Left. On her prime ministerial prospect, Banerjee, said, &#8220;I am not an astrologer. I am not in any competition. There are so many people aspiring. The people will decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stressed the importance of this Lok Sabha poll, saying there would be certain change of government at the Centre but ruled out BJP&#8217;s ascent to power.</p>
<p>She alleged that the ruling Congress and the BJP were working together, as evident in their mutual cooperation on the Telangana issue.<br />    <br />Taking a dig at UPA government for &#8220;corruption&#8221; she said, &#8220;We want a stable government. We want a industry-friendly and farmer&#8217;s friendly government. We want economic stability and electoral reforms&#8221;.<br />    <br />Criticising the Centre&#8217;s decision to raise expenditure limits for Lok Sabha elections to a maximum of Rs 70 lakh,<br />Banerjee reiterated her demand for state funding of elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is so much talk about black money and corruption, then why this move to increase the expenditure? I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s an attempt to legitimise black money, it&#8217;s unfortunate,&#8221; she said.<br />    </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001722&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/arvind3.jpg" /></a> Around 20 AAP supporters marched towards the BJP headquarters in Lucknow following which clashes took place between the two sides.
<p>After Aam Aadmi Party workers staged a protest outside the BJP headquarters in New Delhi, workers of the two parties clashed at several places including the national capital, Lucknow,  Allahabad and part of Gujarat. The trigger for the AAP protests was the detention of party leader Arvind Kejriwal during his Gujarat roadshow.</p>
<p>Around 20 AAP supporters marched towards the BJP headquarters in Lucknow following which clashes took place between the two sides.</p>
<p>In a late night conference AAP leader Prashant Bhushan claimed  that the BJP supporters had attacked AAP  workers who were  protesting peacefully in Delhi. He, however, apologised for some retaliatory stone throwing by AAP workers.</p>
<p>In Gujarat, there were reports that the car Kejriwal was using for his roadshow was damaged. &#8220;Attackers threw a stick on Kejriwal&#8217;s car due to which the windshield was damaged,&#8221; said former BJP MLA and AAP leader Kanu Kalsaria. &#8220;Everybody knows that they are BJP workers,&#8221; he claimed.</p>
<p>AAP Gujarat convener Sukhdev Patel claimed hundreds of people greeted Kejriwal during his day-long visit. Kejriwal was on Gujarat tour to &#8220;verify&#8221; the claims of development in the Narendra Modi-led state.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001704&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/supremecourtm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1976034 " alt="Ansals were more concerned about making money than ensuring safety, SC said." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/supremecourtm.jpg" /></a> SC pulled up members of Chennai Bar for taking &#8220;pre-mature step&#8221; of filing a petition against recommendation for appointment of judges. (PTI)
<p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up members of Chennai Bar for taking &#8220;pre-mature step&#8221; of filing a petition against recommendation for appointment of judges to Madras High Court and disapproved of the conduct of a sitting judge there who had interfered with a hearing in the case.</p>
<p>The apex court said conduct of Justice C S Karnan, who on January 9 walked in as a special bench of the high court was hearing the matter, &#8220;raised a negative murmur about the maintenance of propriety in judicial proceedings&#8221;.</p>
<p>Justice Karnan had said the choice of judges to be appointed was not fair.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sudden unfamiliar incident made us fume inwardly on this raw unconventional protest that was unexpected, uncharitable and ungenerous, and to say the least it was indecorous,&#8221; a bench comprising justices B S Chauhan, J Chelameswar and M Y Eqbal said.</p>
<p>While deliberating on the issue of petition seeking recall of the 12 names recommended by the collegium of the High Court, the apex court said instead of waiting for the proposal to be considered by the collegium headed by Chief Justice of India they took a &#8220;premature step&#8221; of filing the petition before the Madras High Court.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thus, it is apparent that judicial review is permissible only on assessment of eligibility and not on suitability. It is not a case where the writ petitioners could not wait till the maturity of the cause i.e. decision of the collegium of this court.</p>
<p>&#8220;They took a premature step by filing writ petitions seeking a direction to Union of India to return the list sent by the collegium of the Madras High Court without further waiting its consideration by the Supreme Court collegium.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the Justice Karnan incident, the bench said, &#8220;In ordinary life, such incidents are not reviewed with benevolence or generosity, but here we are concerned with a larger constitutional issue of the justiciability of the cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the bench said the &#8220;personal conduct&#8221; of the sitting judge, who was not a party to the proceedings before the high court &#8220;does not require any judicial response for investigating the unusual circumstances and scrutinising the same as it is not necessary to decide the issue at hand&#8221;.&#8221;The judge may have found himself caught in a conflict of class or caste structure and it appears that matured patience<br />
might have given way to injure rules of protocol, but that is not the issue that has to be answered by us. Such aspects may require a more serious judicial assessment if required in future and therefore this question is left entirely open,&#8221; the bench said.</p>
<p>However, it observed that &#8220;It is said that immense dignity is expected, and weaknesses or personal notions should not be exposed so as to affect judicial proceedings.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judges cannot be governed, nor their decisions should be affected, only by the obvious, as proceedings in a court are conducted by taking judicial notice of such facts that may be necessary to decide an issue.&#8221;It is for this reason, that the paramount principle of impartiality that is to be available in the character of a judge has been humbly expounded by none other than Justice Felix Frankfurter,&#8221; the bench said.</p>
<p>It referred to the apex court judgement to suggest that even after the President accepts the recommendations and warrants of appointment are issued, the court is competent to quash the warrant wherein the recommendations were found not possessing eligibility for the elevation to the high court as per Article 217(2).</p>
<p>&#8220;In such a fact-situation, the writ petitioners or the members of the Bar could approach the Chief Justice of India or the Law Minister, but instead of resorting to such a procedure, the writ petitioners had adopted an unwarranted short cut knowing it fully well that on the ground of the suitability, the writ petitions were not maintainable,&#8221; the bench said.</p>
<p>The High Court on January 8 and 9 had passed interim orders to maintain status quo regarding the process of recommendation of 12 aspirants after the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court had forwarded the proposal to the Supreme Court collegium for consideration.</p>
<p>The high court challenged the interim orders before the apex court which on January 13 directed maintaining of status quo and transferred the petitions to the top court.</p>
<p>During the hearing, the bench was informed that the apex court collegium by the resolution of February 13 returned the whole list of advocates as well as of judicial officers, with intimation to the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and the Governor with an observation that the new Chief Justice of Madras High Court as and when appointed, would re-look into the matter.</p>
<p>The Chief Justice of the High Court would send recommendations in consultation with two senior most colleagues after taking into consideration all the relevant facts.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001717&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>With 4.5 lakh first time voters, Assam will see a total of 1.87 crore electors exercising their franchise to elect the representatives during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in April-May.</p>
<p>&#8220;The elections in Assam will be held in three phases. We have 1.87 crore people registered in the electoral rolls who can exercise their voting rights to elect 14 representatives,&#8221; Assam Chief Electoral Officer Vijayendra told reporters here.</p>
<p>The number of voters this year constitute 57.25 per cent of Assam&#8217;s total population and it has gone up by 13 lakh from 1.74 crore voters in last Lok Sabha elections in 2009, he said.    </p>
<p>&#8220;We published the latest electoral rolls in January this year and the number has increased by 6.6 lakh from the last rolls in January 2013,&#8221; the CEO said.       </p>
<p>When asked about the first time voters, Vijayendra said 4.5 lkh youngsters in the age group of 18-19 years would vote for the first time in the Lok Sabha elections .</p>
<p>Talking about the &#8216;D&#8217; (doubtful/disputed/dubious) voters, the CEO said the number stands at around 1.42 lakh in the state.    </p>
<p>On Election photo identity card (EPIC), he said Assam will have its first election with such identification system<br />although it already exists in other parts of the country.<br />    </p>
<p>When asked how much could be the total expenditure of the three-phase elections in Assam, Vijayendra said: &#8220;It is estimated to be around Rs 82 crore. During the last Assembly elections in Assam in 2011, we had spent around Rs 79 crore.&#8221;    </p>
<p>Speaking about the polling stations, he said the elections would be held at 24,275 polling stations across the<br />state, which is an increase of 28.93 per cent from 18,828 booths in 2009 Lok Sabha elections</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001710&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>After announcement of Lok Sabha elections, BJP today said it was ready to take on Congress which will be ousted due to its corruption and misgovernance coupled with price rise that has hurt the common people of the country.</p>
<p>With Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 seats, a priority state, BJP also sought blacklisting of 132 officials there and urged the Election Commission not to give them any poll-related work, alleging that they &#8220;have acted like party workers&#8221; in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;BJP is ready for elections and would declare its candidates soon&#8230;. Congress&#8217; corruption company and ordinance factory has been locked. &#8220;In every phase of this election, public will put a nail in the coffin of the Congress regime due to corruption and misgovernance by it and due to the price rise that has hit the common man. The party has completed all formalities for polls and appointed conveners and incharges in all nine lakh polling booths,&#8221; BJP Vice President Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.</p>
<p>He said the party has decided to launch the &#8220;One note, Kamal par vote&#8221; programme in a big way, besides working on social media, which has an important role to play in these elections. The BJP leader said the party is also chalking out a programme of top party leaders like Narendra Modi, Rajnath Singh, L K Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley to address public meeting across the country.</p>
<p>Attacking the Congress and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, he said they have no achievement to show to the public and the ruling party today stands in despair and disappointment ahead of their impending defeat. &#8220;This election will completely wipe out the Congress due to its misdeeds. BJP will emerge victorious and will<br />
get a majority going by the atmosphere in favour of the party and our prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The party, he said, had fielded 433 candidates in the 2009 elections against 382 in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001713&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/guj-med1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001714" alt="Pan-Gujarat figure of expenditure sensitive areas was not divulged by the Election officials. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/guj-med1.jpg" /></a> Pan-Gujarat figure of expenditure sensitive areas was not divulged by the Election officials.
<p>The auto-hubs of Gujarat, including Sanand and Viramgam in Ahmedabad district, have been declared as &#8220;expenditure sensitive&#8221; areas by the Election Commission of India for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the areas that have seen significant inflow of cash or wealth in the recent past and where the population can be overwhelmed or be subject to inducement,&#8221; said Roopwant Singh, the Ahmedabad district collector on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the last few years, both these regions of the district have seen a lot of wealth flowing into bank accounts of the land-holding farmers after state government made large-scale land acquisitions for developing industrial nodes and auto-hubs that currently houses to automobile companies like Ford Motors, Tata Motors and Maruti Suzuki. For instance, Gujarat government, during the last two years, acquired 3200 hectares of land from farmers in Sanand and about 800 hectares in Viramgam taluka.</p>
<p>Sanand is part of Gandhinagar Parliamentary constituency currently represented by veteran BJP leader LK Advani, while Viramgam falls under the Surendranagar constituency.</p>
<p>Apart from Sanand and Viramgam, the other &#8220;expenditure sensitive&#8221; areas in Ahmedabad district are Dariapur (Ahmedabad-West), Danilimda (Ahmedabad-West), Vejalpur (Gandhinagar) and Daskroi (Kheda Parliamentary constituency).</p>
<p>Apart from the one flying squad that has been deployed to monitor election expenses at each &#8220;assembly constituency&#8221;, the ECI has also deployed an additional flying squad in these &#8220;expenditure sensitive&#8221; areas, Singh added.</p>
<p>However, a pan-Gujarat figure of expenditure sensitive areas was not divulged by the Election officials. When asked the total number of such &#8220;expenditure sensitive&#8221; pockets in Gujarat, the chief electoral officer, Anita Karwal said, &#8220;We would not like to part with this information. It might actually defeat the purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chief Electoral Office of Delhi has submitted its report to the Election Commission of India on the issue of over-expenditure involving former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal during Assembly election campaigning in December last year.</p>
<p>According to the report, Kejriwal had spent over Rs 21 lakh during the campaigning while the maximum limit of expenditure in the Assembly poll is fixed at Rs 14 lakh per candidate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The returning officer of the New Delhi Assembly constituency, the District election officer, and expenditure observer have submitted their reports to the Election Commission of India. The matter is in the active consideration of the ECI. ECI will now take a decision whether a case is made out for disqualification or not,&#8221; said Delhi&#8217;s Chief Electoral Officer, Vijay Dev.</p>
<p>AAP had showed an expenditure of Rs 5,45,000 for a concert organised by it on November 23 at Jantar Mantar during the campaigning. It came to the notice of the District Expenditure Monitoring Committee (DEMC) on December 2 which found that expenditure was to the tune of Rs 39,16,459 and was divided between three candidates &#8211; Arvind Kejriwal, Somnath Bharti and Surinder Singh.</p>
<p>However the party had argued that the expenditure should be included into the party&#8217;s account and not in the account of the candidates as the concert was organised by the party. Section 10A of the Representation of People’s Act states that if a person fails to give an account of election expenses and has no good reason or justification for failure, the Election Commission shall declare him disqualified and such person shall be disqualified for a period of six years.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001699&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lalum.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996311" alt="The Congress has agreed to leave the 'contentious' Madhubani seat for the RJD, and Lalu Prasad has agreed to give 12 seats." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lalum.jpg" /></a> The Congress has agreed to leave the &#8216;contentious&#8217; Madhubani seat for the RJD, and Lalu Prasad has agreed to give 12 seats.
<p>The RJD and Congress finalised a seat-sharing agreement for Bihar on Wednesday, said Lalu Prasad Yadav. The Congress has agreed to leave the “contentious” Madhubani seat for the RJD, and Lalu Prasad has agreed to give 12 seats — one more than his earlier offer  to the Congress.</p>
<p>As per the initial reports, Congress will fight from Sasaram, Kishanganj, Hajipur, Samastipur, Gopalganj, Nalanda, Patna Sahib, Supaul, Purnia, Valmiki Nagar, Aurangabad and Muzafarpur.</p>
<p>The Congress scaled down its position after the JD(U) rejected its last-moment offer for an alliance, and Lalu began to campaign on his own.</p>
<p>The Congress, which wanted Madhubani for its senior leader Shakil Ahmed, agreed to leave it for the RJD’s Abdul Bari Siddiqui, reopening the door for talks. In return, the RJD has agreed to give Sitamarhi and Khagaria to the Congress, and help the party get representation in the Bihar Legislative Council after its lone MLC Kumari Jyoti’s term ends.</p>
<p>Sources said the RJD had initially agreed to give Nawada to the Congress, but Lalu announced his own candidate during a public meeting in Rajauli, Nawada, on Monday. “It was tough posturing to impress upon the Congress the need to strike a deal fast. We knew the Congress was in talks with JD(U). There was bound to be some posturing,” an RJD source said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001674&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Around 19 lakh new voters in the age group of 18 to 19 years have been added to the electoral rolls. (PTI)
<p>With an aim to guard Naxal-hit areas, Bihar&#8217;s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Ajay V Nayak said on Wednesday that polling will be spread over six phases so that the central paramilitary forces could be made available on &#8220;d-day&#8221; in these areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of phases had to be increased to six in Bihar because we do not have adequate Central Paramilitary Forces as demanded and this could be made available from other areas for smooth conduct of elections particularly in the Maoists infested areas,&#8221; Nayak told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Naxal-affected areas of Bihar contiguous to Jharkhand will have polls together on April 10 to facilitate better security availability,&#8221; he said explaining the reasons for expanding polling to six days in Bihar.</p>
<p>Bihar will witness polling in six-phases on April 10, 17, 24, 30, May 7 and May 12. Six to seven Lok Sabha constituencies out of a total of 40 seats will go to polls in each phase.</p>
<p>A special camp shall be organised at all polling stations in the state on March 9 for voters to check their names in the electoral roll.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone has been left out or whose name has wrongly been deleted, he can immediately fill application for inclusion of name in form 6 and hand it over to the Block Level Officer (BLO),&#8221; Nayak said. &#8220;Voters should have Election Photo Identity Card (EPIC) and name in photo electoral roll to exercise their franchise&#8221;, he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001649&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>With Arunachal Pradesh being declared as one of the &#8220;most expenditure sensitive state&#8221; in the country, the Election Commission has constituted a high powered committee to monitor election expenditure in the state, Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) C B Kumar said today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The commission, based on inputs has identified 23 assembly constituencies (total 60 in the state) in six districts of the state as most expenditure sensitive,&#8221; Kumar told a press conference here. The districts include, West Siang, East Siang, Kurung Kumey, Lower Subansiri, Papum Pare and East Kameng, the CEO said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This time we are going to have targeted approach instead of general approach to monitor election expenditure in these districts,&#8221; he said adding, the other districts would also be under the commission scanner. The CEO said, as per commission&#8217;s directions, election expenditure monitoring (EEM) teams like video surveillance teams, video viewing teams, MCMC, flying squads and state surveillance teams have been constituted to check out any type of malpractices during elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;Banks have been asked to furnish daily reports on any abnormal withdrawal or deposit. Flying squads and state surveillance teams in each assembly constituency will check all the vehicles to ensure that no unaccounted cash of more than Rs 50,000 is carried by individual and political parties for election related activities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lok Sabha polls in Arunachal Pradesh for two constituencies would be held on April 9, while notification<br />
would be issued on March 15 and last date for filing nominations has been fixed on March 22 next. Scrutiny of papers would be conducted on March 24 while last date of withdrawal of candidature has been fixed on March<br />
26 next. Counting of votes would take place on May 16. Altogether 7,53,170 electorates including 3,77,272<br />
female would exercise their franchise in 2,158 polling stations in the state.</p>
<p>664 polling stations in the state are inaccessible while 8 polling stations are having less than 10 voters, 20 having less than 20 voters and 105 polling stations have less than 50 electors. The C Sector polling station at Itanagar has the highest number of 1,650 voters, while Malogaon polling station under Hayuliang in Anjaw district has only two voters.</p>
<p>The CEO informed that more than 15,000 government employees were being deployed to conduct the elections<br />
besides, 13 senior officers have been appointed as state nodal officers. &#8220;Central paramilitary force will be deployed throughout the state for creating conducive environment in addition to the state’s security forces,&#8221; he disclosed. The CEO said, the commission was focusing to check all kinds of inducements including cash, liquor and gift by any political parties. Moreover, he said, adequate number of general observers, police observers and expenditure observers were being deployed in the state who, would be coming from outside the state and would remain in the concerned district till declaration of the result.</p>
<p>On movement of poll personnel and materials to inaccessible polling stations, he stated that movement would<br />
be done in advance and enough air sorties have been requisitioned for transportation of men and materials.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001662&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/paswan-main1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995792" alt="Paswan claimed that BJP initially wooed him with an offer of 12 seats." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/paswan-main1.jpg" /></a> Paswan claimed that BJP initially wooed him with an offer of 12 seats.
<p>LJP President Ram Vilas Paswan on Wednesday said he had no regrets over returning to the NDA fold after 12 years and was driven to it by the &#8220;reticent approach&#8221; of RJD and Congress and signs of revolt within his own party.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did my best to work out an alliance with RJD and bring Congress on board, but the two parties wanted to drag seat- sharing talks over an indefinite period. &#8220;That left me with no option but to clinch a pre-poll tie- up with the BJP-led NDA,&#8221; he said at his first press conference here after joining NDA.</p>
<p>Paswan said he had apprehensions that Congress and RJD wanted to delay seat-sharing talks beyond the announcement of the parliamentary poll schedule, which has been proved true.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was apprehensive that they (Congress and RJD) would offer us only a couple of seats at the last minute, which we would have been forced to accept as there would have been no other option for us&#8230; Accepting an offer of a couple of seats would have been insulting for us and humiliating to our party,&#8221; he said. Paswan had quit NDA 12 years back over the 2002 Gujarat riots.</p>
<p>He said that although he personally favoured an alliance with Congress and RJD, his party cadre were getting restive with the attitude of the two parties which were refusing to acknowledge even the existence of LJP. It was the revolt brewing within Lok Janshakti Party overaligning with Congress and RJD on their terms that had tilted the scales in favour of an alliance with NDA, he said.</p>
<p>Paswan claimed that BJP initially wooed him with an offer of 12 seats but, in the end, his party agreed to the final offer of seven seats, including Hajipur (SC), from where he is to contest the Lok Sabha polls, and Jamui (SC), where his son Chirag would make his electoral debut.</p>
<p>Dismissing charges that he had done a &#8220;political somersault&#8221; by joining NDA for survival and to safeguard the political future of his son, Paswan said that had it been so, he would have accepted the offer to become the chief minister in 2005 after the Assembly polls in February of that year had thrown up a hung Assembly.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001615&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday attacked the Congress-led UPA government for denying special category status to the state under &#8216;political pressure&#8217; and appealed people to provide &#8216;strength&#8217; in the ensuing general elections and make Delhi hear them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delhi takat ki sunti hai (Delhi hears only those who have strength),&#8221; he said during a &#8216;Sankalp yatra&#8217; for the special category status to Bihar from Bagha in West Champaran district.</p>
<p>Kumar alleged that Congress and BJP teamed up to provide special category status and special package to Seemandhra but not to Bihar.</p>
<p>Confirming that Bihar&#8217;s special status would be JD(U)&#8217;s be main poll plank in the Lok Sabha elections, the chief minister said he would continue the struggle for the special category status to spur development till it was realised.</p>
<p>In an apparent dig at rival RJD which is in the final process of forging tie-up with Congress for the elections, Kumar said under &#8216;political pressure&#8217; the Centre put thespecial category agenda in &#8216;cold storage&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was every possibility to provide the status that will give tax benefits for setting up industries on the basis of the Raghuram Rajan committee report but in the last minute a brake was applied (under pressure of RJD) by calling off the Finance Secretary meeting on November 26 last year,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001644&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Karwal said that from the date of filing of nomination till the polling day, the EC will check candidates’ bank accounts thrice and all the details will be uploaded on the Chief Election Commission’s website.</p>
<p>There will be a total four state level nodal officers including for election expenditure, police, income tax and an SMS monitor. Karwal also said that parties advertisements on social media will also be monitored and the case of objections will be considered one by one as they come up. The EC in Gujarat will also do extensive use of social media for voters awareness campaign.</p>
<p>As per the CEC guidelines, in suspicious cases, candidates or party members with more than Rs 50,000 cash and gift articles more than Rs 10,000 will be seized by the flying squad. Besides, there will also be video surveillance squad, accounting squad, video viewing squad and static surveillance.</p>
<p>There will be two phone helplines. One would be about electoral list which will be chargeable, while the other will be for registering complains regarding model code of conduct which will be toll free. The details of district wise helplines will be put on website soon. Besides,  a helpline number 1950 across nation is already functional.</p>
<p>She said it is not yet clear that how many companies from outside the state will come, but other measures like web casting, micro observers comprising of (central government  and non-state government  officers on polling booths and video shooting at the polling booths will be done.</p>
<p>Cricketer Cheteshwar Pujara and tennis player Ankita Raina are state EC icon for conducting voters awareness drive.</p>

" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapsupporters480.jpg" /> Police detain supporters of former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejrival at Radhanpur, Gujarat.
<p>Scores of AAP supporters today staged a protest outside BJP headquarters here today hours after Arvind Kejriwal was<a title="Arvind Kejriwal released after brief detention in Gujarat over no permission for road show" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/arvind-kejriwal-detained-in-north-gujarat-over-no-permission-for-road-show/"> detained in Radhanpur</a> town of North Gujarat for violation of model code of conduct.</p>
<p>Police resorted to use of water canon to disperse the demonstrators.<a title="Let us see, says Kejriwal on contesting LS poll against Narendra Modi" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/let-us-see-says-kejriwal-on-contesting-ls-poll-against-narendra-modi/"> AAP activists</a> also clashed with BJP workers.</p>
<p>The demonstrators had reached the BJP headquarters at 11 Ashoka Road at around 5 PM. They shouted anti-Modi slogans claiming that the Gujarat police acted on the behest of BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate.</p>
<p>As he embarked on his four-day tour to verify Modi&#8217;s claims of providing water, power, education and healthcare to people of his state, the former Delhi Chief Minister was taken to Radhanpur police station in north Gujarat and allowed to go after half an hour.</p>
<p>Kejriwal alleged that the police had acted on the &#8220;orders from the top&#8221;. &#8220;We came to know in the morning itself that all the DSPs have been instructed to stop Kejriwal under any circumstances. Modi has also been sending some people with black flags.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/uddhav-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988057 " alt="Uddhav Thackeray" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/uddhav-main.jpg" /></a> Gadkari is an apt businessman-leader who has inked a deal with Raj said Uddhav Thackery. (PTI)
<p>Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray who is said to be upset over the recent meeting between MNS chief Raj Thackeray and Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday ruled out the possible inclusion of any new players in the &#8216;Mahayuti&#8217; (grand alliance) even as he took a dig at the former BJP chief by calling him an &#8220;apt businessman&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a good mood in &#8216;Mahayuti&#8217; (grand alliance of BJP-SS-RPI-RSP-SSS). Party cadres have started working hard. Therefore, people should not feel confused (over the meeting between Raj and Gadkari),&#8221; he told reporters at his residence &#8216;Matoshri&#8217; here.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue of forming an alliance with new parties is closed for us. The election programme has been announced. The battle has begun. We will only win this battle,&#8221; he said adding that he would be soon meeting the senior BJP leader.</p>
<p>Uddhav, who has been sulking since the meeting, attacked Gadkari in his party mouthpiece &#8216;Saamana&#8217;, saying that he is an apt businessman-leader who has inked a deal with Raj.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gadkari is so skilled that without offering any &#8216;dakshina&#8217; (money offered for one&#8217;s services) to the MNS chief, he has sought his support.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no doubt in the mind of the people of Maharashtra that Gadkari is an apt businessman. In the field of politics also, he has developed a skill to get whatever he wants without investing any capital,&#8221; Uddhav was quoted as saying in &#8216;Saamana&#8217;.</p>
<p>Gadkari, who enjoys a good rapport with Raj had met him at a suburban five-star hotel two days back, triggering speculation that BJP was trying to win over the MNS chief into NDA for upcoming elections even as he said there was no reason for Shiv Sena to be annoyed by his meeting with Raj.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001613&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday took suo motu cognisance of the incident of throwing ink on Sahara chief Subrata Roy a day ago in the court complex.</p>
<p>Underlining that the act invited charges for the contempt of court, a bench led by Justice R M  Lodha issued a notice to assailant Manoj Sharma.</p>
<p>The bench has asked him to explain why he should not be punished for the contempt of court for throwing ink on Roy.</p>
<p>The court noted that Roy was being produced in police custody in accordance with its order and hence Sharma&#8217;s act was in derogation of the authority of the court. The court will now take up the matter on March 24.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001586&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rahulgandhim5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993890 " alt="Rahul Gandhi pushed the anti-corruption bills to create a &quot;framework&quot; to fight graft. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rahulgandhim5.jpg" /></a> We want to empower you but BJP wants to hand over power to one man Rahul said, addressing a public rally. (PTI)
<p>In a veiled attack on Narendra Modi, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said the BJP wants to vest power in the hands of &#8220;one person&#8221;, and asserted that his party will drive out BJP like it forced out Britishers from India.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not one person but crores of people who run the country. We want to empower you but BJP wants to hand over power to one man,&#8221; Rahul said, addressing a public rally here.</p>
<p>&#8221;BJP leaders who call themselves Hindu haven&#8217;t read the Gita. Had they opened it, they would have realised that Congress party is not just an organisation but an ideology and no one can touch it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who tried to erase that ideology were driven out of the country. It was not the Congress but its ideology which defeated the British. The way Congress drove Britishers out with love, in the same way, Congress will drive out BJP,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Congress leader also launched a veiled attack on BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, saying &#8220;in Gujarat, three corrupt ministers are sitting in the Cabinet but their leader doesn&#8217;t see corruption.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They (BJP) speak of corruption but when their CM goes to jail in Karnataka, they don&#8217;t see corruption,&#8221; Rahul said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was BJP which tired to stall the Lokpal Bill,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the UPA regime, the number of roads built was three times bigger than during the NDA regime,&#8221; Rahul said, speaking of the achievements of the Congress-led government at the Centre. &#8220;Our opponents do not know India&#8217;s history,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001568&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Hours after Lok Sabha elections were announced, members of the <a title="AAP workers storm BJP office, turn it into a battleground" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/aap-workers-storm-bjp-office-turn-it-into-a-battleground/" target="_blank">Aam Aadmi Party</a> and the BJP came to blows on Wednesday evening in Gujarat, Delhi and Lucknow. </span></p>
<p>In Gujarat, <a title="AAP supporters clash with BJP workers in Delhi over Kejriwal’s detention in Gujarat" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/aap-supporters-clash-with-bjp-workers-kejriwals-detention/" target="_blank">BJP supporters</a> damaged AAP leader <a title="AAP’s first UP rally lays ground for Modi vs Kejriwal" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/aaps-first-up-rally-lays-ground-for-modi-vs-kejriwal/" target="_blank">Arvind Kejriwal’s</a> car. In Delhi and Lucknow, workers of the rival parties threw stones and chairs at each other, attacked each other with sticks, and shouted slogans.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash2_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002067" alt="AAPclash2_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash2_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=184" width="480" height="184" /></a></p>
<p>Clashes began after Kejriwal was briefly detained in Gujarat as he began a four-day tour to “assess” development in Narendra Modi’s home state. Around 3 pm, when he was at his third stop at Radhanpur in Patan district, he was taken to the police station for an alleged violation of the model code of conduct.</p>
<p>As Kejriwal demanded to see official papers, his supporters staged a dharna outside the police station, shouting anti-Modi slogans. Kejriwal was let off after 30 minutes, after which he drove around in an open jeep with slogan-shouting supporters in tow, before proceeding to Kutch.</p>

<p>There, at Kharoi village in Bhachau, he was greeted with black flags for the fourth time since arriving in Gujarat. A flag mast was later thrown at Kejriwal’s car.</p>
<p>As news of Kejriwal’s detention spread, AAP leaders in Delhi and Lucknow sent out bulk text messages to their supporters, calling them to join a protest outside the BJP offices in the two cities at 5 pm.</p>
<p>In Delhi, the protest began around 5.30 pm with 30-odd AAP supporters shouting anti-Modi slogans, but quickly turned ugly after some volunteers tried to pull down a hoarding on the wall of the BJP office, while some others tried to storm the office compound. A large group of BJP workers gathered on <span style="line-height:1.5em;">the other side of the gate shouted slogans against Kejriwal.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002068" alt="AAPclash_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=270" width="480" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>Soon afterward, BJP supporters carrying party flags and canes appeared outside the office and clashed with the AAP volunteers. Police turned water cannons on the mob, but the violence escalated, and both sides threw stones, lathis and chairs at each other.</p>
<p>Police said some 10-12 passersby who were caught in the crossfire suffered injuries on their hands and heads.</p>
<p>Senior AAP leaders including Ashutosh and Anand Kumar — both candidates in the Lok Sabha elections — former Delhi minister Rakhi Birla, and Shazia Ilmi too joined the protest. Ilmi denied that AAP supporters were responsible for the violence, and said the protest was a reaction to the detention of Kejriwal in Gujarat.</p>
<p>“His rally did not have any banners or flags. He was just meeting people. The rally had been planned in advance. How is it a violation of the model code of conduct?” Ilmi asked.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash3_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002069" alt="AAPclash3_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aapclash3_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>In Lucknow, about 40 AAP workers reached the state BJP office for a “candlelight” protest against Kejriwal’s detention. “We had planned to light candles outside the gate and leave a ‘Get well soon, Modi’ bouquet there. But before we could even reach the gates, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) workers attacked us,” alleged AAP’s Lucknow secretary Vishal Vikram Singh, who sustained injuries.</p>
<p>BJYM state vice president Raghvendra Tiwari, however, accused AAP workers of entering the party office and throwing stones. “Obviously when somebody attacks your home you try to defend it,” Tiwari said.</p>
<p>The outnumbered AAP workers were allegedly brutally beaten with sticks, and punched and kicked. “Each one of us was surrounded by three or four BJP workers,” Singh alleged.</p>
<p>An AAP worker was seen being attacked by nearly half a dozen BJP workers with sticks. Eight AAP workers were seriously injured; another three or four sustained minor injuries.</p>
<p>Additional SP (East) Rajesh Kumar said cross-FIRs had been registered against unidentified persons at Hazratganj police station on complaints from both sides.</p>
<p>AAP’s Prashant Bhushan said, “We apologise on behalf of some of our volunteers who threw stones back at them (BJP workers). In our nation’s democracy, there is no place for violence. In our party’s culture, there is no place for violence. We appeal to our volunteers across the country to not engage in any kind of violence.”</p>
<p>BJP president Rajnath Singh appealed for calm while condemning the AAP’s “violent protest”.</p>
<p>“I strongly condemn the AAP’s violent protest at the gates of BJP office today in Delhi. It shows AAP’s undemocratic and anarchist character,” Rajnath said in a statement.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001496&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class=" wp-image-2000857 " alt="gadkari-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gadkari-480.jpg" /> Gadkari, who enjoys a good rapport with Raj Thackeray asked the MNS chief not to field MNS nominees to avoid division in vote against Congress. (PTI)the division of votes,&#8221; Thackeray added.
<p>Continuing to target Nitin Gadkari over his plea to Raj Thackeray not to field candidates in Lok Sabha polls, Shiv Sena on Wednesday said the senior BJP is a &#8220;businessman, who has inked a deal with the MNS chief.</p>
<p>Gadkari, who enjoys a good rapport with Raj Thackeray, had met him at a suburban five-star hotel two days back, triggering speculation that BJP was trying to win over the MNS chief into NDA for upcoming elections even as he said there was no reason for Shiv Sena to be annoyed by his meeting with Raj.There is no doubt in the mind of the people of Maharashtra that BJP leader Nitin Gadkari is a thorough businessman. In the field of politics also he has developed a skill to get whatever he wants without investing any capital,&#8221;Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said in the editorial of his party mouthpiece &#8216;Saamana&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gadkari is so skilled that without offering any &#8216;dakshina&#8217; (money given for one&#8217;s services) to the MNS chief,he has sought his support.And there are reports that without paying or accepting any toll, the MNS chief has agreed to accept Gadkari&#8217;s plea,&#8221; the Sena chief said taking a dig at Raj over his recent agitation against toll.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gadkari asked the MNS chief not to field MNS nominees to avoid division in vote against Congress, which may harm Narendra Modi&#8217;s chances of becoming the Prime Minister,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>If Gadkari has such reservations, then it may also arise questions in the mind of common people whether the Modi wave is really strong enough, Thackeray said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modi is a strong leader and he has created a storm. There is a strong wave in favour of Modi not only there in Maharashtra, but in the entire country and Shiv Sena is strongly behind him. The Mahayuti (the five-party opposition alliance including Sena, BJP) has entered into the fray to win as many seats to support Modi become the Prime Minister,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8221;If Modi is great, the people of Maharashtra will wholeheartedly vote for him. Therefore, nobody should be concerned about the division of votes,&#8221; Thackeray added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001458&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/andra-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001489" alt="Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies would go to the respective states once the bifurcation process of the state is complete." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/andra-med.jpg" /></a> Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies would go to the respective states once the bifurcation process of the state is complete.
<p>Andhra Pradesh will have Lok Sabha and assembly polls as an undivided unit and the candidates elected will automatically become legislators of their respective states after Telangana comes into being on June 2.</p>
<p>Chief Election Commission V S Sampath explained that irrespective of the appointed day for the creation of the new state of Telangana, elections will be held to the Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies as they exist on Wednesday. The corresponding Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies would go to the respective states once the bifurcation process of the state is complete.<br />
&#8220;If an MLA is elected to any constituency which is part of undivided Andhra Pradesh today, the moment a new state is created, if he is part of Telangana, automatically he/she will become member of the Telangana Legislative Assembly,&#8221; Sampath said.</p>
<p>Andhra Pradesh will go to polls on April 30 and May 7. The poll schedule is such that constituencies in Telangana will have polling on April 30 while balloting in Seemandhra region will take place on May 7. Telangana region will have 17 Parliamentary constituencies and the Seemandhra region 25. Telangana, the country&#8217;s 29th state, will be born on June 2 and start functioning from that day. The Central government has issued a notification for creation of the new state after Parliament gave its approval on February 20 for bifurcating Andhra Pradesh. The Centre has imposed President&#8217;s rule in Andhra Pradesh after the resignation of Chief Minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001465&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/supremecourtm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1976034" alt="Ansals were more concerned about making money than ensuring safety, SC said." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/supremecourtm.jpg" /></a> Ansals were more concerned about making money than ensuring safety, SC said.
<p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday held businessmen Gopal and Sushil Ansal guilty of criminal negligence in the Uphaar cinema tragedy, upbraiding the brothers for their “contemptuous disregard” for the law.</p>
<p>The fire which broke out on June 13, 1997, when the cinema was screening the film Border, claimed 59 lives and left more than a hundred injured.</p>
<p>Despite the verdict, whether the Ansals would serve time in jail under penal charges remained undecided after the two judges on the bench differed on the quantum of punishment. Justice T S Thakur and Justice Gyan Sudha Misra referred the matter to a three-judge bench.</p>
<p>Upholding the Delhi High Court verdict of 2008, Justice Thakur said the brothers would undergo a sentence of one year each, as awarded by the HC. The HC had cut by half the two-year sentence awarded by the trial court.</p>
<p>However, Justice Misra, holding that the Ansals should undergo a sentence of two years, substituted the second year’s sentence with a fine of Rs 100 crore, to be paid equally by the brothers. She also directed that in view of his advanced age, Sushil Ansal’s sentence would be one that he has already undergone.</p>
<p>Justice Misra said the fine money would be used to build a trauma centre on a five-acre plot in west Delhi’s Dwarka area, to be allotted by the Delhi government. The trauma centre would be treated as an extension of the Safdurjung Hospital, Justice Misra said. The question of the sentence will now be decided by the larger bench.</p>
<p>Justice Thakur said in his judgment that the Ansals were more concerned about making money than ensuring the safety of their customers. Their “contemptuous” disregard for the law led to the loss of lives, he said.</p>
<p>“The brothers were at the helm of affairs at the time of the tragedy and therefore they cannot escape the blame and pass it on to others, including the municipal or electricity authorities. They owed a duty of care to the people who went to the cinema,” the court said.</p>
<p>The deaths were mainly due to the inability of the victims to exit the cinema complex, which led them to suffocate, the court said.<br />
The civil liability of compensation was decided by the Supreme Court in 2011. It ordered Rs 10 lakh each for the next of kin of victims above 20 years of age, and Rs 7.5 lakh for victims under 20 years. The Ansal brothers, who owned Ansal Theatre and Clubotels (P) Ltd, which ran Uphaar cinema, were asked to pay 85 per cent of the total compensation awarded.</p>
<p>The apex court was simultaneously hearing a petition by the Association of the Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT) for enhancement of punishment to the Ansals. Besides the Ansal brothers, three other convicts, Harsarup Panwar, Bir Singh and Brij Mohan Satija, have filed appeals challenging their conviction.</p>
<p>Neelam Krishnamurthy, who lost her daughter Unnati and son Ujwal in the tragedy, is spearheading the legal battle for the victims. Krishnamurthy, along with the families of other victims, had sought more stringent punishment so that such incidents did not recur.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001476&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kejriwal-main5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993080" alt="Kejriwal may contest elections against Modi, if he stands from anywhere outside Gujarat." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kejriwal-main5.jpg" /></a> Kejriwal may contest elections against Modi, if he stands from anywhere outside Gujarat.
<p>AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday did not rule out his election face-off with BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi, saying &#8220;let us see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Replying to a question if he will contest against Modi, Kejriwal said, &#8220;Let us see,&#8221; and added that to fight an election or not to fight it is not the main issue.  His party has earlier said that Kejriwal may contest elections against Modi, if he stands from anywhere outside Gujarat.</p>
<p>There are speculations that Modi might fight elections from one seat in Uttar Pradesh and one in Gujarat. However, BJP has maintained that it has not decided on the issue yet.</p>
<p>In reply to a question on former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit being made Governor of Kerala, Kejriwal alleged that it was an attempt to shield her from ongoing investigation where he, as the chief minister of Delhi, had filed an FIR against her for scam during Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p>Kejriwal also charged BJP with having double standard on the issue of dharna by Madhya Pradesh Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. &#8220;This is their double standard,&#8221; he said on a question of BJP accusing him of being anarchist when as a chief minister he sat on dharna even as their CM Chouhan is planning to stage a sit-in with his entire Cabinet.</p>
<p>Chouhan on Tuesday said that in view of the apathetic attitude of the Centre towards farmers, the entire Cabinet will stage a sit-in in Bhopal tomorrow during a day-long bandh call given by the BJP. Kejriwal is on a four-day tour of Gujarat to verify development claims of the Modi government.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001446&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rahul-main6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992922" alt="&quot;My request to you, specially tribal youth, is to join mainstream politics,&quot; Rahul said." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rahul-main6.jpg" /></a> &#8220;My request to you, specially tribal youth, is to join mainstream politics,&#8221; Rahul said.
<p>Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said whether he becomes the Prime Minister or not is immaterial but what matters is that all Indians, including women and youth, feel it is their country.</p>
<p>The Congress leader was interacting with tribal youth at an engineering college in Shirpur, as he began his two-day Maharashtra tour.</p>
<p>Responding to best wishes from a youth for becoming the Prime Minister, Rahul said, &#8220;My becoming or not becoming PM does not matter. What is most important is that everyone here, specially women and youth in country feel that this is their own country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asking youth to enter mainstream politics, the Congress leader said there should not be even one youth who says he is afraid in his own country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see MLAs, MLCs and MPs from amongst you in the next 10 years, maybe even a Prime Minister also,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Comparing Mahatma Gandhi and Hitler, Rahul said the German dictator shouted as he lacked confidence. But did Gandhiji ever shout? That was because he was confident.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like Mahatma Gandhi, humbleness while speaking is a sign of extreme self-confidence. Confidence should not be seen as aggression,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no need for saying things aggressively. You can say it with love. Many people will be with you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone, be it Rahul Gandhi or Prithviraj Chavan, says he knows better than you, he is telling a lie,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My request to you, specially tribal youth, is to join mainstream politics,&#8221; Rahul said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My message to the country&#8217;s youth is that the talent and capability the youth here have is not there anywhere else,&#8221; the Congress leader said.</p>
<p>On the progress the country has made since Independence, Rahul pointed out that today there were several rich people in India.</p>
<p>&#8220;Around 50 to 70 years ago there was not even a single rich person here. The only rich were maharajas and British,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001411&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/akhileshyadavm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985503" alt="Akhilesh was speaking to media persons at a function organised to lay the foundation stone of poultry farms at his residence. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/akhileshyadavm.jpg" /></a> Akhilesh was speaking to media persons at a function organised to lay the foundation stone of poultry farms at his residence.
<p>A day after Samajwadi Party (SP) president Mulayam Singh Yadav served ultimatum to Akhilesh Yadav&#8217;s ministers to &#8216;mend&#8217; their ways else lose their job, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday stated that he failed to understand when Mulayam changed his role from being party national president to his father.</p>
<p>Akhilesh was speaking to media persons at a function organised to lay the foundation stone of poultry farms at his residence.</p>
<p>“I am not able to understand when he attains the role of party national president and when he starts acting as a father,” Akhilesh said.</p>
<p>Refusing to comment on Mulayam&#8217;s statement, Akhilesh said: “All of you who are present here keep your hand on your heart and tell me that every father scolds his son or not. At times you do not agree with your father also.”</p>
<p>“He also pats us on our performance sometimes,” he maintained.</p>
<p>Earlier, during a function at CM&#8217;s residence Mulayam had issued a 10-day ultimatum to ministers in the UP government to “stop delaying files and mend their ways” or lose their jobs.</p>
<p>In the past, Mulayam had voiced his unhappiness in public over Akhilesh&#8217;s government. Mulayam had asked Akhilesh to keep distance from “sycophants”.  Mulayam had also stated that ministers will not be able to retain their posts if they ditched him in the Lok Sabha polls. “This is my election and you cannot hold the post and betray me also,” he had stated.</p>
<p><strong>Some previous quotes of Mulayam:</strong></p>
<p>01 August 2012: At CM&#8217;s residence</p>
<p>&#8220;Only 2-4 ministers are working while others should improve their working. I have all the report but do not want to reveal their names.&#8221;</p>
<p>13 August 2012: At a meeting at SP office</p>
<p>&#8220;Do some miraculous work in next six months which is visible before the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>23 March, 2013: Lohia Park<br />
&#8220;Some ministers and leaders are engaged in merry making and serving their personal interests.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001406&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>Bye-elections for the seven assembly constituencies in Gujarat will be held simultaneously as the state votes for the 26 Lok Sabha seats on April 30.</p>
<p>The Assembly constituencies that will see polling in April are Abdasa, Rapar, Himmatnagar, Visavadar, Somnath, Lathi and Mandavi (ST).</p>
<p>The bye-elections to some of these seats have been necessitated after Congress MLAs quit and joined the BJP. For instance, Chhabil Patel (Abdasa) and Prabhu Vasava (Mandvi) quit the party and joined the BJP on February 24. Earlier in February, Rajendrasinh Chavda, MLA from Himmatnagar and Jasa Barad, MLA from Somnath had joined the BJP, while Lathi MLA Bavku Unghad joined the saffron party in last week of January.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Visavadar Assembly constituency fell vacant after GPP president and Narendra Modi&#8217;s bete noire Keshubhai Patel  designed citing health reasons, while the Rapar seat was lying  vacant since January 30, after sitting BJP MLA Vaghaji Patel passed away.</p>
<p>Gujarat will be among the nine states where polling will be held on April 30. Over 3.98 crore plus voters in the state, including 2.08 crore  men and 1.90 crore women will exercise their franchise during this day.</p>
<p>For the Lok Sabha elections in Gujarat, the notification will be issued on April 2, while the last date of filing nominations will be April 9. The nominations will be scrutinised the next day and the last date of withdrawal of candidature will be April 12.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001390&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prescription drug abuse is growing in India and the problem is serious in South Asia, according to a UN report which said drugs enter the region&#8217;s illicit markets through various channels, being diverted from India&#8217;s pharma industry and smuggled from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), an independent UN body tasked with monitoring the production and consumption of narcotics worldwide, said in its annual report that governments in South Asia continue to respond strongly to the threat of drug trafficking and abuse in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;South Asia is facing a serious and growing drug abuse problem, including the abuse of pharmaceutical preparations containing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Prescription drug abuse is growing in India,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drugs enter South Asia&#8217;s illicit drug markets through a number of different channels, including diversion from India&#8217;s pharmaceutical industry, illicit cultivation and/or manufacture within the region, and smuggling from other countries, including Afghanistan (through Pakistan) an Myanmar,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical preparations containing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances continue to be diverted from India&#8217;s pharmaceutical industry and are trafficked domestically or at the international level, including through illegal internet pharmacies, the report said.</p>
<p>Despite efforts by India to tackle the problem, diversion from illicit channels in the country remains a major source of pharmaceutical preparations trafficked in the region.</p>
<p>Globally also prescription drug abuse – often legally obtained medication by a friend or a family member who no longer needs it or is not using it for medical purposes  is outpacing the rates for illegal drugs in some countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an erroneous perception that prescription drugs are less susceptible to abuse than &#8216;illicit&#8217; drugs,&#8221; INCB President Raymond Yans said.</p>
<p>Further, the report found that heroin smuggled into Bangladesh is mostly sourced from India. Cannabis is also smuggled into Bangladesh mostly from India and Nepal.</p>
<p>&#8220;India remained one of the five main source countries for illicit cannabis resin mentioned by governments worldwide in seizure reports in 2011,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Seizures of heroin in India have fluctuated since 2009 and increased from 528 kg in 2011 to 853 kg in 2012.</p>
<p>The quantity of opium seized in India has been increasing since 2009, when about 1.7 tonnes were seized, to more than 3 tonnes in 2012.</p>
<p>Cocaine trafficking has historically been very limited in South Asia but it appears to be rising significantly and 42 kg of cocaine were seized in India in 2012,up from 14 kg in 2011.</p>
<p>India also continued to be a main source of illicit amphetamine-type stimulants manufactured and trafficked in South Asia. India is also frequently cited as a source country for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine smuggled into Myanmar.</p>
<p>Investment in prevention and treatment of drug abuse can lead to significant savings in health-care and crime-related costs, and alleviate the suffering of drug-dependent users and their families, the report said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001345&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/elec-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001364" alt="The first polling day on April 7 will cover six Lok Sabha constituencies in two states, while the second on April 9 will cover seven constituencies in five states." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/elec-med.jpg" /></a> The first polling day on April 7 will cover six Lok Sabha constituencies in two states, while the second on April 9 will cover seven constituencies in five states.
</div>
<div>Lok Sabha elections will be held from April 7 to May 12 spread over nine days in the highest number of polling days so far involving an electorate of 81.4 crore, the Election Commission announced on Wednesday.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Counting of votes in all the 543 Lok Sabha constituencies will be held on a single day on May 16, Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath announced at a press conference flanked by ECs H S Brahma and S N A Zaidi.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Assembly elections will also be held simultaneously in the states of Andhra Pradesh, including Telangana region, Odisha and Sikkim.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sampath was at pains to clarify that it is not a nine-phased polling and the whole exercise will be over in 72 days, three days less than the last elections.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Model Code of Conduct for parties and governments comes into force with immediate effect, he said.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The first polling day on April 7 will cover six Lok Sabha constituencies in two states, while the second on April 9 will cover seven constituencies in five states.</div>
<div></div>
<div>92 constituencies will go to polls in 14 states on the third day on April 10, while a small number of five constituencies in three states will be covered on the fourth day on April 12.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The largest chunk of 122 Lok Sabha seats will go to polls in 13 states on April 17, the fifth day of poll, while the sixth day will witness polling in 117 seats in 12 states on April 24.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The seventh day of polling on April 30 will choose representatives in 89 constituencies spread over nine states and the eighth day on May 7will cover 64 seats in seven states.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Polling will conclude on the ninth day on May 12 with elections in 41 constituencies in three states.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Andhra Pradesh, which has 42 Lok Sabha seats, will go to polls on April 30 and May 7. Elections in the respective assembly segments will be held simultaneously.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The first day of polling on April 30 will cover 17 Lok Sabha seats and 119 Assembly seats in the Telangana region and the second on May 7will cover 25 Lok Sabha seats and 175 Assembly seats in the Seemandhra region.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sampath explained that irrespective of the appointed day for the creation of the new state of Telangana, elections will be held in the Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies as they exist today.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The corresponding Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies would go to the respective states once the bifurcation process of the state is complete.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Arunachal Pradesh will have single day polling on April 9 to cover two constituencies, while Assam with 14 Lok Sabha seats will have a three-day poll on April 7, 12 and 24.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Battlestate of Bihar with 40 constituencies will have polling on six days beginning April 10, 17, 24, 30 and May 7 and 12.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/supremecourtm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1976034" alt="Supreme Court apparently has dismissed the petition on the ground of maintainability." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/supremecourtm.jpg" /></a> Supreme Court apparently has dismissed the petition on the ground of maintainability.
<p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a petition by lawyers against the selection of 12 persons for appointment as judges to the Madras High Court.</p>
<p>A bench led by Justice B S Chauhan held that the lawyers could not challenge the suitability of the candidates at the stage of recommendation made by the chief justice of a high court for appointment of judges.</p>
<p>“We have perused all the documents and taken note of all the arguments. Nobody can challenge the suitability of the candidates. Therefore, we are dismissing the petition,” said the bench while delivering its verdict.</p>
<p>The court apparently has dismissed the petition on the ground of maintainability, saying a writ petition would not lie against a selection list of judges on the contention of suitability of the candidates.</p>
<p>A bunch of lawyers from Madras High Court had challenged the selection of 12 names — 10 from the Bar and two from subordinate judiciary — for appointment of judges to the High Court.</p>
<p>Later, the Supreme Court collegium had returned the list to the Union Law Ministry for sending it back to the High Court for consideration afresh.</p>
<p>Although the lawyers subsequently sought to withdraw their petition in the Supreme Court, the bench refused to allow it and decided the matter on merits.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001313&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>We bring you the five best stories of the Indian Express you must read before beginning your day.</p>
<p><strong>1. Kashmiri students suspended:</strong> A large private university in Meerut has suspended 67 Kashmiri students for allegedly cheering Pakistan during the India-Pak match at the Asia Cup on Sunday. The students were told to vacate their hostel rooms, and were escorted by police and university officials to nearby Ghaziabad. Some students are now back with their families in the Valley. Amit Sharma, Mir Ehsan report in <a title="For ‘cheering’ Pakistan in India match, university in Meerut suspends 67 Kashmiri students" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/for-cheering-pakistan-in-india-match-university-in-meerut-suspends-67-kashmiri-students/" target="_blank">For ‘cheering’ Pakistan in India match, university in Meerut suspends 67 Kashmiri students</a><br />

<p><strong>2. Roy faces SC wrath:</strong> The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered custody in jail for Sahara chief Subrata Roy until March 11 after slamming the group’s “dilatory tactics” and trashing its claim of having already refunded investors. Roy, after issuance of a non-bailable arrest warrant by the court, had been kept in a guest house in Lucknow by the Uttar Pradesh police for the last three days. Utkarsh Anand, Ananya Bhardwaj give details, <a title="Supreme Court sends Sahara chief Subrata Roy to Tihar jail" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/supreme-court-sends-sahara-chief-subrata-roy-to-tihar-jail/" target="_blank">You told us go to hell, says Supreme Court, sends Subrata Roy to jail </a><br />

<p><strong>3. For the sake of unity:</strong> At a seminar organised in Thaliparamba in Kerala’s Kannur district on Monday, two men sat together, smiling and talking. Twelve years ago, these men had entered India’s collective consciousness through their pictures published in the news media — images that went on to become iconic reminders of the Gujarat riots of 2002. <a title="Attacker, victim: 2 faces of Gujarat riots come together for ‘Hindu-Muslim’ unity" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/attacker-victim-2-faces-of-gujarat-riots-come-together-for-hindu-muslim-unity/" target="_blank">Attacker, victim: 2 faces of Gujarat riots come together for ‘Hindu-Muslim’ unity</a>, a report by Tanvir A Siddiqui<br />

<p><strong>4. Opinion:</strong> Over the last few years, ex-servicemen have taken public stands more often than before — usually against the UPA government, overtly or covertly. Christophe Jaffrelot writes on how a resurgent BJP reiterates its traditional appeal for the armyman. <a title="Soldiers of the Party" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/soldiers-of-the-party/" target="_blank">Soldiers of the Party</a><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vksinghm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2001153" alt="vksinghm" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vksinghm.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p><strong>5. Interview:</strong> Rashid Latif, the latest chief selector of the Pakistan side, is a happy man. For one, Shahid Afridi found his touch with the bat against arch-rivals India in a last-over win to give credence to Latif’s belief in him. And secondly, the former Pakistan wicketkeeper believes that the current side is experienced enough to challenge for the World Cup next year.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/indiavotingm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002110" alt=". The maximum number of constituencies (122 across 13 states) will vote on April 17, followed by 117 constituencies across 12 states on April 24.

The maximum number of constituencies (122 across 13 states) will vote on April 17, followed by 117 constituencies across 12 states on April 24. (IE Photo: Praveen Khanna)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">For the first time, the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/lok-sabha-polls-on-april-10-three-way-fight-begins/">Lok Sabha elections</a> will be held in nine phases — from April 7 to May 12. Announcing the poll schedule on Wednesday, the Election Commisson of India said counting of votes will be done on May 16 and the results will be announced on the same day.</span></p>
<p>Assembly elections will also be held simultaneously in the states of Andhra Pradesh, including the Telangana region, Orissa and Sikkim.</p>
<p>While a bulk of the polling — in as many as 525 constituencies — will take place on six days, only 18 constituencies will vote on the remaining three polling days. The maximum number of constituencies (122 across 13 states) will vote on April 17, followed by 117 constituencies across 12 states on April 24.</p>
<p>Most of the constituencies in the Naxal-affected states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and Bihar will vote on April 10, April 17 and April 24. In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, polling will be held on six days. In West Bengal and Jammu &amp; Kashmir (which has only six constituencies), polling will be held on five days.</p>
<p>The total number of days for the entire electoral process <span style="line-height:1.5em;">has been brought down from 75 days in 2009 to 72 days this time.</span></p>
<p>EC officials said various factors like school examinations, holidays, festivals (mainly Bihu in Assam), harvest season in some parts of the country and the weather forecast, particularly about monsoon, had to be taken into consideration. Moreover, the availability of security forces and time taken by them to move from one state to another were also important, they said.</p>
<p>“Keeping in view the interests of the students and also the fact that polling stations are mostly located in school buildings and teachers are engaged as polling personnel, the commission has consciously factored in the examination schedules of various state boards, including the Central Board of Secondary Education, in the process of finalising the poll dates,” said Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath.</p>
<p>He said “other relevant factors like various holidays and festivals falling in the months of March, April and May, harvest season in certain parts of the country and the inputs obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department on the pre-monsoon rainfall, onset and spread of monsoon and acute hot weather conditions in certain parts of the country” had also been taken into consideration.</p>
<p>A staggering 81.4 crore voters, almost 10 crore more than the last Lok Sabha polls, will be eligible to cast their votes this time. According to EC officials, there been a remarkable increase in the enrolment of voters in the age group of 18 to 19 years, with over 2.3 crore voters falling in this age group.</p>
<p>As many as 28,314 transgenders enrolled as “others”, 11,844 overseas electors and 13.28 lakh service electors will also vote during these polls. With an almost 12 per cent increase from last time, the number of polling stations has increased from 8.3 lakh to 9.3 lakh.</p>
<p>The model code of conduct came into force as soon as the poll schedule was announced. “We don’t agree that the model code of conduct is not effective. There is no reason to doubt its efficacy. Also, we never hesitate to use the powers available, but the commission cannot use the powers which are not available to it,” said the CEC. He added that the “model code of conduct is an instrument to ensure that the “level-playing field is not disturbed”.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">Here are the highlights:</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sheilakeralaguv.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001108" alt="Kerala Governor Nikhil Kumar resigned, sending out an additional signal Sheila's appointment as Kerala Governor came after Nikhil Kumar resigned, sending out an additional signal for the coming RJD-Congress alliance. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sheilakeralaguv.jpg" /></a> Sheila&#8217;s appointment as Kerala Governor came after Nikhil Kumar resigned, sending out an additional signal for the coming RJD-Congress alliance.
<p>Sheila Dikshit, a former three-term Chief Minister of Delhi, was on late Tuesday night appointed Governor of Kerala within three months of her defeat in the recent Assembly polls.</p>
<p>A Rashtrapati Bhavan spokesperson said that 75-year-old Dikshit succeeds Nikhil Kumar, a former Delhi Police Commissioner, who resigned yesterday.</p>
<p>Late on Tuesday evening, <a title="Congress-RJD pact likely today; Kerala Guv resigns, may contest" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/congress-rjd-pact-likely-today-kerala-guv-resigns-may-contest/" target="_blank">Kerala Governor</a> Nikhil Kumar resigned, sending out an additional signal for the coming <a title="No Cong-RJD tie-up yet, it’s advantage Nitish Kumar" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/no-cong-rjd-tie-up-yet-its-advantage-nitish-kumar/" target="_blank">RJD-Congress</a> alliance.</p>
<p>The<a title="JD(U) rules out tie-up, Lalu starts own campaign, clock ticks down for Congress" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/jdu-rules-out-tie-up-lalu-starts-own-campaign-clock-ticks-down-for-congress/" target="_blank"> RJD and Congress</a> are likely to announce a seat-sharing agreement for Bihar on Wednesday. The Congress has agreed to leave the “contentious” Madhubani seat for the RJD, and <a title="Congress starts distancing itself from Lalu Prasad’s RJD after forcing LJP to quit" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/congress-starts-distancing-itself-from-lalu-prasads-rjd-after-forcing-ljp-to-quit/" target="_blank">Lalu Prasad</a> has agreed to give 12 seats — one more than his earlier offer — to the Congress. The RJD will also leave a seat for the NCP.</p>
<p>Kumar — who has been pressing for the deal — was likely to contest the Aurangabad seat, a traditional Congress stronghold that has long been represented by his family.</p>
<p>Kumar, a former commissioner of Delhi Police, won the 2004 Lok Sabha election from Aurangabad. He faxed his resignation to Rashtrapati Bhawan from Kochi airport after landing there from Delhi on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The governor told reporters in Kochi that he was quitting his post, and that the Congress leadership would make an announcement on his contesting the Lok Sabha elections in a few days.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Dikshit, a senior Congress leader, had met Union minister Sushilkumar Shinde and the decision to make her Kerala Governor was conveyed to her.</p>
<p>The appointment of a governor is essentially a political call, and making an announcement literally hours before elections are announced is likely to be strongly criticised. The President had forced the government to back off on its move to bring anti-corruption ordinances last week, and it was uncertain whether he would agree to go along with another decision by the outgoing government.</p>
<p>Earlier, RJD President Lalu Prasad visited home of 72-year-old Kumar in Patna setting off speculation of his contesting the Aurangabad Parliamentary seat.</p>
<p>RJD and Congress sources confirmed the visit of Prasad to seek the blessings of Kumar&#8217;s mother Kishori Sinha and to meet the Kerala Governor.</p>
<p>In Bihar, the Congress scaled down its position after the JD(U) rejected its last-moment offer for an alliance, and Lalu began to campaign on his own. The RJD chief will be on a three-day tour of nine Lok Sabha constituencies on Wednesday, and is unlikely to be present when the tie-up with the Congress is announced.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">A week after he skipped a meeting of non-Congress, non-BJP parties, raising doubts about his party’s commitment to an ‘alternative’ front, Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) chief Prafulla Mahanta has said his party is undecided on their future course of action, and some rounds of “informal discussion” with the BJP have not been “successful”.</span></p>
<p>“We are meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) to decide on our future course of action. We are yet to decide if we want to go to the polls alone or in an alliance. We have held some informal discussions with the BJP but they have not been very successful so far,” Mahanta told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>“The BJP is not giving us the seats we want, so we don’t know if we should get into an alliance with them&#8230; What’s the point?” he added.</p>
<p>Mahanta said he had skipped the non-Congress, non-BJP parties meet because of personal reasons, and added that his party is yet to take a call on whether it would be part of this group.</p>
<p>The party would arrive at a decision in the next two days, he said. The AGP central executive body has authorised Mahanta and working president Atul Bora to take a final call on electoral alliances.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001090&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The BJP top brass from UP Tuesday held a meeting here to discuss the party’s candidates for the Lok Sabha elections. BJP general secretary in-charge of UP Amit Shah, former state CM Kalyan Singh and national general secretary (organisation) Ramlal attended the meeting.</span></p>
<p>“Potential candidates for all 80 seats were discussed. If there was unanimity on candidates, single names were finalised, while a panel of names was suggested for other seats,” a source said, indicating that these names will be forwarded to the party’s central election committee to take a final call. The committee would meet on March 8 and March 13 to finalise candidates for several states.</p>
<p>Party leaders said there was no discussion on Narendra Modi’s candidature from the state as the central leadership would decide on that.</p>
<p>Sources indicated Modi was veering towards the idea of contesting from UP, with Shah publicly suggesting his candidature will boost the party’s prospects in the state. Party leaders indicated Shah is keen to get him to contest from Varanasi, currently represented by senior party leader Murli Manohar Joshi.</p>
<p>There were also suggestions that Modi could take the fight to his bete noire Nitish Kumar’s camp by contesting from Patna. But central party leaders indicated Modi will contest from Gujarat to maximise the party’s electoral tally from his home turf. “There have been instances when senior party leaders have contested from two seats to boost the party’s prospects,” said a party leader.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001088&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The BJP has sealed the deal with MDMK and party president Rajnath Singh has engaged both the PMK and DMDK in alliance talks. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001085&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">While the BJP resents the idea of a ‘third front’ at the national level, the party is set to create one in Tamil Nadu by forging a pre-poll alliance with smaller parties to strengthen its electoral prospects in the state.</span></p>
<p>The BJP has already sealed the deal with MDMK, led by Vaiko, and party president Rajnath Singh has engaged both the PMK and DMDK in alliance talks.</p>
<p>While PMK leader and former Union minister Anbumany Ramadoss met Rajnath a while back on the issue of a pre-poll alliance, party sources said the BJP chief recently spoke to a point person of DMDK leader Vijaykanth over phone.</p>
<p>While the BJP has been on the fringe of Tamil Nadu politics, which is dominated by two Dravidian parties, the saffron party had won three Lok Sabha seats in the state when it contested the elections in alliance with the AIADMK in 1998. It bagged four seats when it contested in an alliance with the DMK, MDMK and PMK in 1999.</p>
<p>Though DMK supremo M Karunanidhi praised Narendra Modi recently, the BJP is wary of engaging with the party, given its alleged links with the 2G spectrum allocation scam. Consequently, the BJP is relying on the MDMK, PMK and the DMDK.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001085&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[BJP leader Nitin Gadkari has been marginalised since he lost party presidency. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001069&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gadkari-new-4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001083" alt="Gadkari at his dinner party in Delhi on Tuesday. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gadkari-new-4801.jpg" /></a> Nitin Gadkari at his dinner party in Delhi on Tuesday.
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Marginalised in Delhi and sidelined in his home state Maharashtra, former BJP president Nitin Gadkari has made sure his presence is felt in his party by meeting MNS chief Raj Thackeray, putting the limelight on both. </span></p>
<p>The meeting was to persuade Raj not to field MNS candidates in the Lok Sabha polls to brighten the BJP’s prospects. Gadkari has provided a face-saver for Raj, too, if MNS stays out of the Lok Sabha race, as seems likely, for want of suitable candidates and organisational strength.</p>
<p>The meeting has been noticed by long-time BJP ally Shiv Sena headed by Raj’s estranged cousin Uddhav Thackeray. Gadkari’s political fortunes had been hurtling downhill ever since he lost the BJP presidency to Rajnath Singh. The next blow was elevation of his rival in his native Nagpur district, Devendra Phadnavis, to BJP state unit president.</p>
<p>Early this year, BJP general secretary Rajiv Pratap Rudy, who is in charge of party affairs in Maharashtra, conveyed to Uddhav that issues could be sorted out by taking into confidence Gopinath Munde, Gadkari’s bete noire in the BJP in Maharashtra. This move left Gadkari with no pan-Maharashtra role.</p>
<p>Uddhav and Munde sorted out irritants between BJP and the Sena, including accommodation of RPI leader Ramdas Athawale and Raju Shetty in seat-sharing. The allies parted with one seat each for Shetty’s party, the BJP gave a Rajya Sabha berth to Athawale and the Shiv Sena the Satara Lok Sabha seat for RPI to contest. Uddhav either discussed matters with Munde, or with Narendra Modi or Rajnath Singh if needed.</p>
<p>Gadkari’s meeting with Raj has robbed Munde of solely claiming credit if BJP-Sena poll prospects get a boost. If MNS stays out of the Lok Sabha race, Gadkari could claim his due for having persuaded Raj to stay out to facilitate consolidation of anti-Congress votes. There is unease in the Shiv Sena camp. “It can affect our grand alliance if a senior BJP leader meets Raj Thackeray or NCP chief Sharad Pawar,” Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001069&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Security around Sir Creek has been the focus area of the security agencies after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks when a group of 10 terrorists entered Indian territory through the particular sea route.</p>
<p>Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth reviewed the pace of development and construction of vital roads along the Gujarat coast after it was found that only “40 per cent” of the planned projects had been completed even six years after the Mumbai attacks.</p>
<p>“It was decided to expedite the process of procurement of the four fast watercraft boats,” said an MHA official.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001082&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/docs-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001133" alt="A protest march in Lucknow, Tuesday. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/docs-med.jpg" /></a> A protest march in Lucknow, Tuesday. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The ongoing strike that has crippled medical services in Uttar Pradesh intensified Tuesday with nearly 275 junior doctors resigning in Agra to protest against the attack on their colleagues in Kanpur even as 24 medicos who were granted bail Monday refused to come out of the jail while late evening talks between the government and the doctors failed.</span></p>
<p>The 24 medicos of GSVM College Kanpur refused to sign the personal bond, which is mandatory for an inmate before he is released, confirmed Kanpur district jail superintendent P D Salonia. The students reportedly said they will sign the bond only if Dr Arti Lal Chandani, the IMA kanpur chief and head of department of medicine, GSV Medical College, tells them to.</p>
<p>Salonia said they have informed the concerned local court about the status.</p>
<p>When contacted, Chandani said, till demands of the doctors are met, the students will not come out of jail.</p>
<p>In the evening, doctors from GSVM Kanpur, KGMU Lucknow and IMA Lucknow chapter met Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.</p>
<p>A government spokesperson claimed the doctors promised to call off the strike.</p>
<p>However, Chandani, said the strike will go on as the issue has not been resolved. Dr Aditya Patel, president of KGMU Resident Doctors’ Association said there was no clarity in the CM’s assurance on their demands of initiating action against Kanpur SSP YashasviYadav and SP MLA Irfan Solanki, and also about withdrawal of cases against the 24 students. Services in medical colleges remained paralysed for the fifth day. In Lucknow, doctors staged a rally from KGMU to Hazratganj.</p>
<p>A clash had broken out on Friday between Solanki’s supporters and junior doctors of GSVM college, after a collision between the MLA’s car and a motorbike. The police had resorted to lathicharge to disperse the crowd, in which several people, including the MLA, was injured. The police later raided the college hostel and arrested 36 medicos. They also allegedly broke laptops and caned students.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001071&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) Tuesday informed the Bombay High Court that the film Rahasya, allegedly based on Aarushi murder case, is in fact, a “fictitious suspense thriller”.</p>
<p>Aarushi’s parents Rajesh and Nupur Talwar, who were sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of their daughter and domestic help Hemraj, had taken exception to the film’s release. They had claimed that the film would affect the proceedings of their appeal against conviction before the Allahabad HC.</p>
<p>The couple had also challenged the U/A certification granted to the film by the CBFC and sought a stay on the release of the film. Sheetal Tandel, assistant regional officer, CBFC, in her affidavit submitted to the court, stated that characters are very different.</p>
<p>The affidavit stated that the film is set in Mumbai and the parents of the murdered girl are orthopedic doctors. Moreover, the film is about the murder of an 18-year-old college student Ayesha Mahajan who is very different from Aarushi, even in appearance.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001066&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A year after 168 personnel were indicted in an inquiry into the clash between officers and soldiers in Ladakh’s Nyoma, action has been recommended against three Majors for charges of assault against a soldier that had triggered the unprecedented violence.</span></p>
<p>The officers — Majors SK Sharma, Kapil Malik and Ankur Tiwari — had thrashed a jawan who allegedly sexually assaulted the wife of an officer at an artillery camp at Nyoma. The action recommended against them includes loss of seniority, loss of pension and reprimand that shall effectively ruin their army careers. However the punishment is yet to be confirmed by the army authorities.</p>
<p>The trial of several other personnel who were involved in the clash is also on and several soldiers are likely to be dismissed from service.</p>
<p>It may be recalled a clash took place at the 226 field regiment in 2012 in which several officers, including the commanding officer of the unit were injured.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001056&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">“Chhootegi nahi koi khabar (no news will ever be missed)” — screamed a banner running across the screen of Sahara Samay, the flagship Hindi news channel owned by the Sahara Group. </span></p>
<p>Ironically, the channel gave a complete miss to the “khabar” of the day — the arrest of its chairman Subroto Roy. The throwing of black ink at Roy outside the Supreme Court was also blacked out by the channel. A scroller only kept running at the bottom of the TV screen that said: “Saharashri Subrata Roy Sahara” could not present himself before the Supreme Court because of his mother’s illness and that he had apologised to the court for this.”</p>
<p>Like this national channel, five other regional channels owned by Sahara also gave the events a miss. Confirming that not airing the developments pertaining to Roy’s arrest was a conscious decision, a senior Sahara editor based in Delhi said: “Why are you surprised? Which media organisation will cover the arrest of its proprietor?”</p>
<p>Sahara TV’s group editor B V Rao refused to comment. The Sahara Group owns six TV news channels and several publications, including flagship Hindi daily Rashtriya Sahara and Urdu publications such as Bazme Sahara, Rozana Sahara and Aalami Sahara. Unlike the broadcast arm, Rashtriya Sahara has been reporting the developments, albeit selectively.</p>
<p>On February 20, when the SC issued summons to Roy and his group directors in connection with the contempt proceedings in the alleged investor scam, the daily led its front page with a story on Roy’s meeting with the UK PM David Cameron in Mumbai.</p>
<p>The subsequent developments such as Roy’s failure to present himself before the court and the police raid at his house were not covered. On March 1, however, the newspaper ran a front page story saying Roy voluntarily handed over himself to police.</p>
<p>Around 1500 words-long, the story mainly communicated that Roy was a patriot and law-abiding citizen. On March 2, the daily carried a story on its front page citing the support extended by the film industry to Roy. Next day, a front page item quoted former cricketer Kapil Dev saying Roy couldn’t have done any wrong.</p>
<p>Rashtriya Sahara’s editors couldn’t be reached for comments.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sahara.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001045" alt="Sahara India chief Subrata Roy arrives at the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Ravi Kanojia" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sahara.jpg" /></a> Sahara India chief Subrata Roy arrives at the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Ravi Kanojia
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Subrata Roy argued his case himself for more than half an hour despite being flanked by six of the country’s top lawyers, but still ended up in Tihar jail on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>Clad in his trademark waistcoat and a tie with the Sahara logo, the 65-year-old “managing worker”of the Sahara India Pariwar made impassioned appeals to the court on five occasions in the course of the 100-minute hearing. He urged the court to “have faith” in him and “hang” him if he did not keep his promises.</p>
<p>Roy’s monologue included a “slip of tongue” which earned him a reprimand from Justices K S Radhakrishnan and J S Khehar. He told the court that it would “love” the Sahara group if it heard the “beautiful” story of their paying from their pockets to refund investors. The court’s response: “We will love you only if you make the entire payment&#8230; if you maintain the rule of law.”</p>
<p>Roy’s day at the court began with a man throwing black ink at his face while shouting, “he has cheated and robbed us”. Roy used a handkerchief to wipe the stain off his face, combed his hair, and walked into the packed courtroom, accompanied by his son Seemanto, and chewing something.</p>
<p>Police grabbed the ink-thrower — who was later identified as Manoj Sharma, a Gwalior man who had thrown a shoe at Congress MP Suresh Kalmadi in 2011 — and took him away, but not before a few Sahara employees had landed several hard blows on him.</p>
<p>In the court, Roy waved to his lawyers — senior advocates Ram Jethmalani, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajeev Dhawan, C A Sundaram, S Ganesh and R Dwivedi, besides their briefing counsel — and was seen discussing strategy.</p>
<p>As the proceedings began, Roy said with folded hands, “My apologies for not remaining present on the last date. Believe me that I had genuine reasons. I tender my unconditional apology. Please accept it.”</p>
<p>The court accepted the apology but rejected Sahara’s plea for more time to refund investors’ money. Roy pleaded for a “sympathetic” view of the financial constraints in paying the entire sum up front, and tried to persuade the court to see the “business point of view”.</p>
<p>“We will pay you the entire money by selling the properties,” he said.</p>
<p>The Bench shot back: “Stop telling you will pay us. You cannot pay anything to us. You are not paying anything to us. We have nothing to do with this case. This matter has got nothing to do with us. It is between you and the investors.”</p>
<p>Roy apologised for the “slip of tongue”, but the court insisted: “No, it is not a slip of tongue. The press also says the same thing on your behalf. This is the problem with you.”</p>
<p>On another occasion during the hearing, Roy attempted to explain cash payments by the group.</p>
<p>“Ours is a business proposition and our investor is somebody as small as a rickshaw puller. He invests in cash and wants the money back in cash. Punish me if we don’t abide by the court orders. We have 37 years of business and not a single blot is on us for defrauding anyone. It’s a question of livelihood for 12 lakh employees,” he said.</p>
<p>Roy said Sahara employees had contributed money from their salaries to help the company refund. “It is a beautiful story. You will love us if you hear this story,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001038&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gujuaratriots.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001142" alt="Ansari said at the seminar that for him, “Mochi is far better than Narendra Modi because while Mochi has apologised to him and the community openly at the seminar, Modi is still to apologise for the killing of innocent Muslims”." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gujuaratriots.jpg" /></a> Ansari said “Mochi is far better than Narendra Modi because while Mochi has apologised to him and the community, Modi is still to apologise for the killing of innocent Muslims”.
<p>At a seminar organised in Thaliparamba in Kerala’s Kannur district on Monday, two men sat together, smiling and talking. Twelve years ago, these men had entered India’s collective consciousness through their pictures published in the news media — images that went on to become iconic reminders of the Gujarat riots of 2002.</p>
<p>One of the men was seen as the victim, wearing a shirt streaked with blood, pleading for mercy with folded hands, his eyes brimming with tears. The other appeared as the ruthless perpetrator of the violence, wearing a black beard and saffron Bajrang Dal bandana, standing with a leg on a signboard and both hands aloft, in one of which he held an iron rod. Behind him burnt a large fire.</p>
<p>The first picture — of a tailor named Qutubuddin Ansari — was taken in Naroda Patiya, which saw some of the worst violence of the riots. The other picture, of Shahpur cobbler Ashok Bhavanbhai Parmar, or Ashok Mochi, was taken in Dudheshwar.</p>
<p>On Monday, participating in a seminar cal‘ed ‘A decade of genocide’, organised by the CPM, the <span style="line-height:1.5em;">two men showed they had come a long way since February 28, 2002, the day their pictures were taken in riot-torn Ahmedabad.</span></p>
<p>The men were brought together by journalist-activist Kaleem Siddiqui, who travelled with them to Kerala from Gujarat for the launch of a Malayalam edition of Ansari’s autobiography.</p>
<p>Speaking at the seminar, Mochi apologised to Ansari and the entire Muslim community for the killings of 2002. The 40-year-old Ansari is now happily married with three children; the 39-year old Mochi, by contrast, does not even have a voter’s ID, and has been deprived of the benefits of all government schemes.</p>
<p>Ansari has been trying to stay out of the public eye ever since his picture was used in an email allegedly sent by the Indian Mujahideen. Mochi said he has decided to devote his time to working for Hindu-Muslim amity, and to “improving my image of a communal zealot”.</p>
<p>“It is because of my unsound financial position that I have not been able to get married,” Mochi told The Indian Express over the phone from Kerala. In 2002 he lived in Kajimiya ni Chali in Shahpur with his elder brother. He now lives across the road in Haleem ni Khadki.</p>
<p>Cases were filed against him for rioting. “I was acquitted in the lower court because they could not get any evidence against me from local Muslims. The government appealed against the acquittal, and a judgment is now pending,” he said.</p>
<p>Ansari said at the seminar that for him, “Mochi is far better than Narendra Modi because while Mochi has apologised to him and the community openly at the seminar, Modi is still to apologise for the killing of innocent Muslims”.</p>
<p>“I have no intention of jumping into politics, but this seminar is giving a message to counter communal forces and expose their lies about welfare measures, so I am here, besides the release of my autobiography”, Ansari said.</p>
<p>Mochi blamed the media for “demonising” him and “tarnishing his image”. “You can go to the place where I live and check for yourself if I didn’t helped local Muslims reach safety during the riots,” he said.</p>
<p>Kaleem Siddiqui, the brain behind the seminar, said his objective was to expose the lie that Muslims had started supporting Modi, and that they would vote BJP in the coming polls. He said Urdu, English and Gujarati versions of Ansari’s autobiography would be brought out subsequently.</p>
<p>“The Malayalam edition of 1,000 copies, priced at Rs 85 each, was sold out in day,” Siddiqui, who run a fortnightly Urdu newspaper called Tarkash in Ahmedabad, said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001019&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/up.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001007" alt="Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad during a visit to the encephalitis ward of a hospital in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh.

<p>The mystery deaths of hundreds of children in eastern Uttar Pradesh last year was likely caused by a bacterial infection that is transmitted through head lice, an expert group has concluded.</p>
<p>The group of 20-odd experts from India and abroad, which was set up on November 19 last year, submitted its report to the state government last week.</p>
<p>The findings of the report, which are yet to be officially released, are likely to change the focus of identification, prevention and treatment of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) both in UP and the rest of the country.</p>
<p>The micro-organism suspected to cause the disease is Rickettsia prowazekii, which is transmitted through the faeces of lice. The expert panel has recommended “delousing” as the most important preventive mechanism, and treatment with Permethrin lotion. Skin biopsy and Immuno-Fluorescent Assay tests have been recommended in addition to existing tests to <span style="line-height:1.5em;">identify Rickettsia prowazekii. Doxycycline has been recommended in addition to the existing treatment protocol even before diagnosis is confirmed.</span></p>
<p>The group has also recommended that patients should not be made to share cots in hospitals, because “lice leave the dying patient and invade other patients”. The large number of patients and a shortage of beds has seen two or three children being put on the same bed at BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, for years.</p>
<p>The group, headed by Andhra Pradesh encephalitis expert P Nagabhushana Rao, was asked to recommend “clinical care management protocols and surveillance guidelines for AES and JE (Japanese encephalitis) in Uttar Pradesh.”</p>
<p>The group was constituted after measures such as “vaccination against JE, environmental management, larval control, pig control as well as provision of India Mark II hand pumps and deep wells to counter enteroviral infections” failed to significantly reduce AES cases and mortality.</p>
<p>Members of the group included experts from the National Institute of Virology, National Vector Borne Disease Control Program, BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, and experts from non-government organisation PATH. It also had experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US, including Ken Earhart, director, Disease Detection Regional Center of CDC-India, as honorary members.</p>
<p>The experts analysed 276 AES cases that came to BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, in 2013. Epidemiological analysis and clinical data analysis suggested “Rickettsial infection (Epidemic Typhus) caused by Rickettsia prowazekii is the most likely cause of AES.”<br />
Pritu Dhalaria, convener of the group, said, “Treatment is very simple and death can be prevented if the patient is given a single dose of Doxycycline at an early stage. Mass delousing programmes must be carried out in all high-risk districts.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001002&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sheilakeralaguv.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001108" alt="the government was moving quickly to After Nikhil Kumar resigned, government was moving quickly to appoint a new governor in Thiruvananthapuram, Sheila Dikshit was the frontrunner.

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The RJD and Congress are likely to announce a <a title="Cong opens talks with JMM for seat share" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/cong-opens-talks-with-jmm-for-seat-share/" target="_blank">seat-sharing</a> agreement for Bihar on Wednesday.

The RJD will also leave a seat for the NCP.</span></p>
<p>Late on Tuesday evening, Kerala Governor Nikhil Kumar resigned, sending out an additional signal for the coming <a title="Congress starts distancing itself from Lalu Prasad’s RJD after forcing LJP to quit" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/congress-starts-distancing-itself-from-lalu-prasads-rjd-after-forcing-ljp-to-quit/" target="_blank">RJD-Congress </a>alliance. <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Kumar — who has been pressing for the deal — was likely to contest the Aurangabad seat, a traditional Congress stronghold that has long been represented by his family.</span></p>
<p>Kumar, a former commissioner of Delhi Police, won the 2004 Lok Sabha election from Aurangabad. He faxed his resignation to Rashtrapati Bhawan from Kochi airport after landing there from Delhi on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The governor told reporters in Kochi that he was quitting his post, and that the Congress leadership would make an announcement on his contesting the Lok Sabha elections in a few days.</p>
<p>Late in the night, the government was moving quickly to appoint a new governor in Thiruvananthapuram. Former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit was said to be the frontrunner, but Congress managers were trying to first gauge the views of President Pranab Mukherjee on the matter.</p>
<p>The appointment of a governor is essentially a political call, and making an announcement literally hours before elections are announced is likely to be strongly criticised. The President had forced the government to back off on its move to bring anti-corruption ordinances last week, and it was uncertain whether he would agree to go along with another decision by the outgoing government.</p>
<p>Should the government decide to take the plunge, papers would have to move very early in the morning in order to beat the Election Commission’s press conference announcing elections, and thereby bringing the model code of conduct into effect.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returned from Myanmar late on Tuesday. The government also plans to press ahead with a cabinet meeting on Thursday, and will approach the EC to check what items it can take up.</p>
<p>In Bihar, the Congress scaled down its position after the JD(U) rejected its last-moment offer for an alliance, and Lalu began to campaign on his own. The RJD chief will be on a three-day tour of nine Lok Sabha constituencies on Wednesday, and is unlikely to be present when the tie-up with the Congress is announced.</p>
<p>The Congress, which wanted Madhubani for its senior leader Shakil Ahmed, agreed to leave it for the RJD’s Abdul Bari Siddiqui, reopening the door for talks. In return, the RJD has agreed to give Sitamarhi and Khagaria to the Congress, and help the party get representation in the Bihar Legislative Council after its lone MLC Kumari Jyoti’s term ends.</p>
<p>Sources said the RJD had initially agreed to give Nawada to the Congress, but Lalu announced his own candidate during a public meeting in Rajauli, Nawada, on Monday. “It was tough posturing to impress upon the Congress the need to strike a deal fast. We knew the Congress was in talks with JD(U). There was bound to be some posturing,” an RJD source said.<br />
<em></em></p>
<p><strong>MOVE TO GIVE UP GUV A FRESH TERM</strong></p>
<p>Late Tuesday night, the government was moving to give UP governor B L Joshi, an old loyalist of the Gandhi family, a fresh five-year term. Joshi has been on extension for the past two years. Papers were to move early morning to beat the announcement of elections, but the government first faced the task of getting President<br />
Pranab Mukherjee on board.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav Tuesday issued a 10-day ultimatum to ministers in the UP government to “stop delaying files and mend their ways” or lose their jobs. Also, in yet another public ticking off of his son and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Mulayam asked him to keep distance from “sycophants”.</span></p>
<p>“I have not reviewed the performance of ministers, but I know what you are doing. This is my election. You want to become ministers and also cheat me. It will not work. Will you be able to remain ministers? You will finally be coming to me for tickets (to contest Assembly election),” he said.</p>
<p>Mulayam had in the past too voiced unhappiness over the functioning of his son’s government.</p>
<p>He also cautioned Akhilesh to keep sycophants at a distance. “Beware of these officials who always say ‘Sir, Sir’. They have a habit of saying Sir. You (Akhilesh) never speak. Now say something,” he said pointing towards Akhilesh.</p>
<p>Stating that sycophants tarnish image of the party, Mulayam said, “Party is bigger than government. It makes the government.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000963&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maya.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000961" alt="Mayawati in New Delhi on Tuesday. RENUKA PURI" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maya.jpg" /></a> Mayawati in New Delhi on Tuesday. RENUKA PURI
<p>Two days after BJP’s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi attacked the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Congress saying they would bite the dust in the general elections, BSP chief Mayawati hit out at Modi accusing him of “chhal-kapat” (deceit), “jhooth” (lies) and “dhokha” (betrayal) in whatever he says and added “even if BJP apologizes a thousand times for Godhra, it would not be enough”.</p>
<p>The outburst on Tuesday came a day after Modi, along with new ally and LJP chief Ramvilas Paswan by his side, said in Muzaffarpur that the next decade of Indian politics belongs to Dalits, the backward and the exploited.</p>
<p>Modi had in Lucknow on March 2 said, “Sabka vinaash tay hai (everyone’s destruction is guaranteed)”, expanding SABKA (S for Samajwadi Party, B for BSP and K for Congress). Mayawati hit back saying BJP stood for ‘Bahut Jyada Paap’ (too many sins).</p>
<p>She said “no government can be more corrupt” than Modi’s in Gujarat. “Modi jo bhi kehta hai usme jhooth, dhokha aur chhal kapat hi hota hai,” she said.</p>
<p>Quoting former PM A B Vajpayee’s niece Karuna Shukla (who has joined the Congress) the former BSP chief minister launched a personal attack on Modi saying someone who did not fulfill “pati-dharma” and “rajdharma” cannot fulfill “rashtradharma”.</p>
<p>Asked whether she would lean towards the Congress, having closed the Third Front option, Mayawati said, “Who knows, we might become centre of power and other parties may need to lean on us, and not the other way round. We have helped others to form governments. This time, we’ll go all out to ensure we have balance of power and others have to help us.”</p>
<p>In the same breath, she slammed Congress policies saying the party “failed on all fronts” and “no section of society was happy with them”. “The BSP doesn’t agree with Congress policies that led to largescale inflation, poverty and unemployment,” she said, her party supported the UPA without being part of the government to keep “communal forces” away from reins of power. “But we don’t agree with Congress’ policies,” she said.</p>
<p>She alleged a campaign to misguide voters that BSP may ally with BJP as it had done in the past and warned the Muslim community against the politics of BJP and the Samajwadi Party.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000956&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[On an average, each Lok Sabha seat has 50,000 of them.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000949&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Despite the best efforts of the Election Commission and other organisations, only around 45 per cent of the youths between the ages of 18 and 19 have registered as votes.</span></p>
<p>Of the over 5 crore people in this age group, as per Census 2011, only 2.31 crore have registered in the electoral rolls revision. This means that 50,000 youths in the 18-19 age group, on an average, will not be casting their vote in each constituency in the coming Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>Of the nearly 2.73 crore 18-19 year olds who haven’t registered, around 62 lakh are from Uttar Pradesh. Other states with a large proportion of such youths are Bihar (27 lakh), Rajasthan (11 lakh), Delhi (4 lakh), Haryana (7.5 lakh) and Punjab (6 lakh). Though the process of revision of voters’ list is still on, new voters cannot be registered now.</p>
<p>Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) VS Sampath said they were satisfied with the “reasonably good” achievement in enrolling new voters, pointing out, “It increased from just around 8-10 per cent of coverage in this age group four years back.”</p>
<p>He added: “Unlike in other age groups where we need to improve upon an already existing number or percentage, this group of 18-19 years needs to be started from 0 (zero) enrollment as all are new enrollments. Thus the enrollment of 45 per cent is very good.”</p>
<p>The EC has initiated several programmes to educate people of their voting rights, partnering with government departments, NGOs, the media, the PSUs and also the private sector. Electoral literacy has been made part of the Adult Education Programme and is being included in school curriculum.</p>
<p>While other parties have shown interest, the RSS has launched own campaign to register eligible voters.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000949&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>MEDIA BOYCOTT</strong></p>
<p>A Photo-op of Rahul Gandhi meeting NSUI delegates from Gujarat at the Congress headquarters on Tuesday turned out to be a PR disaster as angry media contingent chose to boycott it after heated exchanges with SPG personnel. As Rahul’s arrival was delayed by 45 minutes, the SPG personnel asked the waiting media to leave the premises and enter again after going through security checks. Once they were out, they were left stranded even as NSUI delegates were allowed entry. That led to heated exchanges between mediapersons and SPG personnel following which the former boycotted Rahul’s function as also the daily briefing.</p>
<p><strong>LOOKING FOR AN OPENING</strong></p>
<p>Haryana Congress MLA Venod Sharma, known more famously as the father of Manu Sharma, is displaying a remarkable sense of mobility in his search for greener political pastures. After meeting with a stiff resistance from within the BJP to his attempts to cross over to the saffron party, he tried to gain entry into the Haryana Janhit Congress of Kuldeep Bishnoi to try gaining by default from its alliance with the BJP. Last heard, he was courting Om Prakash Chautala.</p>
<p><strong>LIST TROUBLE</strong><br />
A cadre allocation list of civil servants, framed by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), has run into rough weather with the PMO sending it back to the DoPT, asking it to check whether the list is in consonance with the existing Cadre Allocation Policy. The development, needless to add, has got some red faces scurrying for cover in the DoPT.</p>
<p><strong>AT TMC DOORSTEP</strong><br />
There has already been a rush of Aam Aadmi Party rejects at the Trinamool office in Delhi. But, on Tuesday, when expelled AAP MLA Vinod Kumar Binny met Trinamool-Jantantra Morcha campaign coordinator Vinod Singh, he created quite a buzz. Incidentally, Binny did not meet TMC leaders, including MP Derek O Brien, who were present at the Trinamool office. Apparently, it’s Anna Hazare’s Janatantra Morcha that has been entrusted to deal with former AAP leaders.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000943&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Defending the move to bring in ordinances to push through anti-graft Bills backed by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on the eve of elections, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said Tuesday night that “very difficult&#8230; special circumstances” had forced the government to take such a route.</span></p>
<p>Responding to a query from The Indian Express, Khurshid said that “the standard answer (to taking the ordinance route) would be a no&#8230; I agree there can be no substitute for Parliament&#8230; but these are very special circumstances&#8230; should Parliament not have functioned for three sessions?&#8230; There is constant, rigid opposition.”</p>
<p>Khurshid spoke to the media on board the PM’s special aircraft after Manmohan Singh, returning home from the BIMSTEC summit, skipped the customary on-board press conference.</p>
<p>He said Rahul has some very “clear views on what needs to be done to fulfil the expectations of the common man&#8230; he does not want to disappoint&#8230; he is our leader and it is our job to support him in his endeavour.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000937&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sheikh.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000934" alt="PM with Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday. PTI" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sheikh.jpg" /></a> PM Manmohan Singh with Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Under pressure to deliver the Teesta river water-sharing agreement with India, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday urged counterpart Manmohan Singh to sign the pact at the earliest because it was “good for the long run”.</span></p>
<p>Hasina raised the Teesta issue when the two leaders met on the sidelines of the third BIMSTEC summit. The signing of the agreement was stalled in 2011 after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee raised objections.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister said it was a difficult matter and he was trying to build consensus at home (on the river-sharing pact)&#8230; She said the agreement must be signed because it was good for the long run,” MEA spokesperson Syed Akbaruddin told reporters after the meeting.</p>
<p>Earlier, while addressing the summit of regional leaders that included Singh, Hasina said “modalities need to be found for sharing water resources, especially common rivers”.</p>
<p>She cited the example of the 30-year Ganges water-sharing treaty between India and Bangladesh and said “others would follow soon”.</p>
<p>The Ganges treaty of 1996 remains the only comprehensive river pact between the two countries, even though they share 54 rivers. Three years ago, Mamata had refused to accompany the Prime Minister to Bangladesh where he had hoped to sign the deal. The government later said nothing would be done without consulting the West Bengal government.</p>
<p><strong>India, Lanka to be in touch on Geneva draft</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Hours after a draft resolution against Sri Lanka for alleged war crimes against Tamils was circulated at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Mahinda Rajapaksa agreed to stay in touch on the matter.</span></p>
<p>The resolution, sponsored by the US, UK, Mauritius, Macedonia and Montenegro, will be put to vote later this month. The draft refers to the report by Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who called for an international probe into allegations of war crimes against Sri Lanka during the final battle with the Tamil Tigers in 2009.</p>
<p>“The two sides agreed to stay in touch given that it has implications for both India and Sri Lanka,” Syed Akbaruddin, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, said after Singh and Rajapaksa met on the summit sidelines.</p>
<p>Twice in the last two years, Tamil parties have mounted pressure on the UPA government, leading to India voting against Sri Lanka in Geneva, resulting in a temporary cooling of ties.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000928&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">With the Defence Ministry ordering a CBI inquiry into the purchase of aero engines by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) from Rolls Royce, the agency is set to reopen investigations into a Rs 208-crore deal involving alleged arms dealer Sudhir Choudhrie.</span></p>
<p>The agency had closed the case against Choudhrie, who was accused of lobbying for an Israeli firm in 2007 to bag a defence deal, in 2010 for want of evidence.</p>
<p>However, with fresh charges of bribery surfacing against him, the agency plans to approach the court for a re-investigation which, it claims, will help unearth Choudhrie’s links in India.</p>
<p>The CBI’s current probe into the contract will likely be centred around Rs 5,000 crore worth of orders received by Rolls Royce.</p>
<p>It is suspected that a hefty commission running into several crores was allegedly paid by the London-based company to its intermediaries to bag defence deals. The agency also suspects that Choudhrie may have played a key role in lobbying for the UK firm.</p>
<p>The British major has already admitted to hiring a private firm as a ‘commercial advisor’ for deals in India, which was paid a certain percentage of the contract value.</p>
<p>The ‘advisor’ has been identified as Aashmore Private Limited company, led by Singapore-based Ashok Patni.</p>
<p>The agency said that it has sought a detailed report from the Interpol on the role of Patni as well as that of Choudhrie.</p>
<p>While temporarily suspending all contracts with the engine manufacturer, the Defence Ministry, in its communication to the CBI, is also learnt to have expressed concern over the ongoing anti-corruption investigation into the company by the UK Serious Frauds Office (SFO) as well as red flags raised by HAL, which has conducted an internal probe after receiving several complaints.</p>
<p>CBI officials said Choudhrie’s name cropped up in the Rolls Royce case after he and his son were questioned by the SFO in UK last month.</p>
<p>The CBI, which started a probe against Choudhrie for his alleged involvement in defence deals in 2007, has claimed there were several financial transactions in his name that could not be explained.</p>
<p>The agency had then referred the matter to Enforcement Directorate (ED).</p>
<p>“While the earlier case against Choudhrie and his firm could not be proved, it had clearly established that money was paid to him and his firm, MITCO,” a CBI official said, explaining the ground to reopen the case.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000916&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/01/rajiv-gandhi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988250" alt="It contended that the state was not protecting the right of the victims at the cost of “selectively” choosing these seven convicts for remission of their jail terms" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/01/rajiv-gandhi.jpg" /></a> It contended that the state was not protecting the right of the victims at the cost of “selectively” choosing these seven convicts for remission of their jail terms
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that the Tamil Nadu government’s decision to release the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case was in derogation of rights of the victims who lost their kin in the blast, which had claimed as many as 18 lives. </span></p>
<p>It contended that the state was not protecting the right of the victims at the cost of “selectively” choosing these seven convicts for remission of their jail terms and that it was also against the fundamental right to equality, besides in breach of the right to life of victims.</p>
<p>“The decision of the state of Tamil Nadu to grant remission selectively, apart from being in excess of jurisdiction, is also violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India&#8230;in the present case, as many as 18 innocent lives were lost and over than 200 persons were injured as result of the human bomb,” stated the Centre.</p>
<p>Additional Solicitor General Sidharth Luthra mentioned the matter before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India P Sathasivam and sought the court’s permission to file additional grounds for the petition challenging Tamil Nadu’s resolution to free the convicts.<br />
The Bench, which will hear the matter on Thursday, allowed him.</p>
<p>The Centre has said that the state’s act of moving for remission was “in derogation and breach of Article 21, right of the family and victims and whose rights the Union is bound to protect and for whom the Union of India is duty bound to act.”</p>
<p>It has said that the Centre required to do so since the “victims would not be efficaciously able to access and have recourse against the hasty and malafide action of the state government.” It pointed out that the apex court has already accepted the right of the victims as a part of Article 21 by a Constitution Bench judgment in 2010.</p>
<p>The Bench had last week stayed the release of four convicts in the case while questioning Tamil Nadu government if it was in a rush to release them.</p>
<p>Tamil Nadu government has opposed the Centre’s petition, saying they wished to earn “brownie points” by filing a plea of such a nature when there was no question of violation of anybody’s fundamental rights. It has also raised issues over maintainability of the petition. Later, some of the families of the victims also filed a PIL against the state’s decision.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000911&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[On the basis of a complaint received through the CVC, the CBI had registered a PE against unknown officials of the ministry in July last year. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000909&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The CBI has decided to close a preliminary enquiry (PE) against unknown officials of the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) in connection with a proposed high-rise by real estate giant DLF. Agency sources said it decided to close the PE after the MoUD argued it is well within the legal framework to take a decision to allow construction of the high-rise.</span></p>
<p>The Indian Express had on Tuesday reported that the proposed high-rise residential project, barely a kilometre from Rashtrapati Bhavan, is on hold as it is caught in the middle of conflicting security assessments by government agencies and a CBI inquiry.</p>
<p>A senior CBI official said, “We may question the decision, but it is not illegal. It is a policy decision and the MoUD was well within the legal framework.”</p>
<p>On the basis of a complaint received through the Central Vigilance Commission, the CBI had registered a PE against unknown officials of the ministry in July last year.</p>
<p>The DLF had got the ministry’s nod to construct a four-storey luxury apartment complex on the land, but the second proposal to raise it to eight storeys faced objection from the Delhi Police, which referred it to another security review. Meanwhile, the CVC referred the matter to the CBI and the apex investigating agency sought comments from various agencies involved in the approval.</p>
<p>“A PE had been registered in July last year to look into the allegation of conversion of land use from dairy farming to residential. The PE was closed as no criminality was found,” said a CBI spokersperson.</p>
<p>The company, meanwhile, denied allegations of any wrongdoing. “M/s EKSPL was acquired by the company in a private transaction over a decade ago. The requisite approvals have been sought pursuant to court directions obtained after protracted litigation and by strictly following due process in this regard,” DLF said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>A single Bench of the Delhi High Court had in 2010 allowed EKSPL to use a 9.26-hectare dairy farm in the vicinity of Rashtrapati Bhavan for residential purposes after depositing conversion charges of Rs 1,200 crore with the government.</p>
<p>During the hearing, the Centre opposed the conversion, citing security concerns, and said the area in question is in the vicinity of Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone (LBZ) President’s Estate and involves security concerns.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000909&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Two Maoist commanders were killed by Orissa police in an encounter at Munugulluvalsa village in Koraput district bordering Andhra Pradesh. Officials said a small team of District Voluntary Force led by additional SP Santosh Kumar Mall tracked down the two Maoists in a camp near Munugulluvalsa. </span></p>
<p>When the team asked the Maoists to surrender, they opened fire. One Maoist, Narender, was the first to die in the exchange. The other, Dumbri, holed up in a house, was killed 20 minutes later. </p>
<p>Others in the camp escaped. The cops seized a carbine, a sten gun, two magazines and a grenade from the spot.</p>
<p>Senior police officials said Narender and Dumbri, both in the ranks of Divisional Committee Member were from Andhra Pradesh. Both were members of Koraput-Srikakulam divisional committee of Andhra-Orissa Border Special Zonal Committee. </p>
<p>Police said Narender, 55, was active in Malkangiri and was brought to Koraput-Andhra border two years ago. He was not promoted due to ill health. Dumbri, 35, joined the organisation more than a decade ago. Both carried a reward of Rs 10 lakh each on their heads announced by Orissa and Andhra Pradesh police. Both were believed to be involved in last year’s Pottangi landmine blast in which 4 BSF personnel were killed.</p>
<p>This is the third big encounter in a year. On August 23 last year, a team of DVF and SOG killed Maoist Madhav alias Golla Ramullu, a member of Andhra-Orissa Border Malkangiri Maoist Divisional Committee.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000902&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The cabinet on March 2 approved the inclusion of Jats in the central OBC list of nine states including Bihar, which has no Jat population. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000900&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Where are Jats in Bihar?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The State Commission for Backward Classes (SCBC) is dismayed at the union cabinet including Bihar among the nine states from where Jats have been put in the central list of OBCs. And both the JD(U) and BJP are upset because the feel Jats “cannot be given reservation at the expense of 131 OBCs in Bihar”.</p>
<p>The cabinet on March 2 approved the inclusion of Jats in the central OBC list of nine states including Bihar, which has no Jat population. The decision was apparently taken to appease Jat leader Ajit Singh.</p>
<p>The SCBC, which gave a written representation to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) on the subject in the last week of February, has described the Centre’s decision as “ludicrous”.</p>
<p>SCBC member and social scientist Jag Narayan Singh told The Indian Express: “When NCBC recently queried about Jats in Bihar, we clearly said that the state had no Jat population and it made no sense to include Jats in the central OBC list for Bihar. Our chairman Justice (retd) Dharmpal Sinha visited Delhi last week to make the position clear.”</p>
<p>Singh said the Bihar commission had told NCBC that it could not agree with the idea of putting Bihar among the nine states. The NCBC could, if it wanted, go ahead “on its own, without any rationale though”.</p>
<p>Singh said the the NCBC had held no public hearing in Bihar about including Jats in the list.</p>
<p>The BJP and JD(U) have found a rare unanimity on the issue. Former deputy CM and BJP legislature party leader Sushil Kumar Modi said, “It is an aberration. It looks erroneous and evokes surprise. Including Jats in central OBC list of nine states will surely hurt the interests of OBCs in Bihar. Jats are a powerful community, and it is not fair that they should get jobs at the expense of other OBCs without increasing the overall quota.”</p>
<p>JD(U) Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson K C Tyagi said: “We are surprised. We never expected Bihar to be among the nine states. Where are Jats in Bihar? This is dirty politics in election season.”</p>
<p>India’s Jat population is estimated to be around 9 crore. The decision gives them benefits of reservation in central government jobs and central education institutions in the states of Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and the National Capital Territory of Delhi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000900&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Mamata Banerjee, who has not been included in the recently formed “third front” of non-Congress, non-BJP parties, dismisses that alliance as “tired front”. The Trinamool Congress chief is confident “a different kind of federal front” will rule the country. She rules out allying with the Congress, the BJP or the Left, and keeps open the question of being a candidate for prime minister. Excerpts from an interview she gave by email to PTI, as quoted by that agency:</span></p>
<p><strong>On the coming together of 11 parties:</strong><br />
No matter. Any force with the communists in it is not viable because the people have rejected the CPM. So&#8230; it is not a third front, it is tired front.</p>
<p><strong>On whether she feels left out since she isn’t in the alliance:</strong><br />
Nothing like that&#8230;.any front of significance (including Trinamool) will come together only after the results are announced&#8230; We are hopeful that a federal front government will lead this nation.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>On who her allies could be after the elections:</strong><br />
Making empty noises now is one thing. It is not important. What is important is to come to Delhi in May with many dozens of Lok Sabha seats.</p>
<p><strong>On whether she is a candidate for the prime minister’s chair:</strong><br />
Throughout my three decades of struggle, people have always been my motivation and inspiration, not kursis&#8230; I have experience of working at the Centre, I have also experience of working in a state. In a democracy, people will decide.</p>
<p><strong>On the two principal rivals:</strong><br />
The Congress is not the alternative to the BJP, and the BJP is not the alternative to the Congress&#8230; People are tired of corruption. People are tired of dynasty&#8230;. People are tired of parties that encourage riots.</p>
<p><strong>On allying with either party:</strong><br />
Let me make it very clear. We are fighting these elections against the Left, the Congress and the BJP.<br />
<strong>On how she sees the Congress </strong><strong>faring:</strong><br />
The Congress will get between 60 and 70 seats. The country is fed up with their anti-people policies. So where is the question of forgiving and forgetting?<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>And the BJP:</strong><br />
Close to 150-160.</p>
<p><strong>On her priorities:</strong><br />
Our focus has been on developing Bengal so that the people reward us abundantly in the Lok Sabha elections.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>On looking beyond Bengal:</strong><br />
As you know, we are the principal opposition party in Manipur and also have MLAs in Assam, Arunachal and UP. We have already announced that we are putting up candidates in Delhi, Jharkhand and some other states.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000889&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It was a Saturday morning, three months before an election, and the sight before them was all too familiar. A group of policemen blocked their path, enabling a convoy to whiz by without stopping. It had more than a hundred vehicles, most of them large and expensive, with even a BMW in the mix. </span></p>
<p>Each car had a sticker that paid homage to their leader. The posters were similar to a large billboard that stared down at them, sponsored by a local party worker hopeful of a ticket. The aam aadmi of Uttar Pradesh watched as nothing, not even toll booths, stopped Arvind Kejriwal’s roadshow. Impressive as the show of strength was, some quietly asked the question all of them were thinking. The Aam Aadmi Party had started with the premise that they had arrived to change politics. What if politics had changed them?</p>
<p>Over three days, the convoy, ever changing as it was, covered more than 1,000 km. For most of the journey, Kejriwal travelled in a Toyota Innova, only to emerge on top of an open jeep when he addressed the crowds in towns along the way. Those who followed him identified themselves by stickers on their vehicles, juxtaposed with their own pictures and welcoming him on his first visit to UP. These vehicles betrayed their wealth. A few were in a rickety jeep, or a tempo, but most rode in Toyota Fortuners, Mahindra Scorpios and Toyota Innovas. One ticket hopeful from Meerut followed Kejriwal in a BMW. As they passed, a local laughed: “How can these be the aam aadmi?”</p>
<p>At several places, local volunteers waited, garlands in hand. They made a beeline for Kejriwal, often stopping other traffic on the busy national highway. At most places where he chose to step out of his vehicle and address the townspeople, he did so right by the main road. What ensued was long traffic jams, and to avoid them many used the wrong carriageway. In Bareilly for instance, once Kejriwal had passed by, traffic came to a standstill.</p>
<p>If people had to stop for the Aam Aadmi Party to pass by, toll booths didn’t slow the cavalcade down either. At most booths, nearly every vehicle, including those of the media, just sped by. Booth attendants waved the vehicles on, with no money or receipts exchanged.</p>
<p>Some of those asking the questions were Aam Aadmi Party volunteers themselves. On the way back to Delhi from Kanpur, Kejriwal’s cavalcade turned into a small clearing in Aurraiya, where a group of 50 had collected to listen to him. He didn’t emerge out of the car. One man in an AAP cap ran to Kejriwal’s Innova and asked, “Utar ke do minute baat kar lijiye sir.” The answer he got was that there weren’t enough people to speak to.</p>
<p>In the three days that marked his first foray into UP, bar the one at the rally in Kanpur, each speech mirrored the other. He spoke of himself, and his Aam Aadmi Party as a collection of “small people, without money, or influence.” The cars, the billboards and the police that lined police argued against him.</p>
<p><strong>Meeting with Tauqeer Raza</strong></p>
<p>Months after his meeting with cleric Tauqeer Raza stoked a controversy ahead of the Delhi elections, Arvind Kejriwal met Raza again Tuesday. After the last meeting, the BJP had alleged Raza was known for issuing fatwas, including one that Taslima Nasreen should be beheaded; Raza had then denied this.</p>
<p>Raza, who called on Kejriwal at his home Tuesday, said the meeting was aimed at finding a secular option to fight an election being waged “almost completely on communal lines”. “We aren’t ruling out the possibility of aiding Kejriwal’s party,” he said.</p>
<p>He belogs to a family of clerics with a large number of Sunni followers in Bareilly. He also heads the political Ittehad-e-Millat Council, which won an assembly seat in UP in 2012. This year, Raza said, his party is not looking to contest.</p>
<p>AAP sources said his support might prove decisive. “Historically the Muslim vote in UP has decided who wins,” said a leader.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000877&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rahul1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000875" alt="Kahul and Amoeba Hasin, somewhat like Rahul and Haseeba Amin." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rahul1.jpg" /></a> Kahul and Amoeba Hasin, somewhat like Rahul and Haseeba Amin.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Video for video, spoofs have appeared of the Congress ads promoting Rahul Gandhi. Though no one is credited in the new videos being splashed on social media, volunteers of BJP units are understood to be behind them.</span></p>
<p>One video has in Rahul’s place a child sucking on a lollipop and dressed like Rahul is in the original. The slogan goes, “Main Kahul baba ki shaitan company ka karyakarta, jahan koi karya nahin karta (I am worker of Kahul baba’s company where no one works).”</p>
<p>The spoofs replace the tagline “Har haath shakti, har haath tarakki” with “Har haath lollipop, har haath rewari” and “Har haath hari patti, vikas ko lal batti”.</p>
<p>One video parodies Haseeba Amin, who chants in the Congress ad, “Hum yuva ko ek yuva hi samajh sakte hai, jo samjhdaar ho, intelligent ho and again, no rocket science&#8230; Congress ke neta hi hai. (Only a young leader can understand the aspirations of the young&#8230;)”. In the spoof, a similarly dressed “Amoeba Hasin” innovates: “Simple se baat hai, koi rocket science nahin, pocket science hai&#8230; Hame who hi samjah sakta hai jo immature ho, crazy magnet ho, again no rocket science&#8230; Dongress ke neta hi hai&#8230;”</p>
<p>Har Hath Shakti has a Mr Giri comparing the country with a tree. The spoof has a child, also a Giri, saying, “Yeh desh ek ped hai&#8230; hamare jaise bigade hue bachche in daliyon se phal churayenge, tabhi to hum peedhiyon tak khayenge&#8230; yehi ek haath is ped ko saalo se loot aya hai&#8230;” Giri the child snatches the lollipop from “Kahul”.</p>
<p>“The videos are the work of the Samvaad cell in Gujarat,” a BJP source says. “An independent Modi fan club is working with the cell’s volunteers.” All contributions have reportedly come free; no one in the BJP would officially divulge who is behind the campaign.</p>
<p>The sources say more will be launched shortly. The makers are understood to have decided against launching them on mainstream media as they feel they have reached the targeted audience successfully enough through Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and WhatsApp.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;Cong videos flash numbers to say, ‘Can you trust him?’</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Congress has released videos challenging Narendra Modi’s claims about development in Gujarat. Uploaded on the party website, these are direct attacks unlike the party’s earlier TV and print ads.</span></p>
<p>One “fact check” video, “Fudging job creation in Gujarat”, notes Modi has claimed Gujarat accounts for 72 per cent of jobs created in the country through employment exchanges, then shows the main page of the Ahmedabad district employment exchange’s website to say: “Placement 578, job seekers 85,432. Only 0.7 per cent. Can you trust him? Let’s get the facts right.” That is the only employment exchange the video deals with.</p>
<p>The video “Modi fudges China’s education expenditure” refers to his claim that China spends 20 per cent of its GDP on education. The video says China spends 3.93 per cent and India 4 per cent.</p>
<p>A third video refers to Modi’s statement that it is time India fixed the education system. “But have his policies on education in Gujarat really worked?” it says, quoting the NGO Pratham’s annual education report to argue that 27 per cent of students in classes VI to VIII students in Gujarat can divide against the national average of 39 per cent, and that 32 per cent in II to V can subtract against the national 40 per cent.</p>
<p>With Modi having attacked the UPA over its sports policy, another Congress video asks, “But has the Gujarat sports policy worked?” Titled “The lying game, catch Modi’s bluff on sports”, this video shows the medal tally at the 2011 national games in Ranchi where Gujarat ranked 28th with seven medals. It draws a comparison: “Sikkim at 26, population 1/100th of Gujarat.”</p>
<p>It is the first time the Congress has come up with videos to counter Modi’s claims although it has been challenging these with statistics earlier.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000873&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000871" alt="In 2009, the BJP and the Shiv Sena won 20 of 48 seats between them while the Swabhimani Paksha, then not in the alliance, won one. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi5.jpg" /></a> In 2009, the BJP and the Shiv Sena won 20 of 48 seats between them while the Swabhimani Paksha, then not in the alliance, won one.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Its eye on the prime minister’s chair for Narendra Modi, yet not certain of a majority of its own, the BJP has set about forging and looking for alliances, state by state, in its quest for 272 seats. A look at who are or could be with the BJP in nine of those states (counting Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as one), which together account for 255 of the 543 Lok Sabha seats: </span></p>
<p><strong>Raj factor: Maharashtra</strong></p>
<p>The BJP has forged a five-party alliance, Mahayuti, with the Shiv Sena, the RPI, the Swabhimani Paksha and the Rashtriya Samaj Paksha. Additionally, to prevent a split in the anti-UPA vote, the BJP is trying to convince Raj Thackeray not to field MNS candidates.</p>
<p>In 2009, the BJP and the Shiv Sena won 20 of 48 seats between them while the Swabhimani Paksha, then not in the alliance, won one. The Congress-NCP alliance has 25 seats in a state where it is in power; the Mahayuti is hoping for anti-incumbency accumulated over three terms.</p>
<p><strong>Naidu an option: Andhra pradesh</strong><br />
N Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP made several overtures to the BJP in the run-up to the passage of the Telangana Bill. Since then, the TDP has gone quiet, apparently putting on the BJP the onus of taking the initiative for an alliance, or possibly preferring to wait until after the polls. With the TRS in Telangana rejecting a merger with Congress, the BJP senses a window of opportunity there too, but again only after the polls.<br />
The BJP had won four of 42 seats in 1998 and seven in 1999, in alliance with the TDP. It has been routed since they parted ways in 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Paswan won over: Bihar</strong><br />
The BJP-JD(U) alliance in 2009 won 32 of 40 seats, but the parting of ways made the BJP look vulnerable given the JD(U)’s base among the backward castes and Dalits — until the BJP forged alliances with Ram Vilas Paswan’s LJP and Upendra Kushwaha’s RLSP. The BJP will contest 30 seats, twice as many as in 2009, with the rest shared between the LJP (seven) and the RLSP (three).</p>
<p><strong>Vaiko Done, DMK a teaser: Tamil Nadu</strong></p>
<p>The BJP has sealed an alliance with Vaiko’s MDMK, is moving forward in talks with the PMK, and is waiting for a final word from the DMDK. The BJP is wary of initiating a dialogue on its own with the DMK given that the 2G scam is linked to the party, though DMK chief Karunanidhi has tempted the BJP by praising Narendra Modi.<br />
In 1998, the BJP won three seats of 39 in alliance with the AIADMK, part of the most successful combination; in 1999 it bagged four in alliance with the DMK, the MDMK and the PMK.</p>
<p><strong>BSY is back: karnataka</strong><br />
As the ruling party in the state, the BJP won 19 of 28 Lok Sabha seats in 2009 while the Congress bagged six and the JD(S) three. The exit of former chief minister B S Yedyyurappa cost the BJP in last year’s assembly elections, which returned the Congress to power. Now the BJP has got Yeddyurappa back; his fledgling KJP had bagged about 10 per cent of the votes in the assembly elections. The BJP state unit is rooting for merging in former minister B Sreeramulu’s BSR Congress, too; it got three per cent of the votes in the assembly elections.</p>
<p><strong>Smaller parties targeted: orissa</strong></p>
<p>The BJP won seven of 21 seats in 1998 and nine in 1999, contesting in alliance with the BJD both times. However, they parted ways ahead of the 2009 and the BJP now has no seat in the state. With Naveen Patnaik having avoided an alliance since, the party is exploring a grand alliance with Soumya Ranjan Patnaik’s Aam Orissa party, Braja Kishore Tripathy’s Samata Kranti Party and Kharavela Swain’s Utkal Bharat Party. Talks with Pyari Mohan Mohapatra’s party have hit a roadblock with the state unit not keen on an alliance.</p>
<p><strong>Divide over AGP: ASSAM</strong></p>
<p>The AGP had contested in 2009 in alliance with the BJP, which won four of 14 seats. However, they parted ways during the assembly elections of 2011, leading to a miserable performance by both parties. The AGP has since shown an interest in a pre-poll alliance with the BJP. The BJP’s state unit is, however, divided. The BJP central leadership too is unsure how useful an ally the faction-ridden AGP will be; it is not in the mood to concede too many seats. The onus is on the AGP to forge an alliance with its share reduced since 2009.</p>
<p><strong>Still with Akalis: Punjab</strong></p>
<p>The BJP’s alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal is already in place and their coalition is in power in the state. The BJP will contest three seats and the SAD the remaining 10.</p>
<p><strong>Deal with hjc: Haryana</strong></p>
<p>The BJP has forged an alliance with the Haryana Janhit Congress led by Kuldeep Bishnoi, with the latter to contest two of 10 seats. O P Chuatala’s INLD, too, has been eyeing an understanding with the BJP. However, the conviction of Chautala and his struggle to get relief from court have come in the way of an alliance, with the HJC against one in any case.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000870&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gadkari-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000857" alt="BJP leader Nitin Gadkari came under fire from party members after he met with MNS chief Raj Thackerey. (Indian Express)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gadkari-480.jpg" /></a> BJP leader Nitin Gadkari came under fire from party members after he met with MNS chief Raj Thackerey. (Indian Express)
<p>The Bharatiya Janata Party has distanced itself from the “political adventure” undertaken by former party president Nitin Gadkari, who met MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Monday and asked him not to field candidates in the Lok Sabha elections in order not to divide votes of Shiv Sena and BJP.</p>
<p>After holding closed-door parleys, state and central leaders of the party expressed displeasure over Gadkari&#8217;s “gameplan”, which it believes was an attempt to reassert himself on his home turf. The development has left many leaders in the state wondering if Gadkari had given a fresh lease of life to MNS, whose electoral prospects were not appearing too bright till now.</p>
<p>MNS leader Bala Nandgaonkar, however, dismissed Gadkari&#8217;s offer. “The formal decision on making public the list of candidates would be taken in a couple of days,&#8221; he said. State BJP president Devendra Fadnavis said: &#8220;As far as the BJP is concerned, we have pulled the curtains down on the developments. Moreover, Gadkari(ji) is a national leader who has explained the reasons for his meeting with Raj Thackeray. It would be inappropriate for us to further interpret their meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Gadkari-Raj meeting, however, did not go down well with the Shiv Sena. Its spokesperson Sanjay Raut even said that such a meeting could affect the alliance. “It can affect the &#8216;Mahayuti&#8217; (grand alliance) if a senior leader of the BJP meets Raj Thackeray or NCP chief Sharad Pawar,” Raut said in a statement.</p>
<p>BJP leader Vinod Tawde, however, said there was no reason for the Shiv Sena to “overreact”. “If the MNS had agreed not to contest, it would have helped both Sena and BJP candidates,&#8221; he said. Insiders indicated that Gadkari might have the consent of national party president Rajnath Singh, but prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi had been cautious ever since the MNS leader launched an attack on him at a public rally. Modi had also disapproved the violence unleashed by MNS workers on the toll collection issue.</p>
<p>Organisational leaders in the state headquarters lamented that Gadkari&#8217;s “gameplan” had badly boomeranged and exposed the cracks within the party. “While it has helped in generating unrest in the Sena, it lends credence to the power tussle between Gadkari and Munde in the party,&#8221; said a leader.</p>
<p>However, Gadkari said on Tuesday: &#8220;I have confined myself to Delhi politics. My initiative to get MNS not to field Lok Sabha candidates is to enhance our tally in Maharashtra, since MNS still has a sizeable vote share. The division of votes would ultimately affect Sena and BJP.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000850&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where are Jats in Bihar?</p>
<p>The State Commission for Backward Classes (SCBC) is dismayed at the union cabinet including Bihar among the nine states from where Jats have been put in the central list of OBCs. And both the JD(U) and BJP are upset because the feel Jats “cannot be given reservation at the expense of 131 OBCs in Bihar”.</p>
<p>The cabinet on March 2 approved the inclusion of Jats in the central OBC list of nine states including Bihar, which has no Jat population. The decision was apparently taken to appease Jat leader Ajit Singh.</p>
<p>The SCBC, which gave a written representation to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) on the subject in the last week of February, has described the Centre’s decision as “ludicrous”.</p>
<p>SCBC member and social scientist Jag Narayan Singh told The Indian Express: “When NCBC recently queried about Jats in Bihar, we clearly said that the state had no Jat population and it made no sense to include Jats in the central OBC list for Bihar. Our chairman Justice (retd) Dharmpal Sinha visited Delhi last week to make the position  clear.”</p>
<p>Singh said the Bihar commission had told NCBC that it could not agree with the idea of putting Bihar among the nine states. The NCBC could, if it wanted, go ahead “on its own, without any rationale though”. Singh said the the NCBC had held no public hearing in Bihar about including Jats in the list.</p>
<p>The BJP and JD(U) have found a rare unanimity on the issue. Former deputy CM and BJP legislature party leader Sushil Kumar Modi said, “It is an aberration. It looks erroneous and evokes surprise. Including Jats in central OBC list of nine states will surely hurt the interests of OBCs in Bihar. Jats are a powerful community, and it is not fair that they should get jobs at the expense of other OBCs without increasing the overall quota.”</p>
<p>JD(U) Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson K C Tyagi said: “We are surprised. We never expected Bihar to be among the nine states. Where are Jats in Bihar? This is dirty politics in election season.” India’s Jat population is estimated to be around 9 crore. The decision gives them benefits of reservation in central government jobs and central education institutions in the states of Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and the National Capital Territory of Delhi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000833&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/suki.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000927" alt="Manmohan Singh with Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Nay Pyi Taw on Tuesday. PTI " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/suki.jpg" /></a> Manmohan Singh with Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Nay Pyi Taw on Tuesday. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Urging the seven-member BIMSTEC grouping to fast-track trade and economic cooperation, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday called for “early conclusion” of the BIMSTEC Free Trade Agreement and said it should be extended to investment and services.</span></p>
<p>Hours later, the third summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) issued a joint declaration directing the trade negotiating committee to “expedite work for conclusion of the Agreement on Trade in Goods by the end of 2014, and to continue its efforts for early finalisation of the Agreement on Services and Investments”.</p>
<p>Singh said India would soon launch a direct shipping line to Myanmar. He also announced the opening of a BIMSTEC Centre for Weather and Climate in Noida near Delhi. On the security front, he called for negotiations on a BIMSTEC extradition convention.</p>
<p>Addressing the summit, Singh said the FTA should be wrapped up early: “Most of us here are connected with each other through one or more regional economic arrangements and it should not be difficult for us to conclude one for BIMSTEC.”</p>
<p>Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand make the BIMSTEC club, home to one-fifth of the world’s population and some of the poorest, but with energy and mineral reserves that promise a bright future if governments fast-track growth and cut red tape for business.</p>
<p>A framework agreement for the BIMSTEC free trade area was signed in Phuket, Thailand, in February 2004, committing parties to negotiate FTAs in goods, services and investments. But that pact has been elusive.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Nay Pyi Taw summit, Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh called the BIMSTEC negotiation process “particularly complex because it already encompasses countries which have FTA under the SAFTA process, and then you have other countries that belong to ASEAN&#8230; We have to arrive at an outcome that is optimal for India and them”.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Singh listed energy as another priority for the BIMSTEC. “As India and some of its neighbours are getting linked by energy grids, we are already experiencing the regional and national benefits of energy cooperation. We must connect each other through transmission highways and gas and oil pipelines, while examining opportunities for cooperation in renewable energy sources. I hope the BIMSTEC Energy Centre planned in Bengaluru will play a key role in this.</p>
<p>“In coming together, we are not only stepping out of narrow, traditional definitions of regions such as South Asia or Southeast Asia, but we are also building a bridge across Asia’s most promising and dynamic arc,” he said.</p>
<p>Underlining physical and digital connectivity as “a driver of cooperation and integration”, Singh asked his counterparts to “identify and implement priority projects of regional importance from the comprehensive study prepared by the Asian Development Bank”.</p>
<p>“And even as we develop physical infrastructure, we should simultaneously start developing the supporting architecture of rules and regulations to facilitate cross-country movements. To promote both BIMSTEC tourism packages and intra-BIMSTEC travel, let us declare 2015 as a Year of BIMSTEC Tourism.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000832&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/khurshidm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1973162" alt=" Khurshid said the party did not need to lay its cards on the table." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/khurshidm.jpg" /></a> Khurshid said the party did not need to lay its cards on the table.
<p>Defending the move to bring in ordinances to push through anti-graft Bills backed by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on the eve of elections, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said Tuesday night that  &#8220;very difficult&#8230; special circumstances&#8230; constant, rigid opposition&#8221; had forced the government to take such a route.</p>
<p>Responding to a query from The Indian Express, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said: &#8220;The standard answer (to taking the ordinance route) would be a no&#8230; But these are very difficult circumstances&#8230; Should the Parliament not have functioned for three sessions?&#8230; I agree ordinances are no substitute for Parliament&#8230; but these are very special circumstances&#8230; There has been constant, rigid opposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khurshid spoke to the media on board the Prime Minister&#8217;s special aircraft after Manmohan Singh, returning home from the BIMSTEC summit in Myanmar which was his last official trip abroad, skipped the customary on-board press conference.</p>
<p>He said Rahul Gandhi has some very &#8220;clear views&#8230; wants to do something that fulfils the expectations of the common man&#8230; and doesn&#8217;t want to disappoint&#8230; but he is not trying to draw any political mileage&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is leading us&#8230; and it is our job to support him in his endeavour&#8230; the President is the head of state and has great experience.. we will try to put across our point of view,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To a query on whether the Congress needed to rethink its strategy in view of aggressive campaigning by BJP challenger Narendra Modi, Khurshid said the party did not need to lay its cards on the table. &#8220;Sometimes high decibel campaigns boomerang,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000830&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Discontent in Bihar BJP after its electoral tie-up with LJP and RLSP on Tuesday came to the fore with some powerful upper caste leaders complaining to the central leadership that they were not involved in deciding tickets for the Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>The leaders including C P Thakur, Giriraj Singh,  Ashwani Kumar Chaube and Amrendra Pratap Singh expressed displeasure with the former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi at a &#8216;Chai pe charcha (discussion over tea)&#8217; at Kargil Chowk.</p>
<p>These leaders, who were conspicuous by their absence at Narendra Modi&#8217;s rally in Muzaffarpur on Monday, are angry with Sushil Modi-led faction for &#8220;conspiring&#8221; to give away upper caste-dominant constituencies like Munger, Begusarai andNawada to the new allies &#8211; Lok Janshakti Party and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party.</p>
<p>In these seats they wanted to contest themselves or seek tickets for their kin. Giriraj Singh, a Narendra Modi follower, said he and some other leaders had met the Gujarat Chief Minister at the airport on Monday during his brief stop over on way to Muzaffarpur for the rally and complained against Sushil Modi&#8217;s &#8220;domineering ways to marginalise them in the decision making process&#8221;.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Giriraj Singh denied that he and other caste leaders were standing in unison to vent their ireat the state unit being commanded by Sushil Modi, though he did not hide his displeasure with him. Chaube and Thakur gave enough hints of discontent brewingin the BJP against Sushil Modi&#8217;s style of functioning, but expressed hope that all vexed problems will be sorted outamicably.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly Nandkishore Yadav admitted differences of opinion within the party and said all leaders have a right to express their viewsas the BJP happens to be a democratic party. Yadav, at the same time, exuded confidence that all leaders will abide by decisions taken with regard to alliance with LJP and  RLSP and work collectively towards catapulting NDA to power at the Centre.</p>
<p>Talking to reporters in Bhagalpur, BJP national spokesperson Syed Shahanwaz Hussain denied any difference in Bihar unit and said the decision on alliance and ticket distribution was the prerogative of central parliamentary board and one must abide by its decision.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000823&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Maharashtra BJP strongly backed its former party chief Nitin Gadkari, who had met Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president Raj Thackeray yesterday, to request him not to contest Lok Sabha polls, to ensure that votes do not get fragmented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gadkariji has clarified the motive behind meeting Raj Thackeray, since he said that if MNS contests Lok Sabha polls, it will lead to division of votes (between the BJP-Sena-RPI alliance and the MNS),&#8221; Maharashtra BJP chief Devendra Fadnavis told reporters here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gadkariji is our national leader. He can meet anybody he wants. It does not need my endorsement,&#8221; he said. However, he said that his party is still unaware about MNS president Raj Thackeray&#8217;s stand on the issue. Fadnavis also clarified that he was not summoned by Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray who is said to be unhappy about Gadkari&#8217;s overtures towards the MNS.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not summoned by Uddhav Thackeray last night. A meeting with him was already scheduled. No explanation was sought from me by the Sena chief,&#8221; he said. Another BJP leader Vinod Tawde said that if the MNS does not contest Lok Sabha polls, then it would not only benefit the BJP, but also the Shiv Sena.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not know why there was any need to react sharply. Gadkariji only asked him (Raj Thackeray) not to contest the Lok Sabha polls. He did not do any deal with Raj,&#8221; the Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council said. &#8220;There is no need for Sena leaders to be upset,&#8221; he said, adding that, &#8220;We did not ask the MNS to join in the BJP-Sena-RPI alliance or the NDA. Gadkariji did not propose any such thing,&#8221; Tawde said.</p>
<p>Both the Shiv Sena and the BJP had lost their five respective seats due to the MNS factor during the 2009 general elections.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000827&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mayawati-medium.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000825" alt="MAYAWATI-MEDIUM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mayawati-medium.gif" /></a> Mayawati also attacked Congress for &#8220;rampant corruption&#8221;, spiraling prices and not doing enough for minorities, backwards and poor. (PTI)
<p>BSP chief Mayawati on Tuesday  accused BJP and SP of having a tacit understanding ahead of the Lok Sabha polls to polarise voters saying Muslims have suffered due to communal violence both in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>She also attacked Congress for &#8220;rampant corruption&#8221;, spiraling prices and not doing enough for minorities, backwards and poor. But at the same time she skirted an attack on Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi.</p>
<p>&#8220;In his rally in Allahabad on Sunday, Mulayam Singh Yadav accused Narendra Modi on the issue of post-Godhra riots. We also agree that the issue should be raised. But it is the same Allahabad where in SP&#8217;s previous regime communal flareup took place and girls were sexually assaulted. There was no justice for the victims. Yadav made no mention of it,&#8221; she told a press conference here.</p>
<p>Mayawati alleged that BJP and SP have a tacit understanding to polarise the voters in UP ahead of general elections. &#8220;But I am sure the Muslims will see through the game&#8230; in fact they (BJP and SP) are in the same boat. Chor chor mausere bhai (two thieves are cousins),&#8221; she claimed.</p>
<p>The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said BJP President Rajnath Singh&#8217;s remarks that he was ready to apologise to Muslims for any mistake will have little impact as &#8220;most of the Gujarat riot victims were Muslims who are yet to recover from the trauma&#8221;.</p>
<p>She said around 150 incidents of communal riots have taken place in Uttar Pradesh during the present SP regime. &#8220;The victims of Muzaffarnagar and Shamli are yet to recover,&#8221; she said. When asked why she was silent on Rahul who too had been attacking BSP in UP, Mayawati said since he has not been declared Congress&#8217; PM candidate, she would &#8220;not be able to comment on him&#8221;.</p>
<p>She also claimed that SP leaders have divided themselves into various &#8220;camps&#8221; to loot Uttar Pradesh.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000822&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lok-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000817" alt="The term of the current Lok Sabha expires on June 1 and the new House has to be constituted by May 31. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lok-med.jpg" /></a> The term of the current Lok Sabha expires on June 1 and the new House has to be constituted by May 31. (Reuters)
<p>On Wednesday the much-awaited schedule for the Lok Sabha polls will be announced by the Election Commission. With the announcement of poll dates, the Model Code of Conduct for governments and political parties will come into force with immediate effect.</p>
<p>The schedule will be announced at a press conference byChief Election Commissioner V S Sampath along with two Election Commissioners H S Brahma and S N A Zaidi. The conference this time is being held at Vigyan Bhawan instead ofat Nirvachan Bhawan, the EC headquarters.</p>
<p>Polling is likely to commence from the second week of April and may be spread over six to seven phases, the longest so far, highly placed sources said. The probable dates for the commencement of polling are between April 7 and 10, the sources in the Election Commission had said.</p>
<p>As of now, the plan is to have the voting exercise involving an electorate of 81 crore in six to seven phases. The 2009 polls were held in five phases from April 16 to May 13. The term of the current Lok Sabha expires on June 1 and the new House has to be constituted by May 31.</p>
<p>Along with the Lok Sabha election, Andhra Pradesh,including the regions comprising Telangana, Odisha and Sikkim will go to polls to elect new assemblies.</p>
<p>It could be the first time the country witnesses elections over such a long period in six or seven phases. The sources had said that the attempt is to &#8220;maximise&#8221; use of forces and the polling days. In the first phase, polling is expected to be held in some of the Naxal-hit states and in some northeastern states.</p>
<p>For the first time in parliamentary polls, a system of paper trail for electronic voting will be introduced in some constituencies on a trial basis.</p>
<p>There have been demands that a paper trail should be inplace so that a fool-proof record is created and controversies avoided in case of a dispute or an election petition filed in courts. The Commission has also issued guidelines to political parties asking them to explain the rationale of financing thepromises they make in their election manifestos. The guidelines that followed Supreme Court directions in this regard have now been made part of the Model Code.</p>
<p>An estimated 81.4 crore voters will be eligible to votein the coming elections after 9.71 crore new voters have beenadded to the rolls since the last elections.From the coming elections, candidates in a parliamentaryconstituency in bigger states can spend up to Rs 70 lakh ontheir campaign, up from Rs 40 lakh in 2011. In the 2009elections, it was Rs 25 lakh.</p>
<p>Another first in the Lok Sabha elections will be the introduction of &#8220;None of the Above&#8221; (NOTA) option in voting,which came into vogue in the assembly elections a few months ago.</p>
<p>The electoral rolls are ready after being updated with January one this year as the cut-off date. A total of 1.1 crore poll personnel, half of them being security forces, will be deployed for the smooth conduct of polls and to ensure that they are free and fair.<br />
Poll officials said the database of the civilian staff to be deployed for conducting polls has been prepared and atleast 5.5 million civilian staff would be deployed.The list of central government employees to be deployed for poll duty as micro-observers in sensitive polling stations has also been prepared.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000811&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/irs-medium.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000815" alt="irs-MEDIUM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/irs-medium.gif" /></a> IRS Officer has been guilty under various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. (PTI)A
<p>An IRS officer has been awarded a five-year jail term by a court here for accepting a bribe of Rs eight lakh from a Delhi-based pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>Special CBI judge Dinesh Kumar Sharma    handed down the jail term to Satish Kumar, the then Additional Director (Investigation), Income Tax, at Meerut, after holding him guilty under various provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.</p>
<p>The court also imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 on the 1989 batch Indian Revenue System (IRS) official saying &#8220;if the corruption is done by the senior officers then it deserves special treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider that a message must go that nobody is above law and that indulging in corruption is a risky proposition.The society looks upon the court in appropriate cases for a maximum punishment so as to have deterrent effect on the society at large,&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>CBI had filed a charge sheet against Kumar on a complaint made in April 2006 by Ramesh Juneja, the managing director of Mankind Pharma Ltd, who alleged that the IRS officer had demanded Rs 30 lakh from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;On May 20, 2006 the complainant (Juneja) met Kumar at his residence and in the said meeting accused threatened to initiate investigation against the complainant and demanded a bribe of Rs 30 lakh to avoid such harassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;After negotiation, the bribe amount was reduced to Rs 10 lakh,&#8221; the CBI had said, adding that later on only Rs 8 lakh was paid to Kumar.</p>
<p>However, Kumar pleaded innocence and told the court that Juneja was visiting his office as he was his neighbour and was friendly with him.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000813&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/as1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000808 " alt="Commerce Minister Anand Sharma" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/as1.jpg" /></a> Commerce Minister Anand Sharma. (PTI)
<p>Hitting out at Narendra Modi, Commerce Minister Anand Sharma today said the economic vision of BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate is nothing but &#8220;political plagiarism&#8221;.</p>
<p>Modi, he said, revealed nothing new in his economic vision for India and only rehashed the UPA government&#8217;s achievements.&#8221;What is being claimed as a vision (by Modi) is political plagiarism,&#8221; Sharma told reporters here.</p>
<p>The minister also said the Gujarat Chief Minister&#8217;s claims on investment figures during Vibrant Gujarat Summits were highly exaggerated. Sharma said if one adds up investments committed during the summits, they would exceed by manifold FDI inflows into the entire country. Citing the Reserve Bank data, Sharma said Gujarat received only USD 9 billion in FDI (between April, 2000 and December, 2013).</p>
<p>Maharashtra received the highest FDI during the said period (USD 65 billion), followed by New Delhi (USD 38.8 billion) and Chennai (USD 12.6 billion). He said Gujarat had claimed in 2011 that during the summit the state inked 7,936 MoUs worth USD 450 billion and 675 MoUs. In the previous summits also, Modi had claimed multi-billion dollar FDI proposals, Sharma said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just add it (the numbers). This is a multiple of at least 5 or 6 times of India&#8217;s total FDI. The total FDI received by India is USD 296 billion (so far),&#8221; he added. He also said when NDA demitted office (in 2004), India&#8217;s exports were to the tune of USD 78 billion and now they have crossed USD 300 billion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Modi is not familiar with (the current figures). The numbers are there in the record. I don&#8217;t want to get into &#8216;tu tu mai mai&#8217;&#8230;I do not expect him to be knowledgeable or to have the humility to appreciate the achievements but the criticism is in conflict with the numbers and facts,&#8221; Sharma said.</p>
<p>He said that during the last four years, India received USD 176 billion in FDI and India has become one of top destinations for foreign investments. He said BJP has impacted the country&#8217;s investment climate by saying that they would roll back the FDI in multi-brand retail policy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000803&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[ West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee claimed that she has been focusing on what people of the country want that is development, peace and progress for both nation and state. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000731&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mamata-main4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995806" alt="Mamata Banerjee dropped hints of her ambition saying she had experience of working at the Center.(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mamata-main4.jpg" /></a> Mamata Banerjee dropped hints of her ambition saying she had experience of working at the Center.(PTI)
<p>Mamata Banerjee is unfazed by her exclusion in the recently-formed Third Front which she rubbishes as an unviable &#8220;tired front&#8221; and is confident that a different kind of Federal Front will rule the country after the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>The West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo is also keeping open the option of whether she is a contender for the prime ministership, saying &#8220;people will decide&#8221;. She ruled out any truck with Congress or BJP and hoped that people would &#8220;reward&#8221; her party &#8220;abundantly&#8221; in the polls. &#8220;No matter. Any force with the Communists in it is not viable because the people have rejected the CPI(M). So,&#8230; it is not Third Front, it is Tired Front,&#8221; she told PTI in an email interview.</p>
<p>Mamata was responding when asked how she sees coming together recently of 11 parties to form the Third Front which includes Left parties, Samajwadi Party, JD(U) and JD(S). Asked whether she felt left out as she was not included in the &#8216;Third Front&#8217;, Mamata replied, &#8220;Nothing like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She insisted that &#8220;any Front of significance (including Trinamool) will only come together after the results are<br />
announced&#8230; We are hopeful that a Federal Front government will lead this nation. &#8220;Questioned as to how this was possible and who could be her allies after elections, she remained vague. &#8220;Making empty noise now is one thing. It is not important. What is important is to come to Delhi in May with many dozens of Lok Sabha seats. The Federal Front will take shape with this model, on the plank of common policies.&#8221;</p>
<p>On whether she will be a candidate for the prime ministership in case a &#8216;Federal Front&#8217; is formed, the Trinamool chief said, &#8220;Throughout my three decades of struggle, people have always been my motivation and inspiration, not &#8216;kursis&#8217; (chair).&#8221; At the same time, the former Union minister dropped enough hints about her ambition. &#8220;I have experience of working at the Centre, I have also experience of working in a state. In a democracy, people will decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the current political scene, Mamata contended that &#8220;Congress is not the alternative to BJP and BJP is not the alternative to Congress.&#8221; Hitting out at Congress with which she had an alliance till about two years ago, she said, &#8220;People are tired of corruption. People are tired of dynasty.&#8221; She also targeted BJP, saying &#8220;People are tired of parties that encourage riots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maintaining that people of the country want development, peace and progress for the nation and for the states to happen hand in hand, the West Bengal Chief Minister said she has been focussing on these issues only. &#8220;Our focus has been on developing Bengal so that the people will reward us abundantly in the Lok Sabha elections,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Besides West Bengal, Trinamool will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi and Jharkhand, she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000731&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Photo, Reuters)
<p>Amid speculations about chance of Congress going with JD(U) instead of RJD, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday categorically ruled out this possibility and said even a last minute decision on special category status to the state could not pave way  for such tie up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Its baseless speculation&#8230;there is no truth in this,&#8221; Kumar told reporters ruling out any chance of alliance with Congress if it agrees to provide special category status to Bihar to pave way for the tie-up. &#8220;Sawal paida nahin hota hain (the question does not arise),&#8221; he said on chance of JD(U) and Congress forging alliance for the coming elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been no such proposal from the beginning&#8230;its unnecessary speculation,&#8221; he said. Congress and RJD of Lalu Prasad are natural allies, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether talks on alliance between them is progressing or not is their concern&#8230;we have nothing to do with it,&#8221; he said emerging from a programme to lay foundation of road projects here. Kumar, who is driving force of JD(U) said, his party would have electoral tie up with CPI and CPM in Bihar for the coming general elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;While understanding on seats have been reached with CPI the same is in process with CPM,&#8221; he said. He, however, did not disclose the seats and said it would be made public soon.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000691&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/roy-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996058" alt="Sahara chief, accompanied by his son Sushanto Roy, was taken to court in a police vehicle around 5 pm." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/roy-med.jpg" /></a> Sahara chief, accompanied by his son Sushanto Roy, was taken to court in a police vehicle around 5 pm.
<p>It was drama to the hilt outside Supreme Court on Tuesday when Sahara chief Subrata Roy came in his trademark white shirt and black half-waist coat, but saw black ink thrown on his face by a man. Amid unprecedented chaos and commotion, 65-year-old Roy came to appear before the court in a white Bolero police vehicle and told the waiting media, &#8220;I promise that I will meet you all after coming out&#8221;.</p>
<p>Soon, a man calling himself &#8220;Manoj Sharma, lawyer from Gwalior&#8221;, threw ink on Roy&#8217;s face, removed his own shirt and started shouting that &#8220;he (Roy) is a thief and has stolen money from poor&#8221;.</p>
<p>Immediately, Roy was escorted inside the court premises and Sharma was roughed up by lawyers and others present before being taken away by the police to Tilak Mark station.</p>
<p>Roy, who was taken in police custody from his home in Lucknow on Friday, was brought as per orders of the apex court, which had issued a non-bailable warrant against him and had asked him to be presented at 2 pm on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The chief of Sahara group, which claims to have a net worth of over Rs 68,000 crore and an asset base of over Rs 1.5 lakh crore, has faced the ire of Supreme Court after he failed to appear before it on February 26 as per orders.</p>
<p>It took about 15-20 minutes for Supreme Court entry passes to be made for clean-shaven Roy, who was seen wearing a black tie with Sahara logo and sporting double-shade glasses. It was a first-of-its-kind incident for Roy, who has been in controversy for quite some time due to this long-running dispute between Sahara group and Sebi, which has found &#8220;various illegalities&#8221; in raising funds to the tune of over Rs 24,000 crore by two Sahara firms.</p>
<p>In an order dated August 31, 2012, the Supreme Court had ordered refund of this money to about three crore investors through Sebi. Later in December 2012, the group was asked to make the refund in three installments.</p>
<p>The group deposited the first intallment of Rs 5,120 crore with Sebi, but said the remaining amount was already returned to investors directly &#8212; a claim contested by market regulator Sebi.</p>
<p>Earlier in April 2013, Roy was also summoned to appear personally before Sebi. After that appearance the flamboyant chief of the diversified group famously said he had spent close to one hour at the regulator&#8217;s office and was not offered even a cup of tea.</p>
<p>There were earlier reports that Roy was being brought to Delhi in a Mercedes, but he came out of a Balero police vehicle outside Supreme Court, where journalists, lawyers and his own group employees had gathered in large numbers.</p>
<p>On social networking site Twitter also, his name was among the top-trending topics and people were seen chatting about the ink incident and other matters related to Sebi-Sahara case.</p>
<p>Sharma, who threw ink, once hurled a shoe at Congress MP Suresh Kalmadi while he had also got a fake death certificate made in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2005-06 to prove high level of corruption.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000706&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/murder-llll.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000609" alt="Shrien Dewani faces extradition to South Africa within four weeks after he lost his last legal battle on Tuesday (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/murder-llll.jpg" /></a> Shrien Dewani faces extradition to South Africa within four weeks after he lost his last legal battle on Tuesday (Reuters)
<p>An Indian-origin British businessman accused of plotting the murder of his Indo-Swedish wife on their honeymoon, faces extradition to South Africa within four weeks after he lost his last legal battle on Tuesday to block the move.</p>
<p>Shrien Dewani&#8217;s legal team had wanted to challenge an earlier High Court ruling that he could be extradited over the killing of his wife Anni. However, a panel of judges headed by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas refused to allow the case to be heard in the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Bristol-based Dewani is being compulsorily detained under the Mental Health Act, suffering from severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p>His lawyer told the judges at the High Court in London that there was fresh evidence that his &#8220;underlying medical condition&#8221; may have become chronic, making it &#8220;untreatable&#8221;.</p>
<p>But the judges rejected complaints made about the adequacy of the undertaking by the South African authorities regarding Dewani&#8217;s welfare, refusing to give the go-ahead for the case to go to the highest court in the country.</p>
<p>In January, the High Court ruled it would not be &#8220;unjust and oppressive&#8221; to extradite Dewani if assurances were received from South Africa about the length of time he would be kept in the country without trial.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old is suspected of ordering the killing of his wife, a 28-year-old Swedish national of Indian origin.</p>
<p>The charge dates back to November 2010 when the pair were held at gunpoint while driving through Cape Town in a taxi. Dewani was released unharmed but his wife&#8217;s body was found in the car with injuries to her head and chest the following day.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege South African national Xolile Mngeni, who was later convicted of premeditated murder and jailed for life, had been hired by Dewani to kill his wife.</p>
<p>The legal battle to keep Dewani in the UK until he is well enough to travel has been ongoing since 2011. But his team may now have exhausted all legal avenues, paving the way for UK Home Secretary Theresa May to issue an extradition order.</p>
<p>An application was made to the judges on Dewani&#8217;s behalf to delay immediately triggering the 28-day period in which the law now requires Dewani to be extradited.</p>
<p>Refusing the application, Lord Thomas said: &#8220;The provisions of the Extradition Act are designed to ensure extradition is a speedy process. &#8220;I therefore pronounce today. Any period that is applicable under the relevant legislation will run from today.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000580&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Resident doctors of AIIMS will hold a candle march within the hospital premises in protest against the alleged high-handedness of city police and administration on the junior doctors of GSVM medical college of Kanpur.<br />
Members of the Faculty Association of AIIMS, Students Union and Society of Young Scientists will also join the march.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been instances of doctors being man-handled by the kins of patients in the past which is highly condemnable. We will hold a candle march today at 6.30 PM to express solidarity with the doctors in strike and also to protest the high-handedness of city police and administration on the junior doctors,&#8221; said RDA general secretary, Dr Shashank Pooniya.</p>
<p>AIIMS resident doctors are also observing a &#8216;black badge day&#8217; today as a gesture to support the ongoing strike by the doctors in Kanpur and all other medical colleges in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Tuesday described the incident as a &#8220;highly condemnable and shameful act&#8221;. They have submitted a letter in this regard to the President demanding the immediate release of the 24 under graduate medical students unconditionally.</p>
<p>&#8220;We demand immediate revocation of all charges against the arrested medical students and that Irfan Solanki should immediately be arrested and SSP Yashashvi Yadav should immediately be suspended from duty and FIR should be lodged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Further we demand that a judicial enquiry or a CBI enquiry into this matter should be initiated,&#8221; said Dr Narendra Saini, general secretary of IMA. IMA has also received a complaint from the Students of GSVM Medical College of Kanpur informing about the brutal attack by the Samajwadi Party MLA, Irfan Solanki and his supporters on February 28. &#8220;Despite complaint given to police on the incident, they did not take proper action and manhandled and mistreated the complainants and students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mob blocked the emergency and compelled the authority of the College not to treat the injured and gun-shot patients&#8221;, said Saini. The medical fraternity in Kanpur has boycotted emergency services with the strike entering fourth day at various government and private hospitals. Several government hospitals in Uttar Pradesh have also joined the agitation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000681&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi-and-nitish-med.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000661" alt="Nitish Kumar on Tuesday questioned incidents of violence that occurred in Gujarat and other parts of the country." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi-and-nitish-med.gif" /></a> Nitish Kumar on Tuesday questioned incidents of violence that occurred in Gujarat and other parts of the country.
<p>Seeking to dismiss allegations by Narendra Modi that Bihar has become a haven for terrorists, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday questioned incidents of violence that occurred in Gujarat and other parts of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any incident of terrorism is a cause of worry. But if on the basis of one or two incidents Bihar is called a haven of terrorism, what shall we say about several such incidents happening in Gujarat and other parts of the country?&#8221; Kumar asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody knows who benefited from the serial blasts at the Patna rally which was a flop&#8230; had this unfortunate incident not happened it could not have attracted media coverage,&#8221; Kumar, who is senior leader of JD(U), claimed.<br />
&#8220;Befitting his personality some people see everything through the glass of communalism,&#8221; he said in a retort to charges levelled by the BJP Prime Ministerial candidate at a rally at Muzaffarpur on Monday.</p>
<p>Kumar said that his government had taken the terrorist attack at the Buddhist temple at Bodh Gaya and at the BJP rally on October 27 last year as a challenge and took all steps to prevent recurrence of such events.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, playing politics in the name of terrorism when elections are around the corner is a shameless effort,&#8221; he said. The Chief Minister was speaking to reporters after a foundation-laying ceremony for a road project here.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000655&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Under pressure to deliver the Teesta river water-sharing agreement with India, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday urged counterpart Manmohan Singh to ink the pact soonest because it was &#8220;good for the long run&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hasina raised the Teesta issue when the two leaders met on the sidelines of the third BIMSTEC summit. The signing of the agreement was stalled in 2011 after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee raised objections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Prime Minister said it was a difficult matter and he was trying to build consensus at home (on the river-sharing pact)… She said the agreement must be signed because it was good for the long run,&#8221; Syed Akbaruddin, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, told reporters after the meeting. Earlier, while addressing the summit of regional leaders that included Singh, Hasina said &#8220;modalities need to be found for sharing water resources, especially common rivers&#8221;.</p>
<p>She cited the example of the 30-year Ganges water-sharing treaty between India and Bangladesh and said &#8220;others would follow soon&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Ganges treaty of 1996 remains the only comprehensive river pact between the two countries though they share 54 rivers. In September 2011, Mamata Banerjee scuttled the Teesta deal.</p>
<p>She refused to accompany the Prime Minister to Bangladesh where he had hoped to ink the deal. The government later said nothing would be done without consulting the West Bengal government.</p>
<p>With its source in the eastern Himalayas, the Teesta flows through Sikkim and West Bengal before entering Bangladesh where it eventually merges with the Brahmaputra.</p>
<p>In her summit address, Hasina also referred to &#8220;the recent experience of cross-border power sharing between Bangladesh and India&#8221; and said there was need to develop regional energy grids and energy markets.</p>
<p><strong>India, Lanka to be in touch on Geneva draft</strong></p>
<p>Hours after a draft resolution against Sri Lanka for alleged war crimes against Tamils was circulated at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and President Mahinda Rajapaksa agreed to stay in touch on the matter.</p>
<p>The resolution, sponsored by the US, UK, Mauritius, Macedonia and Montenegro, will be put to vote later this month. The draft refers to the report by Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, who called for an international probe into allegations of war crimes against Sri Lanka during the final battle with the Tamil Tigers in 2009.</p>
<p>&#8220;The two sides agreed to stay in touch given that it has implications for both India and Sri Lanka,&#8221; Syed Akbaruddin, spokesperson for the Ministry of External Affairs, told reporters after Singh and Rajapaksa met on the summit sidelines.</p>
<p>Twice in the last two years, Tamil parties mounted pressure on the UPA government and India voted against Sri Lanka in Geneva, resulting in temporary cooling of ties.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000637&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 2800 students out of 58,483 failed to appear on the first day of UP board exams in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to District Inspector of Schools, RK Tiwari 1,809 students out of 33,391 did not appear in board examination in Muzaffarnagar district on Monday, while 1,029 students out of 25,092 did not appear in Shamli district. The Board has established 117 centres for conducting exams in the two districts.</p>
<p>Different reasons were stated by students for not appearing in the examination including non-preparation, Tiwari said.<br />
Lisarh is the worst riot-effected village in Muzaffarnagar district, Superintendent of Lisarh Centre Ram Meher Singh said, adding that 13 students belonging to a particular community here could not appear in the exams. Some parents also demanded that the exam centres be shifted due to fear, but their demand could not be met, he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000612&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/raj_thackeray.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000613" alt="Former BJP president Nitish Gadkari had met MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Monday." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/raj_thackeray.jpg" /></a> Former BJP president Nitish Gadkari had met MNS chief Raj Thackeray on Monday.
<p>Reacting to the meeting of former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Nitin Gadkari with Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Raj Thackeray in Mumbai, Shiv Sena on Tuesday said if a senior leader from BJP supports Raj or Sharad Pawar, it can affect the alliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can affect the &#8216;Mahayuti&#8217; (grand alliance) if a senior leader from BJP meets Raj Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar,&#8221; Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut told reporters.</p>
<p>The Sena leader also expressed confidence of his party firmly holding onto the Marathi electorate in Maharashtra. &#8220;Marathi votes will remain with Shiv Sena only. Nobody can dare take it away from us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Shiv Sena-BJP alliance will defeat Congress-NCP and would win as many as 40 seats out of the total 48 Lok Sabha in Maharashtra,&#8221; Raut claimed.</p>
<p>Gadkari, who is said to enjoy a good rapport with Raj Thackeray, had on Monday met the latter at a suburban five-star hotel, triggering speculation that the saffron party is trying to win over the MNS chief into NDA for upcoming elections even as he said there is no reason for Shiv Sena to be annoyed by his meeting with Raj.</p>
<p>Gadkari had later told mediapersons that he &#8220;discussed with the MNS chief the ways to get rid of the Congress government.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, RPI(A) led by Ramdas Athawale, also an important constituent of the &#8216;Mahayuti&#8217; led by BJP and Shiv Sena, said he would &#8220;welcome&#8221; Raj into NDA-fold.</p>
<p>MNS&#8217; high-pitch debut in 2009 elections had caused a large scale division of Marathi votes ensuring the defeat of Shiv Sena candidates in Lok Sabha and Assembly polls.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000608&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Madras High Court Bench here has directed the administration of the famous Thanumalayan Swamy temple in Suchindran in Kanyakumari district to submit details of shops given on lease.</p>
<p>Admitting a petition filed by a local resident S Ramesh,  Justices V Ramasubramanian and V M Velumani directed that details be submitted by March 12. The petitioner contended that many individuals had put up shops in the temple by encroaching on vacant sites, force devotees to buy flowers and other pooja articles and also pick up quarrel with devotees who refuse to purchase them and beat some people.</p>
<p>He had sent a representation to the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department on November 6, 2013, to evict the encroachers, but had not received a positive reply and hence the petition.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000551&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/subrataroyink.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001202" alt="Subrata Roy was attacked with ink by a man as he was being brought for production in court. (AP Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/subrataroyink.jpg" /></a> Subrata Roy was attacked with ink by a man as he was being brought for production in court. (AP Photo)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered custody in jail for Sahara chief <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/roy-has-slip-of-tongue-urges-court-to-love-sahara-but-in-vain/" target="_blank">Subrata Roy </a>until March 11 after slamming the group’s “dilatory tactics” and trashing its claim of having already refunded investors. Roy, after issuance of a non-bailable arrest warrant by the court, had been kept in a guest house in Lucknow by the Uttar Pradesh police for the last three days.</span></p>
<p>The ardent appeal by Roy, who had already tendered his “unconditional apology” to the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/high-drama-greets-subrata-roy-at-supreme-court/" target="_blank">court</a>, for suggesting an alternative so as to stave off judicial custody, failed to move the bench of Justices K S Radhakrishnan and J S Khehar.</p>
<p>“We tried to accommodate you but you said go to hell. We tried again and again <span style="line-height:1.5em;">so that our orders are complied with but you pushed us in a corner. What do you want us to do? Hold our hands and ask you to pay? If we allow this anymore, every litigant will start behaving in this manner,” the bench said.</span></p>
<p>Roy, who was attacked with<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/lawyer-came-to-city-from-mp-to-throw-ink-on-sahara-chief/" target="_blank"> ink </a>by a man as he was being brought for production in court by the Lucknow Police, will be kept in Delhi’s Tihar Jail until Sahara comes up with an “acceptable” proposal to comply with the order on depositing Rs 17,000 crore with SEBI for disbursement to investors.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/saharasubrata.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2001206" alt="Saharasubrata" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/saharasubrata.jpg?w=480&#038;h=291" width="480" height="291" /></a></p>
<p>Besides Roy, two other directors were also ordered to be kept in custody. A woman director was spared because of her gender, and also to enable her to coordinate with others to draft the proposal.</p>
<p>Roy and the two Sahara directors were taken out through a back gate of the court, which is reserved for judges. A team of more than 25 police officials were deployed at the court. “He was taken to Tihar in a police vehicle through the back gate to avoid the media; otherwise no special treatment was given to him,” the police said.</p>
<p>The court has allowed Sahara to seek an early hearing “if a concrete and acceptable proposal can be offered in the mean time”. The group was likely to mention the matter as soon as possible with an alternate proposal.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/subrataroy_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2001207" alt="subrataroy_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/subrataroy_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=312" width="480" height="312" /></a></p>
<p>“Sufficient opportunities have been given to the contemnors to fully comply with those orders and purge the contempt committed by them but rather than availing of the same, they have adopted various dilatory tactics to delay the implementation of the orders,” the bench said, noting that a breach of court orders shook the foundations of the judicial system and undermined the rule of law.</p>
<p>Referring to various documents adduced by Sahara in the last three years, the court noted that the group made “unacceptable statements and affidavits all through”, and also in the contempt proceedings initiated at SEBI’s instance for breach of the court’s August 2012 verdict to refund money to investors.</p>
<p>“Documents and affidavits produced by the contemnors themselves would apparently falsify their refund theory and cast serious doubts about the existence of the so-called investors. All the fact-finding authorities have opined that majority of investors do not exist,” said the court, while also observing that it had “serious doubts” whether investors really existed.</p>
<p>As lawyers for Sahara vehemently opposed Roy’s custody without being held guilty of contempt, the bench made it clear that the order was not for contempt, but was under the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to maintain the rule of law.</p>
<p>The court also rejected the group’s request to give them some more time to enable them sell their properties to deposit money with SEBI. “We are not interested in selling your properties. It is your headache. You should have done it long back but all you give us ‘s ‘Ifs and Buts’. We gave you enough time but you did not allow us to proceed. We are not happy with your proposal. We don’t accept it. We know our orders will not complied by you even after five years like this,” the court said.</p>
<p>In Tihar’s Jail number 3, Roy had a full meal of daal, rice and chapatis. “The moment he was shown his cell, Roy requested the authorities to allow him to have home-cooked food. He was, however, told that he would have to eat what other prisoners ate,” a jail official said.</p>
<p>PRO, Prisons, Sunil Gupta said, “According to the jail manual no prisoner can be extended any special facility except in a few genuine cases. He will be sleeping on the floor like all other prisoners. We provide beds to prisoners who are above 60, but Roy does not fit in this category. He has also been denied home-cooked food.”</p>
<p>Sources said Roy looked around his cell and asked if there was space for him to go for a walk and jog. “He said that he followed a strict health regime, and brisk walking was an essential part of his routine,” said an official.</p>
<p>Roy also underwent a medical examination at DDU Hospital before being taken to his cell. “His blood pressure, sugar levels and everything else was found to be normal,” a source said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000559&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opposition People Democratic Party staged a walkout from the legislative assembly during Question Hour in protest over expulsion of 130 Kashmiri students by a university in Uttar Pradesh for their celebration after Pakistan cricket team&#8217;s victory against India.</p>
<p>Uproarious scenes marked the proceedings as the House assembled in the morning, with PDP MLAs on their feet demanding withdrawal of police FIR against expelled students.</p>
<p>They also sought UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav&#8217;s intervention to ensure cancellation of their expulsion order and their safety on the campus.</p>
<p>However, as the Speaker did not allow them to speak on the issue, they staged a walkout from the House.</p>
<p>Later, PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti said, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t in the past our leaders clapped and appreciated performance of rival team?&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000525&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/01/manmohan.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995207" alt="Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday called for &quot;early conclusion&quot; of the BIMSTEC Free Trade Agreement." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/01/manmohan.jpg" /></a> Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday called for &#8220;early conclusion&#8221; of the BIMSTEC Free Trade Agreement.
<p>Urging the seven-member BIMSTEC grouping to fast-track trade and economic cooperation, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Tuesday called for &#8220;early conclusion&#8221; of the BIMSTEC Free Trade Agreement and said it should be extended to investment and services.</p>
<p>Hours later, the third summit of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) issued a joint declaration directing the trade negotiating committee to &#8220;expedite work for conclusion of the Agreement on Trade in Goods by the end of 2014, and to continue its efforts for early finalisation of the Agreement on Services and Investments&#8221;.</p>
<p>Singh said India would soon launch a direct shipping line to Myanmar. He also announced the opening of a BIMSTEC Centre for Weather and Climate in Noida near Delhi. On the security front, he called for negotiations on a BIMSTEC extradition convention.</p>
<p>Addressing the summit, Singh said the FTA should be wrapped up early: &#8220;Most of us here are connected with each other through one or more regional economic arrangements and it should not be difficult for us to conclude one for BIMSTEC.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand make the BIMSTEC club, home to one-fifth of the world&#8217;s population and some of the poorest, with energy and mineral reserves that promise a future if governments fast-track growth and cut red tape for business.</p>
<p>A framework agreement for the BIMSTEC free trade area was signed in Phuket, Thailand in February 2004, committing parties to negotiate FTAs in goods, services and investments. But that pact has been elusive.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Nay Pyi Taw summit, Foreign Secretary  Sujatha Singh called the BIMSTEC negotiation process &#8220;particularly complex because it already encompasses countries which have FTA under the SAFTA process, and then you have other countries that belong to ASEAN&#8230; we have to arrive at an outcome that is optimal for India and them&#8221;.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Singh listed energy as another priority for the BIMSTEC. &#8220;As India and some of its neighbours are getting linked by energy grids, we are already experiencing the regional and national benefits of energy cooperation. We must connect each other through transmission highways and gas and oil pipelines, while examining opportunities for cooperation in renewable energy sources. I hope the BIMSTEC Energy Centre planned in Bengaluru will play a key role in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In coming together, we are not only stepping out of narrow, traditional definitions of regions such as South Asia or Southeast Asia, but we are also building a bridge across Asia’s most promising and dynamic arc,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Underlining physical and digital connectivity as &#8220;a driver of cooperation and integration&#8221;, Singh asked his counterparts to &#8220;identify and implement priority projects of regional importance from the comprehensive study prepared by the Asian Development Bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And even as we develop physical infrastructure, we should simultaneously start developing the supporting architecture of rules and regulations to facilitate cross-country movements… To promote both BIMSTEC tourism packages and intra-BIMSTEC travel, let us declare 2015 as a Year of BIMSTEC Tourism.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pointing to the &#8220;evolving threat of terrorism in the BIMSTEC region&#8221;, the Prime Minister sought early ratification of the Convention on Cooperation in Combating International Terrorism, Trans-National Organised Crime and Illicit Drug Trafficking and early signing of the BIMSTEC Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000508&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rape-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1977553" alt="The DHR has drafted a new manual to address the psycho-social impact of sexual violence including counselling that the victims should receive to alleviate her woes.      " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rape-med.jpg" /></a> The DHR has drafted a new manual to address the psycho-social impact of sexual violence including counselling that the victims should receive to alleviate her woes.
<p>The Union Health Ministry, which has drawn new guidelines for treating rape victims, has asked all hospitals to set up a designated room for forensic and medical examination of victims besides outlawing the two-finger test performed on them, dubbing it as unscientific.</p>
<p>The Department of Health Research (DHR) along with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) with the help of experts formulated this set of national guidelines for dealing with criminal assault cases, which will hopefully put an end to the &#8220;horrendous&#8221; medical process, which the victims are subjected to after the sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The DHR has also drafted a new manual to address the psycho-social impact of sexual violence including counselling that the victims should receive to alleviate her woes.</p>
<p>These guidelines have been made available to health care providers who work with victims of sexual violence.</p>
<p>A experts&#8217; group on Gender and Health was formed by Dr V M Katoch, Secretary to GOI-DHR and Director General ICMR in November 2011 under the chairmanship of Dr M E Khan (Secretary, Sexual Violence Research Initiative) to formulate these guidelines which can be used at Primary Health Centres and district hospitals whenever a rape victim approaches them.</p>
<p>Later, Indrajit Khandekar, in-charge Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit (CFMU) &amp; Associate professor at Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS) Sevagram- Wardha (on whose study report titled &#8220;pitiable &amp; horrendous quality of forensic medical examination of sexual assault cases&#8221; a PIL was filed in Bombay High Court) was given the responsibility to draft these guidelines.</p>
<p>The guidelines drafted were made available to public and experts and their opinion was sought.</p>
<p>Following this, the guidelines were released for circulation on December 16, 2013.</p>
<p>Khandekar, who pursued the matter single handedly said that he had successfully impressed upon the state government on how to handle such cases and now at national level too, the Centre has come out with fresh guidelines.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been observed that the rape victims are usually put under a horribly judgemental microscope from the moment they call up the cops. They are often subjected to judgmentally attitudes by both the doctors and other medical staff in the hospital. The new guidelines include that every hospital must have a designated room to deal with Medico Legal Cases (MLC) of sexual assault to provide privacy to the victim and must have essential equipments listed in the guidelines,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There must be provisions to provide alternative clothing for the victims and smooth collection of MLC evidence keeping in mind the sensitivity of the circumstances.</p>
<p>Also, there must be training sessions for sensitising doctors and other medical staff for the protocols and guidelines for MLC examination/reporting of such cases, it has been outlined.</p>
<p>As per the guidelines, while carrying out medical tests no third person must be present in the room other than the doctor. If the doctor is male, a female attendant must be there, Khandekar said.</p>
<p>The new set of rules also provide comprehensive care which must address issues like physical injuries, STDs, HIV, Hepatitis B, etc. Also the psychological effects must be recognised and the patient shall be provided counselling, social support and appropriate referrals, it said.</p>
<p>The maligned two-finger test that was used by doctors to opine whether the girl is habituated to sexual intercourse or not, has been outlawed and the manual recognises that it is no way scientific and shall not be performed.</p>
<p>Doctors are asked not to use word rape in their opinion, as it is a legal definition and not a medical diagnosis.</p>
<p>For the first time, names of samples, its preservative and purpose of analysis for forensic lab has to be printed itself on the form before sending it to FSL (forensic science lab). This will avoid inadequate preservation of sample and analysis of sample for wrong purpose, the guidelines said.</p>
<p>A provision for DNA analysis has also been done. A separate form for medical management as a check list has been provided too.</p>
<p>In the past, rape survivor examination was done only after receiving police requisition. Now this is not mandatory for a rape survivor seeking medical examination and care. The doctors should examine such cases without an FIR if the survivor reports to the hospital first.</p>
<p>Also, it is now mandatory for the forensic medical report to state precisely the reasons for each conclusion.</p>
<p>Obtaining &#8220;informed consent&#8221; of the victim is mandatory before starting treatment and so is informing the police (parents and guardians in case the patient is below 12 years or not in a position to give her consent).</p>
<p>The guidelines say that doctors are required to give the patient a structured explanation of what the examination comprises and how the various procedures may be carried out.</p>
<p>All this should be explained in the manner and language which the patient can understand. These guidelines, if properly implemented, will definitely plug the various loopholes present and thereby will help avoid miscarriage of justice and human rights violation, said Khandekar.</p>
<p>Dr H Nagesh Prabhu, Joint Secretary (DHR) Dr K Satyanarayana, Dr Arvind Nath were the coordinator of this project to draw guidelines.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000484&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The bail plea hearing of the Tehelka founder and former editor Tarun Tejpal, facing charges of rape of a junior journalist colleague, began on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As the hearing began, the media persons were asked to vacate the courtroom.</p>
<p>The Goa bench of Bombay High Court had on Monday granted permission to Tejpal to be present in the court during hearing of his bail plea.</p>
<p>Tejpal had moved an application before the bench seeking permission to be present in the court during hearing of his bail petition.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old journalist had contended that his presence was required as he wanted to assist his lawyer during the hearing.</p>
<p>Tejpal has been charged with rape, sexual harassment and outraging modesty of the woman journalist in Goa in November last year.</p>
<p>Tejpal, arrested on November 30 last year is currently lodged in Sada sub jail near Vasco town, around 40 kms from here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/express5_march04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000270" alt="Former SC judge questions Lokpal selection process and other Indian Express stories you must read. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/express5_march04.jpg" /></a> Former SC judge questions Lokpal selection process and other Indian Express stories you must read. 
<p>We bring you the five best stories of the Indian Express you must read before beginning your day.</p>
<p><strong>1. Lokpal controversy:</strong> In a letter sent to the Prime Minister’s Office, Justice (retd) Thomas withdrew his “willingness” to head the search panel, saying, “Why there should be a Search Committee at all?… When the Selection Committee itself can decide on who should be the members of Lokpal…” Appu Esthose Suresh reports in<a title="After Fali Nariman, former SC judge K T Thomas questions  Lokpal selection" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/after-fali-nariman-former-sc-judge-k-t-thomas-questions-lokpal-selection/" target="_blank"> After Fali Nariman, former SC judge K T Thomas questions Lokpal selection</a><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ktthomasm1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2000273" alt="ktthomasm" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ktthomasm1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2. NIA chargesheet:</strong> NIA&#8217;s chargesheet claims the IM’s current priority is to “wage war against Myanmar to take revenge for the atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims”. Muzamil Jaleel gives details about <a title="NIA’s touching faith in Internet downloads and bizarre bluster" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/nias-touching-faith-in-internet-downloads-and-bizarre-bluster/" target="_blank">NIA’s touching faith in Internet downloads and bizarre bluster</a><br />

<p><strong>3. UN Lanka vote:</strong> It is Manmohan Singh’s meeting with Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa on Tuesday that is being tracked closely given the opposition back home by Tamil parties. Hours after Singh arrived in Nay Pyi Taw, official sources underlined that India’s vote on a resolution against Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva for alleged war crimes against Tamils would depend on the text of the draft and would be guided by “our own interests”. Rakesh Singh gives details, <a title="On UN Lanka vote, India’s ‘own interests’ supreme" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/on-un-lanka-vote-indias-own-interests-supreme/" target="_blank">On UN Lanka vote, India’s ‘own interests’ supreme</a><br />

<p><strong>4. Opinion:</strong> Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s visit to Nay Pyi-Taw this week to attend a regional summit brings his decade of leadership of Indian diplomacy to a virtual close.

<p><strong>5. Knocked out:</strong> India now have won just once in their last 10 completed One-day Internationals.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The dais in temple town Kancheepuram faced north and her speech too was directed northward. Launching the AIADMK campaign for the Lok Sabha elections from her citadel in the south, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa targeted the Congress government in New Delhi. Veering away from the usual, most part of her speech dwelt on the perceived weaknesses in India’s defence sector rather than the usual local issues, betraying her national ambitions.</span></p>
<p>Her 40-minute speech focused on the shortcomings of the UPA and targeted favourite rival DMK in passing. The Karunanidhis, land-grabbing and local issues were passé and Delhi had her undivided attention.</p>
<p>“The coming election is not just one to bring about a change in regime, but one that would protect India from foreign aggression,” she said alleging the Congress ignored the armed forces.</p>
<p>“Tamil Nadu is role model for police forces&#8230;with AIADMK at the Centre, the Indian military will be a role model for forces the world over,” she said. She was armed with another list of 10 instances when Congress and DMK betrayed the “interest of Tamils”. It included alleged training of Sri Lankan forces, not protecting Tamil fishermen from Lankan navy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000148&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Two single-legislator parties merged with the Trinamool Congress in Ranchi on Monday, giving Mamata Banerjee’s party its first legislators in the Jharkhand Assembly.</span></p>
<p>They will continue to sit in the treasury benches, thus making the TMC an ally of the JMM-Congress government in the state. However, with the party saying that the arrangement will be up for review post-Lok Sabha elections, the tenure of the Hemant Soren government has come under threat.</p>
<p>Both Bandhu Tirkey and Chamra Linda — previously of the Jharkhand Janadikar Manch and Rashtriya Kalyan Paksha respectively — were inducted into the party in the presence of general secretary Mukul Roy. Their joining comes on the heels of Shibu Soren’s younger brother Lalu Soren leaving the JMM to go over to the TMC in February.</p>
<p>Tirkey, a popular tribal leader who represents Ranchi’s Mandar constituency, wants to contest Lok Sabha elections. “I have intimated the party that I would like to contest from Ranchi; Chamra wants to contest from Lohardaga. It is up to the party now,” said Tirkey said.</p>
<p>Roy said that the TMC, which has entered into an alliance with Surya Singh Besra’s Jharkhand People’s Party, is open to contesting in all 14 seats here. “The party’s central committee will take a call on candidatures of our new members. As of now, we are contemplating contesting from all 14 seats,” he said. Roy also indicated that the TMC is still exploring the option of entering into an alliance with Babulal Marandi’s JVM(P).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000147&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">From cracking jokes to listening to funny experiences of her colleagues, Congress president Sonia Gandhi Monday played the perfect host at a lavish dinner for party MPs and senior leaders at her residence. Although the party is gearing up for a tough election ahead, lending the dinner a farewell touch, the mood was jovial and politics virtually took a back seat. </span></p>
<p>The centre of attraction was Sonia’s dinner table where the women MPs including Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar sat for the lavish spread. And the conversation swung from the controversy over a woman who allegedly kissed Rahul Gandhi in Assam to Mamata Banerjee’s antics in West Bengal. With the likes of Meira Kumar, Deepa Dasmunsi, Krishna Tirath, Annu Tondon, Panabaka Lakshmi all sitting with Gandhi, many male MPs joked the table had over 33 per cent reservation.</p>
<p>Sonia, sources said, was cracking jokes. Meira recalled how despite being fiery, the Parliament session ended on a positive note. Sonia too appreciated the camaraderie which was visible on the last day of the 15th Lok Sabha session and did not forget to pull Meira’s leg, saying now nobody is going to listen to her here.</p>
<p>At one point, Sonia is learnt to have referred to wrong media reports from Assam which had suggested that the woman who kissed Rahul was burnt to death by her husband to convey the “extent” to which the Congress is being tarnished. Panabaka Lakshmi, sources said, chipped in recalling a telephone call she recently received congratulating her for leaving the Congress to protest the division of Andhra Pradesh. The caller had mistaken her for D Purandeswari.</p>
<p>The Congress president also mentioned the speculation about Tondon leaving the Congress. The Unnao MP has already denied the reports. Tirath was teased by the other women MPs for eating slowly with some asking whether she was on a fast. Dasmunsi lent a political touch to the discussion as she wanted Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad to visit West Bengal to explain how the Trinamool Congress government scuttled setting up of an AIIMS-like hospital in the state by not giving land.</p>
<p>Both Sonia and Rahul went to all the tables chatting up with MPs and Congress leaders. Some of the new Congress office bearers thanked her for giving them party responsibilities while many of the MPs shared with her the state of affairs in their constituencies. Sonia, sources said, gave a chin up message to all asking them to go to the polls with confidence. There were no formal speeches from either the party president or the vice-president. Rahul was the topic of the discussion at many tables with MPs and leaders talking about the opposition attack on him.</p>
<p>With many of the MPs having brought their spouses along, Sonia spent quite some time posing for photographs and in between ensuring that her guests taste each and every delicacy on the menu, which ranged from appam and fish curry from Kerala to Mughlai delicacies like murgh biriyani and galawati kebab. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh — who has left for Myanmar for a two-day visit — was among the absentees.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000144&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gadkari.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000058" alt="While Gadkari did not say what he offered Raj in return, top sources in the BJP said about 35-40 seats in the 288-seat assembly could be earmarked for the MNS. PTI " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gadkari.jpg" /></a> While Gadkari did not say what he offered Raj in return, top sources in the BJP said about 35-40 seats in the 288-seat assembly could be earmarked for the MNS. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Former BJP president Nitin Gadkari on Monday asked MNS president Raj Thackeray not to field candidates in the Lok Sabha elections in order not to divide votes of the Shiv Sena-BJP.</span></p>
<p>“Yes, I had a luncheon meeting with Raj Thackeray. I have offered him a proposal&#8230; He should not work at cross purposes with the BJP-led grand alliance in Maharashtra. We do not want him to field candidates against us because it is bound to split the Sena-BJP votes and this will be detrimental to the electoral fortunes of the National Democratic Alliance at the Centre,” Gadkari told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>While Gadkari did not say what he offered Raj in return, top sources in the BJP said about 35-40 seats in the 288-seat assembly could be earmarked for the MNS.</p>
<p>“The talks are at an initial stage. We want him as our partner. The details and formulae can be worked out accordingly,” was all that Gadkari would confirm. Besides MNS, Gadkari is also trying to rope in the Peasants and Workers Party as an ally.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">“Once things move ahead, Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray will be taken into confidence before a firm commitment is made to the MNS,” Gadkari said.</span></p>
<p>There have been efforts in the past to get MNS join the BJP-led alliance. Raj’s party played spoilsport in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, handing an advantage to the Congress-NCP. Even if it does not win seats, the MNS can take away a sizeable chunk of votes, affecting the winnability of the Sena-BJP. BJP leader Gopinath Munde had met Raj and Uddhav separately earlier in a bid to bring the MNS into the NDA.</p>
<p>In 2009, the MNS polled over one lakh votes in each constituency, cutting into primarily Sena-BJP votes. The Sena and BJP together polled 29 per cent votes; along with MNS, it would have topped 33 per cent.</p>
<p>“This is what I am looking at to ensure we tap the most number of Lok Sabha seats out of the 48 in Maharashtra,” Gadkari said.</p>
<p>“I impressed upon him the need to recognise national concerns releated to development and good governance. For this, we have to dislodge the Congress-led coalition at the Centre,” the former BJP president said. “Let us also reconcile to the fact that coalition governments are here to stay, and for this the NDA will have to expand with new partners.</p>
<p>“Whether it is Raj Thackeray or NCP president Sharad Pawar, we are friends who share our concerns on development,” Gadkari said, adding, quickly, however, that the NCP remained a Congress ally.</p>
<p>A senior BJP leader said about the Gadkari-Raj meeting, “Prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi is keeping his fingers crossed because he does not want to antagonise the Sena and disturb the seat-sharing arrangement in Maharashtra.”</p>
<p>A senior Sena functionary warned, “Any alliance without our consent will not be acceptable. We cannot give our consent to any promises made by the BJP to MNS without taking us into confidence.”</p>
<p>Late in the evening, state BJP president Devendra Fadnavis met Uddhav Thackeray at Matoshree, and assured him the BJP would take no decisions without taking the Sena into confidence.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000051&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ndtiwari.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000246" alt="After years of denial, N D Tiwari publicly accepted 35-year-old Rohit Shekhar as his son. (PTI Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ndtiwari.jpg" /></a> After years of denial, N D Tiwari publicly accepted 35-year-old Rohit Shekhar as his son. (PTI Photo)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Before the cameras came on and the questions began, <a title="Paternity row: N D Tiwari denies Rohit Shekhar as his biological son" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others-do-not-use/paternity-row-n-d-tiwari-denies-rohit-shekhar-as-his-biological-son/" target="_blank">Rohit Shekhar</a> spent a few moments alone with his father. “I want you to give respect to my mother&#8230; All I want is honesty from you,” he said. <a title="Paternity case : HC imposes cost of Rs. 2.5 lakh on N. D. Tiwari" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/paternity-case-hc-imposes-cost-of-rs-2-5-lakh-on-n-d-tiwari/" target="_blank">N D Tiwari</a> nodded.</span></p>
<p>Shekhar’s mother Ujjwala Sharma sat in another room, watching TV recaps of the case that saw Shekhar filing a paternity suit against the 89-year-old senior Congress leader and former Andhra Pradesh governor.</p>
<p>“People from his (Tiwari’s) side had been sending us feelers&#8230; But what is the scope for mediation in a case like this? You can’t say he’s 50 per cent my son,” Sharma said.</p>
<p>She said she had heard Tiwari was unwell and decided to call on him on Sunday. “When I met him, he asked to meet Rohit. He (Tiwari) hugged him and acknowledged him as his son.”</p>
<p>The meeting took place at Uttarakhand Sadan in Delhi. “I was seeing him after nine years and I was taken aback. Age has begun to tell on him,” Sharma said.</p>
<p>After years of denial, Tiwari at a press conference on Monday publicly accepted 35-year-old Shekhar as his son. Shekhar had filed a paternity suit against Tiwari in Delhi High Court in September 2007, the final hearing of which is on April 21. A DNA test ordered by the court has established Tiwari as Shekhar’s biological father.</p>
<p>“He hugged me when I met him, put his topi on my head, his shawl over my shoulder. I am positive about what has happened. I have always been positive. But the case will go on. He will have to give this in writing in court. And if he retracts, we will fight it out,” Shekhar said.</p>
<p>At the press conference, Tiwari patted Shekhar, and spoke about his long relationship with Ujjwala’s father and former defence minister Sher Singh. He was less forthcoming on questions about the past and the future.</p>
<p>He dodged answering why he had not acknowledged Shekhar as his son so far, and whether he would now declare Shekhar his heir as well. “I have no property,” Tiwari said with a straight face. But if Shekhar fought an election, he would support his son, Tiwari said.</p>
<p>“What is important is that the Rohit Shekhar vs N D Tiwari case has set a precedent. It has told the patriarchs that you can’t just get away with anything. All I want to do now is to put this behind me, wake up fresh in the morning, do my pranayam and practise my music,” Shekhar said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999882&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>“My daughter would definitely have not gone with some stranger who offered to drop her on his bike. She was very cautious in her ways and would not trust anyone this way.</p>
<p>Additionally, she had a trolley bag weighing 10 kg and a backpack weighing six kg with her, and knew very well how unsafe it was to ride pillion along with that kind of luggage,” Prasad told The Indian Express.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000045&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/01/yasin.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1977125" alt="The chargesheet claims the IM’s current priority is to “wage war against Myanmar to take revenge for the atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims”." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/01/yasin.jpg" /></a> The chargesheet claims the IM’s current priority is to “wage war against Myanmar to take revenge for the atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims”.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">* <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/ats-starts-recording-statements-of-yasin-bhatkal-akhtar/" target="_blank">Yasin Bhatkal</a> downloaded a picture of a Stinger missile from the Internet into his computer — this shows he was trying to “develop arms and ammunition” to wage war on India.</span></p>
<p>* Yasin told Riyaz Bhatkal to “look for a nuclear bomb” in Pakistan, because “everything was available” there. The idea was to nuke Surat, after pasting posters in mosques telling the town’s Muslims to “quietly evacuate”.</p>
<p>*<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/im-planned-to-target-khadki-cantonment-nia/" target="_blank"> Indian Mujahideen</a> wanted to capture Jews in India so that it could “bargain” with the US for the release of Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui who is serving an 86-year sentence in an American prison for an alleged terror plot to attack the US.</p>
<p>* Indian Mujahideen is working with Al-Qaeda, Taliban and Pakistan’s ISI while at the same time consistently abusing ISI, calling it “dogs”.</p>
<p>* Riyaz believed that the Pakistani al-Qaeda were foolish, and he, therefore, flew to Peshawar to meet with the Arab al-Qaeda. Lest his colleagues disbelieved him, he kept his plane tickets to show them as proof of the visit.</p>
<p>Such sweeping conclusions based on little beyond hearsay and bluster are at the heart of the National Investigation Agency’s (NIA’s) supplementary chargesheet against alleged Indian Mujahideen (IM) co-founder Yasin Bhatkal filed in a special Delhi court on February 24. Most charges are based on alleged web chats with little evidence of corroborative material.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the key ones:</strong><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The chargesheet claims the IM’s current priority is to “wage war against Myanmar to take revenge for the atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims”. The evidence?</strong></p>
<p>“During chat of Yasin with Riyaz on 11th May, 2013, Riyaz (said) that he had met someone whose community’s contact lived on Rajasthan border within Pakistan. The man was an old timer and had lived with Mullah Omer [Omar](of Taliban) <span style="line-height:1.5em;">and possibly with Osama Bin Laden (of the Al Qaeda), had crossed 5-6 times, was Burmese and wanted to start the struggle in Burma, and had come to Riyaz for help. The man mentioned that he was planning to take arms and ammunition from Pakistan for use in Myanmar, through the Indo-Pak border. Riyaz mentioned that he would accompany the man till borders. Another issue that the man told was about the network in Thailand where there was a place where arms and ammunition was manufactured, which was independent of Thai rule. Riyaz told that Rohingya Muslims were migrating to Thailand, and that one road from Thailand went over to Malaysia. This route was in the notice of Riyaz since long time. Riyaz was planning to establish someone of the IM in Thailand and was even thinking of sending Daniyal. He mentioned that there a launch was made which travelled upto 40 kms by remote control for the delivery of weapons.”</span></p>
<p><strong>On why the IM allegedly preferred al-Qaeda over the Pakistani Taliban, the chargesheet’s explanation is simplistic, even absurd:</strong><br />
“During chat of Yasin with Riyaz on the 11th May, 2013&#8230;they discussed a mention in Ahl-e-Hadith that the Khalifa will be from Kuresh tribe that is Arab.” Ahl-e-Hadith is the name of a religious party, here it’s apparently used as a substitute for the Hadith. The chargesheet makes the bizarre claim that Riyaz guessed that the leader of Muslims will be an Arab called Khazruu because this is a word derived from Khajur (which means date and is Arab).</p>
<p><strong>On Riyaz’s alleged visit to Waziristan and Afghanistan to tie up with al-Qaeda, the story in the NIA’s chargesheet is rambling, full of forgetful characters:</strong></p>
<p>“During chat of Yasin with Riyaz on the 26th May 2013&#8230;Riyaz started telling about his journey to Afghanistan and that he was stopped at 8 to 10 places. There were check posts of both the army and the police en route&#8230;The contact person between Riyaz and Al Qaida was quite lax in matters of security&#8230;</p>
<p>“Riyaz told Yasin that he had started from there and reached Peshawar. One friend of Al Qaida was to come to Peshawar to pick him, and he came late by one and half days. When Riyaz was to reach the city, his three numbers (of contacts) got closed. Due to delay Riyaz had to stay in Peshawar, and during the stay some blast took place and search was started by the police, which happens generally, so Riyaz had to leave the place. The contact had called Riyaz from neighbouring passenger’s phone. Riyaz then told him the address of a masjid and told him that he was there. Then the contact forgot the name of the masjid.</p>
<p>“Due to blast the few number of PCOs en route had also closed. But then he could meet him who took him to another safe place, and then they left the next morning on the way which went towards Waziristan. Army was positioned all along the way and there was checking all the way. Riyaz said that he was wearing Salwar Kameez and was looking like a Pathan. The contact was from a different place and thus was questioned about his identity card. He got disturbed. Both of them had made separate covers for the journey and pretended to be stranger sitting together and thus Riyaz was sitting calmly next to him.</p>
<p>“The Hill region started at the border of Waziristan. There was a check point en route which they tried to avoid by driving on the barren rocky path. Then they crossed a river on foot to reach the destination. There he learnt that they had a lot of training courses&#8230;It was discussed that any person who would do their courses would be able to raise a Tehreek&#8230;<br />
“On May 29, 2013, Riyaz told Yasin that the persons of the other group doubted that he actually visited Afghanistan to meet Al Qaida. Riyaz had gone by flight to Peshawar and had the return tickets with him, which he had shown to others for proving his visit which was being doubted by others.”</p>
<p><strong>On plans to kidnap individuals who could be used as bargaining chips to free Aafia Siddiqui:</strong><br />
“Riyaz mentioned that there was a person in the Al Qaida of India who looked after UP. He talks about kidnapping of Jews in India. The Jews were to be kidnapped and taken to Afghanistan&#8230;<br />
“Kidnapping for extortion or release of individuals like Dr Afiya Siddique of Pakistan was also pondered over by the IM operatives. The goods train carrying petroleum products were also in the radar of IM for future attacks along with targeted attacks on policemen working with anti-terrorist cells&#8230;Investigations have established that Riyaz suggested kidnapping of Jews as a bargain to set free one Dr Aafiya Siddique, imprisoned by USA&#8230;”</p>
<p><strong>On the alleged IM “conspiracy to acquire nuclear warheads for attacking Surat”, the chargesheet says:</strong><br />
“During chat of Yasin with Riyaz on June 1, 2013, Yasin talked about having placed bombs in Surat. Riyaz told him not to make him remember the Surat failure, which he always remembered. Yasin said that he had himself placed 2 bombs. Yasin then asked Riyaz whether he had found nuclear bomb in Pakistan, to which Riyaz denied, and also said that if looked properly, then everything was available in Pakistan. Yasin told him that Surat should be attacked with nuclear bombs. Yasin then requested Riyaz to look for nuclear bomb to attack Surat. Riyaz told Yasin that Muslims will also die in such an attack, to which Yasin said that they will place posters in mosques for every Muslim resident to quietly evacuate the town.”<br />
This, according to the NIA, “clearly establishes the devious intentions of&#8230;Yasin to wage war against India”.</p>
<p><strong>On the IM’s weapons and techniques to wage this war, the chargesheet says:</strong><br />
“The file named as ‘stinger-missile’ [in Yasin’s computer]&#8230; is the photograph of stringer missile, which was downloaded from Internet by the accused Md Ahmad Siddibapa (Yasin Bhatkal) in order to get the idea of its working and model. The file named as “Home”&#8230; is the file which contains the details of parachute which was downloaded by the accused person Yasin in Nepal&#8230; This confirms that the accused persons were trying to find new methods of attacking targets. This establishes the efforts made by the accused persons to develop arms and ammunition in order to intensify the war waged against the Government of India&#8230;”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000038&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) Monday accused Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda of having married a woman over two decades ago and also claimed that he had a 17-year-old son with her. MLA Abhay Chautala said the woman was a former Youth Congress leader whom Hooda married on November 11, 1992.</span></p>
<p>He claimed the woman had moved a Dehradun court for restoration of conjugal rights. Abhay had initially tried to raise the issue in the Assembly but Speaker Kuldeep Sharma refused to allow it.</p>
<p>Along with party colleague Ram Pal Majra, he then brought up the issue during Zero Hour. The Speaker refused to make it part of the proceedings, saying the allegations were “utterly malicious”. Hooda said there was no case pending against him.</p>
<p>As the INLD members walked out of the House, the issue spilled over to the media lounge, with Abhay producing an affidavit and court documents pertaining to the case and demanding Hooda’s resignation. “Two marriages are prohibited under the Hindu Marriage Act,” he said, adding the woman had alleged that she was being threatened.</p>
<p>The Congress, which initially denied the allegations, later admitted the woman did file a petition, but withdrew it within a month. “The petition was filed on December 17, 2013&#8230; When the court reopened on January 1, the petitioner had no grouse against the defendant&#8230; The Dehradun Family Court dismissed the case as withdrawn,” said Rohtak MLA and Hooda loyalist B B Batra.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000044&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The police also picked up Sahu from Jharkhand on Monday and brought him to Mumbai. He is being questioned.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000039&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The Mumbai Police Crime Branch on Monday claimed to have solved the murder of TCS employee Esther Anuhya with the arrest of a history-sheeter. The police said this was the same man seen with her in the CCTV camera footage on the day of her disappearance.</span></p>
<p>Esther, 23, had disappeared after reaching Lokmanya Tilak Terminus from Vijaywada on January 5. Her body was subsequently found in Bhandup on January 16.</p>
<p>According to police sources, the accused has been identified as Chandrabhan Sanap, 28, who has cases of bag lifting and cellphone theft registered against him at police stations in Mumbai and other places of Maharashtra, besides in Madhya Pradesh. His arrest is said to have been a result of technical evidence and intelligence gathered by the police.</p>
<p>Sanap was picked up from outside the Kanjurmarg railway station on Sunday night and was placed under arrest on Monday morning. After being produced in a local court, he was remanded in police custody till March 15.</p>
<p>The accused’s father worked as a porter with the Central Railway and he suffered a paralytic stroke in 2007, after which his porter’s badge was transferred to Sanap. His addiction to liquor and womanising habits made him sell his badge in 2009, after which he started doing odd jobs. He was currently employed as a driver in Nashik,” Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria said in a press conference on Monday.</p>
<p>On the night of January 4, Sanap allegedly had a few drinks with some friends and reached LTT around 4.15 am on January 5 with the intention to steal from passengers. The police said he noticed Esther sitting there and offered to drop her at her Andheri hostel for Rs 300. Esther allegedly agreed and the two went to the parking lot where she realised that he did not have a taxi as he had claimed, but a motorcycle.</p>
<p>Sanap convinced Esther by giving his cell phone number and the licence number of his bike, telling her that she could give the number to whoever she wanted. However, Esther was out of talk time (on her phone) and instead only made a ‘pretend call’, after which she got on the bike. Sanap took her to the Eastern Express highway and stopped on the service road at Bhandup, saying the bike had run out of petrol. He then assaulted her and when she fought back he banged her head on the ground and then strangled her with her stole,” said Maria.\</p>
<p>Leaving the body in the bushes, where it was ultimately found on January 16, Sanap allegedly went to his Kanjurmarg residence and called his friend Nandkishore Sahu whose bike was used in the crime.</p>
<p>Sanap then went back to the scene of the crime around 10.30 am and tried to find Esther’s phone, as he believed that she had stored his cellphone number and the bike number. However, he was unable to find it. After trying to burn the body using petrol, he hitched a ride on a tanker and went to Nashik, the police said.</p>
<p>The police also picked up Sahu from Jharkhand on Monday and brought him to Mumbai. He is being questioned.</p>
<p>Sanap was currently staying in Nashik with his third wife and 14-month-old son. After committing the crime, he allegedly grew a beard and started sporting a red teeka on his forehead to alter his appearance. He also resumed work and had even gone to Karnataka on an assignment. He returned Sunday night, after which he was picked up by the police.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000039&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rashtra.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000033 " alt="Last November, the CBI registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) against officials of the urban development (UD) ministry for allegedly favouring DLF, giving it permission to construct the building." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rashtra.jpg" /></a> In June 2012, the DLF project, on 23 acres on Sardar Patel Marg in Delhi, got the go-ahead from the UD ministry for a four-storey construction.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Real estate major DLF’s proposed high-rise residential project, barely a kilometre from Rashtrapati Bhavan, is on hold, caught in the middle of conflicting security assessments by government agencies, and now the subject of a CBI inquiry as well.</span></p>
<p>Last November, the CBI registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) against officials of the urban development (UD) ministry for allegedly favouring DLF, giving it permission to construct the building. The PE was registered following a reference from the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), which received a complaint.</p>
<p>In June 2012, the DLF project, on 23 acres on Sardar Patel Marg in Delhi, got the go-ahead from the UD ministry for a four-storey construction. Last October, DLF asked for sanction to add four more storeys — in effect, doubling the height of the building from 15 m to 30 m.</p>
<p>The Intelligence Bureau found nothing irregular about this. In an assessment of that request in November last year, it said that “the proposed building would not pose any threat additional to what is presented by other tall buildings in the vicinity of Rashtrapati Bhavan complex”.</p>
<p>But in February 2013, the security wing of Delhi Police and the President’s Secretariat disagreed and sought a review of the original permission.</p>
<p>For its part, DLF argued, in an internal document, that the security concerns were “imaginary”. After all, it said, an eight-storey building is to come up near Talkatora Stadium for accommodation for Members of Parliament and a new <span style="line-height:1.5em;">construction, has been planned at Hotel Ashok. Next to Hotel Ashok is Hotel Samrat, of similar height, which overlooks the official residence of the Prime Minister. “Security norms need to be applied uniformly and not selectively to block legitimate construction activities,” it said.</span></p>
<p>The project has a history of twists and turns.</p>
<p>In 1992, the erstwhile Edward Keventer (Successors) Private Ltd (EKSPL), holding perpetual lease for dairy farming since 1942, sought land use conversion (for the project). The request was turned down in 2002. In the meantime, DLF took over management of EKSPL.</p>
<p>In October 2010, a Joint Security Survey conducted by Delhi Police, the Intelligence Bureau and the President’s Secretariat opposed the proposal citing security reasons.</p>
<p>In June 2011, the Delhi High Court granted EKSPL permission for residential construction, subject to security clearances. The court noted that use of land for residential purpose was permitted in the area and many residential premises existed there.</p>
<p>In 2012, a second JSS raised security issues but gave conditional clearance for construction up to a height of 15 m. This time, the JSS said that the DLF building would give “clear view of the Mughal Garden and the proposed auditorium within the complex.”</p>
<p>It cited an input from British intelligence agency MI5 that “Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba has operatives to launch para gliders and hang gliders to launch offensive on high value targets” . It came to the conclusion that the proposed building could be “used as a platform to launch aerial attack” and so called for a 39-metre-high perimeter wall was proposed to block direct view of the President’s Estate.</p>
<p>On October 1, 2012, DLF submitted a fresh application to the Ministry of Urban Development. And on February 5, 2013, it filed a separate request with Delhi Police for additional relaxation of building height permission.</p>
<p>But the police security wing cited JSS findings to note that “the building will give a clear view of the Mughal Garden where in-house functions are held” and added that “the earlier decision (permitting residential construction) should also be reviewed”.</p>
<p>An IAF study which began late 2012 is yet to submit its findings — the IAF was asked if the DLF project would fall on the flight path of VIP helicopters once the proposed helipad comes up on the President’s Estate.</p>
<p>On November 27, 2012, the Intelligence Bureau said the building “would not pose any threat additional to what is presented by the other tall buildings in the vicinity of Rashtrapati Bhavan complex.”</p>
<p>A DLF spokesperson declined to comment saying the review process was underway and it was awaiting a government response to its request. DLF has offered tighter security at the premises, even its takeover by security agencies, similar to arrangements made during Republic Day and Independence Day.</p>
<p>Besides the security establishment, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had also objected to the proposed project. The chief vigilance officer of the DDA, in a letter to the Additional Secretary in MoUD on August 13, 2012, said, “Permitting development of land in accordance with the land-use plan mentioned in Master Plan/Zonal Plan has serious implication as there are large number of such land owners having agricultural land which may have different land-use as per master plan who may also stake claim for development.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000029&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Surinder Kocchhar, the researcher and historian who spearheaded a campaign to exhume the bodies of 1857 Indian soldiers from a well in Ajnala, Monday said he would move court to demand that the Union government seek all details of the 282 martyrs from the British government.</span></p>
<p>“I have been told by my lawyer that the case has to be filed in the Supreme Court. I will try to complete all formalities on Tuesday,” said Kocchhar. He said he was hopeful that the British government would have all the details.</p>
<p>Kocchhar said the analysis of information he gathered during the course of his research work on Kallianwala Khoo, also known as Shaheedan Wala Khoo, revealed that the Indian soldiers killed and buried in the well were Hindus. “In his book The crisis in the Punjab, Frederick Cooper, the then Amritsar deputy commissioner, wrote that ‘decorative necklaces’ worn by the soldiers were removed from their necks before they were buried,” Kocchhar said, adding that Cooper mentioned the word, janeoo, to explain the “decorative necklaces”.</p>
<p>He said a request had been made to the state government to provide space for cremation of the exhumed remains.</p>
<p>“We will wait for three months. During this period, the government can take any number of samples it wants to from the exhumed remains. After that we will consign the remains to flames,” Kocchhar added.</p>
<p>Amritsar Deputy Commissioner Ravi Bhagat Monday visited the excavation site and also Dadian village, where 218 soldiers of the 500-strong platoon who had revolted at Mian Mir Cantonment in Lahore during the 1857 mutiny, were killed by British troops.</p>
<p>Bhagat was handed over a charter of demands by the NGO headed by Kocchar and the gurdwara management committee that had undertaken the excavation work. The demands included introduction of a chapter on the episode in history books and changing the name of Kallianwali village to one associated with the martyrs, among other things.</p>
<p>He said the memorandum had been submitted to Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal.</p>
<p>Bhagat has, meanwhile, asked the state’s culture department to make arrangements for procuring samples for carbon dating and collection of DNA from the exhumed remains.</p>
<p><strong>Badal promises memorial, museum</strong></p>
<p>Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal and former chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh Monday spoke to Shaheedan Wala Khoo Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee chief Amarjit Singh Sarkaria and assuring him of setting up a state-of-the-art memorial and museum in memory of the martyrs. Sarkaria said Badal also assured him that the government would ensure adequate space for the memorial. Amarinder has meanwhile said the remains of all martyrs be cremated with full military honours.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Nearly 300 teachers of GSV Medical College, Kanpur, resigned Monday even as junior doctors’ agitation against the arrest of their colleagues entered fourth day paralysing medical services in Uttar Pradesh. The resignations came even as 24 medical students, who were sent to judicial custody Saturday on charges of rioting and loot, were granted bail and Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav appealed to the junior doctors to call off the agitation. </span></p>
<p>“The CCTV footage of whatever happened in Kanpur is available and will be probed. Officers have been asked to conduct a probe, meet representatives of both the sides and take action against those who were on the wrong side,” Akhilesh told reporters in Lucknow.“It is my appeal to doctors that keeping aside their dispute they should execute their responsibilities and save human lives,” he said.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, the CM told a delegation led by Minister of State for Rural Development Pradeep Jain that a fact finding inquiry commission has been set up to look into the matter. “He assured us that action would be taken against his party MLA (from Sisamau, Kanpur) Irfan Solanki if he or his supporters were found guilty,” said a Congress spokesperson Surendra Rajput, who was a part of the delegation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, medical services, OPD and emergency services across the state remained paralysed due to the strike. Medicos have been demanding that arrested students be released and action be initiated against police officers who had allegedly raided college hostels on Friday night. “The students who were arrested have been granted bail. They will be released soon,” said Principal Secretary Medical Education, B S Bhullar.</p>
<p><strong>MLA in the eye of the storm has clean slate</strong></p>
<p>Irfan Solanki, the man in the middle of the controversy — strike of junior doctors that has crippled medical services in UP — is the lone Muslim MLA in Kanpur district who inherited his political legacy from his father Haji Mushtaq Solanki, a two-time Samajwadi Party MLA.</p>
<p>Mushtaq Solanki joined SP in 1993, a year after Mulayam Singh Yadav formed the party. In 1996, Mushtaq was elected from Aryanagar seat in Kanpur giving Mulayam the edge of having a Muslim MLA in the district. He repeated the feat in 2002, but could not complete the term due to his untimely death in 2006.</p>
<p>The SP gave the ticket to Irfan, who was then 26 years old, from his father’s seat in 2007. Irfan won and became the youngest MLA in the 15th state Assembly. Considered close to Mulayam, Irfan contested the 2012 polls from Sisamau and won.</p>
<p>Irfan, popular as Haji Irfan, has considerable following in the community. He claims “not a single case has been lodged against me in the past except once”.</p>
<p>The MLA was caught on the wrong foot in 2011 when he had stormed into the office of the then Kanpur District Magistrate Ritu Maheshwari, protesting alleged inflated bills of local weavers. A case was registered and he was arrested. “They took me into custody and later released me from the police lines,” Irfan claimed.</p>
<p>Irfan is hardly seen participating in debates in Assembly. Besides politics, he inherited a tannery business from his father in Kanpur. A commerce graduate from Mumbai University, he has three daughters and a son.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Indicating the return of the solar panel scam to political centrestage in Kerala on the eve of Lok Sabha elections, prime accused Saritha S Nair on Monday said several leaders had behaved indecently with her.</span></p>
<p>Nair was released last week after she got bail in nearly three dozen cases. “I want to reveal many things. Many leaders would lose sleep in the coming days. I want to take revenge upon those who cheated me. I have evidence beyond details of telephone calls,’’ she told the media.</p>
<p>Nair said Congress legislator A P Abdullakutty pestered her with calls. “One day he invited me to Mascot Hotel in Thiruvananthapuram, but I did not go. On the day I was arrested, Abdullakutty messaged me pleading not to reveal his name.’’</p>
<p>She said the young Congress legislator called her to install solar power solution in his constituency in Kannur. After I gave my telephone number, he made indecent calls even late at night. I can’t say what Abdullakutty spoke to me.’’</p>
<p>“In Kerala, women cannot run a business. If I gave my phone number to a leader, that night I could not sleep due to their repeated calls. They want me to meet their many demands. Even if such demands are met, the support for business would not come,’’ said Nair.</p>
<p>Nair said, “Let leaders understand the stress and pain I had gone through. I would reveal against more leaders in the coming days. Many things I could not disclose. I lost sleep for many months. Let these leaders lose their sleep.’’</p>
<p>The scam rocked Kerala after Nair’s arrest last June. She, along with co-accused Biju Radhakrishnan, were accused of cheating investors promising to make them promoters of windmill farms and install solar power solutions. Three personal aides of Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy lost their jobs over alleged links with Nair.</p>
<p>Her phone call details showed that several Congress leaders including ministers were in touch with her. It was revealed the ministers made calls to Nair at odd hours. Faced with the allegation, Abdullakutty on Monday told the media it was a bid to spoil his political career and refused to speak more.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999985&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Lucknow police stealthily whisked away Sahara chief Subrata Roy from a forest department guesthouse at Kukrail picnic spot Monday afternoon for his production in the Supreme Court Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>The SC had issued a non-bailable warrant against him for defying summons.</p>
<p>As mediapersons waited at the main gate of the guesthouse, where Roy had been lodged since Friday night after his arrest, the police slipped out of the rear gate with him and left for Delhi by road.</p>
<p>Earlier, Additional SP (Trans-Gomti) Habibul Hasan reached the picnic spot around noon. A Scorpio was brought around 1 pm, apparently to take Roy to Delhi.</p>
<p>Around an hour later, Gomti Nagar station house officer (SHO) Ajit Singh Chauhan reached Kukrail.</p>
<p>Congress leader Ammar Rizvi, too, had arrived to meet Roy. He said he had come as “his friend is in trouble”. “But I could not get a chance to meet him. I have left my name outside his room,” he said later.</p>
<p>BJP MLA from Deoria Janmejaya Singh and BJP leader Mahendra Yadav, too, came to see Roy as he belonged to their “area” (Gorakhpur). They were also denied entry.</p>
<p>Around 3 pm, ASP Hasan exited from the main gate. Soon, information came that the policemen have left with Roy from the rear gate of the guesthouse even as security remained at the main gate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just before the model code of conduct comes into effect, HRD Minister Pallam Raju held three back-to-back press conferences on Monday. He sat through two hours of programmes of his ministry, and cleared a spate of appointments. Some new members have been appointed to the UGC, including A Shantih and Mohammed Miyan. Raju also approved a second term for IIT Hyderabad director U B Desai and may also clear a new term for IIT Gandhinagar director Sudhir Jain.</p>
<p><strong>Thank NSUI for small mercies</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Desperate for a glimmer of light in a dark prognosis for the general elections, the Congress tom-tommed NSUI’s victory in the Gujarat University elections. The AICC declared seat-wise results, and announced that the university had over 3.5 lakh voters in eight districts. And in Ahmedabad, the Congress said the university’s reach was spread over 10 districts and seven Lok Sabha seats.</p>
<p><strong>Desperately seeking support</strong></p>
<p>Vying for the Muslim vote in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has managed to rope in a couple of clerics associated with influential Darul Uloom Deoband. The party’s minority wing has inducted Mufti Arif Qasmi and Maulana Salim Ashraf Qasmi, along with former Samajwadi Party leader Saad Siddiqui and their supporters.</p>
<p><strong>Crack cop to disaster expert </strong></p>
<p>Former Central Bureau of Investigation special director K Saleem Ali, who was the driving force behind the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter investigation, has been appointed member, National Disaster Management Authority, in the home ministry. It is a high-profile post equivalent to that of minister of state, and Ali will report directly to the Prime Minister, who is the chairman.</p>
<p>Narendra Modi had shown great interest in disaster management at the time of the Bhuj earthquake; it will be interesting to see how he runs National Disaster Management Authority in case he does come to power.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999976&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Rahul’s experiment 10 years on is limited to 16 constituencies and excludes the one he will contest from. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999973&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Rahul Gandhi’s experiment with primaries for selection of candidates, hailed as a move signalling an end to “the high command culture” in a party brought up on dynasty, has a parallel in an experiment tried out in near identical circumstances in Greece a decade ago, almost exactly to the date.<br />
</span></p>
<p>George Papandreou, a third-generation scion of Greece’s leading political family, got himself elected leader of the party his father had founded, Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), in the country’s first open primary, a move symbolic of Papandreou’s attempt to break clean of charges of “dynastic politics”. In the 2004 national elections, opinion polls pointed at PASOK being likely to lose to the New Democracy party. In January 2004, PM Costas Simitis resigned as leader of PASOK, and recomended Papandreou in his place. On February 8, PASOK held open primaries. Though Papandreou had no opponent, the move was seen as a major step in democratising the party amid the overhang of “dynastic politics”.</p>
<p>Rahul’s experiment 10 years on is limited to 16 constituencies and excludes the one he will contest from.</p>
<p>“The term dynasty generally has a negative connotation, especially in the context of a democracy&#8230; of course, the Gandhi family has gone through terrible experience of violence and fighting for the country&#8230; In many ways, I would say it’s a heavy responsibility when you are second or third or fourth generation&#8230; So, my concept of leadership is to work so that I’m redundant. Not to use the position to gain more and more power. That’s why I pushed the idea of primaries in Greece&#8230;,” Papandreou, who visited India last month, told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>As prime minister from October 2009 to November 2011, Papandreou was in the spotlight with his attempts to keep his country afloat during the Eurozone debt crisis. He resigned as PM in November 2011 as part of a deal to pave the way for a coalition government to restore stability, but remains a powerful figure as an MP and as president of Socialist International.</p>
<p><strong>PRIMARY WINNERS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meenakshi Natarajan, Mandsaur</strong></p>
<p>The sitting MP won the primary amid a boycott and allegations by her rival that several voters were fake. The Rahul Gandhi aide got 706 votes while Surendra Sethi, a former district president who boycotted the primary, got only 50. “Rahulji’s dream of making the selection process transparent was defeated in Mandsaur,” he said. One of Natarajan’s poll opponents will be the AAP’s Paras Saklecha, a former MLA.</p>
<p><strong>Rajbala Ola, Jhunjhunu</strong></p>
<p>She is the daughter-in-law of the late Sis Ram Ola, who represented the seat. She polled 504 of 816 votes while her rival, Shravan Kumar, got 287.</p>
<p><strong>Ashok Singh, Ambedkarnagar</strong></p>
<p>In a contest marred by a self-immolation threat and allegations of unfairness, Singh, 60, polled 151 of 247 votes, against 89 for Krishna Kumar Yadav. Two office-bearers have been expelled for six years for opposing the process. Singh has worked his way up from the NSUI, which he joined in 1975. He will contest against sitting BSP MP Rakesh Pandey and the Samajwadi Party’s Ram Murti Verma. ens</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999973&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">A day after the Centre dropped plans to take the ordinance route on anti-corruption legislations being pushed by Rahul Gandhi, the Congress Monday tried to project it was not a loss of face for the Congress vice-president, arguing that he never talked about the “methodology” and “procedure” to make these legislations a reality.</span></p>
<p>However, it is a different matter that the Congress vice-president had himself told a group of activists who were protesting at Vijay Chowk after the Parliament session, that he had spoken to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi to explore the possibilities of bringing those bills as ordinances.</p>
<p>The Congress Monday argued that Rahul and the party were backing these legislations in “principle and substance” and had not talked about the procedure.</p>
<p>Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said Rahul and the Congress were solidly behind these measures and never pitched for bypassing established procedures and systems.</p>
<p>“Neither Rahul nor the Congress has talked about methodology and procedure,” he said.</p>
<p>Singhvi targeted the BJP saying the constant disruption of Parliament by the main opposition resulted in the non-passage of these bills and led the government to think about bringing ordinances.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999971&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/10/m_id_426995_bjd_chief_naveen_patnaik.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1926995 " alt="There have been financial aid for anganwadi and construction workers, an insurance cover for farmers, a transport scheme for 12 tribal districts as well as a Rs 12 crore scheme for conservation of tribal places of worship, not to mention housing for journalists.

(PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Over the last six months, Orissa Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has announced scheme after scheme, sop after sop, seeking to woo diverse sections in his attempt at a record fourth victory in the assembly elections coinciding with the Lok Sabha polls. These come from a seemingly confident chief minister who represents a party that registered a series of victories in the civic polls over these six months.</span></p>
<p>There have been financial aid for anganwadi and construction workers, an insurance cover for farmers, a transport scheme for 12 tribal districts as well as a Rs 12 crore scheme for conservation of tribal places of worship, not to mention housing for journalists.</p>
<p>More announcements have come over the last few days with the model code of conduct expected any moment. Naveen Monday announced a Rs 230.55 crore scheme for women in self-help groups and one of Rs 24.49 crore for youths. On Sunday, he had hiked dearness allowance of state government employees, a week after his cabinet had cleared higher medical reimbursement for them.</p>
<p>The Congress and the BJP say the sops show Naveen is getting panicky. “He was not as panicky during the 2009 assembly polls, when the major sop he announced was Rs-2-a kg rice for BPL families. Now, with the number of rebels growing in his party, he is trying to cling to power through these schemes,” says Prasad Harichandan, Congress chief whip in the assembly.</p>
<p>And state BJP president K V Singh Deo says, “Naveen is unnerved by the Shah Commission recommendation for a CBI probe into the mining scam. He apprehends a lot of his partymen would desert the BJD and revolt after they are denied tickets.”</p>
<p>For the BJD, Health Minister Damodar Rout says, “As long as poll dates have not been announced, nothing can stop a chief minister from announcing schemes. Besides, Orissa does not depend on central funds for these schemes.”</p>
<p><strong>A look at what Naveen has announced for various sections:</strong><br />
<strong>For govt employees</strong></p>
<p>* 10% hike in dearness allowance, announced Sunday, after union cabinet okayed a similar hike.<br />
* Medical reimbursement, announced days ago, at rates matching those of the Central Government Health Services.</p>
<p><strong>For workers</strong></p>
<p>* A hike in honorarium, announced last week, for anganwadi and mini anganwadi workers with retrospective effect from December 2013.<br />
* Rs 20,000 aid, up from Rs 10,000, to each of 2.6 lakh construction workers for the marriage of their daughters.<br />
* Rs 1 lakh housing loan assistance at 2% a year to construction workers.<br />
* 2% forest development tax on kendu leaves, down from 16%, the reduction since January, for 9 lakh kendu leaf pluckers in 18 of 30 districts. Pluckers will now gain Rs 100 crore every year.</p>
<p><strong>For journalists</strong></p>
<p>* 13 Bhubaneswar journalists chosen last month by the general administration department for government quarters. Selected reporters of English news agencies to those of Oriya dailies.<br />
* Plans on to provide mediclaim and accident insurance to all accredited journalists.</p>
<p><strong>For tribals</strong></p>
<p>* 1,180 routes for buses across 118 blocks in 12 districts under Biju Gaon Gadi Yojana, announced February 22. Bus operators exempted from road tax and route permit tax, given 5% interest waiver on loans to buy the buses. Scheme will also enable tribals, the party’s primary votebank, to reach poll booths.<br />
* Rs 12 crore package, Rs 60,000 each for 2,000 sacred groves, for the conservation and development of such places of worship of tribal people, who constitute 23% of the population.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>For farmers</strong></p>
<p>* Rs 30,000 a year health insurance for 60 lakh farmers under Biju Krushak Kalyan Yojana, started October. Minimum premium per annum is Rs 30 per person; the scheme covers the farmer, his spouse and three dependants.</p>
<p><strong>For women</strong></p>
<p>* Rs 230.55 crore, announced Monday, for 6 lakh women in self-help groups towards interest subvention on loans over the next three years.</p>
<p><strong>For the youth</strong></p>
<p>* Rs 24.49 crore, announced Monday, including a grant of Rs 15.86 crore for micro enterprises.<br />
* Rs 1,500 monthly stipend under Biju Yuva Sashaktikaran Yojana, launched last year, for internship of 5,000 youths at district and subdistrict-level offices.</p>
<p><strong>For students</strong></p>
<p>* 15,000 meritorious students in plus-two getting fee laptops under Biju Yuva Shashaktikaran Yojana.</p>
<p><strong>For the destitute</strong></p>
<p>* Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000, announced in August, as financial assistance to the poor and the destitute for cremation of their dead, as well as for that of unclaimed bodies. The money comes from the chief minister’s relief fund.<br />
*Rs 200 each to widows, the elderly and the disabled as winter assistance to buy blankets, and Rs 100 for around 37 lakh people for buying umbrellas. The umbrella scheme was launched last year for pensioners in rural areas, and has since been expanded to urban areas and the other groups.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999958&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rajneesh Singh, who allegedly stabbed his 36-year-old wife Shweta Singh to death suspecting her of infidelity on Sunday, had hired private detectives and planted bugs in their house to spy on his wife, police said.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, Rajneesh, in his mid-forties who is an alumnus of IIM-Ahmedabad and works for a consultancy firm in Gurgaon, allegedly stabbed Shweta to death with a kitchen knife at their residence in Parsvanath Greens township in Gurgaon’s Sector-48.</p>
<p>They have three children — two daughters aged eight and five, and an 11-month-old son.</p>
<p>Police said Rajneesh stabbed Shweta, who ran a day-care centre in DLF Phase-IV, several times. The couple had been married for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>According to police, after allegedly killing Shweta, Rajneesh called up his parents and then informed police.</p>
<p>“Rajneesh told us that he had asked some private detectives to spy on Shweta, whom he suspected of having an affair. Not only that, every morning before he used to leave for office, he would allegedly plant recording devices at various places in the house. He would allegedly listen to them once he got back from office,” a senior police officer said.</p>
<p>According to police, Rajneesh alleged a man would often visit their house in Sector-48 once he would leave for office and their eight-year-old daughter would leave for school. Police are verifying his claims.</p>
<p>“Rajneesh told us that he confronted Shweta on Sunday morning and, in a fit of rage, allegedly stabbed her with a kitchen knife in the presence of their daughter. After that, he called his parents and police, and then gave himself up, confessing to the crime,” the police officer said.</p>
<p>The couple previously lived with Rajneesh’s mother in DLF Phase-IV, where Shweta ran the day-care centre first from their house and then from a rented location less than a kilometre away.</p>
<p>According to police, Rajneesh was presented before a magistrate on Monday and taken into police custody. “We have taken him into custody for three days,” Alok Mittal, Commissioner of Police (Gurgaon), said.</p>
<p>Police said Shweta’s post-mortem report indicates more than 15 stab wounds on the chest, stomach, abdomen, neck and elbow. The majority of the wounds are on the abdomen. “The post-mortem report indicates multiple stab wounds, mostly to her abdomen&#8230; The cause of death was shock and haemorrhage,” Mittal said.</p>
<p>Sources said the consultancy firm, where the accused was employed, was founded in 2009 and runs out of Sikandarpur in Gurgaon.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999948&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/trschief.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992050" alt="TRSchief" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/trschief.jpg" /></a> The TRS is hoping polls will be separate for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Kalvakuntla Chandrasekhara Rao, 60, and his Telangana Rashtra Samiti see themselves dictating what happens in <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/trs-meet-on-monday-to-decide-on-merger-or-alliance-with-congress/" target="_blank">Telangana </a>politics from now on — with or without the Congress. It is from that perceived position that the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/congress-readies-to-walk-alone-in-andhra-as-trs-rules-out-merger/" target="_blank">TRS </a>has ruled out a merger with the Congress, a decision that, in turn, is set to prevent a pre-poll alliance too.</span></p>
<p>It is a turnaround since 2009, when the TRS could manage only two assembly seats and 10 in the Lok Sabha, Now 23 strong in the assembly following a series of resignations and byelections, its stock high because of the new state, the party is looking at winning over 100 of the 119 assembly seats in Telangana, and 15 or 16 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats, KCR said after a party meeting ruling out a merger.</p>
<p>The TRS is hoping polls will be separate for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.</p>
<p>“The TRS will exist. The TRS will fight elections as a separate party. It is not an agitation party anymore; it is now a pucca political party,” said KCR, a two-time MP. The other party MP, Vijayashanti, is now with the Congress.</p>
<p>The window for a post-poll alliance, however, remains open. A committee has been formed to discuss, if necessary, such opportunities with parties that may include the Congress, KCR said. The committee has K Keshava Rao, Etala Rajender and B Vinod Kumar.</p>
<p>“There are many ways of expressing our gratitude to Sonia Gandhi. We may even support the next government at the Centre if it is led by the Congress,” KCR said. In Telangana, he said, the TRS need ally with no one.</p>
<p>It has been a rollercoaster ride for KCR and the Telangana movement he spearheaded for the last 13 of its 60 years. He began in the Congress, and was Youth Congress vice-president in 1978-79. He lost his first election in 1983, then joined the newly launched TDP in 1984 after completing his MA in Telugu literature from Osmania University.</p>
<p>He has never lost since, returning the MLA from Siddipet in 1985, 1989, 1994 and 1999. He was deputy speaker before he quit the TDP over differences with N Chandrababu Naidu, and launched the TRS in 2001 with the purpose of fighting for a separate state. In 2004, he won the Karimnagar Lok Sabha seat; in 2009, he won Mahbubnagar as well as a byelection.</p>
<p>KCR supported the first UPA government and became known as a cabinet minister without a portfolio. He quit in 2006 accusing the Congress of not being serious about creating a new state.</p>
<p>At home, his fortunes fluctuated. In 2008, the TRS’s 26 MLAs and five MPs resigned demanding the state. In the byelections, it could win back only seven and two seats. And the following year, the TRS allied with the TDP but could win only 10 and two.</p>
<p>KCR bounced back in late 2009 after chief minister YS S Reddy’s death created a vacuum in the state. He went on an indefinite hunger strike that took him centre-stage nationally. As his health deteriorated and student protests turned violent, then home minister P Chidambaram announced the process of creation of Telangana state had been started. It took over four years more before it came on February 17, the day after KCR’s 60th birthday.</p>
<p>What is now Telangana’s first family includes KCR’s son K T Rama Rao who is the MLA from Sircilla, nephew T Harish Rao who is the MLA from Siddipet, and a daughter who heads Telangana Jagruthi, a cultural organisation.</p>
<p>One promise KCR had made was that Telangana’s first chief minister would be from the backward classes. As long as an alliance looked likely, Andhra deputy CM Damodar Rajanarasimha of the Congress looked the most eligible candidate. Now, however, various Telangana leaders have been pushing for KCR himself being projected as the state’s first CM.</p>
<p><strong>His reasons for not merging</strong></p>
<p>Having once promised to merge his TRS with the Congress if Telangana is formed, K Chandrasekhara Rao Monday justified his decision not to do so. The assurance, he said, had been based on the promise that the state would be created last year itself. Some of the reasons KCR cited after a six-hour party meeting:</p>
<p>“Last year I told the Congress that if Telangana is created with a bill passed in September, the TRS would merge with the Congress. But that did not happen then and now we are under no obligation to merge.”</p>
<p>* * *<br />
“The Congress never took us into confidence when they started the process. We were not taken on board when the bill was drafted. None of our suggestions was accepted. We wanted Telangana without any conditions. We oppose the appointment of a governor to oversee law and order in the new state. We oppose the merger of villages of Khammam with Seemandhra.”</p>
<p>* * *<br />
“We requested special status for Telangana along with that for Seemandhra; this too was ignored. Another issue that upsets us is the decision to grant Hyderabad House to Seemandhra. It is our hereditary property. We wanted AP Bhavan; even that was not accepted. Comments by Jairam Ramesh also hurt.”</p>
<p>* * *<br />
“Everyone knows no single party will form the next government at the Centre. It will be a coalition and we want to be a part of it, irrespective of who leads it&#8230; The sharing of water, power, revenues&#8230; between Telangana and Seemandhra will be decided only after the elections. We want to be in a position to be able to demand and get our rightful share. There is also a feeling that Telangana needs its own voice, a powerful political voice, which only the TRS can provide.”<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">AN alliance between RJD and Congress is not yet happening, which seems to be in the interest of the JD(U) which has ruled out any alliance with the Congress in Bihar. </span></p>
<p>JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav ruled out an alliance with the Congress, saying the UPA cannot grant Bihar special package or assistance, which would be possible only if there is National Development Council (NDC) clearance, which in turn would be convened by the next government.</p>
<p>UPA can at best ‘agree in principle” to the Bihar demand of tax incentives and special package, a JD(U) leader said.</p>
<p>Sources said it if Congress and RJD fight separately minority votes would be split and JD(U) would be in “direct contest” with the NDA.</p>
<p>However, JD(U) national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP K C Tyagi said, “If there is no alliance between RJD and Congress, it is because of their own contradictions. We will go to people saying how Congress cheated us on special status demand.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, RJD sources said the party had left the ball in Congress court to ensure secular votes are not fragmented.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The BJP Monday started seat-sharing talks with three regional parties in a bid to form an anti-BJD alliance in Orissa. </span></p>
<p>The saffron party’s likely partners in the state include Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik’s bete noire Pyari Mohan Mohapatra’s Odisha Jana Morcha and former Congressman Soumya Ranjan Patnaik’s Ama Odisha.</p>
<p>Though the state BJP leaders had initially rebuffed Mohapatra’s offer for a “grand” alliance last week, serious discussions started Monday after Arun Jaitley held closed door one-on-one meetings with some party leaders at a city hotel. Among them were former<span style="line-height:1.5em;">BJP MP Kharavela Swain, who had floated Utkal Bharat after losing in the 2009 polls.</span></p>
<p>Former Union minister Braja Kishore Tripathy, who floated Samata Kranti Dal, is also scheduled to meet the senior BJP leader for a tie-up.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999944&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Even as the Centre has constituted a one-man expert committee headed by former Union home secretary G K Pillai to study the viability of creation of a separate Bodoland state, the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) has opposed it, saying there was no need for such a committee. “All that the Centre should do is announce creation of Bodoland,” said ABSU president Pramod Boro.</span></p>
<p>The Bodo People’s Front (BPF), an ally of the Congress, however, lauded the Centre’s decision and even organised a rally in Kokrajhar Sunday to welcome the committee.</p>
<p>Pillai is visiting Kokrajhar Tuesday to carry out a preliminary study of the ground situation. He is also scheduled to meet a cross-section of people during the visit.</p>
<p>“Setting up of the expert committee is the first important step towards creation of a separate Bodoland state. We welcome this timely decision. We are sure the committee will recommend creation of a separate state after meeting all sections of people,” said BPF chairman Hagrama Mohilary, who is also chief of the Bodoland Territorial Autonomous Council.</p>
<p>Mohilary also hit out at the ABSU and said the students’ body was only trying to throw a spanner into the works by opposing or rejecting the expert committee.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999934&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The first hearing is scheduled on Tuesday in the Delhi HC, said officials.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999933&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">After its latest order extending the ban on the Student Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), the government has set up a tribunal headed by Delhi High Court judge Justice Suresh Kait to examine validity of the ban under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. </span></p>
<p>The first hearing is scheduled on Tuesday in the Delhi HC, said officials. As per UAPA provisions, the ban has to be approved by a tribunal headed by a sitting HC judge within six months of the government notification.</p>
<p>The tribunal will travel across the country to examine evidence against the organisation. The government had cited SIMI cadre being involved in anti-national activities in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Scores of alleged SIMI operatives are behind bars on charges of terrorism and the tribunal will examine evidence gathered by the state police, said a senior Home Ministry official.</p>
<p>The tribunal notification issued on February 27 reads, “The central government hereby constitutes the “Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal,”&#8230;.for adjudicating whether or not there is sufficient cause for declaring SIMI as an unlawful association&#8230;”</p>
<p>In its latest ban on SIMI, the MHA said, “the Central government is of the opinion that if unlawful activities of SIMI are not curbed immediately, it will continue its subversive activities and reorganize its activists&#8230; disrupt secular fabric, propagate anti-national sentiments, escalate secessionism by supporting militancy and undertake activities prejudicial to integrity and security of the country.” This is the seventh ban on SIMI, the first was in 2001 and the tribunal upheld the ban barring in 2008 when Justice Geeta Mittal ordered the lifting of the ban on technical grounds. The MHA in its latest ban detailed 21 cases of terror crime highlighting alleged involvement of SIMI.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999933&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The families of two men in Kerala have claimed that they were among the five buried alive in Saudi Arabia in 2010. The incident was reported last week after three of the 25 arrested in connection with the killings confessed to the crime in a court.</span></p>
<p>The families have no official communication from the government, but their friends in the Gulf identified the victims as Salim of Navaikulam in Thiruvananathapuram and Shajahan of Kottarakkara in Kollam. Both had gone missing since 2010 and their families believe they were in prison after they got involved in crimes.</p>
<p>Salim’s wife Shailaja said her husband had been missing since 2010. “A friend of my husband said he identified the wedding ring and the resident permit recovered from remains dug out from the farm. However, we are yet to get any confirmation from Indian or Saudi governments,’’ said Shailaja.</p>
<p>She said Salim, 50, a tailor had been in the Gulf for 15 years when he went missing on March 16, 2010. “We knocked at government offices, including the Indian Embassy, to trace my husband. His colleagues told us he was in jail. We believed that until now,’’ said Shailaja.</p>
<p>Shajahan’s wife Beena said another worker from Kerala, Yousaf, made the family believe Shajahan was arrested by police. Shajahan had been working as a driver. When he went missing in 2010, Shajahan had spent 11 years in Saudi.</p>
<p>“We believed what Yousaf said and hence did not go for any probe. On February 10, Yousaf called to say Shajahan’s body was recovered from a farm. He said Shajahan’s residence permit was found in the remains. Later, we came to know Yousaf was arrested in connection with the incident. Now, I suspect, he knew everything about the murder right from the beginning,’’ said Beena, mother of two minor girls.</p>
<p>The Arab News reported that a tenant stumbled upon decomposed human remains while clearing his land in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. Former Left legislator and film director P T Kunju Muhammed said the incident showed negligence on the part of the Indian government. Muhammed, who anchors a TV programme to trace missing Indians in the Gulf, said, “Thousands of Indian workers had gone missing in Gulf countries. Many are languishing in jails for petty crimes. Even bodies of the dead could not be brought back home. The incident shows how we were callous about complaints.’’</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999932&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Stating the legal stand in the case relating to the commutation of death sentence of the killers of former PM Rajiv Gandhi, the Ministry of Home Affairs has decided to oppose the commutation of death sentence of Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) terrorist Devinderpal Singh Bhullar, notwithstanding his poor medical condition.</span></p>
<p>The MHA, which has to file a reply in the SC on March 10 to a mercy petition filed by Bhullar’s wife Navneet, has decided to take a stand against commutation to life imprisonment. MHA has told the SC that Bhullar will not be executed in his present health condition.</p>
<p>Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung in January had favoured commutation of the death sentence to life term on “on principles of human ethics and natural justice”.</p>
<p>The Centre had recently moved SC opposing the commutation of death sentence of three killers of Rajiv Gandhi on the grounds of delay in deciding their mercy petition.</p>
<p>“Besides Rajiv Gandhi’s killers, we have moved SC against commutation of death sentences of 15 people&#8230; In Bhullar’s case we are going to stick to the stand, the only consideration being his deteriorating health,” said an official.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999930&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Expressing concern over last month’s violence at its project site in Jagatsinghpur district, Korean steelmaker Posco has requested the Naveen Patnaik government to maintain law and order in the area.</span></p>
<p>On February 16, hundreds of people, displaced from their land due to the project, torched Posco’s pre-fabricated office and brought down a 300-metre boundary wall at Nuagaon village. The oustees also attacked workers of a construction company engaged by Posco to build the boundary wall at the proposed site for the $12 billion project.</p>
<p>Following a five-month stand-off, Posco had started building the boundary wall on December 14. A 2-km wall had come up within two months.</p>
<p>In a letter to the Orissa chief secretary, Posco India CMD Yong-Won Yoon said the violence defeated the spirit of the company’s MoU with the state government: “Certain anti-social elements demomished our boundary wall, set our offices on fire and also blocked entry into the site area. Incidences of violence have taken place earlier as well&#8230; Such incidents of violence, arsoning and destruction of our property are a blatant breach of law. It’s not helpful for the project at all.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999929&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In the last days of its tenure, the UPA-II government has reached the crucial “work share agreement” with French firm Dassault for supply of 126 Rafale fighter jets to India. While a deal is expected to be signed only later this year, it is learnt that the two sides have agreed on the pact to operationalise the multi-billion dollar pact.</span></p>
<p>This is being seen as a “major development”, since the two sides have agreed on one of the major pacts to implement the deal after almost two years of zeroing in on the French defence major. The two sides are also working on an agreement for a sovereign guarantee that Dassault will supply, service and maintain the Rafales over the next 40 years.</p>
<p>Overruling concerns raised by Dassault on Hindustan Aeronotics Limited as a partner, it has been decided that HAL will carry out 70 per cent of the work on the 108 aircrafts made in India. The remaining 30 per cent will be done by Dassault. The first batch of 18 MMRCA planes will be fully manufactured in France and will be brought to India in “fly-away” condition.</p>
<p>While Indian officials confirmed the development on Monday here, the head of French defence procurement agency Laurent Collet-Billon had indicated this a radio station in France (Europe1) a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>On February 19, Collet-Billon had said, “This phase of identifying partners has been completed, so there is an agreement between Dassault and its chief Indian industrial partner, HAL.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999923&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Rolls Royce: CBI to probe all contracts with HAL.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999908&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Alarm bells have gone off in the Indian Air Force with the Ministry of Defence putting on hold all deals with leading engine manufacturer Rolls Royce, days after ordering a CBI probe into the allegations of bribery and corruption against the company.</span></p>
<p>The future operations of at least six types of aircraft in service with the Air Force and Navy — including Jaguar fighters, Embraer VVIP jets and Sea Harriers — are likely to be impacted with the annual contracts for repair and overhaul of engines being put on hold for the time being.</p>
<p>The decision to temporarily suspend all contracts with the engine manufacturer comes after the defence ministry expressed concern over the ongoing anti-corruption investigation into the company by the UK Serious Frauds Office (SFO) as well as red flags raised by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) that conducted an internal probe after receiving several complaints.</p>
<p>MoD officials said the CBI had been asked to probe allegations of corruption against the company and look into all deals signed between Rolls Royce and HAL for discrepancies. These include deals for Hawk trainers as well as civilian contracts.</p>
<p>While maintenance contracts have been put on hold, IAF officials said the current contract was valid till the end of this month and that they had spares and other resources to maintain the fleet for now. Several military aircraft, including Avro, Hawk, Kirans, Sea Kings and C-130J, use these engines. The ministry is also seeking advice from the law ministry to ink any future contract, including the annual maintenance contracts, with the company.</p>
<p>The probe comes even as MoD officials said Rolls Royce admitted to hiring a private firm as a ‘commercial advisor’ for deals in India and that it was paid a certain percentage of the contract value. The ‘advisor’ has been identified as the Aashmore Private Limited company that is led by Singapore-based Ashok Patni.</p>
<p>Officials said Rolls Royce admitted in a communication to HAL in November 2013 that the advisor was hired to provide sales and logistic support as well as ‘strategic advice’ for the Indian market. However, sources said, the Rolls Royce’s view was that the company was hired only for advice and consultation for its civilian operations in India and not contracts for the defence forces.</p>
<p>As things stand, all defence contracts that Rolls Royce has inked with India between 2007 and 2011 have come under scrutiny. In addition, the defence ministry also asked for information from the UK where the SFO probe is under way. Arms agent Sudhir Choudhrie was arrested by the SFO last month as part of its investigation into Rolls Royce deals in Asia.</p>
<p>Sources said this was the first time Rolls Royce had made the disclosure that it hired a consultant in India, even though it was mandatory to make such disclosure. According to MoD officials, as part of a contract signed with HAL, Rolls Royce was sent a standard clause in November that asked for disclosure of any contract with individuals or companies for its dealings in India.</p>
<p>In December, said the officials, the company responded with details of its contracts with Aashmore, raising concern within HAL. This prompted the PSU to raise the matter with the MoD and a CBI probe was ordered.</p>
<p>“We will cooperate fully with the regulatory authorities and have repeatedly made clear that we will not tolerate misconduct of any sort,” Rolls Royce has said in a single-line statement on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>BJP for court-monitored probe</strong></p>
<p>The BJP Monday demanded a court-monitored CBI probe into the charges of bribery in the purchase of aircraft engine from Rolls Royce. BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said: “UK Serious Fraud Office arrested arms dealer Sudhir Chaudhary and his son Bhanu, initiating investigation into allegations that the father-son duo acted as intermediaries of Rolls Royce. After this development, the Congress-led UPA government was forced to institute a CBI inquiry&#8230;” He added: “An investigation makes progress only if it is monitored by the courts, otherwise it becomes a cover-up operation. We demand a court-monitored probe into this.” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi, however, said: “It is important to clarify that the Congress has been uncompromising on allegations of corruption. An audit report of the HAL has simply led to a file noting after which the defence minister has already ordered an inquiry. This shows the commitment of the UPA government that whenever there is some prime facie allegation of wrongdoing, it is to be inquired into.” ENS</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999908&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/supremecourtm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1976034" alt="The only plan in place, a scholarship scheme for disabled students, is yet to be introduced in any of the union territories or Northeastern states." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/supremecourtm.jpg" /></a> The only plan in place, a scholarship scheme for disabled students, is yet to be introduced in any of the union territories or Northeastern states.
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">A fund created on the order of the Supreme Court for welfare of the disabled has swollen to Rs 223 crore, but not even 10 per cent of it has been utilised in almost a decade now.</span></p>
<p>The only plan in place, a scholarship scheme for disabled students, is yet to be introduced in any of the union territories or Northeastern states.</p>
<p>In 2004, the court had ordered that the Comptroller and Auditor General set up a trust with the money recovered by it from banks as illegal collection from borrowers. The money, the court said, would be used for the benefit of disabled. The trust was to be managed by the CAG as its chairman, with the finance secretary and law secretary as ex-officio members.</p>
<p>The RBI recently wrote to the under secretary, Ministry of Finance, that Rs 173 crore in all had been deposited in the fund. While 46 commercial banks had deposited Rs 154 crore towards excess interest charged to borrowers, Rs 19.5 crore had been deposited as part of the additional Rs 50 lakh each the banks gave in accordance with the Supreme Court order.</p>
<p>This money, Additional Solicitor General Rakesh Khanna informed a Supreme Court bench led by Justice K S Radhakrishnan recently, has grown to Rs 223 crore along with interest.</p>
<p>However, as the documents submitted in court showed, the trust has so far utilised a meagre Rs 18.59 crore towards according benefits to the physically challenged. Only money allotted for a scholarship scheme has been entirely used, benefiting 1,500 students per year. The number of scholarships has now been raised to 2,000 students per year.</p>
<p>Documents also revealed that no union territory or Northeastern state barring Assam had benefited from the scholarship scheme, which has more male recipients than female.</p>
<p>At a hearing earlier, ASG Khanna had told the court about the recovery of the amount so far and sought some additional orders on issues like merger of banks, or closure of banking operations by some entities, mode of recovery from state finance corporations etc.\</p>
<p>The bench, which was hearing a petition filed by Ravi Shankar Bhushan, a disabled person working in an NGO, said it would pass appropriate orders with assistance from the petitioner’s counsel Colin Gonsalves.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999878&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Indian Express Archive)
<p>Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced Monday that farmers would stage a road blockade and shut down agitation on March 6 to protest against Centre for not providing assistance to them, drawing criticism from Opposition Congress.</p>
<p>Reacting to Chouhan&#8217;s announcement, MP state Congress president Arun Yadav termed Chouhan&#8217;s moral support to the stir as &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221;.</p>
<p>After visiting rain and hailstorm affected farmers in Vidisha and Rajgarh districts, Chouhan announced that farmers would stage a road blockade for an hour from 11 am to 12 pm noon and observe a shut down until 2 pm to highlight their plight, official sources said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Despite my repeated requests, the Centre has not responded. The PM is unable to find time to hear me out. So the MadhyaPradesh shall observe a strike on March 6 in protest,&#8221; Chouhan tweeted about the issue.</p>
<p>Chouhan has already met President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar to highlight various farmers&#8217; issues but failed to receive any central assistance so far, sources said.</p>
<p>Besides assistance for rain and hailstorm hit farmers,the MP CM also demanded Minimum Support Price for gram crop and also for recognising Madhya Pradesh as the Basmati rice growing state by the Geographical Indication Registry.</p>
<p>Chouhan said that MP farmers had no other option left,except resorting to a shut down and staging a road blockade to press the Centre for central assistance.</p>
<p>MP&#8217;s farmers have suffered extensive crop damage because of unseasonal rains and hailstorm after which the state government decided to earmark Rs 2000 crore in the vote-on-account to be passed in the MP assembly in two days.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999872&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad  on Monday asked  the Jammu and Kashmir government to raise the retirement age of doctors so that the health sector did not suffer for want of adequate staff.</p>
<p>Azad said this after inaugurating a 220-bed Super Speciality Hospital besides launching Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakaram (RBSK), Project Swasthya Slate and 102-J&amp;K Referral Service under National Rural Health Mission .</p>
<p>Regarding 102 referral service, he asked the state health minister to bring the remaining sanctioned 200 ambulances at the earliest.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Union Minister Farooq Abdullah, Azad said &#8216;Jammu and Kashmir was the first state to get the Project Swasthya Slate to cover most difficult areas&#8217;.</p>
<p>Spelling out achievements of the Centre and state  governments, Azad said, &#8220;We have not only given new dimensions to health sector but all the development fields have witnessed a discernible change during the past 4 to 5 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Azad said one more medical college has been sanctioned for Rajouri, thus raising the total number of newly sanctioned medical colleges to five.</p>
<p>He said the government has given nod to establish 75 cancer institutions in the country compared to only one such centre in the last 65 years.</p>
<p>He said the UPA government extended massive financial and moral support to all the states without any political, social or religious consideration.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, Abdullah extended gratitude to the Centre for giving special consideration to development of J&amp;K in view of its tough terrain and hoped it will continue to do so in future also.</p>
<p>He also thanked Azad for transforming the healthcare profile of the state.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999862&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rao-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000232" alt="The TRS decision was learnt to have been made in response to the Congress’s refusal to make the party’s leader K Chandrasekhar Rao chief minister of Telangana before the elections. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rao-med.jpg" /></a> The TRS decision was learnt to have been made in response to the Congress’s refusal to make the party’s leader Rao chief minister of Telangana before the elections. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Days after Ramvilas Paswan decided to climb on to Narendra Modi’s bandwagon, the Congress suffered another jolt on Monday: the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) decided not to merge with it.</span></p>
<p>The TRS decision was learnt to have been made in response to the Congress’s refusal to make the party’s leader K Chandrasekhar Rao chief minister of Telangana before the elections.</p>
<p>“Last year I told the Congress that if Telangana is created by passing a Bill in September when Parliament was in session, TRS would merge with Congress. I gave that assurance. But that did not happen, and now we are under no obligation to merge,” KCR said after a meeting of his party on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Despite having its back to the wall, the Congress appeared to put its faith in its vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s firm belief in the philosophy of ‘ekla chalo’ — walk alone. The decision to go alone in Bihar in 2009 had backfired, but the party seemed prepared to play the same move one more time in that state.</p>
<p>Before Monday evening’s decision by the TRS, the Congress was learnt to have told <span style="line-height:1.5em;">KCR to either merge with it or contest separately. </span></p>
<p>“There is no question of an alliance with TRS. KCR had declared that he would merge the TRS with the Congress if Telangana was created. If he goes back on his words, we will fight against each other,” a senior Congress leader had told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>KCR was said to have put conditions for the merger, including making him chief minister of the new state before the elections. The Congress had, in fact, explored the option of “delinking” Lok Sabha and state assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, but the Election Commission had been unwilling, sources said.</p>
<p>The Congress has been disinclined to hand over Telangana to KCR before elections. Having all but sacrificed its 25 Lok Sabha seats in the residuary state, the party was not willing to play second fiddle in Telangana as well.</p>
<p>KCR, on the other hand, has been wary of allowing his destiny to hang in the balance until after the elections, the sources said. Even as the party went into Monday’s meeting, most of its leaders were against a merger with the Congress.</p>
<p>In Bihar, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s response to renewed Congress overtures has been lukewarm, and JD (U) chief Sharad Yadav on Monday ruled out any alliance outside the 11-party non-Congress, non-BJP front.</p>
<p>The Congress considers RJD chief Lalu’s offer of a seat-sharing deal “humiliating” — not so much for the number of seats as for their “quality”. Most of the 11 seats that Lalu is offering are those at which neither the Congress nor the RJD stand much chance. The bitter parting of ways following the failure of seat-sharing talks before the 2009 polls had hurt both parties, still, neither side seemed willing to bend again.</p>
<p>“For Lalu, it is a question of political survival. We got two seats contesting alone in 2009. It can’t be worse than that. We would rather go alone and try to revive the party if Lalu remains adamant,” a senior Congress leader from Bihar said on Monday.</p>
<p>The party expects Lalu to ultimately come around for the sake of preserving his so-called M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) constituency. “If Muslim votes get divided and Yadavs feel that Lalu may not be able to contain Nitish, some of them may even shift loyalties to the BJP. For Yadavs, the main enemy is Nitish, not Narendra Modi,” explained the Bihar Congress leader.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999876&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jayam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999864" alt="Jayalalithaa blamed the &quot;wrong economic policies&quot; of the UPA for the price rise and other ills faced by the people. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jayam.jpg" /></a> Jayalalithaa blamed the &#8220;wrong economic policies&#8221; of the UPA for the price rise and other ills faced by the people. (PTI)
<p>Mounting a blistering attack on the Congress-led UPA Government, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa on Monday accused it of &#8220;plundering&#8221; the nation in the last ten years and appealed to the people to throw it out in the coming Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Congress-led Government at the Centre had plundered the country in the last ten years. This anti-people Congress rule should be removed. I am sure that people are against Congress returning to power,&#8221; the AIADMK supremo said launching her first phase of poll campaign from this temple town known for its silk garments.</p>
<p>Addressing a rally, amidst loud cheers of &#8220;Amma&#8221;, she appealed to the electorate to ensure that the AIADMK would be part of the next government to safeguard the rights of Tamils, indicating her national ambitions.</p>
<p>Lashing out at the Congress, she accused it of betraying people of Tamil Nadu on at least ten issues, including Sri Lankan Tamils issue, attack on fishermen from the state and on Katchatheevu retrieval.</p>
<p>She also blamed the &#8220;wrong economic policies&#8221; of the UPA for the price rise and other ills faced by the people and accused it of neglecting the defence sector.</p>
<p>Resorting to her usual style of engaging people, Jayalalithaa during her about 45-minute long speech, asked the crowd whether they needed such a government, evoking a positive roar &#8220;no&#8221; in response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last time in the assembly elections I had appealed to you all to throw out the family rule (DMK) and you obliged me. Now I am here to ask you to remove anti-people Congress government and am confident you will do it. It is our duty to remove the anti-people and corrupt Congress government,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Referring to various corruption charges that surfaced during the UPA regime, she listed out &#8220;Himalayan 2G scam, helicopter scam, coal scam CWG scam. The list of scams against the Congress rule is endless.. in this DMK spearheaded the 2G scam,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She castigated arch-rival DMK, saying the party had been supporting the &#8220;anti-people UPA Government&#8221; and did nothing for the state despite being part of the central government in the past about 17 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DMK came to power by seeking votes promising to work for the welfare of the people. But Karunanidhi did nothing. We need to teach a fitting lesson to it in the coming election,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Calling the Congress Government a &#8220;traitor&#8221; of Tamils&#8217; interest, Jayalalithaa said it had provided tacit help to the Sri Lankan government which had committed &#8220;genocide&#8221; of Tamils.</p>
<p>She said the Congress-led UPA not only betrayed the Tamils, but also the state government by &#8220;interfering&#8221; in its rights, and cited the &#8220;unilateral&#8221; effort to set up the National Counter Terrorism Centre and enact the GST Act.</p>
<p>Referring to allowing FDI in retail, rise in inflation and prices of fertilisers besides fall in Rupee&#8217;s value, she said the people now had a &#8220;good opportunity&#8221; to teach a lesson to the Congress and the DMK which was supporting it.</p>
<p>The coming polls was not only an opportunity for a regime change, but also for restructuring India&#8217;s growth trajectory and to protect it from foreign threats, she said.</p>
<p>In her address, Jayalalithaa did not name any individual barring Karunanidhi and refrained from referring to any other party other than Congress and DMK.</p>
<p>Dwelling at length on the issues related to defence sector, the Chief Minister said the Congress-led Government had not taken steps to modernise and strengthen the armed forces and said &#8220;it is very regrettable&#8221;.</p>
<p>Stating that allocation for defence sector in the interim budget was the lowest since 1952, she said even out of this, 92 per cent would go for procurments made already. The actual allocation for modernisation and future procurement of weaponry was only eight per cent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rescinding defence procurement agreements alone is not sufficient to end graft in defence buying. Stern measures are needed to recompensate the losses and end corruption,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Accusing the Congress government of failure to fulfill the requirements of defence personnel, she promised the next regime would take all steps to make the country&#8217;s armed forces a model for other nations.</p>
<p>She gave a call to the electorate to &#8220;save India&#8221; by voting for the AIADMK to &#8220;punish the graft-tainted Congress&#8221;, put the nation &#8220;on par with superpowers&#8221; in defence preparedness and to control petrol pricing that affected the common man.</p>
<p>Listing out various pro-people measurers being implemented by her government, she highlighted the salient features of AIADMK manifesto including the promise to raise the Income Tax exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999853&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sachin-pilot.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1962550" alt="Pilot said as per the Congress' district units survey, there were more farmers who were eligible for the compensation, which the Vasundhara Raje government had neglected. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sachin-pilot.jpg" /></a> Pilot said as per the Congress&#8217; district units survey, there were more farmers who were eligible for the compensation, which the Vasundhara Raje government had neglected.
<p>Congress on Monday termed as &#8220;peanuts&#8221; the Rajasthan government&#8217;s compensation given to farmers whose crop had been damaged due to inclement weather.</p>
<p>Congress chief in the state and Union Minister Sachin Pilot said as per the Congress&#8217; district units survey, there were more farmers who were eligible for the compensation, which the Vasundhara Raje government had neglected. &#8220;It is unfortunate that the state government is considering crop damage only in 4000 to 5,000 villages, whereas as per the Congress district units (sruvey), the rabi crop in 25,000 villages perished,&#8221; Pilot said here.</p>
<p>The BJP government&#8217;s initial survey at Tehsil level was done using a wrong method and it should be done on the crop sown area, he said. Demanding that compensation be paid for farmers whose even 25 per cent crop was damaged, Pilot said the state government had announced a meagre package only to those whose crops were damaged 50 per cent or above.</p>
<p>Any village having 40 per cent of crop damage should be declared scarcity hit, and farmers&#8217; loan should be waived, and revenue collection must be stopped, he demanded.</p>
<p>The PCC chief also demanded that &#8220;Abiyana shulk&#8221; (tax) in irrigated area be waived off, adding that affected farmers should be provided foodgrains at Re one per kg, and identified affected farmers should be provided financial assistance.</p>
<p>PCC had last week asked the district Congress units to do on-spot survey of crop damage due to inclement weather and file reports by March 2.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999852&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Archive)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jairamrameshm.jpg" /></a> Union minister Jairam Ramesh on Monday said that the centre will provide funds for the construction of new buildings of Seemandhra&#8217;s capital. (Express Archive)
<p>The Centre would soon constitute three expert committees to look into the issues of the division of government employees between Telangana and Seemandhra states as well as the creation of a new capital for the latter, Union Minister Jairam Ramesh said on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government will not take any unilateral decision on the bifurcation of the employees. Two expert committees will look into the division of employees of the state and central governments,&#8221; the Union Rural Development Minister said here today in a press conference. There are nearly 84,000 government employees in undivided Andhra Pradesh, who will have to be divided between the two states. All of them will have to be accommodated according to their options.</p>
<p>&#8220;While one committee will work on the division of the officials of the all India services, like IAS, IPS, IFS and others, the second one will work on the bifurcation of the over 84,000 state government employees. The committee will take a decision only after obtaining options from them. &#8220;There is no question of taking a unilateral decision. The government will arrive at a decision only after obtaining options from the employees,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to Ramesh, the third expert committee will work on the creation of a new capital for Seemandhra state. &#8220;This committee will give its report within six months. The union government will then study the report and take a decision after consulting the Seemandhra state for the creation of the new capital,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The central government will provide funds for the construction of buildings for the new state capital. 8,000 acres of land is required for the new capital, Ramesh said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999837&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congress on Monday put a brave face on former Supreme Court Judge K T Thomas turning down the offer to head the Lokpal search committee, days after jurist Fali Nariman opted out of panel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the question of government being embarrassed. I do not find any head or tail of this question. It is a statutory body. Each position on this has to be fulfilled,&#8221; party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Giving or not giving consent cannot be linked to government. These are private decisions. People can say yes or no for many reasons. How you can blame government for this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Singhvi&#8217;s reaction came after Thomas turned down the offer to head Lokpal search committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason is when I went through the rules, our committee which is called the search committee was to recommend names to select committee. The select committee need or need not to accept those names. So it was not worth while to have this search committee,&#8221; the former judge said giving reasons for his opting out.</p>
<p>Thomas was a judge in the apex court between March 29, 1996 to January 1, 2002.</p>
<p>Singhvi said whatever objections about the procedure for the appointments of Lokpal should have been raised when the Lokpal legislation was being passed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999835&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Archives)
<p>Natarajan&#8217;s victory came against the backdrop of former Neemuch district Congress president and Lok Sabha aspirant Surendra Sethi&#8217;s allegation that the primary was rigged. Sethi had boycotted the election.</p>
<p>The concept of primary is aimed at decentralisation of power and encouraging inner-party democracy in Congress. A total of 1,501 persons were eligible to cast vote in the primary election, which was held at hotel Harsh Vilas in Mandsaur today.</p>
<p>Natarajan secured 706 votes out of total of 781 votes cast, whereas Sethi got 50 votes while 25 votes were rejected.</p>
<p>Sethi had alleged at least 500 Congress workers registered for voting did not belong to either Neemuch or Mandsaur, which according to him has cast a serious doubt on authenticity of the entire process.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is sad that Rahul&#8217;s pilot project was being sabotaged by those who claim to be close to him,&#8221; he had said.</p>
<p>Under the project being steered by Rahul, nominees in 15 Lok Sabha constituencies across the country, will be chosen through primaries or inner party elections in a bid to strengthen &#8220;democracy&#8221; in Congress.</p>
<p>Natarajan, also AICC secretary, was selected by Rahul for contesting from Mandsaur in 2009 general elections, which she won by over 30,000 votes defeating her BJP opponent Laxmi Narayan Pandey.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999806&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh&#8217;s wish to visit his birth place in Pakistan&#8217;s Punjab province, where he was born over 81 years ago, may not materialise before the end of his tenure.</p>
<p>Asked whether Singh will be able to squeeze in a trip to Pakistan before the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, Indian officials said: &#8220;We haven&#8217;t got anything planned&#8221;. Singh was born in Gah village on September 26, 1932.</p>
<p>While accepting in principle invitation by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit that country, Singh had made it clear that he would undertake the trip only if there is a possibility of a &#8220;substantive&#8221; outcome.<br />
India has been unhappy over the slow pace of progress in the trial of the 26/11 Mumbai attackers in Pakistan and feels that Islamabad is deliberately dragging its feet in ensuring that the culprits are punished.</p>
<p>New Delhi is also agitated that Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafeez Sayeed is being permitted to roam around free in Pakistan and also make provocative anti-India speeches.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999748&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to Centre and all states on a PIL to declare HIV affected children as a disadvantaged group under the Right of Education Act to ensure they got education without discrimination.</p>
<p>A bench headed by Justice B S Chauhan also sought response from the governments on the plea of an NGO seeking framing of guidelines to prevent any kind of discrimination towards students due to their own HIV status or that of their parents or guardians.</p>
<p>Alleging that children living with or affected by HIV/AIDS are denied admission, suspended and even expelled from schools, the NGO &#8211; Naaz Foundation &#8211; submitted that such students are also being publicly ridiculed by school authorities, humiliated and treated unfairly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moreover, the confidentiality of the HIV-positive statusof the children has been routinely breached leading to violation of their right to privacy and the rampant acts of stigmatisation and discrimination that have followed have undermined their human dignity,&#8221; the petition said.</p>
<p>It said according to the NACO report the total number of people living with HIV in India is estimated at around 20.9 lakh in 2011 and children less than 15 years of age account for 1.45 lakh.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999765&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Narendra Modi today alleged that the Third Front was only aimedvat promoting the interest of the Congress, and they cannot do any good for the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Third Front is actually aimed at promoting the interest of Congress,&#8221; he said addressing the Hunkar rally while launching a blistering attack on Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar, a prime mover of the anti-Congress and anti-BJP Front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear about Third Front a year or six months ago? &#8230; It has come (into being) on the eve of elections&#8230;It can spoil the elections but can do no good for the country,&#8221; the BJP prime ministerial candidate said.</p>
<p>Coming down heavily on Congress and other parties, he said while for BJP secularism meant promoting the interests of all castes and communities, and ushering the country on the path of development, but for others it has a &#8220;narrow meaning of stopping Narendra Modi from coming to power&#8221;.</p>
<p>Tearing into Kumar&#8217;s development claims, he quoted statistics stating that only 23 per cent households in the state have toilets and only 16 per cent have electricity.</p>
<p>New entrants to NDA &#8212; LJP President Ramvilas Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha of Rashtriya Loksamata Party &#8212; shared the dais with Modi for the first time after becoming part of the alliance.</p>
<p>Modi said for the parties opposing him the main agenda is not to protect sovereignty of the country or its development but only to stop him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Negativism and efforts to fool the country in the name of secularism will not cut any ice with people any more,&#8221; he said in an apparent dig at Congress and Nitish Kumar.</p>
<p>Modi blamed Kumar and his &#8220;vote bank politics&#8221; for the serial explosions in his Patna rally, which claimed seven lives.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people who are involved in vote bank politics wanted to end my game through the explosions,&#8221; he alleged.</p>
<p>Continuing his tirade against Kumar, he said it was due to the &#8220;vote bank politics&#8221; that Bihar has become a<br />
&#8216;haven&#8217; for terrorists taking shelter in neighbouring Nepal.</p>
<p>He lambasted Congress and the other parties, seeking to form the Third Front, for &#8220;chanting&#8221; secularism for everything as part of their &#8220;vote bank politics&#8221; and to avoid answering questions on lack of development initiatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Earlier it was a fashion to attribute everything to terrorism from across the border and hands of Pakistan ISI. But today secularism seems to have become the &#8216;jarri butty&#8217; (life saving herbs) for everything &#8212; be it the question of price rise or corruption,&#8221; he said and blamed the parties opposing him of practising hypocrisy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today when you say prices of essential commodities are rising, they (opponents) will say secularism is in danger. There is excessive corruption, they will say secularism is in danger,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Referring to the NDA, he said it is witnessing expansion and also stood for National Development Alliance.</p>
<p>&#8220;This (the expansion) is not going to stop &#8230; Anxiety of my opponents is set to increase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Modi started his 40-minute address in Bhojpuri and lavishly praised Maithli language and &#8216;makhana&#8217; known for its nutritional value and grown in north Bihar areas.</p>
<p>This was his third visit to Bihar. After his first visit for the October 27 &#8220;Hunkar rally&#8221; at Patna, he had visited the state again to condole the death of seven persons in the serial blasts on that day.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999762&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>With new BJP allies <a title="BJP gets its first new ally as Ram Vilas Paswan returns to NDA fold" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/lok-sabha-polls-ram-vilas-paswan-returns-to-nda-as-bjp-ljp-agree-on-seat-sharing/" target="_blank">Ramvilas Paswan</a> and Upendra Kushwaha by his side, <a title="Third Front aimed at promoting Congress’ interest: Narendra Modi" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/third-front-aimed-at-promoting-congress-interest-narendra-modi/" target="_blank">Narendra Modi</a> sought support for the “National Development Alliance” in Muzaffarpur on Monday. He reminded Bihar Chief Minister <a title="Ram Vilas Paswan has no ideology, BJP-LJP alliance ‘unprincipled’: Nitish Kumar" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/ram-vilas-paswan-bjp-ljp-alliance-unprincipled-nitish-kumar/" target="_blank">Nitish Kumar</a> of the poor development record of his state, and accused him of being soft on terrorism as part of his “votebank politics”.</p>
<p><a title="Hunkar rally: I want to see Narendra Modi as the future PM, says Paswan" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/hunkar-rally-narendra-modi-paswan/" target="_blank">LJP chief</a> Paswan, who shared the dais with the NDA’s prime ministerial candidate for the first time since joining the alliance last week, addressed Modi as “vikas purush” and sought a commitment on the development of Dalits and Muslims.</p>
<p>Rashtriya Lok Samata Party’s Kushwaha, a prominent OBC leader who parted ways with Nitish in 2012, stressed on the uplift of farmers.</p>
<p>“I welcome Paswanji and Kushwahaji into the NDA. Those who thought that BJP was a party of baniyas and upper castes were surpised after a person from a backward community was made its PM candidate,” Modi told a massive crowd on the outskirts of this district town. “The coming decade will be one in which the Dalit, the exploited and the backward will march on the road to progress,” he said.</p>
<p>Modi described his idea of development as one in which every house had a toilet, a functioning tap, and a power connection. “I am ashamed to see that even after 60-plus years of independence, we have not been to provide a life of dignity to our mothers and sisters by building tollets at home,” he told the cheering meeting.</p>
<p>He asked Nitish how providing toilets in “only 23 per cent households”, electricity to “only 16 per cent homes” and giving jobs to only 2,000 of the 8.5 lakh registered unemployed could qualify as “development”.</p>
<p>He attacked the Congress and third front, saying while he was trying to “find solutions to problems”, they were only  trying to “sort out Modi”. “To every question on inflation and corruption, they talk of secularism&#8230; Secularism to us is appeasement of none and development of all.”</p>
<p>Comparing the apparent difference in the approaches of Paswan and Nitish to the NDA, Modi said, “Paswanji left the NDA after the 2002 riots. But whenever we met, there was warmth. But there are other leaders who behave in a certain way behind closed doors, and in another way in public, and baulk at even shaking hands (with me).”</p>
<p>“People cannot forgive hypocrisy,” he said, referring to Nitish’s ire at a Gujarat government advertisement that had shown the two chief ministers holding hands in solidarity.</p>
<p>Paswan, who described Modi as the “future PM”, on his part said: “So long as I was with them, I was good. Nitish Kumar would say that I should be the CM. But one should not stay where there is no respect. NDA has treated me better than UPA.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999764&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/manmohanm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999746" alt="Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is welcomed on his arrival in Nay Pyi Taw on Monday to attend the 3rd BIMSTEC Summit. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/manmohanm.jpg" /></a> Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is welcomed on his arrival in Nay Pyi Taw on Monday to attend the 3rd BIMSTEC Summit. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">With India election-bound, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has ruled out his return to office, arrived Monday in Myanmarese capital Nay Pyi Taw to go through the motions of a regional summit and touch base one last time with leaders of a grouping that seeks to bridge South Asia with ASEAN.</span></p>
<p>Singh flew out of New Delhi for Nay Pyi Taw, for the third BIMSTEC summit — the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation between Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand.</p>
<p>Hours after landing in Nay Pyi Taw, Singh met President Thein Sein, who is chairing the summit as host, and Nepal’s new Prime Minister Sushil Koirala. His meetings with Rajapaksa, Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh and Myanmar’s opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi are scheduled for Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit.</p>
<p>External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid, responding to a query from The Indian Express on the Prime Minister’s meeting with Koirala, said: “Prime Minister Koirala is still getting a feel of what he has to do&#8230; He is very keen that our Prime Minister visit Nepal but the Prime Minister has said it is difficult. He said hope you will come to India instead. Issues important to both sides were mentioned. and the handing over (by India) of a trauma centre in Kathmandu, which is ready, will happen soon.”</p>
<p>It is Singh’s meeting with President Rajapaksa on Tuesday that is being tracked closely given the opposition back home by Tamil parties. Hours after Singh arrived in Nay Pyi Taw, official sources underlined that India’s vote on a resolution against Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva for alleged war crimes against Tamils would depend on the text of the draft and would be guided by “our own interests”.</p>
<p>Twice in the last two years, India voted against Sri Lanka after Tamil parties mounted pressure on the UPA government resulting in a cooling of ties. The US-led resolution, which will be put to vote later this month, calls for an international probe into allegations of war crimes during the final battle with the Tamil Tigers in 2009. Under pressure from Tamil parties, Prime Minister Singh had called off a trip to Sri Lanka when it hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).</p>
<p>When asked how India would vote in Geneva, Khurshid said: “We have not received any draft (of the resolution). We have checked with Sri Lanka and they too haven’t received any draft.”</p>
<p>In a statement before leaving for Nay Pyi Taw, the Prime Minister called for a collective effort to combat security challenges, improve connectivity and trade in the region.</p>
<p>“Security challenges, both natural and man-made, require our collective vision and determination to be overcome&#8230; We set great store by BIMSTEC cooperation in the years ahead, for which this summit should play a critical role,” he said.</p>
<p>Last week, when Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh was asked how India would vote at Geneva, she said the government was still to firm up its stand. “I would suggest you wait till the vote actually takes place. You are aware this is a fairly complex process&#8230; We have to see the text of the resolution, we have to take several other factors into account, and then we will finally vote,” she said.</p>
<p>In a statement before leaving for Nay Pyi Taw, the Prime Minister called for a collective effort to combat security challenges, improve connectivity and trade in the region.</p>
<p>“Security challenges, both natural and man-made, require our collective vision and determination to be overcome&#8230; We set great store by BIMSTEC cooperation in the years ahead, for which this summit should play a critical role,” he said.</p>
<p>“BIMSTEC lies at the crossroads between SAARC and ASEAN, drawing its energy from the natural convergence of the countries around the Bay of Bengal. Connectivity and sub-regional cooperation in trade and investment, energy, climate, tourism, agriculture and other areas provide the spark for the growth engine in our region&#8230;”</p>
<p>“BIMSTEC has evolved as a group since the last summit in New Delhi in 2008. With the impending establishment of a permanent secretariat in Dhaka and appointment of a secretary general, it is poised to play a more active role in regional integration and cooperation. Several BIMSTEC centres are being launched throughout the region, including three in India, to foster greater technical exchanges between member countries,” Singh said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999743&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/farooq.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999742" alt="farooq" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/farooq.jpg" /></a> &#8220;I had never said that Kashmiris are maha chor (big thieves),&#8221; Union Minister Farooq Abdullah told reporters in Jammu.
<p>Refuting reports about his remark over people of Kashmir, whom he allegedly dubbed as <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/pandemonium-in-jk-assembly-over-farooq-abdullahs-comments-on-kashmiris/" target="_blank">&#8216;maha chor&#8217;</a>, Union Minister Farooq Abdullah on Monday said he was misquoted by the media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kashmiri (people of Kashmir) are not only thieves, but maha chor (biggest thieves),&#8221; Farooq had said at a function in Delhi on Sunday over the issue of power theft in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had never said that Kashmiris are maha chor (big thieves),&#8221; the Union Minister told reporters in Jammu.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is lot of pilferage of power. Many of our people are stealing electricity. But I never said anything like that Kashmiris are thieves,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;It (pilferage of electricity) happens all over the country. Biggest transmission and distribution losses are in Jammu and Kashmir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Expressing dismay over the media reports, Farooq said, &#8220;I am sad that I was misquoted by the media.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Union minister said, &#8220;I had said that it is unfortunate that we buy power for nearly 2-3 thousand crores, but we are not able to get that money back because there is a lot of pilferage of power. Many of our people are stealing power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farooq said, &#8220;two days ago while speaking on power situation, I had spoken about power pilferage, but I didn&#8217;t say anything like &#8216;We Kashmiris are maha chor&#8217;. Of course, the biggest power operations loss is in Jammu and Kashmir. I have been saying this all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He alleged that since the elections were near, &#8220;a newspaper tried to create misunderstanding in the minds of the people by publishing this&#8221;.</p>
<p>On PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti&#8217;s demand for apology, he said, it was Mufti who should apologise for spreading lies.</p>
<p>PDP members, led by Mufti, on Monday created ruckus in the J&amp;K Assembly and trooped into the well of the house demanding an apology from Farooq.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999734&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ktthomasm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999735" alt="Thomas' move to quit the Lokpal search committee is the latest controversy over appointing the anti-corruption ombudsman." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ktthomasm.jpg" /></a> Thomas&#8217; move to quit the Lokpal search committee is the latest controversy over appointing the anti-corruption ombudsman.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Days after <a title="Fali Nariman declines to be on Lokpal search panel, tells PMO selection process flawed" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/fali-nariman-declines-to-be-on-lokpal-search-panel-tells-pmo-selection-process-flawed/" target="_blank">Fali Nariman</a> declined to be part of the process to pick India’s first Lokpal, the government suffered a second embarrassment in the matter — retired Supreme Court judge <a title="Thomas’ decision not an embarrassment to govt: Congress" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/thomas-decision-not-an-embarrassment-to-govt-congress/" target="_blank">K T Thomas</a>, who headed the search panel, quit, saying the committee lacked independence.</span></p>
<p>In a letter sent to the Prime Minister’s Office, Justice (retd) Thomas withdrew his “willingness” to head the search panel, saying, “Why there should be a Search Committee at all?&#8230; When the Selection Committee itself can decide on who should be the members of <a title="Whose Lokpal" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/whose-lokpal/" target="_blank">Lokpal</a>&#8230;”</p>
<p>With Nariman and Thomas quitting, the eight-member search panel now has two vacancies.</p>
<p><a title="Whose Lokpal" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/whose-lokpal/" target="_blank">MUST READ: Whose Lokpal</a></p>
<p>Sources in the government said Thomas’s resignation has placed the government in a difficult position, because the appointment of the head of the search committee needs the consent of the selection committee, of which Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh are members. With the PM away in Myanmar, the government has little time to convene a meeting before elections are announced and the model code comes into force — expected any day now.</p>
<p>BJP leaders said the Leaders of Opposition in both Houses were likely to write to the Chief Election Commissioner over the delay in announcing elections. In 2009, <span style="line-height:1.5em;">the code of conduct had come into effect on March 3. </span></p>
<p>As per the Lokpal selection process, the selection committee comprising the PM, Swaraj, Speaker Meira Kumar, Supreme Court Justice H L Dattu (representative of the Chief Justice of India), and jurist P P Rao (the fifth member) must set up a search committee to shortlist possible candidates. However, the government has forwarded a list of 305 names to the search committee, asking it to pick a shortlist from the list.</p>
<p>Thomas has said that he had second thoughts after Nariman declined to join the search panel. “The current selection process would overlook the most competent, the most independent and the most courageous,” Nariman said in his letter, sent to the PMO last Thursday.</p>
<p>Thomas had written: “When I went through the Rules I have come to realize that the work of the Search Committee is to pick out names of persons from the list provided by the Central Government.</p>
<p>“I have reservations in accepting the Chairmanship of the Search Committee. I do not consider it worthwhile to travel such a long distance from my hometown Kottayam in Kerala far up to New Delhi and spend many days to make a panel from the list forwarded by the DoPT of the Central government. The Search Committee cannot make any independent search to find out the most deserving persons to be included in the panel.”</p>
<p>Thomas, who lives in Kerala, was picked to head the search panel comprising 7 others.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999716&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sahara chief Subrata Roy was on Monday taken by road to New Delhi for his case hearing. He will be produced before the Supreme Court by 2 PM on Tuesday. The apex court had issued a non-bailable warrant against him in a case of alleged contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roy has been taken to Delhi by road by the police..&#8221;, SP, Trans Gomti, Habibul Hasan told PTI after the 65-year-old Sahara chief left in a cavalcade of police cars.</p>
<p>Asked about the route by which he would be taken to Delhi, Hasan said probably he would be taken through Kanpur. </p>
<p>Roy surrendered on Friday, last week and was arrested by the police after evading them for two weeks. The Supreme Court had ordered his arrest after he failed to appear before the court.</p>
<p>The Sahara chief was lodged in a guest house of the state forest department at Kukrail, Lucknow after the state police was directed by a local court on February 28 to keep him in its<br />
custody till March 4.</p>
<p>Chief Judicial Magistrate Anand Kumar Yadav had directed the UP police to keep him in custody till 2 PM on March 4 and ensure that he is by then produced before the apex court.</p>
<p>Police had moved an application before the CJM seeking Roy&#8217;s custody, instead of transit remand, and his counsel V.K Shahi did not oppose it.</p>
<p>The order to arrest Roy was issued on February 26 for his failure to appear before the apex court in a contempt case arising out of non-refund of Rs 20,000 crore to investors by two of his companies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999705&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Delhi court on Monday dismissed a criminal defamation complaint filed by former IPS officer R B Sreekumar against Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, BJP president Rajnath Singh and two others for allegedly launching a malicious campaign against him in connection with the 1994 ISRO spying case.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Magistrate Akash Jain dismissed Sreekumar&#8217;s complaint, saying it seems that he was &#8220;not willing&#8221; and interested in pursuing it.</p>
<p>The court observed this when neither Sreekumar nor his counsel appeared before it for hearing on the complaint.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perusal of record shows none has appeared for the complainant (Sreekumar) on the last dates of hearing&#8230; it appears that complainant is not willing or interested to pursue the complaint,&#8221; the magistrate said, adding, &#8220;the application is dismissed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s order came as Sreekumar and his counsel did not appear before it for the hearing despite repeated  alls in the morning as well as in the post lunch session of the court.</p>
<p>Besides Modi and Singh, Sreekumar had also named BJP spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi and Nambi Narayanan, a retired<br />
scientist of Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), as accused in his complaint.</p>
<p>Earlier, Sreekumar&#8217;s counsel had alleged in the court that his client was defamed by the press statement issued by Lekhi in which the former Director General of Gujarat Police was called a &#8220;traitor&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sreekumar&#8217;s counsel had claimed that the former IPS officer was &#8220;nailed&#8221; in TV interviews by BJP leaders, who gave separate statements against him, and he was even called &#8220;anti-national&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I (Sreekumar) am specifically being named as traitor in the press statement issued by Lekhi. This is the party&#8217;s statement as being the party&#8217;s national spokesperson, Lekhi is speaking on behalf of the party,&#8221; he had said.</p>
<p>In his complaint, Sreekumar had alleged that a conspiracy was hatched and on November 7 last year, Lekhi gave statements harming his reputation &#8220;by digging out an old closed case of 1994 related to espionage affecting the national interests of the country&#8221;.</p>
<p>Giving details of the 1994 case related to espionage, Sreekumar had said in his complaint that Kerala Police had<br />
registered two cases in Trivandrum under various sections of the Foreigners Act, the Official Secret Act and the IPC and two Maldivian women &#8212; Mariam Rashida and Fausia Hassan &#8212; and two scientists of VSSC, D Sasikumaran and Nambi Narayanan, were named as accused for their alleged involvement.</p>
<p>He had said on the official request of DGP Kerala, Director Intelligence Bureau deputed IB officials to assist the Kerala Police in the cases and a team was formed in which he was also a member.</p>
<p>He had said that he, along with others, were engaged in assisting the special investigation team (SIT) of Kerala Police and he had interrogated Sasikumaran and Mariam Rashida, a female officer in the Maldivian Secret Service.</p>
<p>He had said that case was later transferred to the CBI which reported to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Government of Kerala against the approach of Kerala Police and IB officials involved in the investigation of the espionage case.</p>
<p>He had said that the Kerala Government rejected the proposal of CBI for taking departmental action against Kerala Police and later on, charges against him and others were dropped by the Home Ministry through its order on January 24, 2005.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998551&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/narayanasamym.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1998561" alt="Narayanasamy said that the opposition parties including BJP did not allow discussion on the anti-corruption legislations. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/narayanasamym.jpg" /></a> Narayanasamy said that the opposition parties including BJP did not allow discussion on the anti-corruption legislations. (PTI)
<p>The government on Monday accused opposition BJP of stalling key anti-corruption legislations in recently concluded session of Parliament.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government took all possible steps to pass the anti-corruption legislations. These legislations were listed as agenda in Parliament. Unfortunately the opposition parties including BJP did not allow it to be discussed,&#8221; Union Minister V Narayanasamy said.</p>
<p>The statement came a day after Union Cabinet rejected the ordinance route for the anti-corruption measures despite pressure from Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi for bringing such laws.</p>
<p>Narayanasamy alleged that BJP was indulging in &#8220;double standard&#8221; on the issue of anti-graft legislations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever government takes any step, they (BJP) stop (it). This clearly shows the double standard of BJP,&#8221; said Narayanasamy, Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.</p>
<p>However, he refused to speak much on Sunday&#8217;s Cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever cabinet decides, we have to respect that and go by that,&#8221; the Minister said.</p>
<p>Three bills &#8211; Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, Citizens Charter Bill and The Prevention of Bribery of Foreign Public Officials &#8211; related to Ministry of Personnel could not be taken up in the Parliament session which ended on February 21.</p>
<p>The Union Cabinet, which met yesterday, had rejected the ordinance route on the measures feeling that &#8220;full deliberations&#8221; were required in Parliament on the matter.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998544&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rrr-lll.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1998535" alt="The status of the waitlisted tickets will be communicated through SMS on the passenger mobile phone number (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rrr-lll.jpg" /></a> The status of the waitlisted tickets will be communicated through SMS on the passenger mobile phone number (PTI)
<p>Now you will no longer have to dial 139 or visit the rail website to check the status of your waitlisted ticket as the railways will now send booking status messages to passengers on mobile phones, if the tickets get confirmed before the journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last 10 days the trial was going on and today we formally launched the SMS alert service for all passengers whose waitlisted tickets get confirmed,&#8221; Minister of State for Railways Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said here.</p>
<p>He said everyday about four lakh passengers will get SMS alert on their mobiles about the status of their waitlisted tickets.The software for the SMS-based service has been developed by CRIS, the technological arm of railways.</p>
<p>&#8220;The status of the wait listed tickets will be communicated through SMS on the passenger mobile phone number given at the time of booking ticket. So now you will get status alert on your mobile once the waitlisted ticket becomes reservation against cancellation (RAC) and also when it gets finally confirmed,&#8221; Chowdhury said.</p>
<p>This was a Rail Budget proposal and the government was a committed to providing it to passengers free of cost, he said after launching the SMS Gateway service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Passengers want to know about the status of the ticket and the new service is certainly going to benefit passengers and also help reduce load on the railway website,&#8221; Railway Member (Traffic) DP Pandey said.</p>
<p>Pandey said not only the status of the ticket, passengers will also get the exact position of the coach and berth number. &#8220;Passengers will get the status alert three hours before with their coach number and berth number.&#8221;</p>
<p>He, however, clarified that if the waitlisted ticket becomes RAC or confirmed then only a passenger will be informed through SMS and not otherwise.</p>
<p>The facility is expected to reduce the last minute inquiry rush on the rail websites and call centre as well as reduce the crowding near the notice board of pasted chart locations on platforms.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998232&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nair1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1998539" alt="nair1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nair1.jpg" /></a> Solar panel scam accused Saritha S Nair was released from jail on February 21, 2014 after she got bail in all 46 cases. (Express Archive).
<p>Saritha S Nair, the prime accused in the solar panel scam, on Monday said several Congress leaders had indecently behaved with her.</p>
<p>Nair was <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/crime/kerala-solar-panel-scam-accused-saritha-nair-released-on-bail/" target="_blank">released on bail</a> last week in nearly three dozen cases that are pending against her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to reveal many things. Many leaders would lose their sleep in the coming days. I want to take revenge on those who had cheated me. I have evidence beyond the details of telephone calls,&#8221; she told the media.</p>
<p>Nair said Congress legislator A.P Abdullakutty had repeatedly pestered her by making late-night phone calls.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day he invited me to Mascot Hotel in Thiruvananthapuram, but I did not go. On the day I was arrested, Abdullakutty messaged me pleading not to reveal his name,&#8221; said Nair.</p>
<p>She said the young Congress legislator had called her to install solar power solution in his constituency in Kannur.</p>
<p>&#8220;After I gave my telephone number, he repeatedly made indecent calls even late night. As a lady, I cant say what Abdullakutty spoke to me,&#8221; said Nair.</p>
<p>Nair also charged the Congress leaders from Kerala of gender discrimination.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Kerala, women cannot run business. If I give my phone number to a leader, that night I would not get any sleep due to their repeated calls. They want me to meet their many demands. Even if such demands are met, the support for business would not come. This is what I experienced from leaders from north to south of Kerala,&#8221; said Nair.</p>
<p>Nair promised to reveal more details in the next few days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the leaders understand the stress and pain, which I had gone through in recent months. I will reveal further details against more leaders in the coming days. There are many things that I cannot disclose due to the subject&#8217;s nature. I had lost sleep for many months. Let these leaders lose their sleep,&#8221; said Nair.</p>
<p>The solar scam had rocked Kerala for several months last year after Nair&#8217;s arrest. She, along with co-accused Biju Radhakrishnan, had cheated many investors by promising to make them promoters of wind mill farms and install solar power solutions.</p>
<p>Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy’s three personal aides had lost their jobs over their close links with Nair.</p>
<p>Her phone call details showed that several Congress leaders, ministers in Centre and Kerala, were constantly in touch with Nair. It was learnt that the ministers had made calls to Nair at odd hours.</p>
<p>Refuting Nair&#8217;s allegations, Abdullakutty on Monday told the media that it was a bid to spoil his political career. But, he refused to speak further on the charges.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998156&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Union Minister V Narayanasamy on Monday charged the BJP with not being interested in halting corruption as it had not supported the passage of an amendment Bill to the Prevention of Corruption Act in Parliament.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the principal opposition party, the BJP should have supported the anti-corruption [amendment bill&#8230; but it did not&#8230;I feel the party is not interested in stymieing corruption,&#8221; the Minister of State in PMO told reporters.</p>
<p>Stating that the Judicial Accountability Bill and The Right of Citizens for Time Bound Delivery of Goods and Services and Redressal of their Grievances Bill were also scuttled, he alleged that the BJP was now posing obstacles for the ordinance route as well.</p>
<p>On the fishermen&#8217;s issue, he expressed the hope that the proposed second round of talks between fishermen of Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka on March 13 would be fruitful.</p>
<p>To another question, he said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may meet Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa &#8220;only on the sidelines&#8221; of the BIMSTEC summit at Mayanmar and not exclusively.</p>
<p>Singh left for the Myanmarese capital Nay Pyi-Taw today to attend the summit, making a strong push to intensify collective efforts to combat security challenges and enhancing connectivity and trade in the region.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998155&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A preliminary<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/navy-sets-up-high-level-probe-in-submarine-mishap/" target="_blank"> probe</a> into the accident on board the INS Sindhuratna, in which two officers died last week, has ruled out any problems with the battery of the submarine and has found that the cables in the sailors’ accommodation have been burnt down, pointing to a possible short circuit.</span></p>
<p>While the initial assessment was that a battery pit fire had caused heavy smoke in compartment number 3 of the submarine following which all sailors had to be evacuated, a detailed inspection has revealed that all batteries are undamaged and fully functional.</p>
<p>“An inspection has found that the smoke was emanating from the sailors accommodation that is located just above the battery pit. We also found that certain cables in this accommodation have been burnt down, including some tiles and other equipment,” a Navy officer said.</p>
<p>It is believed that the heavy smoke that was observed in the compartment came from the gutting of these cables, possibly due to a short circuit. As soon as it was detected, the compartment was sealed and the fire extinguishing system was activated. The heroic action of the two officers — Lt Commanders Kapish Muwal and Manoranjan Kumar — who died on board, is believed to have saved many lives on board the submarine. Officials said the two officers rushed to the compartment as soon as alarm bells went out and ordered an evacuation.</p>
<p>Following the evacuation, they sealed the compartment and manned a battery-monitoring station near the sailors accommodation as a battery problem was suspected to have been the reason for the smoke. The duo are believed to have died at the monitoring station after the fire extinguishing system was activated that effectively sucks the entire oxygen of the compartment to put out the fire. Investigations in the accident are still on by a Rear Admiral-led board of officers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998424&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arun-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997743" alt="Arun Jaitley said the assurance offered by the Congress to Kumar was more political than linked to the economic necessities of Bihar. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arun-main.jpg" /></a> Arun Jaitley said the assurance offered by the Congress to Kumar was more political than linked to the economic necessities of Bihar. (PTI)
<p>As Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar frowned at the Centre, BJP on Monday took a dig at him, saying he was led up the &#8220;garden path&#8221; by Congress on the issue of special status and hinted that this had led to its split with BJP.</p>
<p>Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said the assurance offered by the Congress to Kumar was more political than linked to the economic necessities of Bihar and the special status did not come once the JD(U) was on its own after breaking up with BJP.</p>
<p>&#8220;The UPA&#8217;s intention was to lead JD(U) up the garden path that the special category status to Bihar was indeed coming. I do not know how the astute leadership of JD(U) fell for this,&#8221; he wrote on his blog.</p>
<p>His statement came a day after Kumar staged a day-long protest in Patna against the Centre&#8217;s failure to grant special category status to Bihar.</p>
<p>Hinting that the promise had prompted Kumar to part ways with BJP, Jaitley said, &#8220;Coincidentally the signalling towards this special category status was also at the same time when the JD(U)-BJP split took place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once the JD(U) was on its own, the special category status did not come, the BJP leader said.</p>
<p>Taking a swipe, he said, &#8220;in the &#8216;swayamvar&#8217; (process of choosing a life partner from among many) between Lalu Prasad-led RJD and JD(U), the Congress party preferred its old ally (RJD).&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing reports that Congress and JD(U) may consider an alliance after the talks between Congress and RJD have somewhat stalemated, Jaitley said Congress has already double-crossed JD(U) on special category status.</p>
<p>The JD(U)-BJP government in Bihar had repeatedly demanded the special category status and there is a near consesus on the issue among political parties in the state, he said.</p>
<p>He also appeared to support the similar demand from other states in eastern India like Odisha and West Bengal, saying they have not economically progressed in comparison to others and suffered from natural disadvantages.</p>
<p>BJD and Trinamool Congress have been pressing for special status for Odisha and West Bengal, respectively.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997736&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two political parties having two members in the Jharkhand Assembly merged with the Trinamool Congress here on Monday.</p>
<p>The Jharkhand Janadhikar Manch (JJM) with its MLA Bandhu Tirkey and the Rastriya Kalyan Pakshya (RKP) with its MLA Chamra Linda merged with the TMC in the presence of former Railway Minister and TMC General Secretary Mukul Roy. &#8220;With the merger of two recognised political parties having their MLAs, the TMC now has presence in the Jharkhand Assembly,&#8221; Roy told a press conference after the merger here.</p>
<p>Along with Congress and RJD, both the MLAs are currently supporting the ruling Hemant Soren government in the state. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to support the government. We&#8217;ll also request Assembly Speaker Shashank Sekhar Bhokta to allot us a separate place on the ruling side,&#8221; Tirkey said.</p>
<p>Lalu Soren, younger brother of JMM chief Shibu Soren, has also joined the TMC, Roy said. &#8220;With the joining of these leaders, TMC has become stronger. We have not yet decided how many seats to contest in the Lok Sabha, though we have kept the option open to contest all the 14 seats in Jharkhand,&#8221; Roy said when asked whether Tirkey and Linda would contest Lok Sabha poll.</p>
<p>To a question, Roy said his party was not surprised that the Ramvilas Paswan led Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) had joined the NDA. &#8220;It has not surprised us. But, we are maintaining equal distance from the Congress and the BJP,&#8221; Roy said. Both TMC president and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Paswan had been ministers in the erstwhile NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997724&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p># Modi slams Nitish, says Bihar government has no answers that&#8217;s why they keep talking about secularism.</p>
<p># From plights of the farmers to inflation and poverty, our rivals blame everything on secularism: Modi.</p>
<p># Nitish government is soft towards terrorism: BJP&#8217;s PM candidate.</p>
<p># There should not be politics on terror, parties should bury differences to fight it: Modi</p>

<p>Muzaffarpur Lok Sabha seat is at present represented by Jainarain Nishad of JD(U). After October 27 rally which was rocked by serial bomb blasts triggered by Indian Mujahideen terrorists, Modi had returned to Bihar on November 3 last year to condole death of six citizens killed in the explosions.</p>
<p>Modi revisit to the state is bound to trigger hot political debate among parties in the state in days to come. BJP and Narendra Modi is paying special attention on Bihar with 40 Lok Sabha seats.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/farooqabdullahm.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1981780" alt="FAROOQABDULLAHM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/farooqabdullahm.jpg" /></a> &#8220;Kashmiri (people of Kashmir) are not only thieves, but <em>maha chor</em> (biggest thieves),&#8221; said Farooq.
<p>Opposition PDP MLAs created a ruckus, disrupting question hour in the Legislative Assembly on Monday in protest over Union Minister Farooq Abdullah&#8217;s statement that Kashmiris were the biggest thieves in respect to power theft in India.</p>
<p>Farooq, who is the father of Jammu &amp; Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, was speaking at a function in Delhi on Sunday over the issue of power theft in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kashmiri (people of Kashmir) are not only thieves, but <em>maha chor</em> (biggest thieves),&#8221; said Farooq.</p>
<p>Trouble erupted in the Legislative Assembly immediately after the House assembled on Monday morning. The opposition PDP MLAs were soon on their feet, drawing the Speaker&#8217;s attention towards Farooq Abdullah&#8217;s statement and sought an apology from him.They also sought adjournment of question hour to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>The Speaker&#8217;s repeated requests that the union minister is not a member of the House fell on deaf ears as angry PDP legislators stormed into the well of the House, raising slogans against Abdullah. Though the Speaker continued with the question hour, nothing was audible in the commotion caused by the agitating opposition members.</p>
<p>The PDP MLAs continued to raise slogans for over half an hour, and later staged a walk out from the House. However, before leaving the house, some of them had heated exchanges with Higher Education Minister Mohammad Akbar Lone and National Congress MLA Surjeet Singh Slathia.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Farooq has come under criticism for his statements. Last year, Farooq faced fire for a controversial comment against women.</p>
<p>Farooq had said that men were scared to talk to women as they feared that they may end up in jail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m scared to talk to a woman these days. I don&#8217;t even want to keep a female secretary. Who knows, I might end up in jail because of a complaint. No, I&#8217;m not blaming the girls, I&#8217;m blaming the society itself. The society has reached this point where now after one direction, it&#8217;s putting pressure on everyone,&#8221; said Farooq, commenting on the former Supreme Court judge AK Ganguly sexual harassment case.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997675&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>A special CBI court on Monday fixed April 4 for recording the statements of accused, including former<a title="2G case: SC issues contempt notice against Sahara chief Subrata Roy,others" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/2g-case-sc-issues-contempt-notice-against-sahara-chief-subrata-roy-others/" target="_blank"> Telecom </a><a title="2G case: SC issues contempt notice against Sahara chief Subrata Roy,others" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/2g-case-sc-issues-contempt-notice-against-sahara-chief-subrata-roy-others/" target="_blank">Minister A Raja</a>, DMK MP Kanimozhi and some top corporates executives, in the 2G spectrum case.</p>
<p>Special CBI Judge O P Saini, who was scheduled to record the statements of the accused on Monday, posted it for April 4, saying &#8220;only half of the work is over&#8221; as preparing questions to be asked from the accused was a lengthy process. The judge, however, said he would give sets of questions to the accused on April 4 so that they could file their written response within a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other case (against promoters of Essar Group and Loop Telecom) is also listed for April 4. I will be done (preparing the questions) by then in both the cases. I will give the questions to both the parties and they will submit their written replies within one week,&#8221; the judge said.</p>
<p>The special judge also said, &#8220;I am trying to prepare the questions in such a manner that your (accused) work will be done in half-an-hour.&#8221; The court had on November 27, 2013, concluded recording of statements of CBI witnesses in the case after the deposition of CBI&#8217;s Superintendent of Police Vivek Priyadarshi, the chief investigating officer, got over.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mohan-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997656" alt="Singh stressed that India's bilateral relations with BIMSTEC countries are among its most important in the world. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mohan-main.jpg" /></a> Singh stressed that India&#8217;s bilateral relations with BIMSTEC countries are among its most important in the world. (Reuters)
<p>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh left for Myanmar on Monday to attend the BIMSTEC Summit, making a strong push for intensifying collective efforts to combat security challenges and enhancing connectivity and trade in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security challenges both natural and man-made, require our collective vision and determination to be overcome,&#8221; Singh said in a statement before his departure for the Myanmarese capital, Nay Pyi-Taw.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the security sphere, we have steadily put in place enabling legal instruments for regional approaches to international terrorism, transnational crime, drug trafficking and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, the need for which is more salient in today&#8217;s integrated world than ever before,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Singh said the BIMSTEC lay at the crossroads between SAARC and ASEAN, drawing its energy from the natural convergence of the countries around the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Connectivity and sub-regional cooperation in trade and investment, energy, climate, tourism, agriculture and other areas provide the spark for the growth engine in our region,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister stressed that peace, stability and development in BIMSTEC countries, with over 20 per cent of the world&#8217;s population and over USD 2.5 trillion worth of GDP, was &#8216;indispensable&#8217;, for the forward march of Asia as a whole.</p>
<p>BIMSTEC has evolved and matured further as a group since the last summit in New Delhi in 2008, he said.</p>
<p>Singh stressed that India&#8217;s bilateral relations with BIMSTEC countries are among its most important in the world.</p>
<p>On the sidelines of the two-day summit, he hopes to exchange notes with leaders from other Member states, whom he described as &#8216;close and friendly neighbours of India&#8217;.</p>
<p>With the impending establishment of a Permanent Secretariat in Dhaka and appointment of a Secretary General, BIMSTEC is poised to play a more active role in regional integration and cooperation, he said.</p>
<p>Several BIMSTEC centres are being launched throughout the region, including three in India, to foster greater technical exchanges between member countries, he said.</p>
<p>During the summit to be attended by leaders from seven countries including India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Bhutan and Nepal, Singh is expected to make a strong pitch for giving a fillip to India&#8217;s Look East policy and explore ways to enhance connectivity, transport, trade, tourism and other linkages to all the northeastern states.</p>
<p>In what could be his last foreign trip as Prime Minister in this tenure, Singh is likely to use his two-day visit to renew contacts with leaders of the seven-member Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) which will hold its summit in Nay Pyi Taw tomorrow.</p>
<p>One cannot underestimate the potential of BIMSTEC in bringing the fruits of these cross connectivity linkages to the northeastern states, says Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh.</p>
<p>With some sticky issues still to be resolved, it may take some time for the grouping to wrap up a free trade pact.</p>
<p>&#8220;FTA negotiations are processes that take time. The BIMSTEC negotiation is particularly complex because it already encompasses countries which have FTA under the SAFTA process, and then you have other countries that belong to ASEAN. Taking all this into account, we have to arrive at an outcome that is optimal for India as well as for them. So, this is going to take some time,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>A Framework Agreement for BIMSTEC Free Trade Area was signed in Phuket, Thailand in February, 2004, which commits the parties to negotiate FTAs in goods, services and investments.</p>
<p>An agreement on Trade in Goods and other provisions relating to rules of origin, operational certification procedures and pact on Customs cooperation was finalised in June, 2009. India has exchanged its tariff preference schedules with member countries.</p>
<p>Leaders at the upcoming meeting are expected to ink pacts on setting up of BIMSTEC Centre on Weather and Climate in India and Cultural Industries Observatory in Bhutan besides establishment of the permanent secretariat in Dhaka for which India has pledged contribution of 32 per cent of annual expenditure incurred there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our stakes in BIMSTEC are significant and will grow further as the grouping matures,&#8221; the Foreign Secretary stressed.</p>
<p>The summit will be preceded by ministerial meeting which will be attended by External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid and at the senior official level by the Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p>During the visit, the Prime Minister will have bilateral meetings with Sri Lankan President Mahindra Rajapaksa, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and other leaders.</p>
<p>His talks with Rajapaksa takes place three months after he had skipped a visit to the island nation to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) due to pressure from Tamil parties and within government.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has rejected a call by the UN for an independent international probe into allegations of war crimes.</p>
<p>Colombo has come under increasing international pressure to probe allegations of excessive civilian deaths during the final battle that ended in May 2009. A crucial UN Human Rights Council resolution on Sri Lanka is coming up for vote in Geneva this month.</p>
<p>Last Monday, the UN had called for an independent international probe into allegations of war crimes in Sri Lanka during the final battle with the LTTE, prompting an angry reaction from Colombo which rejected the demand and slammed it as &#8220;unwarranted interference&#8221;.</p>
<p>Singh&#8217;s meeting with Hasina comes in the backdrop of delay in signing the long-pending agreements on Teesta river water sharing treaty and India&#8217;s ratification of land boundary agreement with that country.</p>
<p>This will also be Singh&#8217;s first meeting with Hasina after her party Awami League coasted to a landslide victory in the January 5 parliamentary election, bagging 231 seats in the face of a boycott by BNP-led 18-party opposition alliance.</p>
<p>The talks are expected to touch on the agreement on Teesta river treaty which was put on hold after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had expressed reservation over the quantum of water to be given to Bangladesh and had opted out of Singh&#8217;s entourage to Dhaka in September, 2011.</p>
<p>Singh, who is travelling to Myanmar after a gap of nearly two years, the last being a bilateral visit in 2012, will also be holding talks with the leadership in that country.</p>
<p>The Summit is also expected to discuss steps to bolster cooperation in counter-terrorism. India has led negotiations and finalised the BIMSTEC Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.</p>
<p>India also wishes to see BIMSTEC promote economic and energy cooperation, encourage cultural links and strengthen security contacts.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997650&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/express5_march03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997477" alt="Express5_March03" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/express5_march03.jpg" /></a> HAL&#8217;s deal under scanner, pending requests with Delhi Police and many more &#8211; five must-read stories of Indian Express.
<p>We bring you the five best stories of the Indian Express you must read before beginning your day.</p>
<p><strong>1. HAL&#8217;s deal under scanner:</strong> The inquiry has been ordered into alleged irregularities in purchases made over a four-year period, starting 2007, from the UK-based firm. The engines were procured for the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer (AJT) that is being produced by HAL for the Air Force and Navy. <a title="Defence Ministry orders CBI probe into purchase of Rolls Royce engines by HAL" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/defence-ministry-orders-cbi-probe-into-purchase-of-rolls-royce-engines-by-hal/" target="_blank">Defence Ministry orders CBI probe into purchase of Rolls Royce engines by HAL</a>, reports Manu Pubby<br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/antony.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994491" alt="Antony" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/antony.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. JD(U) deserts Congerss:</strong> The JD(U) has ruled out an alliance with the Congress, saying it cannot resort to “political opportunism” and desert the non-Congress and non-BJP front it recently formed. The rejection further limits the Congress’s options in Bihar, with Ram Vilas Paswan having already walked out and the RJD getting restless as a “deadline” by it to decide on an alliance passed Sunday. Santosh Singh gives details in <a title="JD(U) rules out tie-up, Lalu starts own campaign, clock ticks down for Congress" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/jdu-rules-out-tie-up-lalu-starts-own-campaign-clock-ticks-down-for-congress/" target="_blank">JD(U) rules out tie-up, clock ticks down for Congress</a><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nitish-480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996901" alt="nitish-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nitish-480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.  Lapse undetected:</strong> Over 600 complaints regarding the Delhi Police forwarded by the Central Vigilance Commission to an online portal have been pending for the past eight years. The reason: the Delhi Police didn’t know the password to access the portal or how to operate it, a lapse that went undetected since 2006. <a title="Vigilance complaints pile up as Delhi Police doesn’t know password" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/vigilance-complaints-pile-up-as-delhi-police-doesnt-know-password/" target="_blank">Vigilance complaints pile up as Delhi Police doesn’t know password</a>, a report by Shalini Narayan<br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/delhipolice.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1997465" alt="delhipolice" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/delhipolice.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Opinion:</strong> When some Indian bureaucrats have argued in favour of a closed capital account at international forums, they have faced amusement from the audience. No country has taken this idea seriously. This so-called “lesson from the global financial crisis” is something no one is interested in learning. Ila Patnaik writes on how a closed capital account is not a real option in <a title="No escape from freedom" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/no-escape-from-freedom/" target="_blank">No escape from freedom</a><br />
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rbi-m.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1997466" alt="rbi-m" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rbi-m.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a><strong></p>
<p>5. Market watch:</strong> In the four-year period between April 1993 and March 1997, as many as 4,005 companies entered the capital markets with their initial public offerings (IPOs) to raise an aggregate of Rs 41,319 crore. The IPOs accounted for more than 9 per cent of the average market capitalisation of Bombay Stock Exchange over the four-year period. <a title="Sebi wants monitoring agency to keep an eye on all IPO funds" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/sebi-wants-monitoring-agency-to-keep-an-eye-on-all-ipo-funds/" target="_blank">Sebi wants monitoring agency to keep an eye on all IPO funds</a>, special reporty by Sandeep Singh<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pm-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997448" alt="Manmohan Singh's Myanmar trip would be an attempt to renew contacts with leaders of the Bay of Bengal. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pm-main.jpg" /></a> Manmohan Singh&#8217;s Myanmar trip would be an attempt to renew contacts with leaders of the Bay of Bengal. (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Risisng from the Burmese jungles, imperial Nay Pyi Taw, now in its eighth year, remains one of the loneliest capitals in the world.</span></p>
<p>But for two days beginning Monday, it will be busy hosting heads of seven governments, each carrying the cares and worries of home to a summit that seeks to marry India’s <a title="Visits to give Look East policy new depth,says Manmohan" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/visits-to-give-look-east-policy-new-depth-says-manmohan/">Look East policy</a> with Thailand’s Look West for the growth of the region.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who heads out for the Myanmarese capital Monday morning on what should be his last official trip abroad, will renew contacts with leaders of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) and push for better connectivity to the North-East, India’s gateway to the regional grouping.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters ahead of the third <a title="Manmohan to visit Myanmar in May" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/manmohan-to-visit-myanmar-in-may/">BIMSTEC Summit</a>, Foreign Secretary Sujatha Singh underlined the importance of the grouping in bringing transport, trade, tourism and other investment linkages to the North-East: “Our stakes in BIMSTEC are significant and will grow further as the grouping matures&#8230; It is in our interest to make sure that our North-East does not fall behind, that it develops in a manner commensurate with its potential.”</p>
<p>Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand make the BIMSTEC club, home to one-fifth of the world’s population and some of the poorest, with energy and mineral reserves that promise a future if governments fast-track growth and cut red tape.</p>
<p>A framework agreement for the BIMSTEC Free Trade Area was signed in Phuket,  <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Thailand, in February 2004, committing parties to negotiate FTAs in goods, services and investments. But that pact is still some time away.</span></p>
<p>“FTA negotiations are processes that take time. The BIMSTEC negotiation is particularly complex because it already encompasses countries which have FTA under the SAFTA process, and then you have other countries that belong to ASEAN,” Secretary Singh said.</p>
<p>In Nay Pyi Taw, the PM will hold bilateral meetings with his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina and President Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka on the summit margins.</p>
<p>Last November, Singh had given in to pressure from his own Congress party and Tamil parties and had not travelled to Colombo where Sri Lanka was hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).</p>
<p>His meeting with Rajapaksa comes at a time when Sri Lanka, rejecting calls for an international probe into allegations of war crimes during the final battle with Tamil Tigers in 2009, has expressed anger over a United Nations Human Rights Council resolution that will be put to vote in Geneva later this month.</p>
<p>On Friday, Rajapaksa told mediapersons in Colombo that he was “uncomfortable” with the development and “there should have been no resolution”. When he was asked how he thought India would vote, he said he couldn’t tell because India was headed to elections and the “mood of the electorate” had to be factored in by leaders. But he did add “politicians understand each other”.</p>
<p>Sheikh Hasina knows Singh will not be in office when they meet next. She will want to discuss the future of an agreement on sharing the Teesta water, scuttled by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. The delay over the ratification of the land boundary agreement may also come up.</p>
<p>Host Thein Sein, who stunned the world with the pace with which he opened up Myanmar after decades of isolation and military rule, will be meeting Singh at home for the second time in two years. He has his own set of worries, especially in the Rakhine state which has been wracked by sectarian violence between Buddhists and the stateless Rohingya Muslims.</p>
<p>There’s no word yet whether Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, who is fighting for political survival in Thailand, will make it to Nay Pyi Taw.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1997359 " alt="The order for an inquiry comes two weeks after arms dealer Sudhir Choudhrie and his son were arrested." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rolls2.jpg" /> The engines were procured for the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer (AJT) that is being produced by HAL for the Air Force and Navy.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Defence Ministry has ordered a CBI inquiry into the purchase of <a title="And now,green aeroplanes" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/and-now-green-aeroplanes/">aero engines</a> by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) from Rolls Royce, putting one of the world’s largest defence and aerospace companies under the scanner.</span></p>
<p>The inquiry has been ordered into alleged irregularities in purchases made over a four-year period, starting 2007, from the UK-based firm.</p>
<p>The order for an inquiry comes two weeks after arms dealer Sudhir Choudhrie and his son were arrested by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in the UK, which is probing serious <a title="Arms dealer Choudhrie held in London" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/arms-dealer-choudhrie-held-in-london/">bribery allegations</a> in the sale of Rolls Royce engines in Asia.</p>
<p>Sources in the Defence Ministry said that the CBI probe was ordered after complaints alleged discrepancies in the contract for engines, and charged officials in HAL and the Defence Ministry with taking bribes.</p>
<p>The engines were procured for the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer (AJT) that is being produced by HAL for the Air Force and Navy.</p>
<p>Rolls Royce has not yet commented on the Indian inquiry.</p>
<p>Sources said the allegations were probed by the chief vigilance officer of HAL, and a preliminary report shared with the Defence Ministry. With the report indicating that the charges were serious and had some basis, the ministry decided to order a CBI inquiry.</p>
<p>Choudhrie had been briefly arrested by the SFO in London and questioned on his association with Rolls Royce. The firm is under investigation for several deals, including sales in China and Indonesia.</p>
<p>While it is still not clear if the Indian investigation is linked to the SFO probe, the CBI has already sought information about Choudhrie’s arrest from their counterparts in the UK. The Enforcement Directorate, which is investigating the arms dealer’s money transactions, has also roped in the Customs Overseas Intelligence Network.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997259&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aap-up-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997481" alt="While Kejriwal himself said nothing on the matter, there were clear indications that he would fight the Lok Sabha elections against Modi. PTI" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aap-up-main.jpg" /></a> While Kejriwal himself said nothing on the matter, there were clear indications that he would fight the Lok Sabha elections against Modi. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In his first rally in Uttar Pradesh, Arvind Kejriwal launched a no-holds-barred attack on BJP prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi on Sunday. Rubbishing talk of a Modi wave, Kejriwal said he expected the <a title="Arvind Kejriwal could fight from Varanasi if Modi contests seat: AAP" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/arvind-kejriwal-could-fight-from-varanasi-if-modi-contests-seat-aap/">Aam Aadmi Party</a> to get more than 100 seats in the coming Lok Sabha polls, and said that no government would be formed without AAP.</span></p>
<p>While Kejriwal himself said nothing on the matter, there were clear indications that he would fight the <a title="Modi, Rahul and Kejriwal head to Uttar Pradesh for rally weekend" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/modi-rahul-and-kejriwal-head-to-uttar-pradesh-for-rally-weekend/">Lok Sabha elections</a> against Modi. Three AAP stalwarts called on him from the stage to contest against Modi from Varanasi, in what sources said was an attempt to force the Gujarat Chief Minister’s hand.</p>
<p>Sources said that Kejriwal would only make his announcement once Modi clarifies his stand, but confirmed that the BJP leader was the party’s principal opponent. “Modi will now either have to contest from Varanasi, or find a good reason to stand from somewhere else. Or he will be accused of being afraid,” sources said.</p>
<p>In another indication of its gameplan for Uttar Pradesh, AAP Sunday inducted influential Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Rushaid, a member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, and several members of the AMU Old Boys’ Association at the rally. Rushaid, who spoke of Kejriwal in glowing terms, was the only man the AAP leader introduced and hugged on the stage.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Attacking Mayawati for allying with the BJP in the past, Kejriwal asked Muslims to choose AAP. “If you vote for the BSP, you are voting for the BJP. Don’t make that mistake. And Mulayam Singh will join whoever has the most seats, because he needs the government’s protection in the CBI cases against him,” he said.</span></p>
<p>The AAP rally also mentioned the Samajwadi Party government’s record with regard to communal tension, with Kejriwal talking of more than a hundred riots in Uttar Pradesh in two years. “I believe that all riots are engineered. I promise you that if one impartial invesigating agency looks into them, and one political lynchpin is caught, riots will stop.”</p>
<p>Amid loud cheers from the nearly 20,000 people gathered at Kanpur’s waterlogged Ramlila Maidan, Kejriwal said that he will travel through Gujarat for four days to “see Modi’s claims of development for himself”. “Hum bhi to dekhen Gujarat ko (I should also see the development in Gujarat)! If there is that much development, then we will learn and apply those methods in Delhi and in Uttar Pradesh. But if it’s not true, then the blindfold will have to be taken off.”</p>
<p>Having arrived at Kanpur after a roadshow across 17 parliamentary constituencies in Uttar Pradesh, Kejriwal dismissed the notion of a “Modi wave”. “When we left Ghaziabad, people said there is a Modi hawa. I went to Haryana and have travelled in Uttar Pradesh. Bas TV channelon mein hawa hai (the wave is only in TV channels). But the truth is that TV channels are being paid for opinion polls. It is true there is a hawa, but it is not a Modi hawa. This is only the media’s badmaashi. When we won the elections in Delhi, it wasn’t our victory, it was an expression of anger. That is the wave — anger among the people. “</p>
<p>Kejriwal claimed that visiting Haryana and Uttar Pradesh had also made him believe that an AAP government at the Centre was a possibility. “I know that we can have an AAP government. This much is clear, that we will get more than the Congress, they will be left with nothing. In Uttar Pradesh, they will only get six to seven seats. But we will get at least a 100 seats overall and no government can be formed without AAP,” he said.</p>
<p>Attacking Modi’s economics, Kejriwal said, “Modi had come to Delhi to speak about his economic policy. The BJP earlier used to say no FDI in kirana. The Congress had taken money from Walmart, but the BJP used to oppose this. But look, now Modi stays quiet on FDI in retail. It must mean that Walmart ka paisa has reached him too.”</p>
<p>Kejriwal also repeated his charges regarding Mukesh Ambani and Modi, saying, “People told me that Modiji is good. I wrote him a letter and asked him that if you are PM, would you allow Ambani to sell gas at $8 when it actually costs $1. Modi hasn’t even responded. If he doesn’t even acknowledge me, how will he help you?”</p>
<p>Hinting at a Modi versus Kejriwal electoral battle, Manish Sisodia also took on the Reliance chairman, saying, “If Narendra Modi doesn’t answer questions on Mukesh Ambani and the increase in gas prices, how should we ask him? We have heard that he is going to Benaras. Do you think Arvind should ask him there?”</p>
<p>Later, AAP national executive member and the party’s face in Uttar Pradesh Sanjay Singh made a direct request to Kejriwal. “I want to put this proposal before all of you that Arvindji should save our country. He should fight against Narendra Modi from Benaras,” Singh said.</p>
<p>Kumar Vishwas, who is contesting against Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi from Amethi, repeated the demand. “I want Arvindji to come to Amethi and help me. I will come to Benaras, but you must come too,” Vishwas said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997251&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The <a title="Won’t return to NDA even if Narendra Modi is not PM candidate: JD(U)" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/wont-return-to-nda-even-if-narendra-modi-is-not-pm-candidate-jdu/" target="_blank">JD(U)</a> has ruled out an alliance with the Congress, saying it cannot resort to “political opportunism” and desert the non-Congress and non-BJP front it recently formed.</span></p>
<p>The rejection further limits the Congress’s options in Bihar, with <a title="BJP gets its first new ally as Ram Vilas Paswan returns to NDA fold" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/lok-sabha-polls-ram-vilas-paswan-returns-to-nda-as-bjp-ljp-agree-on-seat-sharing/" target="_blank">Ram Vilas Paswan</a> having already walked out and the RJD getting restless as a “deadline” by it to decide on an alliance passed Sunday. The stalemate over their talks continues, with the RJD offering the Congress 11 seats and the party insisting on 13. The two also disagree over the seats the Congress should get.</p>
<p>The Congress had approached Bihar Chief Minister <a title="Ram Vilas Paswan has no ideology, BJP-LJP alliance ‘unprincipled’: Nitish Kumar" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/ram-vilas-paswan-bjp-ljp-alliance-unprincipled-nitish-kumar/" target="_blank">Nitish Kumar</a>, promising to “push” his special category status demand for the state in exchange for an alliance. Sources said the JD(U) asked the Congress to move the Bihar special status demand file with Seemandhra’s if it really cared for the state. “It is too late now for an alliance with the Congress. We are the prime mover behind the 11-party non-Congress and non-BJP front. Even if the Congress offers special status, we may not change our stance now,” said a JD(U) leader close to Nitish Kumar.</p>
<p>Admitting a stalemate with the RJD, a Congress leader said: “We may settle for even 11 seats provided we are offered Madhubani, Sitamarhi, Nawada, Jhanjharpur and Motihari. But the RJD is offering us reserved seats. How can we fight the BJP if we do not have even some upper caste-dominated seats?”</p>
<p>The Congress believes that the RJD has more to lose. “We fought alone last time and managed to win two seats. We can only improve even if we fight alone. It is the RJD that has to decide whether it can afford fragmentation of secular votes,” said a source.</p>
<p>RJD chief Lalu Prasad gave some indication Sunday of a softening of stand, saying communal forces should be kept at bay. Party leaders also hinted at accommodating a few of the Congress demands, including conceding the Khagaria seat. However, there was no response from the Congress leadership till late evening.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997240&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rahul.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997422" alt="Although the Cabinet could meet once more before the code of conduct kicks in, the government wouldn’t propose any ordinance whatsoever, sources said. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rahul.jpg" /></a> Although the Cabinet could meet once more before the code of conduct kicks in, the government wouldn’t propose any ordinance whatsoever, sources said. (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">For once, legal and propriety issues outweighed <a title="Cabinet rejects Rahul Gandhi’s ordinance agenda, clears Jat reservation" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/cabinet-rejects-rahul-gandhis-ordinance-agenda-clears-jat-reservation/">Rahul Gandhi</a>’s clout in the <a title="UPA government gets BJP support for tabling Bangla Bill" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/upa-government-gets-bjp-support-for-tabling-bangla-bill/">UPA government</a> as the Union Cabinet on Sunday dropped plans to bring the <a title="Rahul ordinances: Unsure of what President may do, govt in a huddle" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/enthusiasm-over-government-may-not-go-ahead-with-ordinances-pushed-by-rahul/">anti-corruption ordinances</a> he was pushing. </span></p>
<p>President Pranab Mukherjee weighed in to change the government’s mind, conveying his strong disapproval of the move to ministers who called on him earlier in the day to get him on board, according to sources.</p>
<p>While the ordinances were not formally placed as an agenda item at Sunday’s Cabinet meeting, they came up in the course of discussions. “It was generally felt that the normal legislative route should be followed in the case of anti-corruption legislations, primarily because they require a full-fledged debate by Parliament,” said a source present at the meeting.</p>
<p>Sources added that although the Cabinet could meet once more before the code of conduct kicks in, the government wouldn’t propose any ordinance whatsoever.</p>
<p>Apart from the propriety of bringing ordinances on poll-eve, said sources, Mukherjee also pointed out some “technical” issues. The fact that this government would bring an ordinance when 15th Lok Sabha is still alive and then leave it for the next government and the next Lok Sabha to ratify it was not considered proper. The President was said to have discussed all these aspects with Law Minister Kapil Sibal and Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde <span style="line-height:1.5em;">when they called on him.</span></p>
<p>After this meeting, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held consultations with senior ministers and party leaders, before finally deciding to drop the ordinance plan, to avoid the possible embarrassment of seeing Rashtrapati Bhavan sit over the ordinances.</p>
<p>These issues had been flagged at the Congress core group meeting on Friday evening as well, with the Law Ministry expressing reservations over the “urgency” for ordinances on the eve of general elections. However, the top guns of the government had then chosen to put these concerns aside in deference to Rahul’s wish.</p>
<p>A section of the ruling Congress also believes that the indelible image of the UPA government bending and crawling to the Congress vice-president’s whims and fancies would only harm the party in the forthcoming elections. Rather than emerging as a leader who could question, defy and deride the system that was developed and nurtured even by his mother Sonia Gandhi — as planned and projected — Rahul, said sources, was coming across as an “irresponsible leader who loved to show off his authority even at the expense of the Prime Minister’s, a leader who would tear an ordinance on convicted lawmakers one day and shake hands with Lalu Prasad the next day”.</p>
<p>“These anti-corruption ordinances, if promulgated, would have badly boomeranged on Rahul and the entire Congress. (Narendra) Modi, I am sure, would have loved to see the Cabinet toeing Rahul’s line once again,” said a senior Congress leader and minister.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997229&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Five months after he filed a police complaint apprehending threat to his life, an activist who had raised voice against alleged misuse of government funds in development works in his village, was shot dead in the Ikauna police station area of Shravasti district late Saturday evening. </span></p>
<p>The police have arrested Jagdev, the husband of local pradhan Kusuma Devi, and his three associates in connection with the murder of Zakir,45. Another accused is absconding. The activist had told the police that he has filed complaints against alleged financial irregularities by the local pradhan, following which her husband had developed enmity with him. Zakir had collected the information through an RTI plea. The police then allegedly did not take action against Jagdev and instead served notice to Zakir five days ago asking him to submit personal bond for maintaining peace.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997224&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[This would allow for longer tenures of IAS officers as SDMs.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997221&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A Committee constituted by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has recommended that the total training period for IAS officers be brought down from two years (103 weeks) to one-and-a-half years (75 weeks), despite opposition from the director of the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration (LBSNAA) towards the move.</span></p>
<p>The Kiran Aggarwal Committee, tasked with reviewing the content and duration of induction training of IAS officers, has recommended reducing the district training from the current 54 weeks to 33 weeks “in view of the strong feedback received from recent batches of IAS officers about the relatively sub-optimal effectiveness of attachments in the district and the relatively higher utility of independent charges for on-the-job learning.”</p>
<p>It has been argued that, given the rising median age of IAS officer trainees (around 28 years), the training duration must be reduced as many enter service with significant work experience and less potential years of service.</p>
<p>Introduction of a structured mid-career training programme and opportunities to avail short-term refresher courses after four years of service have also been cited to back the case for the reduction in training period. It has also been argued that any reduction in training or probation period would be welcomed by state governments given the general shortage of junior-level IAS officers. This would allow for longer tenures of IAS officers as SDMs, the report says.</p>
<p>LBSNAA director Padamvir Singh has expressed reservations against the move. “I do not entirely endorse the decision to reduce the duration of training period from 2 years to 1.5 years or thereabouts,” he wrote in an email to Aggarwal in January.</p>
<p>“The reason is that the feedback received from various quarters has not pointed in any significant manner to the need to reduce the duration from 2 years. Even in our discussions with State Government, and ATI representative and pass-outs from recent batches, the general refrain was more towards improving the content and delivery of training and refocusing it to the needs of adult learning.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997221&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In what could be the first signs of a larger malaise within the party, JMM chief Shibu Soren’s younger brother Lalu Soren has joined the Trinamool Congress.</span></p>
<p>With that, the possibility of brothers contesting against each other for the Dumka Lok Sabha seat has come up, with TMC reportedly toying with the idea of fielding Lalu against sitting MP Shibu. Even otherwise, the fight for Santhal Parganas will be no walkover for the JMM, as the BJP has scheduled a Narendra Modi rally in Dumka on March 24.</p>
<p>Lalu, who was the JMM’s Bokaro district president, joined the TMC in Kolkata on February 27 in the presence of party general secretary Mukul Roy. He will be introduced to state-based TMC leaders in a meeting in Ranchi on Monday.</p>
<p>This is the third high-profile rift that the JMM has faced this year. In January, a large number of office-bearers of its frontal organisations had resigned from their positions alleging the party did not include them in its decision-making process. After elections to the Rajya Sabha last month, those of the Kurmi caste — led by three MLAs — rebelled. They were angry that the party had insulted Savita Mahato, from the family of one of the party’s co-founders, by offering her a seat and later turning her away.</p>
<p>The desertion of Lalu, who had been part of the Jharkhand movement since the beginning, will sting the party. “Lalu Soren got ambitious. People like this will come and go; the party will be unaffected,” said a JMM leader.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997212&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Candidates often choose to withhold “inconvenient information” while filing the mandatory affidavit along with their nomination papers for elections, but now it will not be viable. </span></p>
<p>The Election Commission of India has decided that a candidate will have to fill every column with relevant information while filing the affidavit. “A candidate who chooses to leave any column blank in the affidavit will be liable to be disqualified. We plan to enforce this in the coming Lok Sabha polls,” a top EC functionary told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>All Returning Officers (RO) have been asked to carefully scrutinise the affidavits when candidates file their nomination papers. “ROs will inform the candidate about it (incomplete affidavit) and provide him or her an opportunity to fill any column that may have been left blank. If a candidate fails to complete the affidavit, the nomination papers will be rejected,” a senior EC official explained.</p>
<p>Information relating to criminal background, assets, liabilities and educational qualifications are sought in the affidavit. “Past experience has shown that many candidates chose not to fill some of the columns they found inconvenient at times. The columns they chose to leave blank were often related to their educational qualifications, liabilities and the market value of their immovable properties. It was felt that by withholding such inputs, the candidates were denying the voters information that could be critical for them to make a right choice,” a senior EC official explained.</p>
<p>Most of the major political parties, including the Congress and the BJP, had expressed strong reservations against the move, but the EC rejected their arguments.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997211&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Polling in the Lok Sabha elections is likely to commence in the second week of April and may be spread over seven phases, the longest so far, highly placed sources in the Election Commission said on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>The probable dates for the commencement of polling are between April 7 and 10, the sources told PTI while emphasising that the poll schedule was still being “fine tuned”.</p>
<p>As of now, the plan is to have voting, involving over 81 crore voters, in seven phases but efforts are on to reduce that to six phases. The 2009 polls were held in five phases from April 16 to May 13.</p>
<p>The much-expected announcement of the schedule is expected in the middle of this week. The Model Code of Conduct for governments and political parties will come into force from the date of announcement. The EC has ruled out advancing the schedule or compressing it to avoid the summer heat, a demand put forward at the all-party meeting convened by the EC last month. The term of the current Lok Sabha expires on June 1 and the new House has to be constituted by May 31.</p>
<p>Along with the Lok Sabha polls, Andhra Pradesh, including the regions comprising the newly carved out Telangana, Orissa and Sikkim will go to polls to elect new assemblies.</p>
<p>The sources said finishing touches were being given to the schedule. Consultations with the Union Home Ministry, state governments, para-military forces and Chief Electoral Officers of states have already been completed.</p>
<p>There was speculation that the announcement may be slightly delayed for the Centre to promulgate some of the ordinances it plans to bring out against corruption and on some other issues but there is no confirmation of it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997209&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said NCP president Sharad Pawar has an old habit of standing on two stones — keeping his options of power politics open-ended. </span></p>
<p>He said that Pawar was weighing the option of keeping post-poll option open with NDA but was voted out by the alliance partners supporting the BJP. “Pawar wanted to mend his fences with NDA. So he held a meeting with BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. When we opposed he retracted and started calling Modi a ‘mass murderer’,” Thackeray told reporters at his residence Matoshree.</p>
<p>“When Pawar disclosed his meeting with Modi, even his party justified. But when it became evident that we were against the alliance, he took a U-turn and started finding faults with Modi. Pawar raked up Gujarat riots to malign Modi’s image,” he said.</p>
<p>Thackeray reiterated his party’s support to Modi as prime minister candidate. Interestingly, Sena had several times done flip-flops on Modi’s PM candidature through its mouthpiece Saamna. The Sena president wondered why Maharashtra farmers reeled under crisis even when they had the Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar representing them at the Centre. He said, “The maximum number of farmers suicides take place in Maharashtra despite Pawar heading the agriculture ministry.”</p>
<p>Taking a dig at Pawar, he said, “It appears he (Pawar) is more interested in contesting MCA polls and keeping away from Lok Sabha election. Why is he staying out of Lok Sabha elections?”</p>
<p>Thackeray also criticised the state government&#8217;s decision to regularise the slums till 2000 ahead of the polls.</p>
<p>NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said, “The Sena should explain its own flip flop on Modi before attacking NCP leaders. The NCP is committed to its secular politics. Pawar has explained he met Modi in the capacity of union agriculture minister meeting chief minister. There was nothing political about the meeting.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997194&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nitish-med1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985104" alt="The JD(U) refused to entertain any claim of the CPI(M), which wanted to fight Ujiarpur, Darbhanga and West Champaran." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nitish-med1.jpg" /></a> The JD(U) refused to entertain any claim of the CPI(M), which wanted to fight Ujiarpur, Darbhanga and West Champaran.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Janata Dal (United) has decided to leave two Lok Sabha constituencies for the CPI to contest in Bihar as part of its efforts to prop up an “alternative” front.</span></p>
<p>JD(U) secretary-general K C Tyagi told The Indian Express that two seats which CPI would contest are Begusarai and Banka. Begusarai is represented by Monazir Hassan of the JD(U).</p>
<p>It was a difficult decision for JD(U) leader and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to deny re-nomination to a sitting member, who is also from the minority community. But Begusarai was a stronghold of CPI, popularly known as Leningrad of Bihar.</p>
<p>The CPI had won Ballia seat (four of its Assembly segments have been since merged with Begusarai after delimitation) five times in the past. Therefore, if an adjustment had to be made with the CPI, the JD(U) had to concede it a seat where it had a chance of winning.</p>
<p>There was no such problem as far as Banka was concerned. The sitting MP is Putul Kumari, widow of former Union Minister of State Digvijay Singh, who won as an Independent backed by the JD(U), but joined the BJP a couple of months ago. Nitish had, in fact, offered the ticket from Banka to Rajya Sabha member N K Singh. He rejected the offer.</p>
<p>The JD(U) refused to entertain any claim of the CPI(M), which wanted to fight Ujiarpur, Darbhanga and West Champaran.</p>
<p>By reaching an electoral understanding with CPI, Nitish fared better than SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav, who, despite his long-standing friendship with Left leaders, has not been able to work out such an alliance with them. Sources said the Left parties wanted the SP to part with some seats in UP, or give at least Ghosi seat to CPI to accommodate Atul Anjan without reciprocating this gesture in West Bengal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997186&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Centre is expanding its vulture conservation programme across eight centres to save the endangered species and arrest the steady decline of their population.</span></p>
<p>The move to emulate successful vulture breeding and rescue centre in Pinjore comes ahead of the ambitious plan to release these birds, bred in captivity, into the wild by 2016-17.</p>
<p>Six hundred pairs of each of the three critically endangered species — white backed, long billed and slender billed — will be released. For this purpose, 25 pairs of the three species will be needed to breed in each of the eight centres.</p>
<p>At a meeting last month, officials from Central Zoo Authority, zoo directors, chief wildlife wardens and forests officers involved in the Vulture Conservation Breeding Programme agreed to send captive-bred vultures to Rani in Assam; Rajabhatkhawa in West Bengal; Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad; Van Vihar National Park &amp; Zoo; Bhopal; Sakkarbaug Zoo, Junagarh; Muta Zoo, Ranchi; and Nandankanan Zoo, Bhubaneswar.</p>
<p>In fact, vultures, in 19 other zoos in India, will also be soon shifted out to these centres, officials said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997179&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The ad blitzkrieg for the BJP and its PM candidate is set to be unleashed in a few days, with lyricist and adman Prasoon Joshi and executive chairman and creative director at Ogilvy &amp; Mather Piyush Pandey ready to launch the slogans.</span></p>
<p>Sources said the slogan is divided into three parts. The first will target the current government at the Centre, the second will be an appeal to vote for BJP, which will be followed by the tagline ‘Desh Ki Pukar, Modi Sarkaar’, said sources.</p>
<p>Slogans under consideration are “Dus Saal Mehngai ki Maar”&#8230;( the first part targeting the government over price rise), “Sarkaar Badle Halat Badle, BJP Ko Vote De”&#8230; (The second part appealing for votes). The tagline “Desh Ki Pukar Modi Sarkaar” follows.</p>
<p>The BJP communication cells or Samvaad cells have never been so active before and it was seen when they launched a campaign on social networking sites to support Modi . Joshi and Pandey are among ad and media management professionals BJP roped in for the campaign. Sources said the slogans are likely to be launched this week.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997176&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/s.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997171" alt="The SP and Congress were misleading the people in the name of secularism and using it to cover up the failures of their governments, Modi said." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/s.jpg" /></a> The SP and Congress were misleading the people in the name of secularism and using it to cover up the failures of their governments, Modi said.
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Narendra Modi Sunday pitched the Lok Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh as a direct contest between the BJP and the Samajwadi Party, targeting SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav in his second consecutive rally in the state. His speech at Lucknow’s Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan made no reference to the BSP or to Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.</span></p>
<p>The SP and Congress were misleading the people in the name of secularism and using it to cover up the failures of their governments, Modi said.</p>
<p>Beginning his speech by invoking Atal Bihari Vajpyee, who was an MP from Lucknow for four consecutive terms, Modi said he had learnt a lot from the former prime minister. Vajpayee often said that the route to power in Delhi passes through Lucknow, he added.</p>
<p>Highlighting that he belonged to a backward caste, Modi said that the BJP was a democratic party that had projected him as the prime ministerial candidate despite the fact that he had been a tea vendor.</p>
<p>The meeting concluded the first phase of the party’s election campaign in Uttar Pradesh. The Lucknow rally was the eighth addressed by Modi in the state.</p>
<p>Modi appealed to the people to not allow parties to destroy “the legacy of Lucknow”. “Sounds of fireshots from katta (countrymade pistols) have replaced the sound of music here. They have made the Gomti river a drain.”</p>
<p>Quoting from Mulayam’s speech in Allahabad earlier on Sunday, Modi said the SP chief appeared to have accepted defeat. “Mulayam today urged not to compete with Modi’s rallies on crowd numbers. It is his first defeat. He also asked partymen to compete with the BJP on development issue. It is his second defeat as finally he had to follow politics of development rather than vote bank politics,” Modi said.</p>
<p>The Gujarat Chief Minister had targeted Mulayam and son Akhilesh at his Gorakhpur rally too, on January 23. In all his rallies, the SP chief has also made the BJP and particularly Modi the focus of his attack. Sunday was the fourth time Mulayam and Modi addressed rallies the same day.</p>
<p>The Lucknow rally ground, that has a capacity to hold five lakh people, was packed, with party leaders claiming that nearly as many were on roads outside the ground.</p>
<p>Modi accused Mulayam of telling lies about Gujarat, saying: “Instead of criticising Gujarat, Netaji should tell about the work the SP government has done in UP.” He invited the SP chief to visit Gujarat to see the 24-hour power supply in villages there. “In UP, reservation is there in power supply too. People get 24-hour supply in Netaji’s constituency whereas public at other places do not,” he said.</p>
<p>Modi also noted that while more than 150 riots had taken place in the one year government of Akhilesh in Uttar Pradesh, no riots had occurred or curfew clamped in Gujarat in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>He also referred to Uttar Pradesh’s criminal record, saying 45 per cent of all serious crimes in the country took place in the state, because of “rowdyism” of SP leaders. In one year, crime had increased in the state by 240 per cent, he said.</p>
<p>Making more comparisons with Gujarat, Modi said that while per capita income in Uttar Pradesh was Rs 26,000, it was Rs 75,000 in his state. When the Uttar Pradesh government had asked him for lions, he had given them those, he added.</p>
<p>Modi also noted that Amul dairy network had now come to Uttar Pradesh — Akhilesh last week laid foundation stone of two Amul milk processing plants. “If you cannot see development in Gujarat, why did you bring Amul to UP?” Modi said.</p>
<p>While the SP government did nothing to promote local industries, Modi said, just the business of kites in Gujarat, involving Muslims, had increased in worth to Rs 500 crore from Rs 35 crore under him.</p>
<p>While not naming Salman Khurshid, Sriprakash Jaiswal and Beni Prasad Verma — Union ministers belonging to the state — he hinted that all three were corrupt.</p>
<p>Earlier, BJP national president Rajnath Singh asserted that no leader had faced so much criticism in Indian history as Modi. “What crime has Modi done that political opponents are targeting him for the past 12 years?” Rajnath said.</p>
<p>Rajnath as well as former Army chief General V K Singh, who also addressed the rally, blamed the UPA government for the death of two Navy officers in an accident aboard INS Sindhuratna.</p>
<p><strong>SP MP with Modi on the dais</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Samajwadi Party MP from Kaiserganj Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh Sunday appeared on the stage with Narendra Modi at BJP’s Lucknow rally. Singh is yet to formally join the BJP and reportedly attended the rally on the party’s invitation.</p>
<p>The four-time MP had won 2009 Lok Sabha election from Kaiserganj on the SP ticket and was announced by the party as its candidate again for the coming 2014 elections. But Singh refused to contest on SP ticket recently, triggering speculations that he may join the BJP. <strong>ENS</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997168&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mulayam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997173" alt="Mulayam Singh at Allahabad rally on Sunday. Ravi prakash. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mulayam.jpg" /></a> Mulayam Singh at Allahabad rally on Sunday. Ravi prakash.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Launching yet another scathing attack on BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Sunday alleged that he had presided over “mass murder of Muslims” in 2002 in Gujarat and now his party was trying to hoodwink the community by talking of apology.</span></p>
<p>“Musalmanon ka katleaam kara ke maafi maangte hain. Musalman bhai aapko nasamajh lagte hain? Yeh badi samajhdaar aur bahadur kaum hai. Jiske saath rehte hain, dil se rehte hain (You first preside over mass murder of Muslims and now you are seeking apology. Do you think Muslims don’t understand? They are a brave and intelligent community. If they support you, they do it from their heart).” Mulayam said.</p>
<p>He was addressing the SP’s ‘Desh Bachao, Desh Banao’ rally in Allahabad even as as Modi addressed a rally in Lucknow.</p>
<p>Hitting back at Modi for his taunt that Mulayam could not turn UP into a Gujarat as the feat required “a 56-inch-chest”, the SP chief recalled the 2002 Gujarat riots and how he went there without security. “Aapne security nahin di, phir bhi wahan gaye. Kiska seena 56-inch ka hua? (You did not provide me with security. Still I went there. So, who has the 56-inch chest now?),” asked Mulayam.</p>
<p>In a double-barrelled attack on Congress-led UPA government and the BJP, he said that while former lacks courage, the saffron party does not have enough candidates for the Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>Taking a dig at LJP’s Ramvilas Paswan for joining hands with the BJP, and in an apparent reference to former army chief V K Singh joining the saffron party, Mulayam said, “The BJP does not have candidates. They are trying to garner some by bringing in people from other parties. Samajwadi Party mein candidates ki line lagee hai. UP, MP, Karnataka, Mumbai har jagah line lagee hai. But we are being careful in giving tickets.”</p>
<p>“UPA sarkar ke paas hausla nahin hai. Ab jimmedaari aap par hai (the government does not have the courage. The responsibility now is on you),” Mulayam added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997167&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Rs 5,000 is all you need to invest in CPSE ETF, which the government is set to float.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997163&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The first Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) is set to hit the market soon thereby providing investors an opportunity to take exposure into the 10 major listed public sector companies . The new offer will add to the long list of ETFs which has been dominated by Gold ETFs so far.</span></p>
<p>While the government recently approved the ETF plan for the PSUs, the CPSE ETF is an open-ended fund and the units would have a face value of Rs 10 per unit. According to the draft offer document filed by the finance ministry with market regulator Sebi, individual investors can invest a minimum of Rs 5,000 and the maximum of Rs 10 lakh in the fund. Non-institutional investors or qualified institutional buyers can invest in the ETF with a minimum investment amount of Rs 10 lakh.</p>
<p>The launch of the CPSE ETF is mainly aimed at monetising government’s stake in PSUs so as to meet the disinvestment target of FY14. The government has, so far, raised about Rs 5,093.87 crore through stake sales in PSUs. As per the revised estimates in the Interim Budget, the target was lowered to Rs 16,027 crore in this financial year from Rs 40,000 crore.</p>
<p>While the ETF, which is expected to hit the markets this month, it could fetch government Rs 3,000 crore. The fund will provide a new option to investors looking at putting their money in public companies indirectly.</p>
<p><strong>What is ETF?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>An ETF is similar to that of a mutual fund but trades like a stock on an exchange. The CPSE ETF will be listed in the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange. Investors will be able to buy and sell units of the ETF, which will give them exposure to a basket of the 10 CPSE stocks.</p>
<p>ETFs were introduced in India in 2001. Currently, there are about 33 ETFs with assets under management of close to Rs 11,500 crore held by 6.2 lakh investors.</p>
<p><strong>The ETF basket</strong></p>
<p>The asset management company for the ETF is Goldman Sachs Asset Management (India) Private Limited. There are 10 stocks in the ETF basket, namely ONGC, Coal India, GAIL, Rural Electrification Corporation, Oil India, Container Corporation of India, Power Finance Corporation, Indian Oil Corporation, Engineers India and Bharat Engineering. Earlier, Power Grid Corporation was also in the basket but it has been dropped as the scrip has a one-year lock-in period since its follow-on public offer in December.</p>
<p>While several public sector companies own natural resources and have generated good returns for investors over the last 30 years, they also have high dividend payout, providing one more reason to the investors to invest in them. The fund will also qualify for tax exemption under the Rajiv Gandhi Equity Savings Scheme (RGESS) and offer tax exemption for first-time investors in equities.</p>
<p>Unit holders who wish to avail of the tax deduction under the scheme will be subject to lock-in-periods — fixed lock-in and flexible lock-in — as specified under the notified RGESS. The fixed lock-in-period shall commence from the date of purchase of such units in the relevant financial year and end on March 31 of the year immediately following the relevant financial year. The flexible lock-in period will be of two years beginning immediately after the end of the fixed lock-in period.</p>
<p>Fund managers of the CPSE ETF will be allowed to invest up to 10 per cent of the Rs 3,000 crore corpus in derivative products like stock futures and interest rate swaps.</p>
<p>The draft prospectus, filed by the finance ministry with the Sebi, says, “The scheme may invest in derivative products like stock index futures, interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements or other derivatives&#8230;”.</p>
<p>Derivatives are financial products, like futures, options or warrants, whose value is derived from the value of the underlying asset.</p>
<p>“The notional exposure of the scheme in derivative instruments shall be restricted to 10 per cent of the net assets of the scheme. The combined exposure of equity shares, debt securities and gross notional exposure of derivatives instruments shall not exceed 100 per cent of the net assets of the scheme,” it said.</p>
<p>The investment in derivative products, it said, would help the fund managers to protect the value of portfolio and enhance the unit holder interest.</p>
<p><strong>Should you invest?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Government-owned companies are fundamentally strong but heavy regulations affect their performance. However, with stable government and better economic policies, the stocks tend to pick up very quick and are advised for long-term investors.</p>
<p>The performance of the PSU index at the Bombay Stock Exchange over the last few years has not been very encouraging. While the Sensex has risen by 16.4 per cent between January 2010 and January 2014, the PSU index at BSE has fallen by 41 per cent in the same period showing the bad performance of PSUs over the period marred by policy paralysis.</p>
<p>While PSUs have significantly underperformed, a lot of these companies are trading at significant discounts and a change in the overall economic environment may see them outperform going forward. Investors can look to get into the ETF with an investment horizon of 3-5 years.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997163&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">In the four-year period between April 1993 and March 1997, as many as 4,005 companies entered the capital markets with their initial public offerings (IPOs) to raise an aggregate of Rs 41,319 crore. The IPOs accounted for more than 9 per cent of the average market capitalisation of Bombay Stock Exchange over the four-year period. </span></p>
<p>If these many companies raised money from the public, several companies also duped investors in the pretext of public offer — vanishing from the market over the coming years. There are 238 companies in the ministry of corporate affairs’ list of ‘vanishing companies’ and out of that, 87 remained untraceable till March 2012.</p>
<p>While nobody was held accountable for investors’ loss then, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has now proposed that all companies that come up with IPOs need to set up a monitoring agency that will look into the use of issue proceeds. The market regulator has also looked into putting some onus on independent directors, management and audit committee in the same regard.</p>
<p>This is a big move by Sebi. Earlier, companies coming up with public offerings of raise less than Rs 500 crore were not required to have any monitoring agency.</p>
<p>A look into Initial Public Offers in the last three calendar years (2011-2013) shows that only 8 out of the 51 public issues raised over Rs 500 crore from the market, whereas more than 80 per cent of the issues had issue size of less than Rs 500 crore.</p>
<p>Therefore, going by the current market regulations, a large number of companies attracting a significant number of investors are not required to float a committee that monitors the use of the IPO money — a big gap in the regulations, which Sebi looks to bridged with its new proposal.</p>
<p>“It is a move in the right direction as it will provide protection to all investors against misuse of IPO funds in companies. If the regulator is worried about misuse of funds then all investors need to be protected,” said Prithvi Haldea, chairman, Prime Database.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed regulations </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>After almost four years that the government had asked the capital markets regulator to figure out ways to monitor the use of IPO proceeds, Sebi has finally come out with a discussion paper on the same, inviting public comments till March 25.</p>
<p>The market regulator has also proposed that the monitoring agency will have to submit its report on a quarterly basis (as against semi-annual basis) and should make the report public through dissemination to the stock exchanges.</p>
<p>“Considering that Companies Act, 2013 requires prior approval from shareholders for any change of object and a provision for exit to dissenting shareholders, it is very important that shareholders get regular update on utilisation of issue proceeds,” said the working paper, giving the rationale behind making the report public.</p>
<p>Earlier, in several cases, companies have given one reason in the object of raising the money while coming up with their IPO, and later, the promoter would change the stated object of use of funds by getting a resolution passed through a majority.</p>
<p>Experts say that while the new Companies’ Act provides minority shareholders with the power to recall their money in case of any change in the use of funds by the promoter, Sebi’s proposal on quarterly disclosure of the report at the stock exchanges would further empower investors as they would get an update on the use of funds on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p>On the categorisation of the report, it has been proposed that the monitoring agency will have to grade the deviation from stated use of funds on a two-digit scale — first stating the deviation from object (on a scale of 0-2 where 1 stands for no deviation)and the second indicating the range of deviation (on a scale of 0-5 where 1 indicates deviation up to 10 per cent).</p>
<p>“Monitoring Agency Reports where there is a deviation from objects of the issue should be segregated from reports where the utilisation is in line with objects of the issue. Companies Act, 2013 requires that the company shall not change its objects for which it raised the money through prospectus unless a special resolution is passed by the company and dissenting shareholders have been given opportunity for exit by the promoters and shareholders having control,” said the paper.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility on independent directors</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Not only has the role of promoters and management on the use of funds has come under the lens, the regulator has also brought independent directors’s role to the fore. While Sebi has proposed that the companies need to set up the a sub-committee of board of directors before the opening of the issue that will oversee the monitoring of utilisation of issue proceeds, it has further said that the majority of that committee will be constituted by the independent directors and will be headed by one of them.</p>
<p>“Constitution of such committee will be helpful in facilitating monitoring of utilisation of issue proceeds. Further, the said requirement will ensure active involvement of board of directors monitoring of utilisation of issue proceeds,” the discussion paper said, giving the rationale behind setting up of the sub-committee.</p>
<p>Along with the new corporate governance norms that look to put a check on the number of companies and the tenure that one can serve as an independent director, this move puts in additional responsibility on the shoulders of independent directors.</p>
<p>While the audit committee and the management were not in picture earlier, the regulator has said, “Audit committee and the board/ management shall provide their comments for the deviation, if any, pointed out in the report of monitoring agency.”</p>
<p>Sebi said that such comments will help understand the reasons for any such deviations.</p>
<p><strong>The bottomline </strong></p>
<p>Once the proposals are approved by the Sebi board and implemented, it will go a long way in providing a safety net to retail investors. It will also act as a deterrent for promoters who enter the capital market with wrong motives. While the proposals look to empower and entrust independent directors with additional responsibility, it should also help in reduction of instances of promoters misusing funds raised through IPOs.</p>
<p><strong>The vanishing act</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>There are 238 companies in the government’s list of ‘vanishing companies’ and out of them 87 remained untraceable till March 2012.</p>
<p>Earlier, companies coming up with public offerings of raise less than Rs 500 crore were not required to have any monitoring agency. Sebi has now come out with a discussion paper inviting public comments on its proposal to require all public offers to have a monitoring agency.</p>
<p>A look into IPOs between 2011-2013 shows that only 8 out of the 51 public issues raised over Rs 500 crore from the market, whereas more than 80% of the issues had issue size of less than Rs 500 crore.</p>
<p>Market regulator has also proposed that the monitoring agency will have to submit its report on a quarterly basis against semi-annual basis.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997147&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Bollywood personalities Sunday came out in full support of Subrata Roy calling him a “true patriot” and a “generous and wonderful human being”, days after he was arrested in a case related to non-refund of investors’ money.</span></p>
<p>The press conference called at a music studio in Andheri to voice support for Roy witnessed drama of sorts with actor Fardeen Khan and other personalities, especially director Ramesh Sippy, complaining about the “character onslaught” on Roy, but choosing to remain silent on the plight of the investors who lost their money in the alleged fraud. Actor Johnny Lever, lyricist Sameer, singers Nitin Mukesh, Rahul Vaidya, Saapna Mukherjee and Sadhana Sargam were others who rallied for the Sahara chief.</p>
<p>Fardeen said, “There is a trend that is very common nowadays that when someone is facing legal challenges, he faces a character onslaught. That is why we are here to defend Subrata Roy. He is a conscientious and honest man, and has always been a true Indian patriot&#8230; We have heard adjectives such as megalomaniac being used for him. When we hear such things, we feel we should defend him. At least give the man a chance to defend himself.”</p>
<p>The Bollywood figures refused to comment on the case, saying the matter was sub judice and that they knew little about the litigation.</p>
<p>Sippy said, “Whatever the Supreme Court verdict is, we will accept it. The matter is sub judice, it won’t be right to comment. We have come because we personally know the Sahara chief.” When asked about investors who lost money, Sippy said, “We don’t know any of these investors personally to speak about them.”</p>
<p>“Subrata Roy does not put any one down. The kind of things that have been said about him, he is actually not like that,” Lever said, praising the Sahara boss.</p>
<p><strong>Roy to be taken to Delhi today</strong></p>
<p>Lucknow: Police is likely to take Sahara chief Subrata Roy, currently in UP Forest department’s guest house near Lucknow, to Delhi Monday for his production before the SC Tuesday. While police and government officers discussed the mode of transport for Roy till late Sunday, sources said he was likely to be taken to Delhi by road.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997151&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Medical services remained paralysed in the state as junior resident doctors continued their strike Sunday following failed negotiations between administration and doctors of GSV Medical College Kanpur. The 24 arrested undergraduate medical students of the medical college were, meanwhile, sent to jail after produced before the court Saturday evening.</span></p>
<p>The doctors are protesting against the alleged cane charge and police action on students of the college Friday after a brawl between them and local Samajwadi Party MLA Irfan Solanki. The MLA and some medical students had sustained injuries in the clash.</p>
<p>Three FIRs were lodged against 24 students and several others under various IPC sections, including charges of rioting, attempt to murder and loot. Kanpur Range DIG RK Chaturvedi said, “We had offered for bail of the students from the police station, but the university administration did not agree to it. All 24 have been sent to judicial custody after they were produced before the court Saturday evening.”</p>
<p>“The doctors are still on strike. Administration representatives have assured us that the arrested students will be released by Monday. The college administration has given a complaint Sunday evening against MLA Irfan Solanki and SSP Yashashvi Yadav at Swaroopnagar police station, but no FIR has been lodged so far,” said Dr Sanjay Kala, Proctor, GSV Medical College.</p>
<p>The proctor said that the college administration might approach the court if FIR is not lodged in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, medical services remained paralysed in Kanpur, Lucknow, Agra, Meerut, Jhansi and Allahabad, apart from other towns, where junior and senior resident doctors as well as undergraduate students remained on strike.</p>
<p>“While junior resident doctors remained on strike in several places, faculty members of all medical colleges are on duty, providing medical services to the patients so that the public does not face problems,” Balwinder Singh Bhullar, Principal Secretary, Medical Education told The Indian Express. “Even in Kanpur, the university administration has allotted duties to faculty members and essential medical services have been restored,” he said.</p>
<p>Strike also continued in KGMU Lucknow, as undergraduate and junior resident doctors protested.</p>
<p>Representatives of doctors also met Health Minister Ahmad Hasan on the issue, but did not get positive assurance, said Ashish Kumar Singh, a second year MBBS student at KGMU. “Some of the services like emergency services at Trauma Centre and Queen’s Mary hospital as well as operation theatre services were provided today, but from Monday, if the matter is not resolved, we will continue the strike and even close the OPD services,” said Singh.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997149&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Four state-owned steel giants have signed agreements to cumulatively provide Rs 2 crore for setting up a school of privately run Amity Group in Union steel minister Beni Prasad Verma’s Gonda constituency in Uttar Pradesh.</span></p>
<p>The four PSUs — SAIL, NMDC, RINL and MOIL — have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Amity Group for providing Rs 2 crore assistance for the school, a ministry source said. “They have been asked to contribute for the school, which would be set up in Gonda. The foundation stone laying ceremony is likely in next few days,” the source said.</p>
<p>Verma, who also attended MoU signing ceremony here, could not be reached. Heads of the PSUs, when contacted, declined comments due to “sensitivity” involved in the issue.</p>
<p>The Standing Committee on Coal and Steel, in a report tabled in May last in Lok Sabha, had noted “the haphazard manner in which CSR activities have been carried out by steel PSUs in two districts of UP Barabanki and Gonda.”</p>
<p>The Committee had said that it failed to understand the logic behind concentrating their CSR activities in Gonda and Barabanki “as if headquarters of these PSUs have been shifted to these two districts”.</p>
<p>Verma has won from Gonda five consecutive times and was born in Barabanki.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997146&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cop.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997102" alt="Nazrul Islam has just retired, will join hands with A R Mollah.File" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cop.jpg" /></a> Nazrul Islam has just retired, will join hands with A R Mollah. File
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Once one of Mamata Banerjee’s closest aides, then one of her fiercest critics, Nazrul Islam is set to join a rebel from the CPM ranks Monday.</span></p>
<p>The IPS official-cum-author, who retired as an additional DG Friday, will join hands with former CPM minister Abdul Rezzak Mollah, who has launched a party to fight for the rights of Muslims and SCs/STs in West Bengal. Mollah is a veteran politician who has taken on former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.</p>
<p>Mamata had handpicked Islam in the years leading to paribartan. As rail minister in 2009, she inducted him in the Railway Protection Force. They drifted apart during Mamata’s tenure as rail minister itself, with Islam alleging corruption in the ministry. Since Mamata came to power, he has frequently been criticising her government and written books about “exploitation of Muslims and using them as vote bank”, one of which has been banned and seized. The government filed a chargesheet against him for violating service rules and he too moved a counter-case. Even last year, he wrote to the CBI about alleged corruption in the rail ministry.</p>
<p>Islam and Mollah have been consulting each other for some time, aides say. It is the former’s government obligations that are believed to have prevented him taking up politically the issues close to both men’s hearts.</p>
<p>Islam has a history of highlighting issues relating to the deprivation of Muslims, SCs and STs in Bengal, including during his challenges to Mamata. He has brought out several publications about Muslims and SCs/STs being denied government jobs , important posts, or ministerial berths in proportion with their population. These are the very plank Mollah is campaigning on; he alleges an upper-caste domination in the communist party’s hierarchy.</p>
<p>The day after he retired, Islam told The Indian Express the time has come to take these issues forward along with Mollah. “I have been working for minorities and SCs/STs through my organisation, Adivasi Mulbasi Sanghatan, for a long time,” he said. “And I have seen that Mollah too has been working for these neglected groups. So, there is scope for us working together.”</p>
<p>Islam and leaders of his organisation will meet Mollah March 4 after Mollah returns to Kolkata from Delhi. They are expected to announce a common platform March 10. during the launch of a book, Udar Akash, a collection of essays written by intellectuals on the minorities living in Bengal.</p>
<p>Islam himself is releasing three books relating to such issues in a couple of days. They are called Mulniwasi Istehar, Bhaontadir Bhanr Samuha (Buffoons of a Bluff Master), and Ulangini Rani (The Nude Queen). “These books deal with minorities and SCs/STs and the promises made to them by the government,” said Islam. Ulangini Rani is a collection of poems and Buffoons is a satirical novel, which many believe is directed at Mamata.</p>
<p>At one point, Mamata used to praise the IPS officer’s uprightness. Now, he not only attacks her for unfulfilled promises to Muslims but also ridicules her for her frequent utterances of “Inshallah” and “Khuda hafeez”, and for offering namaz.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997096&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In the 2008 Marathi film Valu, directed by National Award winner Umesh Kulkarni, a youth called Aaba plays trick after trick to usurp the position of village sarpanch from a seasoned politician. The actor will now seek to reprise that role in real life. </span></p>
<p>Nandu Madhav, actor and theatre director, is the Aam Aadmi Party candidate against the BJP’s Gopinath Munde in Beed. An actor since 1985 in various Marathi and Hindi films, he played his most famous role as Dadasaheb Phalke in Harishchandrachi Factory, India’s official entry for the Oscars in 2009.</p>
<p>Madhav, born in the arid region of Georai in Beed, is a law graduate who was lured into the theatre. And he is known in the state not only for his artistic but also for his social sensibilities.</p>
<p>“Nandu is a socially committed man, and also a professionally committed man. When Paresh Mokashi was making Harishchandrachi Factory, funds would run out and the project be halted for months. Most actors would have taken on other projects. But Nandu wanted to be available any time the shooting resumed, and stayed committed to the project,” critic Shanta Gokhale says.</p>
<p>Madhav has made many films highlighting farmer issues in Marathwada. One film, Akda (The Hook), tells the story of poor farmers forced to steal power to sustain their farms. Shwet Angaar (White Fire) showcases the lives of cotton farmers of the region.</p>
<p>He also directed the play Shivaji Underground in Bhimnagar Mohalla, written and acted by a group of farmers and actors from Jalna district of Marathwada region. The play questions the right-wing portrayal of the Maratha warrior king, and triggered calls for its ban.</p>
<p>Madhav says getting into electoral politics is an extension of his work. “I was earlier speaking thorough my work, which was also politics,” he says. “People for the past few years were fearful of taking the plunge into the electoral space. However the Anna Hazare movement has created a space and people who were waiting on the sidelines have got the push&#8230;”</p>
<p>Madhav says his fight is for the uplift of farmers and farm labourers who have no social safety net. “Established politicians seem to have created a ring whereby they share the spoils of the constituency at the expense of the people. My attempt is to challenge this structure so that real issues of the people of my region, including farmers, are addressed,” Madhav says.</p>
<p>For a resident of Marathwada, where caste plays a key role in deciding elections, Madhav is careful not to spell out his last name. “You can call me Nandu Madhav Kamble, Kulkarni, Qureishi, Munde, any name you like,” he says.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997091&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Chirag Paswan, once a vocal fan of Rahul Gandhi, today praises Narendra Modi as “not an iota per cent communal”. Chirag, 32, son of Ramvilas Paswan, heads the parliamentary board of the LJP which has realigned with the BJP 12 years after walking out of the NDA. Excerpts from an interview with the actor-turned-politician:</em></p>
<p><strong>Does the alliance mean you have no issues with the RSS ideology, something your father was once critical about?</strong><br />
Ours is an out-and-out issue-based alliance. We are not merging into the BJP. We might not agree on a couple of things, we might agree on a couple of other things, but when you have a common minimum programme of the NDA, the government will be directed by that.</p>
<p><strong>Will that be formed before or after the polls?</strong><br />
It will be pre-poll. We have presented our issues to the BJP clearly, whether relating to minorities or Dalits, or special status for Bihar, on which they gave us the assurance this would be the first thing they would do when they come to power. We will be working on a draft.</p>
<p><strong>Your party has always espoused what is called “secular” politics. How can that go with perceptions about Narendra Modi?</strong><br />
Of late the perception about Mr Modi has changed a lot. In his recent speeches, if you listen, not even an iota per cent hint of communalism is there. And what better statement than what Rajnath Singh gave the other day (offering to apologise to Muslims if the BJP has committed any mistake). I think this is the strongest secular statement anyone can give.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like Modi to apologise for the 2002 riots?</strong><br />
I think it’s high time we moved on. If you have to think about the development of a state and the country, you cannot restrict yourself to 2002. A lot of things have changed. You cannot hold someone (responsible) for years and years for one event. I know what happened then was bad&#8230; but then it’s time for everyone to move on.</p>
<p><strong>What will your stand be if the BJP includes a Ram temple in Ayodhya as part of its manifesto?</strong><br />
Let’s not pick that&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>You will be sharing the stage with Modi on March 3 in Muzaffarpur. Will you find it hard to explain to your voters why you have shifted camps?</strong><br />
We don’t need to explain to them. They already know how much we were humiliated. They have seen our repeated efforts to get into an alliance with the Congress and the RJD. We met Sonia ji, CP Joshi ji and for three months we kept trying to meet Rahul, but he just didn’t meet us. Because of so much humiliation, there was a lot of anger in our cadre and leaders&#8230; Everybody unanimously, including those from the minority communities, were saying we should go ahead with the BJP.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to your secular credentials?</strong><br />
Our national president is very clear there will be no compromise on our principles. Personally he had reservations about going ahead with this alliance. But everyone in the party convinced him&#8230; He had only one condition, that our ideology and whatever our manifesto stands for should be intact. So we had a couple of rounds of meetings with senior BJP leaders, in which we kept these concerns clearly in front of them&#8230; Even in 2002, when our national president (Paswan) was part of the NDA government, the day he felt some injustice was happening with minorities, he resigned.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your opinion of Rahul Gandhi?</strong><br />
He was young and had a vision, which I was looking forward to. But he couldn’t deliver. My personal equation with him is very good; he has also seen my film (Miley Na Miley Hum, 2011) and he was my neighbour for 25 years.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997082&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lok Janshakti Party president Ramvilas Paswan, who surely has a penchant for being in news, has stayed away from limelight ever since he made yet another somersault from the so-called secularists’ camp to the BJP. Instead, his son Chirag has been at the forefront, vigorously trying to justify his father’s decision. Sr Paswan may have achieved twin objectives by staying in the background — to project his son as the heir apparent of the party and to avoid responding to rather uncomfortable queries about post-Godhra riots and his shifting stances.</p>
<p><strong>PUSH FOR SON</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Rajasthan Governor Margaret Alva has put the Congress top brass in a dilemma. The former Congress leader is lobbying for a Lok Sabha ticket for her son Nivedith from North Kannada constituency. Neither Congress president Sonia Gandhi nor vice-president Rahul Gandhi is said to be enthused by the idea. At the same time, however, they are said to be wary of upsetting Alva. The party leadership had invited her wrath in 2008 Karnataka Assembly election after her son was denied a ticket. She had then alleged role of money in the distribution of tickets — a remark that had forced the Congress high command to drop the Nehru-Gandhi family loyalist from all party posts. Last year, during the AICC meet in Jaipur, the Governor had taken great pains to do up a room in Raj Bhawan for Sonia but the latter had chosen to stay in a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>AWAITING GO-AHEAD</strong></p>
<p>Adding to the general state of confusion, many Congress general secretaries in charge of states and state Congress chiefs are anxiously waiting for a signal from Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who is said to be in favour of fielding senior party functionaries in the election. For instance, while Ajmer MP and Rajasthan PCC chief Sachin Pilot is preparing to contest, AICC general secretary in charge of the state and MP Gurudas Kamat has already informed the high command that he would be contesting again. Similarly, general secretary B K Hari Prasad, who had almost turned the party’s fortune in Chhattisgarh, has been recommended for four constituencies in Karnataka. He may not be amused though, given that his detractors are only trying to push him out of his stronghold in Bangalore. Many other functionaries like Madhya Pradesh and Bihar PCC chiefs are also keen to contest. These leaders are, however, not sure whether Rahul would let them confine themselves to their own constituencies, leaving the party rudderless in the states. Rahul has chosen to keep all of them in a limbo.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKING OUT</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>As the Manmohan Singh government prepares to walk into the sunset, the PMO’s communications advisor Pankaj Pachauri seems to have finally decided to aggressively bat for the government. He has started giving interviews to the media starting with state-owned Doordarshan and All India Radio. Chances are that appearances in other media outlets will follow soon.</p>
<p><strong>MAKING UP</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Having drawn flak for ordering black-out of proceedings of the House during passage of the contentious Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill, Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar tried to placate Leader of Opposition Sushma Swaraj by gifting her a sari.</p>
<p>Swaraj’s speech during the debate on the Bill was not telecast by Lok Sabha TV due to the Speaker’s diktat. A gracious Swaraj reciprocated the gesture.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997104&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested a suspected Indian Mujahideen (IM) activist in connection with Bodh Gaya serial blasts from a village in Bihar’s Arwal district, police said on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>Acting on a tip off, the NIA team arrested the suspected IM activist, Md Irfan, from Auwgila village late Saturday night, Superintendent of Police (SP) Shafi-Ul Haque said. Immediately after his arrest, the NIA team took Irfan to Patna in a vehicle under tight security for questioning in connection with the Bodh Gaya serial blasts, the SP said.</p>
<p>Haque said that NIA had detained two more persons — Raj Nandan and Ranjan — for interrogation from different villages of the same district and released the duo after their complicity in the Bodh Gaya blasts could not be ascertained. The IM had carried out serial blasts at the Mahabodhi temple and adjoining areas on July 7, 2013.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997122&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The home ministry’s report said that details of security features are classified and “not desirable to be parted with an outside organisation”.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997119&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">After the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has opposed a National Investigation Agency (NIA) to engage a statistician to estimate fake currency circulation in India.</span></p>
<p>The NIA roped in a statistician from the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata for the Rs 15 crore proposal to collect data on fake currency from various parts of the country. The issue was discussed at the Economic Intelligence Council in December 2013 where the IB objected to the proposal “on the ground of confidentiality, duplication and expanded scope of objectives.”</p>
<p>The MHA endorsed the views of IB in an internal report regarding a “working group to devise a mechanism for collection of statistical information on FICN (Fake Indian Currency Notes)”.</p>
<p>The MHA report noted that details of security features are classified and “not desirable to be parted with an outside organisation”.</p>
<p>The NIA wanted to institute a working group for data collection, technical analysis and estimation of FICN in circulation. A presentation given by the statistician to MHA on the roadmap of estimation of FICN. According to MHA sources, the proposal was to send teams across India and conduct random searches to seize FICN and send it for analysis. The key issue MHA raised is that high quality FICN circulated allegedly with backing of Pakistan, is an area of concern for the Indian government, and can only be checked at four forensic laboratories in India. The MHA note argues, “Technical analysis of FICN is an activity already being performed by FCORD (FICN Coordination committee)”, in its January 3 note.</p>
<p>The MHA view is National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) is custodian of data and once the Rs 1,200 crore Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System is in place, NCRB will provide precise updated data on FICN. This can be used by experts to evolve a mathematical model to estimate FICN in circulation.</p>
<p>The NIA has given suggestion that Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, be engaged for a Rs 40 lakh proposal for a data analysis and the MHA can take a view on whether to conduct an all-India exercise. A source said, “The exercise is to improve security features of currency and present the findings at International fora to put pressure on state actors aiding FICN syndicates.”</p>
<p>In 2011, the Centre had come out with a white paper on FICN circulation estimating the volume as 0.2 per cent of total money in circulation. It is planning seven more security features to Indian currency to counter FICN.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997119&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Cabinet also clears special status for Seemandhra.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997067&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">In what could be the last cabinet meeting of UPA 2, the government on Sunday decided to include Jats in nine states in the central list of OBCs for reservation in central government jobs and educational institutions. </span></p>
<p>The cabinet also decided to give special category status to Seemandhra for a period of five years. “A decision has been taken to ask the Planning Commission to give special category status to Seemandhra for a period of five years. The temple town of Bhadrachalam will remain in Telangana. Areas of submergence under the Polavaram project too will be given land for land in Seemandhra,” Union Minister Jairam Ramesh said after the cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>The decision on Jat reservation comes two months after the cabinet asked the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC) to fast track its opinion on the matter without waiting for the results of the survey being undertaken by the Indian Council for Social Science Research (ICSSR) for this purpose since last year.</p>
<p>The decision affects Jats in Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan (Bharatpur and Dholpur), Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi. These include three of the four Hindi heartland states where voters had rejected the UPA in assembly elections last December.</p>
<p>The NCBC, which had earlier rejected the proposal, has now given a favourable decision, paving the way for the long pending demand to be finally accepted.</p>
<p>The decision will also give some breathing space to Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh’s RLD in western UP where, since the riots of August-September last year, the party has been sidelined.</p>
<p>The NCBC had approached ICSSR in May last year to conduct a “Jat Baseline Survey” to determine socio-economic conditions of the community in six states where they are the most numerous, in order to ascertain the legitimacy of the demand to include them among the OBCs for quotas in central government jobs and educational institutions.</p>
<p>The ICSSR survey has so far taken off in only one of the six identified states, and is likely to take quite some time to be completed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997067&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Renuka Puri
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The sons and daughters of a number of prominent Bihar politicians hope to carry on their families’ legacies, if not start their own, by contesting the elections.</span></p>
<p>In some cases, their possible candidacy is the fallout of others in the family being ineligible. Lalu Prasad has been convicted and his son Tejaswi is too young to contest, but Tejaswi’s sister Misa Bharati is eligible. Former MP Jagdish Sharma too has been convicted in the fodder scam, but has his son Rahul to fall back on.</p>
<p>Two other prominent sons face no such compulsions but were finding their ambitions hindered amid negotiations between the Congress and the RJD. One of them is Samrat Choudhary, son of former assembly deputy speaker Shakuni Choudhary. Samrat, who led the attempt to split the RJD with a group of breakaway MLAs, has been eyeing the Khagaria seat but the Congress too was lobbying for it with the RJD. He reportedly fell out with the RJD after Lalu assured a ticket to his father but not to him.</p>
<p>Ramvilas Paswan’s son Chirag, too, found his designs on the Jamui seat thwarted by the Congress’s demands. With Paswan having tied up with the BJP instead, he has swung this seat in the bargain and is likely to field Chirag.</p>
<p>The son of another prominent leader to have made his ambitions clear is Mantu Tiwari. Son of expelled JD(U) MP Shivanand Tiwari, Mantu is known to be close to RJD leaders but has not yet joined any party and as such is not in the reckoning for the upcoming elections.</p>
<p>In Lalu’s family, Rabri Devi is likely to contest from Chhapra and another member from the Yadav-dominated Pataliputra seat. With Tejaswi not yet 25 and Lalu’s eldest son Tej Pratap not politically inclined, the talk has been about Misa possibly contesting. There are too many contenders in the RJD for that seat and Lalu would prefer it within the family.</p>
<p>For Chirag, an LJP newcomer who had been praising Rahul Gandhi until the switch of allies, his father wants a safe seat. “Paswan wants Chirag to contest from the reserved Jamui seat currently represented by the JD(U). The Congress was not conceding the seat and the LJP chief chose a safe route,” an LJP leader said.</p>
<p>Chirag entered politics after a brief stint in Bollywood and has been made LJP parliamentary board chairman, something that has upset several senior party leaders. Chirag, who has toured several places in Bihar in the last one-and-a-half years, lacks his father’s earthy appeal but has been trying to learn the finer nuances of Bihar politics.</p>
<p>Samrat, the Parbatta MLA, was 25 when he was made a minister in Rabri Devi’s government. “The RJD has started working as a B team of the Congress. I was feeling suffocated. I was impressed with Nitish Kumar’s commitment to secularism,” says Samrat. His father, who lost from Bhagalpur in 2009, is counted as one of the two most prominent RJD leaders after Lalu, the other being Raghuvansh Prasad Singh.</p>
<p>An RJD leader said: “Samrat had been lobbying for Khagaria but the Congress too wants it. Now that the JD(U) has been exposed as having been behind the effort to split the RJD, it cannot make Samrat a minister.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997074&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Over a fortnight after the transfer of former Health Secretary Keshav Desiraju, Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad in a letter to Cabinet Secretary A K Seth accused Desiraju of having batted for a medical college denied permission by the Medical Council of India (MCI). </span></p>
<p>Desiraju’s transfer, widely criticised, was reported to have been a result of his opposition to re-entry of tainted former MCI chief Ketan Desai into the council. A group of retired IAS officers had written to the Prime Minister to look into possible role of Desai in the transfer.</p>
<p>Azad’s letter justifying the transfer accused Desiraju of overlooking MCI rules to recommend review of 14 cases where the council denied permission. “Little did he appreciate that review of MCI decisions by the ministry had become ground for complaints of corruption in earlier regimes,” Azad wrote in his letter sent on February 24, adding, “I understand Desiraju personally pushed this matter having been approached by promoters of a particular medical university and thus wanted the date of approval extended.”</p>
<p>Azad’s office said it could not offhand give the name of the university. Desiraju did not respond to phone calls and messages. An email to his official id went unanswered.</p>
<p>The minister also blamed Desiraju over a faux pas that came in the way of sending MBBS doctors to rural areas. “We held consultations to arrive at a consensus regarding one-year compulsory rural posting after one-year internship for those seeking admission to PG courses. Desiraju prepared a note mentioning duration of internship as 2 years in place of 1 year,” said Azad stressing this “created havoc” and sparked an agitation by young doctors.</p>
<p>He accused Desiraju of committing a serious mistake when he sent a letter to Unnao MP Anu Tandon informing her that Rs 337.87 crore has been released as first installment for setting up a nursing school in her constituency (when the entire project cost was Rs 10 crore). “You can well imagine the embarrassment caused to me as well as the MP when she approached me in August, 2013 for laying the foundation stone&#8230; only to be told by me that we do not have any central scheme for such a mega nursing project&#8230; I had to apologise on the Health Secretary’s behalf. I reprimanded Desiraju for non-application of mind following which he admitted his mistake,” Azad said. Sources close to Tandon said it was a “very small mistake”.</p>
<p>Azad said Desiraju had a casual approach towards the meetings and left it to his subordinates to participate in discussions.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997124&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The Indian Embassy is making arrangements to bring back bodies of five Indians killed in last week’s blast in a restaurant in Qatar. The Ministry of External Affairs is coordinating with the mission there to facilitate consular assistance to families of these victims.</span></p>
<p>The dead Indians have been identified as Riyas Kizhakemanolil, Abdul Saleem Palangad, Zakaria Padinjare Anakandi, Venkatesh and Shaikh Babu, the local media reported.</p>
<p>They were among 11 killed in the blast at a Turkish restaurant in Doha. The blast tore through the restaurant at a mall next to a petrol station on Thursday. The Qatar government announced a probe into the explosion that injured 35 people. Four Nepal nationals and two people from the Philippines died in it. The Embassy is in contact with all concerned to bring the bodies, Ambassador to Qatar Sanjiv Arora informed New Delhi.</p>
<p>Of the 10 injured, three are from Nepal, three are from Pakistan, two are from the Philippines, one is from Egypt and one is from India, the Gulf Times reported.</p>
<p><strong>Sreedharan to act as LS Secy-Gen</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">P Sreedharan, Secretary in the Lok Sabha Secretariat, will perform the duties of the Secretary-General for the time being, sources disclosed here on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>Speaker Meira Kumar, who had been away at her constituency Sasaram in Bihar for a week, passed orders to this effect soon after her return to the Capital Saturday evening following the retirement of the incumbent S Bal Shekar. He had succeeded T K Vishwanathan last September.</p>
<p>Sreedharan, an additional secretary, was incidentally promoted to the post of the secretary on February 28.</p>
<p>This elevation qualifies him for being considered for an appointment to the post of the secretary-general, which is on a par with the Cabinet Secretary.</p>
<p>Speaker Kumar has to consult the Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition for making a regular appointment.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997115&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Alleging Rahul Gandhi knew nothing about Amethi, Aam Aadmi Party leader Kumar Vishwas on Sunday said he would opt out of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections if the Congress leader was able to name all the 17 blocks in the constituency.</p>
<p>Addressing AAP&#8217;s first rally in industrial city Kanpur, he said there were also talks of Priyanka Gandhi being fielded by the Congress against him in the Parliamentary polls.</p>
<p>Vishwas alleged Rahul knew nothing about the region and dared him to name all the blocks in the constituency without any help.</p>
<p>If the Congress leader was able to do so, he would not contest the Lok Sabha elections, the AAP leader said.</p>
<p>Taking a dig at the Gandhi scion, he said the Congress vice-president was in a foreign country when a massive anti-graft campaign, spearheaded by Anna Hazare, was underway in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Vishwas further alleged Gandhi was also not seen when a huge protest erupted on the streets in the wake of December 16 gangrape.</p>
<p>He alleged widows in Rahul&#8217;s constituency were deprived of pension.</p>
<p>He said the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre was conspiring with the Akhilesh Yadav dispensation to put him behind bars.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997062&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jaitley-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997043" alt="BJP is not a party that will go on the track of vote bank politics and have religion-based reservation for Muslims. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jaitley-main.jpg" /></a> BJP is not a party that will go on the track of vote bank politics and have religion-based reservation for Muslims. (PTI)
<p>Against the backdrop of speculation about Narendra Modi&#8217;s comments suggesting a rethink on the FDI policy, BJP on Sunday said their opposition to FDI in retail will not change.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as FDI in retail is concerned, the BJP hasgenuine concerns against this and I don&#8217;t think, it is quite likely, that policy is going to be changed,&#8221; Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley told on a national news channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as present is concerned, I think it is quite unlikely that the BJP will change,&#8221; he said noting that for the present, that door is closed as no policy is a policy for the next 100 years.</p>
<p>Addressing a traders conference here on Thursday, Modi had asked the trading community not to run away from global challenges but adapt itself to modern practices like tying up with bigger stores and online trading, without referring to FDI in retail.</p>
<p>Jaitley admitted that the BJP was consciously trying to woo the Muslim community ahead of elections and said the party &#8220;will go full length&#8221; to implement its three underlined convictions of security, equality and economic progress towards them.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing wrong in it. It&#8217;s a good sign for India. It&#8217;s a good sign for BJP. It&#8217;s a good sign for the minority community members&#8230;. We are&#8230;Everybody has evolved&#8230; It&#8217;s an appeal being made,&#8221; he said admitting that the BJP was making an effort to reach out to the community.</p>
<p>He said as far as Muslims were concerned, BJP is not a party that will go on the track of vote bank politics and have religion-based reservation for Muslims.</p>
<p>On Pakistan, Jaitley said talks and terror cannot co-exist and BJP&#8217;s desire to talk will not outweigh the other surrounding circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jaitley said the attitude of BJP towards Pakistan if they come to power will be the same as it was during the NDA regime under Atal Behari Vajpayee.</p>
<p>&#8220;This whole passion and desire that you continue to have dialogue at the highest level irrespective of what the response of Pakistan is. If you have Pakistan&#8217;s attitude which is not responsive, it is not necessary that the heads of government meet,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be calibrated, it will be less emotional and it will be more realistic. If the situation is such that Pakistan wants a serious dialogue, the environment for the dialogue doesn&#8217;t have to be created by India. It has to be created by them,&#8221; the BJP leader said.</p>
<p>Jaitley said it is not NDA or UPA and not India which has to make sure how Pakistan conducts itself and a lot in India and Pakistan relationship depends on the internal environment in Pakistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Pakistan is less radicalised and it doesn&#8217;t allow these kind of elements to really dominate the relationship between India and Pakistan, I&#8217;m sure the relationship will progress,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>On the recent Navy accident, he attacked Defence Minister A K Antony for stopping procurements and turning the situation in the forces to a crisis level and promised to reverse it, if BJP came to power.</p>
<p>&#8220;That attitude (of stopping procurements) has to change,&#8221; he said, adding that one must start trusting people and putting systems in place when the government has confidence that it is doing things in a cleaner manner and not doing anything in a manner that is shady.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is no collateral agenda that the government has, you cannot allow one of the most sensitive areas of India &#8211; security, particularly considering the environment that we live in to continue to suffer because there is no procurement taking place,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jaitley also hoped that a situation like the former Army Chief V K Singh taking the government to court will not arise again.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the government is fair, is open, has the stature and the vision to resolve these issues in closed doors, I don&#8217;t think such a situation will ever arise again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Admitting that conventionally the party&#8217;s support amongst a particular minority community was a little less, he said the BJP will be second to none in making sure that it instills confidence in every section of society.</p>
<p>He said that it is in this context that BJP Chief Rajnath Singh made a &#8220;modest and a confidence instilling gesture&#8221; to Muslims at a recent gathering where he sought to apologise.</p>
<p>On Goods and Services Tax (GST), he said it was lack of confidence in the central government by states that was responsible for it not getting through and hoped this confidence will be rebuilt in the coming times if BJP comes to power.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997031&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rahulm1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1997041" alt="RAHULM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rahulm1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>In what can be termed as a major setback to Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, the Union Cabinet on Sunday rejected the ordinance route for anti-graft bills pushed by the Gandhi scion, while clearing an ordinance to amend the Prevention of atrocities against SC/ST act.</p>
<p>The Cabinet has meanwhile cleared Central reservation for the Jat community. With this the community now gets reservation in government jobs and educational institutions.</p>
<p>Approving changes to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill, the Cabinet directed the Planning Commission to grant special category status for five years to the successor state of Andhra Pradesh comprising 13 districts.</p>
<p>While discussing the issue of these ordinances, the Union Cabinet felt that &#8220;full deliberations&#8221; are required in Parliament keeping with the &#8220;highest traditions of democratic principles&#8221;, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari told reporters.</p>
<p>This was the second time in three days that the Cabinet decided against using the ordinance route on certain measures, which were being pushed by Rahul Gandhi as part of a &#8220;framework&#8221; to fight corruption.</p>
<p>The decision is believed to have been influenced by the apprehension that President Pranab Mukherjee would not give assent to these ordinances. Senior ministers like Law Minister Kapil Sibal and Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde met the President at least twice since Saturday, apparently to gauge his mood but evidently did not get any positive signal.</p>
<p>Sources said the Congress Core Group, headed by Sonia Gandhi, had yesterday given its assent to using the ordinance route to measures like Prevention of Corruption Act, Citizens&#8217; Right to Time-bound Delivery of Services and Citizens Charter Bill, SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Bill and Rights of Persons with Disability Bill.</p>

(PTI)
<p style="text-align:justify;">Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday assured people that he will do everything to get them their share of water from the Bhakra Dam for which the Hansi-Butana Canal has already been dug.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Some vested interests are plotting to derail our plan to get water to Haryana through the Hansi-Butana Canal but I would ensure that they do not succeed in their designs,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He gave this assurance while addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stones and inaugurating various projects at Ismaila village in the district.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The canal has been dug to ensure that Haryana&#8217;s share of water from Bhakra Dam reaches every part of the state, he said. The Chief Minister said that when he became an MP, he assured the people of the area that he would never compromise on the interests of the state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The people of the state are with me and I will fulfill every promise I made to them&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before Congress came to power, the area was backward. The people of the state gave him a chance to remove backwardness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the Congress came to power in 2005  and I became Chief Minister, people said my government won&#8217;t last long. But with the blessings of UPA Chairperson  Sonia Gandhi, and cooperation of the people, my government has lasted full term and performed excellently,&#8221; Hooda said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If people continue to support us, Congress will surely form government for the third consecutively term in Haryana,&#8221;he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997022&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The police on Sunday arrested Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (MSS) leader Akhil Gogoi for allegedly abetting and entering into a criminal conspiracy leading to self-immolation by a person here last week. The arrest triggered state-wide protest with supporters of the KMSS blocking roads and railway tracks, prompting police to cane them.</span></p>
<p>Gogoi was picked up around 4 am from his house in Chanmari after police broke open a door. The Kamrup CJM’s Court remanded him in four days’ police custody. Five other members of the KMSS were also arrested under the same charges.</p>
<p>SSP A P Tiwari said that altogether six FIRs have been registered in connection with the self-immolation in front of the secretariat on February 24.</p>
<p>Akhil Gogoi, who heads the KMSS, has been accused under Section 306 of abetting in the act leading to the death of one of his supporters, and under 120(B) of entering into a criminal conspiracy.</p>
<p>Pranab Boro, a member of the KMSS, had set himself on fire in front of the state secretariat during an agitation to press the issue of documents to people currently squatting on government land, forests and wetlands in the Assam capital. While the police had registered a case on its own, four FIRs were lodged by individual citizens.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997023&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/telanganam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997017" alt="Telangana supporters celebrate after the announcement of the separate state of Telangana at their party headquarters in Hyderabad. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/telanganam.jpg" /></a> Telangana supporters celebrate after the announcement of the separate state of Telangana at their party headquarters in Hyderabad. (Reuters)
<p>Amid suspense whether TRS would merge with Congress or forge an alliance, a crucial meeting of the regional party would be held on Monday to take a call on the issue.</p>
<p>The joint meeting of TRS politburo, MLAs and state executive would be held at the party office here to deliberate on the political strategy for the future.</p>
<p>The meeting comes against the backdrop of the ties between the two parties running into rough weather with the TRS taking exception to the Congress &#8220;poaching&#8221; on its leaders.</p>
<p>TRS president K Chandrasekhar Rao had announced that he would be willing to merge his party with Congress if the latter accepted the separate Telangana demand.</p>
<p>He had also called on Congress president Sonia Gandhi, along with his family, to thank her for the passage of the Telangana Bill in Parliament.</p>
<p>However, the strain in the ties came with TRS MLA G Aravind Reddy and its expelled MP Vijayashanti joining the national party last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is certainly in bad taste with the Congress party, while talking to us about a merger or an alliance, at the same time they go about poaching our sitting MLA Aravind Reddy&#8230; They also admitted one of our expelled MPs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore, this is something the Congress leadership needs to understand, that if you want to be friends with TRS, you cannot be picking up people from TRS and expect us to be friends also,&#8221; TRS MLA and Chandrasekhar Rao&#8217;s son K T Rama Rao said here on Friday last.</p>
<p>Moreover, several TRS leaders and workers are said to be against a merger with Congress.</p>
<p>Addressing a gathering here on Friday, the TRS president took objection to certain comments reportedly made by Union minister Jairam Ramesh during his visit to the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;A minister by name Jairam Ramesh came (to Hyderabad) yesterday. He said I am personally against the formation of Telangana. How can he insult Telangana sitting in Hyderabad, our land. How painful we feel, if a central minister speaks like this,&#8221; Rao had said.</p>
<p>He was also critical of the move to give some villages, allegedly facing submergence due to Polavaram multi-purpose irrigation project, to Seemandhra.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also felt that we should work together (with Congress) if there is respect and be good. The issue will be settled in a few days. We have a party meeting on March 3.</p>
<p>All important leaders would be there. I cannot individually decide. Let&#8217;s take a decision in the state party meeting. Whatever is good for Telangana, we will take that route,&#8221; the TRS president had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997013&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Arvind Kejriwal could contest against Narendra Modi if he decides to fight Lok Sabha election from Varanasi, AAP leaders indicated Sunday.</p>
<p>Addressing a rally before Kejriwal&#8217;s speech, party leader Sanjay Singh appealed to him to contest against Modi from Varanasi because there is a buzz that the BJP PM candidate will be fielded from the constituency.</p>
<p>Another senior leader Manish Sisodia in his speech said that &#8220;we want the people of Varanasi to answer all the issues that Kejriwal has raised on (Mukesh) Ambani.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kejriwal will ask Modi these questions from Varanasi.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former Delhi Chief Minister, who has himself not indicated his strategy on contesting Lok Sabha election, was silent on the issue during his speech.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997010&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>Most autorickshaw drivers will not be advertising for Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the coming Lok Sabha elections as they are upset with his government&#8217;s &#8220;failure&#8221; to implement promises made to them last month.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike in Delhi Assembly election, we would not advertise for AAP in the coming polls as Kejriwal government failed to implement any announcements made at a Mahasabha durign its 49-day rule,&#8221; said Rajendra Soni, general secretary of Delhi Autorickshaw Union which covers most of the auto drivers across Delhi.</p>
<p>Kejriwal had last month announced that transport department and traffic police would not seize autos for minor violations like drivers in not proper dress and that such action will only be taken if a vehicle didn&#8217;t have license, permit and fitness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Transport department and traffic police still continue to seize autos for minor violations. When we recently reminded transport and traffic officials about the government&#8217;s order, they said that they have not got any written direction from the government&#8217;s side,&#8221; Soni added.</p>
<p>Mukesh, an auto driver, said that 49 days were enough to issue written order or notification, but the  Kejriwal government didn&#8217;t do anything in this regard.</p>
<p>AAP-led government on February 7 had also announced its decision to issue 5500 NCR permits to autos.</p>
<p>&#8220;This promise was also not fulfilled. Without Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments&#8217; consent, Delhi&#8217;s autos cannot ply in Noida,Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Gurgaon,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There are nearly 80,000 autorickshaws running in the capital.</p>
<p>The Aam Aadmi Party had acknowledged their role in its electoral success and promised to address their grievances.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997000&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kejriwalm.jpg" /></a> Kejriwal accused Modi of maintaining silence on FDI in retail. (PTI)
<p>Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday claimed that his party will secure 100 seats in Lok Sabha election and that the next government cannot be formed without its support as he launched a fresh attack on Narendra Modi over his alleged links with Mukesh Ambani.</p>
<p>Addressing a rally here as part of a three-day road show in Uttar Pradesh, he accused Modi of maintaining silence on FDI in retail and accused BJP in Rajasthan of getting into a &#8220;setting&#8221; on the issue of Robert Vadra&#8217;s land deal.</p>
<p>Kejriwal said he will visit Gujarat from March 5 to 8 to see the so called development claimed by Modi in the state.</p>
<p>He also did not spare the ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh saying that there have been more than 100 riots in the state in the last two years. Targeting Mayawati&#8217;s BSP, he said voting for it is a waste because it amounts to voting for Modi.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only AAP can give an honest government. If you all, Hindus, Muslims and people from other castes come together and do not come under the poisonous influence of other parties, then I can assure you that this time your (people&#8217;s) government will be formed in the Centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;AAP is going to get at least 100 seats in the Lok Sabha elections. Moreover, we are going to get more seats than Congress. At least the government in Centre will not be formed without AAP&#8217;s support.</p>
<p>&#8220;AAP will help in forming the central government and we will change the face of the country,&#8221; said the 45-year-old former Delhi Chief Minister.</p>
<p>Kejriwal questioned Modi&#8217;s stoic silence over FDI in retail, alleging the principal opposition party has received money from a multinational retail firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;BJP was saying that when they would come in power, they would not allow FDI in retail. Congress had taken money from foreign companies and they were trying to bring them here, but BJP was opposing the move.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, three days back Modi did not speak on this issue when asked by people. Even before election, the setting has been done. It means BJP has received money from Walmart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Escalating his attacks on Modi, the AAP leader alleged that the former&#8217;s rallies are being &#8220;funded&#8221; by Mukesh Ambani.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modi is using Mukesh Ambani&#8217;s choppers and aeroplanes. I have pictures as proof. In public you say I used to sell tea. Howcome a tea-seller gets this many number of helicopters,&#8221; he questioned.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996996&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/votingm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997005" alt="The 2009 polls were held in five phases from April 16 to May 13. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/votingm1.jpg" /></a> The 2009 polls were held in five phases from April 16 to May 13. (AP)
<p>Polling in the upcoming <a title="Voting schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2014" href="http://http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/voting-schedule-for-lok-sabha-elections-2014/" target="_blank">Lok Sabha Elections</a> is likely to commence in the second week of April and may be spread over seven phases, the longest so far, highly placed sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The probable dates for the commencement of polling are between April 7 and 10, the sources in the Election Commission said while emphasising that the poll schedule was still being &#8220;fine tuned&#8221;.</p>
<p>As of now, the plan is to have voting, involving over 81 crore voters, in seven phases but efforts are on to reduce that to six phases. The 2009 polls were held in five phases from April 16 to May 13.</p>
<p>The much-expected announcement of the schedule is expected in the middle of this week. The Model Code of Conduct for governments and political parties will come into force from the date of announcement.</p>
<p>However, the Election Commission has ruled out advancing the schedule or compressing it to avoid the summer heat, a demand put forward at the all-party meeting convened by the Commission last month.</p>
<p>The term of the current Lok Sabha expires on June 1 and the new House has to be constituted by May 31.</p>
<p>Along with the Lok Sabha polls, Andhra Pradesh, including the regions comprising the newly-carved out Telangana, Odisha and Sikkim will go to polls to elect new assemblies.</p>
<p>Highly placed sources in the Commission said finishing touches were being given to the schedule. Consultations with the Union Home Ministry, state governments, para-military forces and Chief Electoral Officers of states have already been completed.</p>
<p>There was speculation that the announcement may be slightly delayed for the Centre to promulgate some of the ordinances it plans to bring out against corruption and on some other issues but there is no confirmation of it.</p>
<p>If a six or a seven-phased schedule is finalised, it would be the first time the country would witness elections over such a long period.</p>
<p>The sources said that the attempt is to &#8220;maximise&#8221; use of forces and the polling days. In the first phase, polling is expected to be held in some of the naxal-hit states and in some North-East states.</p>
<p>For the first time in parliamentary polls, a system of paper trail for electronic voting will be introduced in some constituencies on a trial basis.</p>
<p>There have been demands that a paper trail should be in place so that a fool-proof record is created and controversies avoided in case of a dispute or an election petition filed in courts.</p>
<p>In a bid to create a level-playing field, the Model Code of Conduct bars governments in the Centre and in the states from making any kind of announcements regarding new schemes or promises so as to lure voters.</p>
<p>The Commission has also issued guidelines to political parties asking them to explain the rationale of financing the promises they make in their election manifestos.</p>
<p>The guidelines that followed Supreme Court directions in this regard have now been made part of the Model Code.</p>
<p>An estimated 81.4 crore voters will be eligible to vote in the coming elections after 9.71 new voters have been added to the rolls since the last elections.</p>
<p>From the coming elections, candidates in a Parliamentary constituency in bigger states can spend up to Rs 70 lakh on their campaign, up from Rs 40 lakh in 2011. In the 2009 elections it was Rs 25 lakh.</p>
<p>Another first in the Lok Sabha elections will be the introduction of &#8220;None of the Above&#8221; (NOTA) option in voting, which was put in vogue in the assembly elections a few months ago.</p>
<p>The electoral rolls are ready after being updated with January one this year as the cut-off date.</p>
<p>A total of 1.1 crore poll personnel, half of them being security forces will be deployed for the smooth conduct of polls and to ensure that they are free and fair.</p>
<p>Poll officials said the database of the civilian staff to be deployed for conducting polls has been prepared and at least 5.5 million civilian staff would be deployed.</p>
<p>The list of central government employees to be deployed for poll duty as micro observers in sensitive polling stations has also been prepared.</p>
<p>About 8 lakh polling stations have been set up across the country keeping in view the convenience of both the voters and the poll staff.</p>
<p>Preparations have been made for deployment of around 12 lakh electronic voting machines with the addition of another 2.5 lakh new EVMs which it had ordered with various public-sector companies.</p>
<p>During the 2009 polls, there were 714 million voters against 671 million voters in 2004 Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>The Commission favours a multi-phased election for a country of India&#8217;s size and electorate because it is better that there is &#8220;complete satisfaction&#8221; of voters.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it can lead to &#8220;discontentment&#8221; in case of any shortcomings, they said.</p>
<p>Some states will be accorded special treatment due to their being affected by extremism.</p>
<p>The EC sources said the Commission has not conducted any election in a single go in one phase after 1971 as the size of the electorate in the world&#8217;s largest democracy has grown considerably over the years.</p>
<p>The officials also said that the entire poll process takes around three months time. But there is a limit of six weeks time from the announcement of the schedule to the first date of poll in view of the Supreme Court direction that the Model Code of Conduct inhibiting government decisions cannot be an unduly long period.</p>
<p>They said the Commission has to give around two weeks&#8217; time for government formation before the term of the Lok Sabha or a state assembly expires. In the states of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim, which will have assembly polls along with the Lok Sabha polls, the Commission will place two EVMs alongside for voters to vote in both the elections.</p>
<p>Andhra Pradesh has 42 Lok Sabha constituencies and a 294-member Assembly. Out of this, 25 Lok Sabha constituencies and 175 Assembly constituencies will remain with the residuary state of Andhra Pradesh, while Telangana will have 17 Lok Sabha seats and 117 Assembly seats.</p>
<p>Odisha will also elect its 147-member assembly while Sikkim has a 32-member state assembly.</p>
<p>The terms of Andhra Pradesh assembly is till June 2, that of Odisha is till June 7, and of Sikkim till May 21.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996974&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/telengana-medium.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996984 " alt="telengana-medium" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/telengana-medium.jpg" /></a> Congress MPs, MLAs and ministers in the erstwhile Kiran Kumar Reddy government are taking out victory rallies. (PTI)
<p>With the division of Andhra Pradesh a reality now, political parties in the state are redrawing their strategies with the Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly elections looming.</p>
<p>President&#8217;s rule was imposed in Andhra Pradesh as Chief Minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy and also a number of Congress MLAs quit their posts and party in Seemandhra in protest against state&#8217;s division.</p>
<p>Riding the formation of Telangana, the ruling Congress is hoping to make substantial gains in the region which has 17 Lok Sabha and 119 assembly segments.</p>
<p>Congress MPs, MLAs and ministers in the erstwhile Kiran Kumar Reddy government are taking out victory rallies and events to thank Congress president Sonia Gandhi for the passage of Telangana bill in Parliament.</p>
<p>Congress expressed hope that TRS, which is now a powerful force in the region, would merge with it, but the ties appeared to have run into rough weather in the wake of the national party &#8220;poaching&#8221; on some TRS leaders.</p>
<p>The issue of possible merger or alliance between the two parties is expected to be clear this week with the TRS holding a crucial party meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Either merger or alliance with TRS is expected to boost Congress&#8217; prospects in the region.</p>
<p>Under attack for state&#8217;s division, Congress, however, faces a bleak future in Seemandhra (with 25 Lok Sabha and 175 assembly seats) and its leaders are trying to highlight the development package offered the residual Andhra Pradesh to reach out to the voters.</p>
<p>TRS leaders are expected to do well in the region as it is their party which took the separate statehood demand to the national centre-stage.</p>
<p>The main opposition TDP is upbeat in Seemandhra as it appears to be making gains in the region due to its Chief N Chandrababu Naidu&#8217;s pro-development and strong leader image.</p>
<p>Ministers from Seemandhra in the erstwhile Reddy government and other Congress MLAs, who were opposed to the division of Andhra Pradesh, are joining the TDP which is a boost to its prospects.</p>
<p>The picture is not too rosy for TDP in Telangana as TRS and Congress appear to be the clear favourites as the two parties are credited with the formation of separate state.</p>
<p>In a setback to TDP in Telangana, some of its MLAs have joined TRS in recent times.</p>
<p>YSR Congress expects to do well in Seemandhra as it favoured united Andhra Pradesh and also due to the charisma of its leader Y S Jaganmohan Reddy and the good will for late Y S<br />
Rajasekhara Reddy.</p>
<p>The party, however, faces an uphill task in Telangana because of its stance against the division of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>BJP is hoping to do well in Telangana as it had been consistent in supporting separate Telangana demand, though it shares the blame in Seemandhra along with Congress for division.</p>
<p>The party hopes that the popularity of its Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi would help.</p>
<p>CPI has been a strong supporter of separate Telangana and it expects to reap an electoral benefit in the region for its campaign in support of statehood demand.</p>
<p>CPI, on the other hand, was opposed to division of Andhra Pradesh, and it can expect to do well in areas of its strength. Both the Left parties are expected to have an electoral alliance with major parties.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996971&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mulayamm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996956" alt="Samajwadi Party Supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav with party leader Mohammad Azam Khan during a public rally &quot;Desh Banao Desh Bachao&quot; in Allahabad on Sunday. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mulayamm.jpg" /></a> Samajwadi Party Supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav with party leader Mohammad Azam Khan during a public rally &#8220;Desh Banao Desh Bachao&#8221; in Allahabad on Sunday. (PTI)
<p>In a stinging attack on Narendra Modi, SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday alleged that the BJP was trying to hoodwink Muslims by talking of apology after &#8220;having allowed their carnage&#8221; in 2002 and dismissed as &#8220;baseless propaganda&#8221; Gujarat Chief Minister&#8217;s development claims.</p>
<p>Hitting back at Modi for his taunt that Mulayam could not make UP as prosperous as Gujarat as the feat required &#8220;a 56-inch-chest&#8221;, Mulayam raked the 2002 riots issue at a rally in the city where UP Minister Azam Khan asked Muslims to defeat &#8220;the mass murderer who had called you a puppy &#8220;, a reference to the remarks made by the BJP prime ministerial candidate in an interview last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to remind him that I had demonstrated my strength when I visited Gujarat in the aftermath of the brutal massacre of Muslims. I went there and met and consoled victims of the horrible communal riots notwithstanding Modi&#8217;s threat that his administration would not be responsible if I was attacked by mobs,&#8221; he said as Modi addressed a parallel rally in Lucknow.</p>
<p>Describing Muslims as &#8220;a brave, sensible and trustworthy community&#8221;, Yadav charged BJP with &#8220;hoodwinking&#8221; the minority community by &#8220;sounding apologetic after having allowed their carnage&#8221; &#8211; an obvious reference to the recent statement of BJP chief Rajnath Singh.</p>
<p>Firebrand party-leader and cabinet minister Azam Khan also came down heavily on both Congress and BJP, holding the former responsible for Partition which &#8220;drove a wedge between Hindus and Muslims&#8221;.</p>
<p>Khan said Muslims &#8220;ought to defeat the mass murderer who had called you a puppy and is now seeking your votes, realising that you may not be kings but without your blessings nobody could ever become a king either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mulayam also termed as &#8220;baseless propaganda&#8221; the development claims of Modi during his over a decade-long tenure as the Chief Minister of Gujarat.</p>
<p>Yadav quoted a number of sources to claim that &#8220;more than 30 per cent of women and 50 per cent of children are malnourished in Gujarat&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rivers of the state are among the most polluted. Daily wages given to those working in the unorganised sector are lower than that in UP. You (Modi) call this good governance and development? I call it nothing but baseless propaganda,&#8221; Yadav said.</p>
<p>Yadav also attacked Congress for having &#8220;remained silent in the face of repeated transgression of the national boundaries by China&#8221; during the decade-long UPA rule while blaming both Congress and BJP for &#8220;recognising Tibet as a part of China despite the plateau&#8217;s strategic importance for India&#8221;.</p>
<p>He claimed that both the parties were &#8220;unable to find candidates of their own for the Lok Sabha elections and hence embarked upon a poaching spree&#8221; and said the return of Ram Vilas Paswan to the NDA fold, whose Lok Janshakti Party has been offered seven seats in Bihar, was &#8220;a manifestation of desperation&#8221; in the saffron party camp.</p>
<p>Earlier, Yadav&#8217;s son and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav claimed that his government had &#8220;accomplished in two years what previous regimes could not in full five-year-terms&#8221; and exhorted the people to &#8220;help the party win as many seats in the Lok Sabha elections as possible so that no government is formed in the Centre without our support&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996919&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/udhdhav-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996951" alt="Uddhav said despite Pawar being the agriculture minister, Maharashtra was highest ranked in farmers' suicides and lowest in development." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/udhdhav-main.jpg" /></a> Uddhav said despite Pawar being the agriculture minister, Maharashtra was highest ranked in farmers&#8217; suicides and lowest in development.
<p>Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday described Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar as a politician who has his feet planted in two camps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pawar is a politician who stands on two stones,&#8221; Uddhav said, using a Marathi phrase.</p>
<p>Pawar was exploring option of a post-poll alliance with NDA.</p>
<p>But Shiv Sena opposed his move to join NDA after which the NCP chief did a U-turn on BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi&#8217;s alleged role in Gujarat riots, Uddhav claimed, while talking to reporters at his residence, after handing out BEST bus passes to freedom fighters and accredited journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;When reports of Pawar&#8217;s meeting with Modi surfaced, the NCP leader defended his meeting saying he did not meet a terrorist. But when Shiv Sena opposed having NCP in the &#8216;Mahayuti&#8217;, Pawar remembered the Gujarat riots,&#8221; Uddhav said.</p>
<p>Pawar, had recently said there was no need for a debate on the 2002 Gujarat riots after courts had ruled on Modi&#8217;s role during the communal conflagration. But, he later took a U-turn and targeted Modi for &#8220;mass murder&#8221;.</p>
<p>Uddhav said despite Pawar being the agriculture minister, Maharashtra was highest ranked in farmers&#8217; suicides and lowest in development.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is Pawar interested in cricket. Why is he contesting MCA polls and staying away from Lok Sabha elections?&#8221; Uddhav asked.</p>
<p>The Lok Sabha polls will be a straight fight between Congress-led alliance and NDA, he said, adding that &#8220;vote to any other party will mean vote for the Congress.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also criticised the Maharashtra government&#8217;s decision to regularise slums till the year 2000 on the eve of elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government has just told them to continue with their life in slums without any facility. Only our government will give them a better life,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Sena leader also said that the political situation in the state was in favour of BJP-led NDA.</p>
<p>Shiv Sena has declared candidates for 15 of the 22 seats and the remaining will be announced in a few days.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996936&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Former Army Chief General V K Singh today said social activist Anna Hazare is impressed by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee&#8217;s personality and not influenced by her ideology.</p>
<p>&#8220;She (Mamata) lives with simplicity and that is why Anna appreciates her. She stays in her own house in Kalighat and wears a slipper and a simple saree. It is not ideology, but about the personality,&#8221; Singh told PTI on-board Lucknow Mail. He was on his way to attend Narendra Modi&#8217;s rally here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anna is on a mission to develop rural India and from there the development should only move forward. No body should have any objection to it,&#8221; Singh said.</p>
<p>Stating that Anna wanted to get &#8220;good&#8221; people elected in the country for the formation of a strong Lokpal, the former Army Chief said, &#8220;a strong Lokpal should be made for that a good person must be elected for the purpose.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996920&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Security forces have intensified combing operation to nab top Maoist leader Sabyasachi Panda after three arrested women members of Odisha Maobadi Party (OMP), led by the rebel leader, revealed he was shot at in a recent encounter.</p>
<p>Police arrested three women rebels and unearthed a huge cache of arms and ammunition along Ganjam-Gajapati border. Nikita alias Minati Majhi, Dandingi Antia alias Dandingi Majhi and Sukanti Majhi alias Jhunu were nabbed by police three days back from a camp in Mukhi jungle near Gajapati&#8217;s Dimbiripankala village.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are hot on the trail of Sabyasachi in both the districts,&#8221; DIG (southern range) Amitav Thakur said. The women ultras said Sabyasachi took a bullet on his thigh during an exchange of fire between security personnel and extremists at Salimagochha in Ganjam two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Dealing a body blow to Sabyasachi, police have arrested six of his aides, including the women cadres, in recent raids and encounters.</p>
<p>&#8221;Basing on intelligence inputs, combing has been intensified along Ganjam-Gajapati border,&#8221; said SP (Ganjam) Ashish Kumar Singh. The operation would continue till his arrest, said SP (Gajapati) C S Meena.</p>

(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modim1.jpg" /></a> Modi said top political leadership is the need of the hour. (PTI)
<p>BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Sunday  attacked the third front, saying the &#8220;experiment&#8221; will prove &#8220;costly&#8221; for the country which needed a government that could take decisions and come up to the people&#8217;s expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is my firm belief that the country is at a decisive stage where such an experiment (of a third front) would prove costly. The country needs a government that can take decisions and come up to the expectations of the people,&#8221; he told a Hindi daily in an interview.</p>
<p>Modi said all the parties who are advocating such a front emerged and got established on the basis of anti-Congress politics but were forced to join hands with Congress due to political opportunism at one time or the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;And now when there is an anger against Congress in the country, those working towards the third front are in a way actually helping Congress,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Promising to root out corruption by adopting a &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy towards it, the Gujarat Chief Minister made a veiled attack on the country&#8217;s top political leadership, saying if they are &#8220;themselves corrupt or give their silent approval to corruption due to their own weaknesses, then who will stop it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said for curbing corruption, what is need is that the top political leadership should be &#8220;credible&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996847&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested a suspected Indian Mujahideen (IM) activist in connection with Bodh Gaya serial blasts from a village in Bihar&#8217;s Arwal district, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Acting on a tip off, the NIA team arrested the suspected IM activist Mohd Irfan from Auwgila village late last night, Superintendent of Police (SP) Shafi-Ul Haque said.</p>
<p>Immediately after his arrest, the NIA team took Irfan to Patna in a vehicle under tight security for questioning in connection with the Bodh Gaya serial blasts, the SP said.</p>
<p>Haque said that NIA had detained two more persons &#8212; Raj Nandan and Ranjan &#8212; for interrogation from different villages of the same district and released the duo after their complicity in the Bodh Gaya blasts could not be ascertained.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stories of love and longing from ancient Sanskrit literature, lesser known among modern readers have been rendered into English by retired diplomat and Haksar, acclaimed for his translation of the Kama Sutra.</p>
<p>In &#8220;The Seduction of Shiva: Tales of Life And Love&#8221; Haksar has compiled an eclectic stories of erotic love from ancient Sanskrit texts which academics have estimated to have been spread over a period of 1500 years, nearly a millennium from the present times. &#8221;All great literature deals with the theme of the relation between the sexes and I have tried to bring together a collection of stories covering as big a period as possible,&#8221; Haksar said during the book release here recently.</p>
<p>The first story in the anthology talks about how the god Shiva is seduced by Mohini, the female form assumed by Vishnu. In another tale, Urvashi curses the Pandava prince Arjuna when he rejects her advances. The protagonist in another story pursues pleasure first as a man and then as a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stories in the &#8216;Seduction of Shiva&#8217; have been taken over a over 1500 years let me drew material from not only from what is called secular writing but also literature traditionally regarded as scriptural like tales from the Puranas,&#8221; says Haksar.</p>
<p>The story of Bodhisattva, before he became the Buddha is also narrated in the tome. &#8220;The tale of Prince Sudhana from the eighth century Divyavadana is also a love story, the only one in my knowledge which features the future Buddha as a lover,&#8221; the author says.</p>
<p>Most jataka accounts of his deeds in former births dwell on the cultivation of virtues like compassion, truth patience and self control as prerequisites for eventual enlightenment points out Haksar.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996745&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Russian cyber security solutions firm Kaspersky Lab  found that about four million malicious applications were used by cyber criminals to distribute mobile malware for Android-based devices.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996735&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India comes second on the list of  most  cyber attacks on mobile devices- prone countries with a major chunk of these intrusions designed for phishing and stealing banking details, a report by security software maker Kaspersky said. Russian cyber security solutions firm Kaspersky Lab said Russia topped the list of attacks on mobile phones, accounting for 40.34 per cent of all attacked unique users.</p>
<p>India, with 7.9 per cent of attacks, stood at the second spot, followed by Vietnam (3.96 per cent), Ukraine (3.84 per cent) and the UK (3.42 per cent). Other countries in the top 10 included Germany (3.2 per cent), Kazakhstan (2.88 per cent), the US (2.13 per cent), Malaysia (2.12 per cent) and Iran (2.01 per cent). During 2013, nearly 100,000 new malicious programs for mobile devices were detected, more than double the previous year&#8217;s figure of 40,059 samples, Kaspersky said.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 98.1 per cent of all mobile malware detected in 2013 targeted Android devices,&#8221; it added. The report also found that about four million malicious applications were used by cybercriminals to distribute mobile malware for Android-based devices. &#8220;The majority of mobile malware in 2013 targeted users money. The number of mobile malware modifications designed for phishing, the theft of bank card information and money from bank accounts increased by a factor of almost 20,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Kaspersky added that it had blocked about 2,500 attempted infections by banking Trojans. &#8220;Banking Trojans are by far the most dangerous type of mobile malware for users. Some of those detected in 2013 were more geared towards stealing money from bank accounts rather than from a victim&#8217;s mobile account, which significantly increases the potential losses,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Vulnerabilities in the Android OS architecture and its growing popularity were important factors behind the increase in Android banking Trojans in 2013. Cybercriminals appear to have become obsessed with this method of making money. At the beginning of the year there were just 64 known banking Trojans, but by the end of 2013 Kaspersky Lab&#8217;s collection contained 1,321 unique samples.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, the majority of banking Trojan attacks target users in Russia and the CIS. However, that is unlikely to last for long: given the cybercriminals&#8217; keen interest in user bank accounts, the activity of mobile banking Trojans is expected to grow in other countries in 2014,&#8221; Kaspersky Lab Virus Analyst Victor Chebyshev said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996735&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>India is home to the fifth largest group of billionaires in the world and Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, is the country&#8217;s richest man with a personal fortune of USD 18 billion, says a report.</p>
<p>According China-based research firm Hurun&#8217;s 2014 global rich list, Mukesh Ambani is ranked 41st in the list that was topped by Bill Gates, whose personal networth stood at a whopping USD 68 billion.</p>
<p>Other noted Indians in the list include Lakshmi N Mittal, ranked 49th with a personal net worth of USD 17 billion.</p>
<p>Dilip Sanghvi of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Wipro&#8217;s Azim Premji are both ranked 77th with a personal wealth of USD 13.5 billion each. Tata Sons&#8217; Pallonji Mistry is ranked 93rd with a personal wealth of USD 12 billion.</p>
<p>SP Hinduja &amp; family is ranked 93rd on the list, with a net worth of USD 12 billion.</p>
<p>In the global rich list, Gates was followed by Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s Warren Buffett (2nd) with a personal wealth of USD 64 billion and Amancio Ortega of Inditex is ranked 3rd with USD 62 billion fortune.</p>
<p>The fourth position iss claimed by Carlos Slim Helu &amp; family (USD 60 billion) while Oracle&#8217;s Larry Ellison with USD 60 billion was ranked fifth.</p>
<p>The report said that during the past year the Indian rupee weakened 12 per cent against the US Dollar, making it harder for Indians to make the cut-off.</p>
<p>Despite the currency fluctuations, India has improved its position over last year. In the 2014 Hurun global rich list, the country is ranked fifth with 70 billionaires, 17 more than 2013.</p>
<p>Interestingly, India has higher number of these super rich individuals than Germany, Switzerland, France and Japan.</p>
<p>The combined wealth of the Indians billionaires comes to a staggering USD 390 billion.</p>
<p>The US is home to 481 billionaires, followed by China with 358 billionaires. The US and China now have half of all billionaires on the planet, the report said, adding that the UK, Japan, Switzerland, India and Russia are growing fast in terms of billionaires.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mumbai is home to 33 billionaires and is among the top six billionaire cities in the world.</p>
<p>New York is officially the &#8216;Billionaire Capital of the World&#8217; as 84 of the Hurun Billionaires live in the &#8216;Big Apple&#8217;, up 14 from 70 last year.</p>
<p>The list is a compilation of US dollar billionaires and wealth calculations were a snapshot of the positions on January 17, 2014. The list ranked 1,867 billionaires from 68 countries. The total wealth of the these super rich people amounted to an eye-popping USD 6.9 trillion.</p>
<p>Of the 1,867 billionaires, 946 saw their wealth increase and there were 482 new faces. Only 318 individuals saw their wealth decrease and 123 remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The average age is 64, up one year from 2013. One in nine billionaires is a female, compared with one in ten last year, the report said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996734&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modim.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1996429 " alt=" (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modim.jpg" /></a> &#8220;Modi is a threat to secularism, while Rahul is not. Not because he is secular, he is not a force,&#8221; said Tyagi (AP).
<p>Janata Dal (United) today ruled out any return to the National Democratic Alliance regardless of whether Bharatiya Janata Party decides to go for a prime ministerial candidate other than Narendra Modi after Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>&#8220;JD(U) will under no condition go back to NDA even if Modi is not made PM (candidate) and they make a leader such as LK Advani, Sushma Swaraj or Rajnath Singh as their PM candidate after the elections,&#8221; said JD(U) secretary general K.C Tyagi.</p>
<p>He was responding to a question on whether JD(U) would reconsider its stand if a situation arose after the elections where the BJP-led NDA would need to take the support of former allies to form the government.</p>
<p>The situation in June, 2013, was different, he said. The party was of the view that if BJP made anyone other than Modi the PM candidate, then it would remain within the NDA.</p>
<p>Asked about Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi&#8217;s political agenda, Tyagi said, &#8220;Modi is a threat to secularism, while Rahul is not. Not because he is secular, he is not a force.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked whether Congress leaders had met Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar on the issue of seat adjustment, Tyagi replied, &#8220;I neither confirm nor deny (that).&#8221;</p>
<p>Until and unless special status is granted to Bihar, there is no question of meeting, sitting or chatting with&#8230; Congress. But it is too late also.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996727&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>BJP Prime Ministerial candidate <a title="Third front experiment will prove costly for the country: Narendra Modi" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/third-front-experiment-will-prove-costly-for-the-country-narendra-modi/" target="_blank">Narendra Modi</a> on Sunday launched a scathing attack against SP, BSP and Congress, saying they were misleading the people under the veil of secularism to hide their failures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though heat of elections is yet to be felt, there is a wave in favour of BJP due to which &#8220;sabka vinash&#8221; (rout of SP, BSP and Congress) is certain&#8230;.For them secularism is all about vote bank to mislead the people,&#8221; the <a title="Slogans ready, Modi’s ad campaign from this week" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/slogans-ready-modis-ad-campaign-from-this-week/" target="_blank">BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate</a> told a massive rally here.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are misleading the people by wearing the veil of secularism to conceal their failures,&#8221; the Gujarat Chief Minister said.</p>
<p>Hitting out at the SP government on the issue of communal violence, Modi asked SP chief <a title="In UP, Modi keeps focus on Mulayam" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/in-up-modi-keeps-focus-on-mulayam/" target="_blank">Mulayam Singh Yadav</a> to explain as to why so many riots had taken place in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the past one year of your son&#8217;s (Akhilesh&#8217;s) rule, more than 150 riots have taken place in UP, while there was not even a single riot in Gujarat in the last 10 years. Not even a curfew was clamped there. Don&#8217;t compare Gujarat with UP on development,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Accusing SP, BSP and Congress was using seclarism as a poll slogan and a tool to grab power, Modi said that for BJP secularism was about uniting people and ensuring development.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secularism is article of faith for us. It is to unite people and do development&#8230;.For them its a tool to grab power and an election slogan,&#8221; the BJP leader said.</p>
<p>Taking on the SP supremo, Modi claimed that Mulayam Yadav in his address in Allahabad had conceded defeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Netaji (Mulayam) has conceded defeat in his address in the SP rally&#8230;.by saying that he cannot compete with the crowd at my rally&#8230;.By talking about development, Yadav has been forced (by us) to leave his old ways and come to this topic&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been talking about politics of development for past 10 years and I am happy that he has also started talking about it,&#8221; Modi said.</p>
<p>He said instead of giving false facts about Gujarat, it would have been better if he (Mulayam) would have given an account of work done by him in UP.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is spreading lies about Gujarat&#8230;.He should first visit Gujarat and see that electricity is available there 24 hours, 365 days while in UP there is no power. In UP, there is reservation as far as distribution of electricity is concerned. Areas of Netaji are getting power, while other places did not have power&#8230;.,&#8221; he sai</p>
<p>On the law and order front, Modi alleged that &#8220;due to hooliganism of SP leaders, 45 crimes took place right under your (Mulayam&#8217;s) nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were over 20,000 cases of atrocities against women in UP alone&#8230;.In Kanpur, medical students were manhandled by aides of an MLA and later lathicharged by the police and faced brutality by them due to which doctors in the entire state are agitating&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The politics of hooliganism will not be tolerated anymore&#8230;.These misdeeds say everything and I do not need to elaborate,&#8221; Modi said.</p>
<p>He said that there were two camps in Samajwadi Party &#8211; one &#8216;Samaj Virdohi Party&#8217; and another &#8216;Sukhwadi Party, which is engaged in fun. Had Ram Manohar Lohia been here, he would had been pained, he said.<br />
Alleging that nothing concrete was done to ensure develoment in UP, Modi said even traditional industries were not promoted due to which they became sick.</p>
<p>Attacking central ministers from UP without taking any names, the BJP leader alleged that &#8220;there is one who has &#8216;eaten coal&#8217;, while the name of another, who talks a lot in other countries, came up in connection with corruption through his NGO in the name of providing facilities to handicapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, there is another who, defending his colleague, says he could not do corruption of Rs 70 lakhs and he would have believed the corruption allegation if amount had been Rs 70 crore,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Targeting UP Cabinet Minster Azam Khan on the buffalo theft issue, Modi said that here there is no news when someone&#8217;s son goes missing but the minister&#8217;s buffalo theft hogged media space due to &#8220;police activeness&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was waiting for the minister&#8217;s reaction that due to the incident there is threat to secularism,&#8221; Modi said taking a jibe at the SP minister.</p>
<p>Striking an emotional chord with backward community by saying he came from a backward class, Modi maintained, &#8220;It was his party BJP, which named a person from backward community who had grown up in poverty by selling tea as a Prime Ministerial candidate&#8221;. No other party could do so, he said.</p>
<p>He said that the coming 10 years were crucial for the backward, dalits and poor and their lives would witness a change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to sit as a watchman of Delhi&#8217;s coffer and no one&#8217;s &#8216;hand&#8217; can reach there. Even those riding &#8216;cycle&#8217; and &#8216;elephant&#8217; will not be allowed to put their hand on it,&#8221; Modi said.</p>
<p>Wooing the minority community, Modi said, &#8220;These parties did not care when you raised problems of unemployment, irrigation, price rise, poverty or even admission of your kids in school&#8230;.They say leave these issues as there is a threat to secularism to hide their failure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giving figures of Haj applications from Gujarat, he said that though the quota was less there, applicants were more as compared to Uttar Pradesh as economic status of Muslims here was not good.</p>
<p>&#8220;The economic status of Muslims is not good here&#8230;.They are not treated as humans but as a vote bank&#8230;.and this has ruined them&#8221;, he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996722&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>“We met the home minister today and requested him to form a committee to study the viability of Gorkhaland state as the centre has done in the case of Bodoland,” said Roshan Giri. “He told us the state government’s consent is also needed to form such a committee.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nineteen years after a 13-year-old boy went missing, Kerala police have found he was murdered for a gold chain. In the interregnum between the crime and its delayed cracking, the accused allegedly poisoned his accomplice and kept the boy’s family under the impression he was kidnapped, the police said.</p>
<p>Muthumoolayil Mahadevan, son of Vishwananthan Achari, went missing on September 8, 1995 from his home at Changanassery in Kottayam district. After several rounds of probe, initiated at the intervention of the Kerala HC, police Wednesday arrested M E Harikumar, now 43. On Thursday, the police found the accused had also murdered his accomplice Salimon by poisoning. The mysterious death of another accomplice Pramod alias Kannan is also being probed.</p>
<p>Police said Harikumar, addicted to buying lottery tickets, had been running a cycle shop near Achari’s store. Mahadevan had gone to repair his cycle when Harikumar lured him to his shop and strangulated him to death. Police said the motive was to rob the boy of a gold chain as he needed money to buy lottery tickets. He disposed the body with the help of accomplices Salimon and Pramod.<br />
Harikumar made anonymous calls and sent letters, saying they had kidnapped the boy. Achari lodged a complaint with the police. The boy’s family later moved the Kerala HC which issued an order to constitute a special team to probe the case. Achari died in 2006 while his wife Vijayalakshmi passed away three years ago.</p>
<p>Police said the breakthrough came after a worker at Achari’s shop said he had seen the Mahadevan going to Harikumar’s cycle shop. Police grilled Harikumar, who confessed to the crime. Police said Salimon, one of the two accomplices, used to extract money from Harikumar threatening to reveal the crime. Tired of intimidation, Harikumar invited Salimon to his shop and poisoned him.<br />
Investigating officer K J Simon said a fresh murder case has been registered based on Harikumar’s revelation that he murdered Salimon. Meanwhile, the death of Pramod has also come under police eye and a probe is being launched.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996629&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>J&amp;K CM Omar Abdullah and his ministers spent more than Rs 9 crore to renovate their bungalows and purchase furniture in the past two years, state government officials have said. They also spent Rs 9 crore on air travel on board the state’s two helicopters and one aircraft in the past two years, they added.</p>
<p>Despite a blanked ban since 2009, the VIPs spent over Rs 1.43 crore on furniture. Nearly Rs 7.34 crore was spent on repair and renovation of their bungalows, including private ones. The highest amount — Rs 1.26 crore — was spent on the CM’s official residences.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996627&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A loud no-nonsense cop and a soft-spoken judge who’s barely audible — the personalities of SP Devnarayan Patel and ADJ Anestus Toppo could not have been more different. So when a fight ensued between the two on a busy road last Sunday, they reacted very differently.</p>
<p>The 51-year-old judge retreated in the face of the cop’s fury but worked quietly through the night — getting in touch with his seniors, filing a case and getting himself medically examined but skipping the crucial alcohol test.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old, on the other hand lost his temper, allegedly roughed up the judge, removed the key from the ignition of the judge’s car and was almost certain that he would not be touched because he had been saved from situations like these before.<br />As things unfolded, leading to Patel’s suspension and the prospect of a possible arrest, something in him snapped. The exact circumstances in which he shot his wife and children, who survived, and turned the gun on himself are still being investigated but, prima facie it appears he was not prepared for what he thought was his “humiliation for acting against a drunk judge” as his suicide note scribbled on the back of his suspension order read.</p>
<p>“I was going to a hospital but stopped due to a traffic jam. The SP came to my car, took out the key and thrashed me,’’ Toppo, who joined the judicial service in 1994, told The Sunday Express. The judge, who hails from Jashpur and was posted in Jagdalpur nearly two years ago, was silent on the question of being drunk and blocking traffic. “I never imagined things would take such a turn,” he said. Those in Patel’s support insist he would not behave badly. “Once he realised who Toppo was he asked his own driver to drop him but the ADJ declined,’’ a policeman on duty at SBI Square that night said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the entire bar association has thrown its weight behind the ADJ, who has now been transferred to Bilaspur to facilitate an impartial probe into his conduct, admitting that he was used to drinking and could have been drunk that Sunday. The advocates insist Patel is being lionised because his suicide has made many sympathetic towards him.</p>
<p>“His nature is very good. He is barely audible and is unlikely to have raised his voice then,’’ said bar association president Santosh Mishra while reeling off incidents when the SP allegedly roughed up people in line of duty. The bar alleged that Patel had beaten up another advocate, who was also a block committee president, in Narayanpur last year leading to a similar demand for his suspension. He was not suspended but taken off duty.</p>
<p>“Suspensions are common in the life of a policeman. The punishment is used mainly as a tool to calm frayed tempers and to diffuse tension. You don’t take your life for it,’’ a senior police officer said. IG (Bastar) A D Gautam, from whom the police headquarters had sought report about the brawl, said inquiries are on at several levels.</p>
<p>Advocates have objected to the inquiry being ordered by the High Court registrar. “What kind of inquiry is it that calls only those who are likely to speak against the ADJ,’’ Mishra said. About the possibility of the ADJ being booked for abetment to suicide, the advocates say if anything, Patel’s seniors should be booked because his suicide note accuses them of not hearing him out.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996615&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Police have identified six of the seven militants killed in the Dardpora Forest of Lalpora, Lolab in Kupwara district last week.

<p>DIG of Police North Kashmir said the probe was carried out by scientific and technical methods. “The scientific and technical investigation and account of eye witnesses who were victims of the atrocities carried out by these militants in the past 5-6 months, revealed this group was operating in the Hardoona forests of Vilgam, Handwara, Lolab and Dardpora forests and was responsible for the murder of police constable in the forests of Hardoona Vilagam Handwara as well,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996602&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Weeks after they forced Penguin to withdraw a book authored by Wendy Doniger, the same Delhi-based Shiksha Bachao Andolan Samiti (SBAS) Saturday threatened to take legal action against yet another book On Hinduism by the same author unless its publishers Aleph Book Company assures in writing withdrawal of the book. Aleph Book Company is an independent publishing firm promoted by Rupa Publications.</p>
<p>“The contents of the book On Hinduism written by Wendy Doniger are malicious and offending similar to her pervious work which the publishers have agreed to withdraw,” convenor of SBAS Dina Nath Batra said addressing a press conference. The Samiti said that their press conference was aimed to bring the issue to public light and announce a week’s time for the publishers to assure in writing that they will withdraw the book.</p>
<p>“We have been given an oral assurance by the publishers that the sales of the book will be stalled. The publishers have been given a week’s time to provide an assurance in writing, failing which, SBAS would move the judiciary,” Atul Kothari, co-convenor of SBAS, said. He said that they will wait for a written assurance for a week, failing which the Samiti may take its next “democratic step” to ensure the book is withdrawn.</p>
<p>Co Publisher of Aleph Publications, Ravi Singh, however, completely denied any such move. “We are not withdrawing the book and we are not terminating any contract”, Singh told The Sunday Express. Dina Nath Batra, who soon after Penguin India’s withdrawal of Doniger’s book made it clear that the author’s next  On Hindusim is on his hit list, said that this book is even more damaging than the Penguin publication.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996599&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mn-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996584" alt="BGI volunteers in action at Syedna Burhanuddin’s funeral" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mn-med.jpg" /></a> BGI volunteers in action at Syedna Burhanuddin’s funeral.
<p>When Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, the spiritual head of the Dawoodi Bohra community, died in January, 30 volunteers from Karachi were among the 3,500 from across the world who assisted the Mumbai Police in controlling the crowds during the funeral.<br />
They are all a part of the community’s disciplinary force known as the Burhani Guards International (BGI), which has a membership of over 6,000 volunteers from different parts of the world, including the US, East Africa and Europe.</p>
<p>The BGI’s Karachi group comprises 450 volunteers. When Syedna Burhanuddin celebrated his 100th birthday in 2011, over 100 volunteers from Karachi arrived in Mumbai. “In the last two-three years, the embassy has been more flexible with double or triple-entry Indian visas with a validity of six months to one year&#8230; Thanks to these multiple-entry visas, around 15 guards could immediately travel to India when the Syedna died,” said Hasnain Jack, BGI, Karachi.</p>
<p>“Irrespective of which country the guards come from, we are all a part of the Bohri family. It does not cross our minds to ask which country each one is from. We wear the same uniform, speak the same language and share a common passion for serving the community. We do not have geographical boundaries,” said Muffadal Kothari, joint secretary, BGI, Mumbai.</p>
<p>The BGI was set up by Syedna Burhanuddin in 1994, after the riots in Mumbai. “Earlier, there were a number of local volunteer groups which took up the task of enforcing discipline at community functions. However, after the riots, the Syedna streamlined these bodies. The BGI was thus created,” said Shabbir Bharmal, a member of the BGI advisory committee. The volunteers fund their travel, accommodation and other expenses. When Syedna Burhanuddin was alive, they travelled across the globe for his events, helping in crowd management and providing paramedical services. At the local level, the BGI, Mumbai, also assisted the police during the 2008 terror attacks.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996575&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A day after Sahara chief Subrata Roy was arrested, the Kukrail reserve forest and the popular picnic spot nearby, on the outskirts of Lucknow, were closed to the public, remaining accessible only to his visitors. Roy has been kept at a state forest department guest house in Kukrail reserve forest.</p>
<p>Among his 40-odd visitors on Saturday were his sister Kumkum Roy Choudhury and brother J B Roy. Choudhury arrived at around 11.45 am and left at around 1 pm.</p>
<p>The forest guard outside the area has been replaced by policemen, who, along with Sahara employees, manned the gates, clearing the entry of visitors. Sahara officials, including its corporate communications team and two foreign security guards, were among the visitors.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/subratapolice_475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996685" alt="Subratapolice_475" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/subratapolice_475.jpg?w=480&#038;h=318" width="480" height="318" /></a></p>
<p>Many Sahara employees stood guard outside the picnic spot throughout the day. While no politicians were seen, as many as four deputy SPs, one additional SP and officers-in-charge of several police stations visited the area. Divisional Forest Officer A C Yadav, who turned up for a “regular visit”, said he was not aware that the public had been barred from entering the picnic spot. He said he had not passed any such order.</p>
<p>Many picknickers had to return disappointed. “This picnic spot has one of the most important crocodile breeding centres. I don’t understand why the police have decided to keep him here,” said Ajay Singh, a college student. Forest department sources said the guest house where Roy is being kept has four rooms and a rose garden, with a view of the Kukrail river.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Lucknow Police on Saturday again approached the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Anand Kumar, seeking clarification on his order passed on Friday. “We wanted some clarification on the CJM’s order about the time when we are to produce Roy in the Supreme Court, but he did not entertain the application and asked us to take legal opinion from Joint Director (Prosecution) instead. After getting the legal opinion, we will produce Roy before the Supreme Court on March 4,” said a police officer who did not want to be named.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996569&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rahulgandhim3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989750" alt=" the Cabinet will take up the anti-graft Bills being pushed by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi through the ordinance route." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rahulgandhim3.jpg" /></a> the Cabinet will take up the anti-graft Bills being pushed by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi through the ordinance route.
<p>As President Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday signed into law the Bill creating the separate state of Telangana, the government decided to move an ordinance in the last meeting of the Union Cabinet on Sunday to insert special category status for Seemandhra within the new law itself.</p>
<p>This, sources said, is a departure from convention as grant of special category status is always an executive order, not one which requires the law to be amended. But pushed by the Congress to placate Seemandhra, the government has taken a political call to insert this in law so that it can only be withdrawn by an amendment.</p>
<p>Similar status was given to Uttarakhand when it was created under the Vajpayee government though an executive decision by the Union Cabinet. But with the BJP making political gains by stalling passage of the Bill in Rajya Sabha unless the government announced a special package — the Prime Minister eventually did — the Congress was keen to show it could go a step further.<br />
The Telangana ordinance will also marginally change the boundaries of the new state as a set of villages in Khammam district, affected by the Polavaram hydel project, will be moved to Seemandhra for smooth facilitation of resettlement and rehabilitation since the project itself is in Seemandhra.</p>
<p>Besides this, the Cabinet will take up the anti-graft Bills being pushed by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi through the ordinance route. These include the Prevention of Corruption (amendment) Bill and Right of Citizens for Time-bound Delivery of Goods and Services.</p>
<p>It is learnt that President Mukherjee had certain doubts over signing a clutch of ordinances in such a manner just before the elections. The government looked into the matter and found certain precedents based on which Minister for Personnel V Narayanasamy met the President. But Mukherjee, it is learnt, made it known that the ordinance route should be taken only for the Bills the government considers absolutely critical.</p>
<p>All ordinances were deferred at the last Cabinet meeting on Friday since the government was examining these issues carefully. The matter was further discussed by the Congress core group which made the political call to press ahead with the ordinance route despite certain caveats related to parliamentary principle given that the announcement of elections is imminent. Given the President’s stand, the Congress core group may meet again before the Cabinet sits for the Sunday special.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996564&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/swoden-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1960726" alt=" Edward Snowden disclosed that snooping by United States intelligence agencies involved internet networks in India." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/swoden-med.jpg" /></a> Edward Snowden disclosed that snooping by United States intelligence agencies involved internet networks in India.
<p>Months after whistleblower Edward Snowden disclosed that snooping by United States intelligence agencies involved internet networks in India, the government has acknowledged that only metadata or the “origin-route-destination” of emails were tracked and not their “actual content”.</p>
<p>In a report “Cyber Crime, Cyber Security and Right to Privacy”, tabled in Parliament in the last session by the Standing Committee on Information Technology, the Secretary of the Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DEITY) said that the government has been “assured that whatever data has been gathered by them for surveillance relates only to the metadata”. “It has been reiterated and stated at the highest level of the US President that only the metadata has been accessed, which is, the origin of the message and the receiving point, the destination and the route through which it has gone, but not the actual content itself,” the Secretary told the committee.</p>
<p>He said “this has been reiterated by them, but we expressed that any incursion into the content will not be tolerated and is not tolerable from Indian stand and point of view” and “that has been mentioned very clearly and firmly by our Government”. The committee, while taking note of DEITY’s stand that “incursion into the content of the country’s data will not be tolerated”, said that the “department should have exercised enough caution so that such a situation was not allowed to occur at the first instance”.<br />
Asking the department to be “extremely vigilant and cautious” in terms of safety and policy with different countries so as to avoid “such leakage and interception of sensitive data in the name of surveillance”, the panel has called for “remedial measures” and “a policy which should be implemented stringently so as to obviate recurrence of such instances”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996549&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By: Ranjit Lal</strong></p>
<p>If you live in Delhi or in northern India, and stand beneath a peepul, banyan, neem or semul (or probably any large flowering or fruiting tree) at the end of March or beginning of April, you may hear an incessant sibilant chittering wafting down from the branches above. There’s a restless excitement in the air, and when you look up, you’ll see the leaves flicker and tremble: there’s something up there, actually multitudes of somethings up there!<br />
At last you spot them: restless mynah-like birds, but in strawberry pink and glistening black, some displaying wispy “shendi” crests, trembling their wings and chattering non-stop.</p>
<p>They’re rosy starlings, or rosy pastors, on their way back to their breeding grounds in eastern Europe or the temperate regions of southern Asia. They’ve spent the winter in India — and you may have met them in fields and pastures and grasslands all the way down to the Deccan. They had snuck through northern India (and Delhi) probably sometime in September the previous year and spread over the sub continent for six months of R &amp; R, and raiding fields of jowar and bajra as well as orchards.</p>
<p>And yes, they look like mynahs and for long were thought to belong to that garrulous clan, though now scientists are saying that’s not exactly right and no one still knows who they descended from. Hmm…it kind of figures… I did a bit of checking up on them (“research” the intellectually pompous would say) and boy do they have some interesting characteristics and USPs.</p>
<p>Most migrants to India fly north-south and back again. Rosy-starlings like to be different — they’re east-west migrants: they fly in from eastern Europe or south-west Asia. They don’t have much of a worldwide reputation having been deemed a species of “least concern” (I guess we could update even that status!). But they have one huge redeeming feature, which ought to make them a species of immense value. They really go after locusts and grasshoppers big time and farmers can’t be more grateful to them than for that. Normally, they breed between May and July, but if there’s a plague of locusts about which they get wind of, they’ll produce an explosive baby boom in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Eggs are laid phata-phat and incubated for, perhaps, 10 days, and the babies are out guzzling locusts in less than three weeks. The Chinese, canny as ever, even built artificial nests to inveigle them to stay and breed and clean up the locusts in their fields, which otherwise would need destruction by expensive pesticide. The pastors cleaned up the locusts to the extent that many of their babies got none at all and starved! Even the tough Afghans are known to revere the species for their pest-controlling abilities, though idiots in north-west India and Pakistan shoot them in large numbers, because they’re considered a juicy delicacy.</p>
<p>As for attitude (and belligerence), they have it in spades. When a flock — and they like to move around in large, intimidating numbers — descends on a tree, they’ll clear it of all other species. Even amongst themselves, there’ll be constant jostling and shoving and tu-tu-main-main. Males with love and lust on their brains will erect their gelled crests, throw back their heads, shiver their wings and sing. When a few dive down onto the grass, and hop, skip and jump after insects, others will promptly follow and they’ll be scrimmaging and hop-scotching all over one another in their haste to get the tidbits before each other — like people trying to climb over each other to get to the top of a queue. But what really is spectacular is when they take to the sky.…</p>
<p>If the chattering in a tree suddenly stops, like a switch has been thrown, look up quickly. The flock — maybe 500-strong — will have taken to the air, flying tightly bunched together, swift, direct and banking and swirling like coiling swathes of dark smoke. All in pindrop silence. (They’re supposed to have flight calls too, but so far I haven’t heard them). When they zoom directly overhead, they’ll remind you of a squadron of miniature Spitfires, except that all you hear is the whirring of their wings. They’ll circle around and land back on the tree, and the chattering starts up.</p>
<p>By the third week of April, you might see squadron after squadron flying swiftly and intently overhead like warplanes on a bombing mission. The locust-eaters are on their way home. And if you are a locust or a grasshopper dreaming greedily of laying waste vast fields of grain, be very afraid indeed.…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By: Sanghamitra Mazumdar </strong></p>
<p>If your child is more than 18 months old and you use a smartphone, iPad or an Android tablet, chances are that your device will have more apps for your little one to use, than for yourself. With game-based learning pegged to be the future of education, apps for children have an ever-growing market. Going a step further, now there is a tablet that caters only to children aged two to 10 years.</p>
<p>My tech-savvy two-and-a-half-year-old son has taken to Eddy like a fish takes to water. I have always been apprehensive of giving my iPhone, Nexus 7 or his father’s iPad to him, fearing he would straightaway go to YouTube for his “ABC songs” and Masha and Medved cartoons, and in the process get exposed to inappropriate content on the internet. This new tablet launched last month by Delhi-based education start-up Metis Learning relieves me of this worry.</p>
<p>Eddy claims to be the first Android-based learning tablet for children and has been designed by educators. Its content is linked to school curriculum, and your child can read books, learn to play musical instruments and also practise basic mathematics through games on the device.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a lowdown on the product from a parent’s point of view.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Net-safe:</strong> Although Eddy is internet-enabled, the device does not allow my son to access regular tablet features without parental approval. This keeps him away from social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, internet browsing and other apps for adults. Coming pre-loaded with the Maxthon Kid Safe web browser, Eddy provides a violence-free and controlled environment.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring:</strong> The first thing you can do on the tablet is to customise the device according to the age of your child. In addition, this feature lets me monitor my son’s daily activities on the device through detailed reports.</p>
<p><strong>Screen time:</strong> The best feature I have found on this tablet is that it allows me to decide how long I want my son to use the device. I can set the permissible number of hours per day or week and even allot exact time slots.</p>
<p><strong>Choice of apps:</strong> If my child finds one subject too engaging and gets hooked to it, and spends too much time on it, I have the choice to block that particular app and promote another. My son likes the language and maths subjects most and I can keep changing apps in each section.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing:</strong> Eddy gives me an option to create multiple profiles. The feature is not of much use to me, but children with siblings can share the device using the separate profiles created according to age. A maximum of three profiles can be created. Price: Rs 9,999 (Available in pink and green)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996547&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The peculiar blindness of online charity.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996545&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By: Nishant Shah</strong></p>
<p>If you are present on social media networks, chances are you have been tagged in a meme doing the rounds. It is one of those feel-good memes that begins with a declaration of charity — “Pay It Forward”. The meme invites five people from the friend circle to reply saying “I’m in!”. The first five people to leave the comment have a treat to look forward to. In the coming year, they will receive a gift — anything from a pack of gum to a penthouse apartment in Mumbai. When the original poster feels like it, when they think of that person, they will surprise him/her with a gift in the mailbox. And in return, each recipient of the gift must put up a similar message on their network, “paying it forward”, sending a surprise gift to five people who were not expecting it. And like a well-balanced Ponzi scheme, each person multiplies this network of gifting by five, building a world where everybody gets their day brightened by the promise of an unexpected gift.</p>
<p>So far, so good. Except that this feeling of random surprise gifting, of being caught in a network of love is a signal of the insularity and closeness that online social networks often produce. In many ways, the “Pay It Forward” meme is a culmination of the various forms of internet charity fads that we have seen in recent years. The digital does not need material resources of replication: If you have an e-copy of a book, and you allow me to make another e-copy of the same, we both have the same book, without any reduction in quality or value of ownership. Because of this ability to share, copy, remix, reuse and recycle, these ideas of “paying it forward” have propelled some of the most successful open access and sharing moments.</p>
<p>This has resulted in game-like charity endeavours through social networks. The most famous one is probably where people were encouraged to play games to contribute a bowl of rice or clean drinking water to starving children in Africa. Crowdfunding campaigns like Kickstarter and Indigogo help people support independent entrepreneurs, cultural producers or people in need of capital to expand their quality of life, donate in small numbers. Social networks like LinkedIn or Klout manifest this by providing us with “network capital” where our connections with people help build professional and social communities, which give us reputation and attention currencies.</p>
<p>There are already many critiques of this new wave of encashing your networks and getting financial aid from friends and communities, because they signal a new form of patronage and support that replaces our older welfare models. For me, these are still interesting shifts that digital natives are producing, where they build new societies premised on a community made of individuals (rather than individuals that belong to a community).<br />
The earlier models of welfare or charity were often a reflection on one’s own privilege.</p>
<p>It was contingent upon the individual recognising that they have privileges — financial, social, cultural, political —and hence there was a sense of responsibility and a feeling of “paying back” to the world around. Indeed, implicit in that model of sharing was the idea that those empowered by the sharing will improve the conditions of those around them, thus starting a trickle-down effect, which would help build a stronger and open society. However, within these new digital realms, the sense of paying it back has been replaced by paying it forward. What I give, I do not want to get back, but I want you to pass it on to somebody else.</p>
<p>And that somebody is always, almost entirely, someone like us. The recipient of these rewards is going to be somebody who shares the same privileges and positions, and yet, it gives us that warm fuzzy feeling of “doing good” without having to contribute to the socio-politically disadvantaged around us. Even in the early days of the internet, when Tim Berners Lee was dreaming of the World Wide Web, there were voices warning us that the digital might create an echo-chamber where people who are like each other will stay in isolated but extended communities, where they would not connect enough with the world of inequality and the reality of inequity.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with the “Pay it Forward” meme. In an age that promotes ritualised gifting guided by the celebration of “days” shaped by markets, this is a way of introducing whimsy in our social relationships that are often mediated by reciprocal gifting. We should celebrate the impulse and the spirit of this gamified virality. At the same time, it is also good to remember that paying it forward is not the same as paying back, and that the true potentials of sharing are not in sharing with those who are like us, but with those who might be thwarted from accessing the same kind of resources that we, while browsing Facebook and tagging friends, can take for granted.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Two cookbooks that relive family memories and experiences over different generations and geographies. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996544&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Bulbul Sharma<br />
</strong><br />
Bengali men fantasise about food the way Punjabi men dream about generously built women” is a well-worn cliché. But, it is women, who are intensely involved with food every moment of their lives. Women carry food memories across generations, making sure that the thread remains unbroken from grandmothers to granddaughters.</p>
<p>Most of them never wrote anything down, just narrated stories and embedded the recipes within, effortlessly. We all carry these stories in our heads, heard from our grandmothers, mothers, aunts and even friends. While there is love — “eat one more parantha&#8230; you look so thin,” says a loving mother to her overweight daughter — there is also jealousy, bitterness and anger — “her baigan ka bharta was never as good as mine”, “ you know, buaji never told me the entire recipe, she always left out an important ingredient.”</p>
<p>Some of the food stories are an important part of family lore, a record of unforgettable family events. “Remember how masi put salt instead of sugar in the kheer?” Sometimes, they point to an intricate family tree: “My sister-in-law, who made this gobhi shalgam pickle, is actually mamiji’s niece.”</p>
<p>Tasting a dish or just inhaling the aroma of a certain spice can bring forth hidden memories. “What was that dish? Who made it?” you wonder, and then the story unfolds bit by bit, enlivening many related memories.<br />
Each family has a different story and each community has a new version of the same food story. The stories vary in richness, flavour and colour, the way the recipes vary from region to region. One woman’s kadi pakori (made in Punjab with besan and yoghurt) may be another woman’s mattha alu (made in UP with potatoes, besan and yogurt).</p>
<p>Not much has been written about north Indian food. That is why The Sood Family Cookbook (HarperCollins) by Aparna Jain comes as a pleasant surprise. This book began its life as a three-ring binder shared by 70 members of the author’s extended family and their close friends. The recipes have been collected from various parts of the world, where the members of the clan moved to — from the mountains of Shimla, where it all began, to Bengal, Italy, Thailand and Switzerland, to Toronto, New York and Bostond.</p>
<p>Jain, a former techie from Silicon Valley, describes how she learnt to cook, “by thinking on my feet”, when she landed in Geneva. Like most people of her age, she had no experience of the kitchen, but learning to cook alone in a faraway land taught her to do things her own way and perfect the art of cooking on-the-go, though after a few tense episodes. “I panicked and called my aunts and uncles for recipes, and was met with the same answer from all of them: ‘Recipe? Bete, we do not write recipes, we just know what to do. And we really can’t tell you the measures, it’s all instinct.’ So I just had to scribble down whatever they could tell me.”</p>
<p>The author then began collecting  recipes from various members of her extended family. “Living in nuclear families in cities around the world, we all wanted to find ways of replicating the specialties that certain family members were renowned for, but did not know how to do it. It was also a way of reliving the memories associated with food,” she says.</p>
<p>This book, which the author calls “a gift from my family to you”, is for young adults setting up their own homes anywhere in the world. They can go on a food journey to make pahaadi dhaniya chicken, Kashmiri yakhni, Syrian mutton kebab, Nepali tomato chutney or Hyderabadi masoor dal.There is an unusual and easy-to-make recipe for chicken rasam. The Sood family seems to be experts at making up their own unique dishes, and the author has explained the route each dish has taken. There are recipes for  chutneys, not just our traditional mango and lime, but a banana saunth chutney and a Nepali tomato one. It does not stay with one kind of cooking and often feels you are reading a travelogue and a family saga rolled into one as you go from one part of the world to another.</p>
<p>Not just members of the Sood family, but anyone who reads the book will recall their own moments with a particular recipe or ingredient, creating a food story yet again. Bong Mom’s Cookbook (HarperCollins) by Sandeepa Mukherjee Datta is another cookbook that charts family history. As we read the stories that weave in and out of the recipes, we also get involved in the author’s life and family history. As we taste the delicately flavoured bati chorchori, the rich dhokar dalna, and creamy prawn malaikari, we listen to fond tales about her grandparents, dip into her childhood and get to know amusing details of her adult life.</p>
<p>The description of elaborate Sunday morning breakfasts with luchi, green-peas kochuri and aloo chorchori will make you hungry, and as you settle down for a long lunch with an impressive line of fish curries, you will feel hungrier. There is a classic hilsa fish curry steamed in mustard sauce, an unusual tomato fish and my favourite doi maachh (yoghurt fish), besides the famous muri ghonto, a fish head curry, dreaded by all except a born-in-Bengal Bengali. If you do not like muri ghonto, you are sneered at and called a “traitor”, and I am one of them. I once saw a Punjabi friend leap up from the dining table in horror when she suddenly spotted a huge fish eyeball staring at her from a plate. She turned a vegetarian soon after, at least whenever she visited our house. My children, who are half Punjabi, were always suspicious of any fish curry “lest it bite”. Dutta has also described recipes of various chutneys, an important part of the Bengali cuisine.</p>
<p>Food memories are precious and we need to preserve them in many different ways. A cookbook with stories seems to be the best and easiest way to do it. <em>(Bulbul Sharma is a painter and writer)</em></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996544&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[An age-old Mizo practice of headhunting is recreated in a faraway village. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996538&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/head-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996542" alt="Men dressed as traditional Mizo warriors place artificial severed heads next to Sahlam tree." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/head-480.jpg" /></a> Men dressed as traditional Mizo warriors place artificial severed heads next to Sahlam tree.
<p>A group of bare-footed men with swords and country-made guns walk up the hill with bulging cotton sling bags, firing their guns and chanting as they do. A little later, a group of women in traditional wraparounds chant a welcome and offer each of them liquid tobacco.</p>
<p>Once at the square, shaded by a large tree, the men take out seven artificial human heads, made of wood, from their bags and place them near a tree. Shortly after, several of them climb the tree as those on the ground hand them the severed heads, which they hang in a neat row on an overhanging branch, using pieces of vine.</p>
<p>The ceremony is a recreation of the traditional Mizo practice of lu lak or headhunting, which was a part of Chawngtlai village’s declaration of itself as a “Mizo Historical Village” and a celebration of their ancestral chief Nikuala’s 1891 victory over invading tribes from the east (what is now Myanmar), a battle that marked the historic end of the Mizos’ headhunting practice.</p>
<p>The spectacle was organised by Chawngtlai villagers who now live in Aizawl, including students and professionals, and are connected with their kin and neighbours through a “Chawngtlai group” on Facebook. They came home for the weekend on motorcycles  and cars, to make a name for their village as one that lives in today but treasures yesterday.</p>
<p>Back in the 1890s, the British administration took strong exception to Nikuala’s act of hanging seven of the enemies’ heads on a tree. The chief was imprisoned for life and the village was burned down as punishment, an event described by British officers Bertram S Carey and HN Tuck in their 1895 book The Chin Hills. It was, in fact, the Mizo tribes’ warlike nature and frequent raids mounted on various colonial outposts led British military expeditions, and later Christian missionaries, into the hills.</p>
<p>Little of that life survives in the village now. The residents here are mostly farmers, many owning profitable fields of passion fruit and grapes. Many others own heavy machinery and hire laborers, who work in the small quarries dotting the hills nearby. Still others are government employees.</p>
<p>There are at least 400 houses in the village, many of them built of wood with tin roofs, several built from concrete. One of the several churches that dot the village boasts of Mizoram’s tallest monument to Christianity, a 24-foot menhir carved from a single rock and erected in 1994 to mark the 100th year of the faith’s entry into the Mizo hills.</p>
<p>In Chawngtlai, village leaders explain why the tree from which the severed enemy heads hung (19 heads hung from it at one time, and the tree still stands in the middle of the village today) was specifically called Sahlam — Sah means “to strike with a sword” and lam means “dance” — instead of Milukhai — literally, “a place from where human heads hang” – as such a place is known in some places within Mizoram.</p>
<p>“In our village, the threat of invading tribes from the east was ever-present as we lived in the region that stood close to the border between Mizo tribes and other tribes from the east,” says C Laltlangmawia, a local historian, adding the tree is, in fact, the only one that has been preserved through the years.</p>
<p>“The place, at least in our village, was specifically called Sahlam because every boy old enough to hold a sword was made to strike the hanging heads with a sword so they were acclimatised early on to warfare. It is said the struck heads spun as if they were dancing,” he says.</p>
<p>Headhunting was a practice among various communities through what is now north east India, such as Mizos, Nagas and some tribes in Arunachal Pradesh, as well as among various south-east Asian communities and even some in Europe and the Americas (such as native Americans, who took the scalps of enemy tribes as well as non-native settlers).</p>
<p>Mizo writer F Lalremsiama writes that the practice was intertwined with the Mizos’ belief in an afterlife. In the old Mizo belief system, there were two places a person could go to after he died. One is called pialral (paradise), reserved for those who attained a special status through either material wealth or exceptional hunting skills.<br />
The rest had to go to mitthi khua (village of the dead) and live there pretty much as how they lived in this life, complete with the hardships, toil and worries of everyday life. The taking of heads, however, would offer them comfort at mitthi khua, as those whose heads they took would be their slaves there.</p>
<p>Warriors would also, during wars and raids, take heads for similar reasons. As a warrior cut off his victim’s head, he would shout out his name thrice. This, it was believed, would familiarise the victim with his killer even after moving on into the afterlife, where he would wait for his killer to arrive, and serve him as a slave.</p>
<p>There were also other reasons prompted by frequent wars among the various Mizo villages at the time, for Mizo tribes fought not only non-Mizo tribes, but among themselves as well — a warrior who brought home the heads of enemies was considered a great fighter and entire villages and communities considered him someone who could protect them. Such was the comforting power of brave warriors at the time that Chawngtlai village still claims a role in the material tradition of Mizos.</p>
<p>According to local leader and historian PC Zoramsiama, Nikuala’s wife Lalngurvungi made a tradition of presenting the village warriors a black shawl with red-and-white stripes to mark them as men who would not retreat in the face of enemy attacks from the east. “The shawl is called tawlhloh puan (literally, a weave that marks the end of retreat) because it signifies the battle that marked victory for the Mizos,” says Zoramsiama.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996538&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">A day before Narendra Modi’s rally in Lucknow, Rajya Sabha member and BSP national general secretary S P Singh Baghel joined the BJP in the presence of the party’s state in-charge Amit Shah in Lucknow Saturday. </span></p>
<p>Baghel had won the Lok Sabha elections on a Samajwadi Party ticket in 1998, 1999 and 2004 from Jalesar. He sought a ticket from Firozabad after the seat was scrapped, but was denied one by the party. He later contested against UP CM Akhilesh Yadav from Firozabad as a BSP candidate.</p>
<p>“I want the development model of Gujarat to be implemented across the the country,” said Baghel, who plans to contest from Firozabad.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, former CM Kalyan Singh said he will formally join the BJP Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Lone LJP MLA who quit party joins JD(U)</strong></p>
<p><strong>PATNA:</strong> Lone LJP MLA (Araria) Zakir Hussain Khan, who quit the party over the LJP striking an alliance with the BJP, on Saturday joined the JD(U). Two LJP MLAs had joined JD(U) over two years ago. LJP, which had won three seats in the Bihar Assembly polls, now has no MLA. Khan, who wanted to contest from Araria Lok Sabha seat, fell out with the LJP after the party failed to ally with the RJD. Sources said Zakir was promised either the Araria seat or a ministerial position by JD(U).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Senior BJP leader and spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi Saturday said party president Rajnath Singh had not issued an apology to the Muslim community and the party did not feel it should apologise to any community.</span></p>
<p>“There is this confusion being spread by the Congress and so called secular leaders that Rajnath has apologised. I want to set the record straight that he had asked members of the minority community to come along with the BJP and, in case the party failed to live up to the trust of the community, he would be more than willing to fold his hands and apologise,” Naqvi said in Mumbai.</p>
<p>Naqvi said there was no need for the BJP to apologise for anything. “I do not think there is a need for the party to apologise to anyone for anything,” Naqvi said.</p>
<p>Rajnath had created a flutter earlier this week at a gathering of the Muslim community when he suggested the BJP was ready to apologise to members of community.</p>
<p>Naqvi said that for the BJP, good governance and a clean administration took preference over secularism.</p>
<p>Asked if the party did not value secularism, Naqvi said the party was not a proponent of the type of secularism espoused by the Congress. “For us, all communities are equal. We do not adhere to the type of secularism espoused by the Congress,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996539&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Actor Vijay Raaz talks about knowing nothing about acting, coping with a year in the wilderness and his new films. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996529&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/raaz-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996536" alt="Actor Vijay Raaz in Dedh Isqiya." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/raaz-480.jpg" /></a> Actor Vijay Raaz in Dedh Isqiya.
<p>Two days before the shoot for Monsoon Wedding (2001) began in Delhi, actor Vijay Raaz received a call from its casting director Loveleen Tandan. He was to do the role of PK Dubey, a small-time wedding planner, and, yes, could he please rush to Delhi the next day? By then, he had done enough bit roles in Hindi movies to afford a mobile phone. He had auditioned for the role some time ago, but had little hope of bagging it since two prominent actors were in the running. Since the scale tipped in his favour only at the eleventh hour, he missed the workshop that Mira Nair had made the entire cast go through.</p>
<p>Naturally, the question of how Raaz would approach the role was on top of Nair’s mind. The actor promptly assured the director: “Now that you have shown faith in me, I would do something and make this work.” Such a response, says Raaz, can come only from someone who does not know anything. “A trained or method actor will be able to specify how he plans to go about it. I could never answer such questions. I still can’t,” says Raaz, lazing on the terrace of the Jam Jar restaurant in Andheri, Mumbai.</p>
<p>Needless to say, his marigold-eating lover act became very popular, and is still his calling card. The role made him an overnight comic sensation, ensuring a steady flow of offers and handsome remuneration. “If someone believes in me, that helps create the magic. If I have to prove something, it becomes difficult for me. It feels like sitting for an examination. If I had to study, I would have gone for higher degrees, fulfilled my father’s dream of getting a government job,” says the commerce graduate from Delhi’s Kirori Mal College.</p>
<p>This lanky actor’s first brush with theatre was as an inspector in a play called Pagal Ghar. Two months of rehearsals got him hooked to acting forever. He worked with Sakshi Kala Manch in Mandi House, Delhi, for a few years, before joining the NSD Repertory Company at a monthly salary of Rs 12,000. During the NSD interview, he chose to enact a monologue by Karna from Avtar Sahni’s Maharathi, but forgot the lines mid-way. Unruffled, he offered to redo it from the start — this trait has seen him through rough patches. Four years later, in 1998, he quit NSD and packed his bags for Mumbai.</p>
<p>Despite his bumpy journey in the industry, Raaz has stuck to casual preparedness before facing the camera. “When you read a script for the first time, the impressions that it creates are fresh, the way all the senses are focussed when you taste something new,” says the actor, who is currently basking in the critical appreciation he got for his role in Abhishek Chaubey-directed Dedh Ishqiya.</p>
<p>He plays the character of Jaan Muhammad, an ambitious politician with roguish charm, who aspires to upgrade his social status by marrying Madhuri Dixit-Nene aka Begum Para. His aversion to study the script worked in his favour. It landed him the role of a gangster in Delhi Belly (2011), a movie that brought him back into the limelight after a string of forgettable appearances.</p>
<p>In spite of the production staff nagging him, he did not read Delhi Belly’s script — he just glanced at the parts that involved his gangster character — before he met director Abhinay Deo. “However, when we started talking, none of us felt I was not well-versed with the script,” says the 44-year-old.</p>
<p>Delhi Belly’s expletive-spewing don paved the way for an eventful second innings after the career slump in 2005 following his detention in Dubai — where he was shooting for Deewane Huye Paagal — for possessing marijuana. By then, he had established himself as one of the most talented actors in the industry: Rajat Kapoor-directed Raghu Romeo (2003), featuring him as a naive protective lover, bagged the National Award for Best Regional Film (Hindi). Even though Run (2004) was a flop, his “kauwa biryani” act was a hit (35-minute clipping of his scenes alone used to be shown on cables in north India). “I did not have a movie for nearly a year after that. I could deal with the setback because I am not very career-oriented,” he says.</p>
<p>If reports are to be believed, he even increased his price after Delhi Belly. Today, three of his films are lined up for release this year — Atul Agnihotri-produced O Teri in March, his directorial debut Kya Dilli Kya Lahore, in which he also acts, in April, and Neeraj Pandey-produced Saat Uchakkey in May. His next, Rangez Pandey, based on a real-life incident, will go on the floors soon.</p>
<p>What makes him a perfect choice for characters with comic traits? For Naseeruddin Shah, his co-actor in several movies, including Monsoon Wedding, Barah Aana and Dedh Ishqiya, it is Raaz’s “fantastic acting” skills and “confidence in himself”, while Agnihotri believes in his ability to grasp a role quickly. “When I first saw him on stage (during NSD Repertory Company’s show of Agni Aur Barkha, a Girish Karnad play, where Raaz played a 90-year-old), I thought it was some kind of optical illusion. He appeared as a spidery kind of character. And I told myself, ‘What is this person?’ I was too impressed with him,” says Shah. Later, the actor recommended Raaz to Mahesh Mathai for his debut movie Bhopal Express. Kapoor, who gave Raaz his first lead role, sums up his uniqueness, “Like most good actors, he has a great instinct. Once an actor latches on to the right note, it can’t go wrong. The rest is rubbish.”</p>
<p>Chaubey’s long search for an actor to play Jaan Muhammad ended with Raaz. His long locks, paired with dark glasses, and a quirky demeanour made him the perfect choice for the role. But Saat Uchakkey’s director Sanjeev Sharma — who has been tracking the actor since his Delhi theatre days and finds him “dynamic” — had made up his mind about casting Raaz from the beginning. “I needed a free-spirited actor to play the role of Jaggi, a wheeler-dealer,” says Sharma.</p>
<p>When asked about a movie or a role, Raaz’s standard answer is: “It just happened.” Even the dragon tattoo on his right forearm “just happened”. Yet, in between such nonchalant responses he keeps slipping in how he is particular about “enjoying” his work. Even as a directionless college student, he found acting “an interesting career option” when he discovered that it was more enjoyable than “playing cricket”.</p>
<p>Raaz’s roller-coaster journey in the industry has, perhaps, inspired him to explore life. When not working, he loves to be alone. He also reads books on spirituality and philosophy. Or else, he likes to go on long drives. “When I have time, I travel to the mountains. Otherwise, I have my room and solitude.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996529&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">BJP chief Rajnath Singh Saturday inducted former Army Chief Gen V K Singh into the party along with over 100 other ex-servicemen.</span></p>
<p>“In today’s circumstances, the BJP alone is the nationalist alternative working in national interest. We ex-servicemen, who have served on borders, should work with nationalist forces. So, we decided to move with BJP to bring a government which is stable, strong and takes decisions in national interest,” Gen Singh said. “I am confident we can achieve this dream,” he said, invoking Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s slogan, “Jai jawan, jai kisan, jai vigyan”.</p>
<p>A clutch of BJP supporters also resorted to sloganeering — “Desh ka raksha mantri kaisa ho, General V K Singh jaisa ho” — suggesting that V K Singh be made Defence Minister if the BJP comes to power.</p>
<p>Welcoming the former Army chief into the party, Rajnath praised the armed forces for their discipline and bravery and charged the UPA regime for leaving “holes” in the national security framework. He also deplored the alleged kickbacks in the procurement of armaments.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Rakhi gatecrashes </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> Ahead of V K Singh’s induction, actress Rakhi Sawant gatecrashed the party. “It is my house, I am the BJP’s daughter. I have come here to have tea. I don’t know if I will be joining the BJP, it is up to the senior leaders,” Rakhi said. “Just the way I have come from Mumbai to Delhi, I want the junta to come out and vote for Narendra Modi. I am certain he will be PM,” she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996523&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/art-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996525" alt="Laxman Aelay’s Ringtone; and Lullaby Baby." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/art-480.jpg" /></a> Laxman Aelay’s Ringtone; and Lullaby Baby.
<p>In her yellow sari and an orange blouse, a woman lies on the floor, staring anxiously at the mobile phone placed next to her arm. On a wall behind her is a poster of Osmania University in Hyderabad, a hub of the violent protests and student suicides that have accompanied Telangana politics over the last three years. The woman is possibly awaiting a phone call, perhaps from her son about his safety, who might be  studying at the university. This is Ringtone, which was on display at Jehangir Art gallery in Mumbai last year, as part of the exhibition “Fellow Travellers”. It is one of the many paintings by Hyderabad-based artist Laxman Aelay which capture the struggles of the inhabitants of Telangana.</p>
<p>Forty-nine-year-old Aeley’s journey is often reminiscent of MF Husain’s, whose tryst with art began as a painter of film posters, while the former worked as a signboard painter. “When I went to study in Hyderabad, I was working as a book illustrator and I had done nearly 1000 illustrations for non-fiction, Dalit and Bahujan literature, poetry and feminist books. I worked with feminist activists and was highly influenced by their vision of Telangana,” he says. When he returned to his village, Kadirenigudem in Nalgonda district, its harsh realities offered a stark contrast to the city life he had experienced. “There was no water and the area was very dry. I had not noticed this as a child,” he says. Soon, his work would be inhabited by the humble men and women of the village.</p>
<p>Aelay’s paintings tell stories of villagers struck by poverty and trace their daily chores. He says women play a very important role in his work. “In my village, women are responsible for farming as well as their homes. My paintings bring out the role of women in the armed struggle for Telangana,” says Aelay. A Telengana identity is at the root of his oeuvre. Left Myths features an elderly man in a red shirt and an off-white dhoti, with his back to the viewer. His shirt is adorned with motifs of horses and bulls, which seem handpicked by the artist from the painted scrolls used by the Mandahechulu tribe in their performances, a blend of singing, storytelling and illustrated scrolls, which reveal the history of the cattle-rearing Golla caste in the Deccan.</p>
<p>Thota Vaikuntam, often referred to as the “Jamini Roy of the south” or “Vaikuntam from Telangana”, was one of the first to portray the region’s sensibilities in his works. His paintings bring out a deep-rooted fascination with his native village Boorugupally. “In my village, one will find certain strong colours like red, green and yellow in the attires of people. I studied what they wear, how they sit and what they hold and I gave form to these studies through my paintings,” says the 72-year-old artist.</p>
<p>Women appear to be frequent subjects of his works as well. His canvases portray a simple life — men carrying toddy pots on their shoulders, women engaged in temple rituals, or standing alongside flute-bearing men, almost like Radha and Krishna. While making use of polka dots, Vaikuntam employs the complex wash painting method to decorate his women in vivid hues. “I want to bring out my cultural identity through my art,” he says.</p>
<p>Though the colours used by him might appear to signify happiness and peace, the turbulent history of his land is subtly entrenched in his paintings.“I did not want my paintings to look happy. If you see the women I paint closely, you will see the suffering on their face. By looking at the colours, you might think they are happy but they are sad. We had other similar movements in ’78 and ’79. My friends were tortured in police stations. I could not do anything. My feelings are there, on the canvas,” he says.</p>
<p>How will a new state affect the Telangana art scene? Artists from Telangana hope that the creation of the new state will revitalise and promote Telangana culture which, they feel, has been neglected, and many of its art forms are quickly disappearing. “There are experts who draw or paint small images on temple walls or on cloth depicting a scene from the Mahabharata or describing a scene from local folklore. This art is becoming rare, so are Burrakatha and Pandulu which are oral storytelling forms. There was a time when Burrakatha used to be the main entertainment in every village of Telangana,’’ says Vaikuntam. “Of course, while we should try to nurture art, we need hospitals and schools urgently as well,’’ he adds.</p>
<p>Vaikuntam also feels that certain areas of Telangana require government support, encouragement and funds to prevent them from becoming extinct and to help artists who could not get an opportunity to break into the mainstream art world. “The real art lies in the villages and towns, where it often goes unnoticed. I know many good painters and craftsmen who eke out a living as drawing teachers in Hyderabad and other nearby cities while silently pursuing their passion. Government-funded exhibitions and galleries, where artists can display their work, are urgently needed,” says Vaikuntam.</p>
<p>Artist Annavaram Srinivas agrees: “The government should establish an exclusive Telangana Arts Academy.” Painter Surya Prakash is sceptical about government support. “Telangana will become a state after two-three months. We have to see what kind of people run the government and whether they would be interested in salvaging Telangana art. A few accomplished painters and artists from Telangana receive government support but there are entire families and communities who are into some kind of art or the other that is very unique and they need a lot of support,” he says.</p>
<p>In the coming years, Prakash predicts that painting and music, may see several changes as people celebrate the new state and the landscape starts changing. “I will continue to paint my women but I am also looking at starting to paint changing Telangana landscapes and other things,’’ says Vaikuntam.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996521&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/indian-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996474" alt="Newly arrived labourers from India in Trinidad. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/indian-480.jpg" /></a> Newly arrived labourers from India in Trinidad.
<p>A fresh wavelet of diasporic literature is upon us. Gaiutra Bahadur’s Coolie Woman, released a couple of months ago, tells the story of Indian women shipped out of Calcutta, often on false pretences, to work on sugarcane plantations in the Caribbean — a dirty little secret wrapped up in the dodgy innovation of indentured labour which has just begun to unravel, a century after the event. The third volume of Amitav Ghosh’s Ibis trilogy should be nearing completion. And in the interim, Sunil S Amrith has gone local in Crossing the Bay of Bengal to remind us of the millions of Indians from generations ago, gentlemen and lascars, who were far more globalised than us, in whose world Trincomalee, Penang and Rangoon were no more remote than Kanpur and Calcutta.</p>
<p>As the first modern transnational, the East India Company made the diaspora possible and enjoyed a moodily ambivalent relationship with it. The focus on the three Rs — reading, ’riting and ’rithmetic — in Macaulay’s scheme of education had raised cadres of standardised clerks, managers and administrators, who could be plugged in anywhere in the Empire and start playing right away. For Indian elites, this was the beginning of a phase of globalisation and in the early 20th century, it was not at all unusual for Indians to have served or traded in Burmese or Malay cities.</p>
<p>But below the poverty line, globalisation was a tragic story of forced displacement and loss. Having diversified into military and administrative capabilities in order to dominate markets and hinterlands, the East India Company found that land revenue no longer returned sufficient profits. Cash crops for export, like opium, offered indecent margins. But in forcing rural communities to turn away from subsistence agriculture to cash crops, the Company opened the door to famine. And so were born large populations of landless people who were willing to go to the ends of the earth — even to Bahadur’s Guyana — to escape the economic uncertainties and social problems that followed.</p>
<p>Indentured labour was a windfall for Western entrepreneurs, shoring up economies which had invested heavily in slavery and lost their deposit on its abolition. The system had to end for purely economic reasons, apart from emerging moral discomforts. Modern slavery was highly inefficient, being dependent on permanently demoralised workers without a past, present or future. In one period, Indian sugar entering the UK was subjected to countervailing duties to protect Caribbean plantations. Embarrassingly, the free peasant of Uttar Pradesh was producing sugar cheaper than the slave-owner of Jamaica, exposing the lie at the heart of slavery — that almost free human energy would assure competitiveness.</p>
<p>Did the indenture system provide a a soft landing for slavery when it crashed in flames? At least, it may have been a transitional step towards the industrial age when, for the first time in history, energy ceased to mean muscle power, whether of human or animal origin. The differential in power between employers and workers in the world that Bahadur describes is not unlike that between owners and slaves. Besides, she writes of workers who signed up for the Caribbean believing that they would be home for vacations, and of terms of employment which made return improbable, even after the term of indenture was completed. Asymmteric information flows made for a one-way ticket not wholly unlike slavery.</p>
<p>The literature of the early diaspora, from events like the transportation of Amitav Ghosh’s Raja Neel Rattan Halder to the accounts of indenture that are emerging from migration studies, has barely begun to be told in English. Interestingly, though, the figure of the “Girmitiya” or indentured worker — a corruption of the dodgy “agreement” that they signed — is quite well known in Hindi literature. But the academic narratives of transportation, exile and indenture are overwhelmingly outnumbered by media success stories of recent migration. In our imagination, the diaspora has lost the negative connotations of centuries past, when it was associated with the coercions of geopolitics. To our generation, the images that the diaspora conjures up are those of the charmed technologist, the hardy corner store veteran turned motelier, the committed BJP supporter of independent means.</p>
<p>Amazingly, though, these figures have almost never populated the pages of South Asian fiction. Even non-fiction – other than a small number of Silicon Valley books — rarely speaks of the diaspora stars that the media loves to fete. Academia writes mostly of people like Judith M Brown’s Global South Asians (Cambridge University Press), which had established a benchmark in migration studies in 2007 without mentioning Lakhubhai Pathak or Sundara Pichai even once. It appears that we, the readers, prefer ordinary lives like that of Brick Lane. n</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996471&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Philip Hensher on writing about a Bangladeshi family, Dan Brown and his new book. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996511&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hensher-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996518" alt="British writer Philip Hensher." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hensher-480.jpg" /></a> British writer Philip Hensher.
<p>British writer Philip Hensher was a clerk at the House of Commons in 1996 when he opened his mouth to a gay magazine to say that he fancied Gordon Brown’s “shagged-out look”. Hensher, now 49, was promptly fired but that left him with the time in the world to write and travel to different worlds, between hard covers — The Mulberry Empire (2002) set in Afghanistan in the 1830s, The Northern Clemency (2008) which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and Scenes from Early Life (2012) about a Bangladeshi family during the war of 1971. He writes all his books longhand so it was no surprise that in 2012, Hensher wrote The Missing Ink, a book about the lost art of handwriting. Excerpts from an interview:</p>
<p><strong>Would you say that losing your job was the “best” thing to have happened?</strong><br />
Oh it was fantastic. I think everybody ought to be sacked at some point in their lives. Because for most people that is the worst thing that could possibly happen. And when it happens, you think, oh well, that’s fine. That was 20 years ago, but since then, I’ve never been frightened of anybody. Apart from tigers, I’m quite frightened of tigers.</p>
<p><strong>Your last book, Scenes from Early Life, is about your husband Zaved’s childhood. It’s been praised for its accurate portrayal of Dhaka of the 1970s. How did you manage that?</strong><br />
I’ve always felt that there was a real spiritual connection between the Bengali mind and the English mind and it’s about the place of humour. You don’t often see two Bengalis talking for long without one of them making a joke and the other one bursting out laughing. You can sit and watch two Swedish people for a long time before one of them will set out to make the other laugh. Bengalis and the English drive each other up the wall, but they get on in the end.</p>
<p><strong>As a writer, do you feel you need to identify with the characters, especially if you’ve set them in a country and culture different from yours?</strong><br />
With Scenes, I don’t think readers cared if you’re actually Bengali or not, I can’t do anything about not being Bengali. But the writing needs to possess the quality of truth, it should appear to be true. I didn’t want to write the history of the Bangladesh war, I wanted to write the story about this family. I was quite a long way in when I realised that it was going to be about the war as well. Because everything was being shaped by the war. I wanted to give readers an interest into the war and go and read another book. I felt it wasn’t for an English writer to write a nationalist story.</p>
<p><strong>In The Missing Ink, you wrote about how the pen is an extension of ourselves. You&#8217;ve also mentioned how cellphones are increasingly eclipsing writing instruments.</strong><br />
I love all the aspects of writing because of the instruments, you can chew the end of your pencil as you write. The pen feels very warm to us, like a part of ourselves. With the cellphone, there is a kind of bewildering intimacy. Till some years ago, people took out their cellphones to make calls. Now they hold it in their hands all the time, gazing at it like a small animal that might bite them if they don&#8217;t stare at it ceaselessly.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve described Dan Brown as somebody who writes like a real estate agent. You&#8217;re not too fond of commercial fiction, are you?</strong><br />
I love commercial fiction, but Dan Brown is awful! Do you know who I love more than anybody? Elmore Leonard. A lot of the writers who we think of as great writers now, were very commercial in their times. Dickens, PG Wodehouse. But among the writers I admire, I admire Naipaul’s books more than anything. I don’t like him very much, but as a writer he’s unparalleled. Zadie Smith, she’s simply wonderful, especially her essays.</p>
<p><strong>What are you working on now?</strong><br />
I’ve just finished a novel called The Emperor Waltz. It’s got three historical strands — one’s about the early Christians, one’s about German society in the 1920s, the rise of the Bauerhaus, the background of the rise of the Nazis, and the third one is about a radical bookshop in London in the 1980s. It’s been a great pleasure to write this novel, it’s a long one. I didn’t realise that I’d been thinking about this novel for decades. One of my best friends, when I sent him the novel, said to me, do you remember that when we were at Cambridge together in the late 1980s, we were walking down the street in London and we passed this radical bookshop and I’d said, at the time, (he remembered, I didn’t) that somebody ought to write a novel about that? So I’ve been thinking about this novel for at least 25 years. It came together very fluently, 620 pages, and I wrote it in 13 months. I’ve got to think of another one to write, but I’m having a little break now.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996511&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
