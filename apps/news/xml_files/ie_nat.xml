				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Omega-3 fatty acids have been found to be deficient in our diet, thanks to changing food habits and increased dependence on processed foods. These essential fatty acids are good fats that our body cannot make and need to be supplied through diet. These fats can be obtained both from plant and animal foods.</p>
<p>They are an important family of healthy fats as they play a key role in several metabolic functions of our body and help in reducing inflammation, facilitating healthy brain function, lowering blood fats, maintaining blood pressure levels, regulating heart rhythms, and boosting immunity and lung function. These make them useful for people suffering from diseases such as arthritis, asthma, auto-immune disorders, ADHD, Crohn’s, Parkinson’s, and heart ailments.</p>
<p>Today, the scientific consensus is so strong that health policy makers worldwide, including the American Heart Association (AHA) and the World Health Organization (WHO), agree that omega-3s maintain health and help prevent diseases. Reports on health benefits have led to increased demand for products containing marine omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs poly-unsaturated fatty acids)).</p>
<p>Most people have been using fish oils and recently, flaxseeds to boost intake of omega-3 fatty acids. Since fish is a restricted source, there is a growing interest in alternative sources of omega-3 fats. The latest to enter the omega-3 delivery system is Krill oil, found in the southern coast of Antarctica. Krill, tiny sea creatures, about 2 inches long, are shrimp-like crustaceans that are a dietary staple for whales, small fish, and seabirds. Krill or Okiami, as the Japanese call it, has been a cherished food source in many Asian countries since the 19th century.</p>
<p>The metabolic effects of Krill oil are essentially similar to those of fish oil. Krill oil has less omega-3 concentration but is more readily and effectively absorbed by the body. Krill oil contains an antioxidant astaxanthin, which has been found to increase HDL (good) cholesterol and decrease triglycerides. Phospholipids found in Krill oil too have been found to increase the good cholesterol. Unlike fish oils, krill oil carries omega-3s in the form of phospholipids, which are readily absorbed by the body.</p>
<p>Findings from a study conducted at McGill University in Montreal and published in 2004 in the journal Alternative Medicine Review indicate that Krill oil helps lower (bad) cholesterol levels more effectively than fish oil. Another study published in 2013, in the European Journal of Nutrition demonstrated that while fish oil and Krill oil are comparable dietary sources of omega-3 fats, Krill oil seems to have greater potential to improve lipid profiles and lower inflammation, at similar doses.</p>
<p>Although a food-based approach for achieving omega-3 PUFA is recommended, but may not always be possible. Omega-3 supplements may be needed for those who do not like fish. The downside of Krill oil is its high cost and environmental concerns.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Gretchen Reynolds</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament in the knee is a nightmare. As the parent of a teenage son who is seven months out from ACL reconstruction surgery, I can attest to the physical and psychological toll it can take, not to mention the medical bills. But a practical new study suggests that changing how sports teams warm up before practices and games could substantially lower the risk that athletes will hurt a knee, at a cost of barely a dollar per player.</p>
<p>Injuries to the ACL, which connects the tibia and femur and stabilizes the knee joint, are soaring, with an estimated 150,000 cases a year. The ligament is prone to tearing if the knee shears sideways during hard, awkward landings or abrupt shifts in direction — the kind of movements that are especially common in sports like basketball, football, soccer, volleyball and skiing.</p>
<p>Motivated by the growing occurrence of these knee injuries, many researchers have been working in recent years to develop training programs to reduce their number. These programs, formally known as neuromuscular training, use a series of exercises to teach athletes how to land, cut, shift directions, plant their legs, and otherwise move during play so that they are less likely to injure themselves. Studies have found that the programs can reduce the number of ACL tears per season by 50 per cent or more, particularly among girls, who tear their ACLs at a higher rate than boys do (although, numerically, far more boys are affected).</p>
<p>But to date, few leagues, high schools or teams across the country have instituted neuromuscular training. That puzzled Dr Eric Swart, a resident in orthopaedic surgery at Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center.</p>
<p>Wondering what might motivate coaches and other interested parties to take up ACL injury-prevention programs, Dr Swart and his colleagues settled on naked self-interest. They set out to see what the financial savings involved in undertaking — or resisting — an ACL-injury prevention programme might be.</p>
<p>So, for a study presented last Friday at the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons annual meeting in New Orleans, he and his colleagues gathered recent clinical trials related to neuromuscular training and used them to create a model of what would happen in a hypothetical sports league composed of male and female athletes, ages 14 to 22, if they did or did not practice neuromuscular training. The researchers then began running the monetary numbers.</p>
<p>They first determined that, not surprisingly, the medical costs associated with a single ACL tear are staggering, with the estimated price for reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation averaging $15,000.</p>
<p>The cost of the training was negligible, since several of the programs included in the analysis are available free on the Internet and require almost no equipment.</p>
<p>According to the researchers’ calculations, the cost of starting a neuromuscular training programme averaged $1.25 per player per year, “which is so much cheaper than visiting an orthopaedic surgeon,” said Dr Swart, an orthopaedic surgeon.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015845&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[A new study questions the link between saturated fats and heart disease.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015843&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Many of us have long been told that saturated fat, the type found in meat, butter and cheese, causes heart disease. But a large and exhaustive new analysis by a team of international scientists found no evidence that eating saturated fat increased heart attacks and other cardiac events.</span></p>
<p>The new findings are part of a growing body of research that has challenged the accepted wisdom that saturated fat is inherently bad for you and will continue the debate about what foods are best to eat.</p>
<p>For decades, health officials have urged the public to avoid saturated fat as much as possible, saying it should be replaced with the unsaturated fats in foods like nuts, fish, seeds and vegetable oils.</p>
<p>But the new research, published on Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, did not find that people who ate higher levels of saturated fat had more heart disease than those who ate less. Nor did it find less disease in those eating higher amounts of unsaturated fat, including monounsaturated fat like olive oil or polyunsaturated fat like corn oil.</p>
<p>“My take on this would be that it’s not saturated fat that we should worry about” in our diets, said Dr. Rajiv Chowdhury, the lead author of the new study and a cardiovascular epidemiologist in the department of public health and primary care at Cambridge University.</p>
<p>But Dr Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, said the findings should not be taken as “a green light” to eat more steak, butter and other foods rich in saturated fat. He said that looking at individual fats and other nutrient groups in isolation could be misleading, because when people cut down on fats they tend to eat more bread, cold cereal and other refined carbohydrates that can also be bad for cardiovascular health.</p>
<p>“The single macronutrient approach is outdated,” said Dr Hu, who was not involved in the study. “I think future dietary guidelines will put more and more emphasis on real food rather than giving an absolute upper limit or cut-off point for certain macronutrients.”</p>
<p>He said people should try to eat foods that are typical of the Mediterranean diet, like nuts, fish, avocado, high-fibre grains and olive oil. A large clinical trial last year, which was not included in the current analysis, found that a Mediterranean diet with more nuts and extra virgin olive oil reduced heart attacks and strokes when compared with a lower fat diet with more starches.</p>
<p>Alice H Lichtenstein, a nutritional biochemist at Tufts University, agreed that “it would be unfortunate if these results were interpreted to suggest that people can go back to eating butter and cheese with abandon,” citing evidence that replacing saturated fat with foods that are high in polyunsaturated fats — instead of simply eating more carbohydrates — reduces cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p>Dr Lichtenstein, who was not involved in the latest study, was the lead author of the American Heart Association’s dietary guidelines, which recommend that people restrict saturated fat to as little as 5 per cent of their daily calories, or roughly two tablespoons of butter or two ounces of Cheddar cheese for the typical person eating about 2,000 calories a day. The heart association states that restricting saturated fat and eating more unsaturated fat, beans and vegetables can protect against heart disease by lowering low-density lipoprotein or so-called bad cholesterol.</p>
<p>In the new research, Dr Chowdhury and his colleagues sought to evaluate the best evidence to date, drawing on nearly 80 studies involving more than a half million people. They looked not only at what people reportedly ate, but at more objective measures such as the composition of fatty acids in their bloodstreams and in their fat tissue. The scientists also reviewed evidence from 27 randomised controlled trials — the gold standard in scientific research — that assessed whether taking polyunsaturated fat supplements like fish oil promoted heart health.</p>
<p>The researchers did find a link between trans fats, the now widely maligned partially hydrogenated oils that had long been added to processed foods, and heart disease. But they found no evidence of dangers from saturated fat, or benefits from other kinds of fats.</p>
<p>The primary reason saturated fat has historically had a bad reputation is that it increases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL, the kind that raises the risk for heart attacks. But the relationship between saturated fat and LDL is complex, said Dr. Chowdhury. In addition to raising LDL cholesterol, saturated fat also increases high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, the so-called good cholesterol. And the LDL that it raises is a subtype of big, fluffy particles that are generally benign. Doctors refer to a preponderance of these particles as LDL pattern A.</p>
<p>The smallest and densest form of LDL is more dangerous. These particles are easily oxidized and are more likely to set off inflammation and contribute to the buildup of artery-narrowing plaque. An LDL profile that consists mostly of these particles, known as pattern B, usually coincides with high triglycerides and low levels of HDL, both risk factors for heart attacks and stroke.</p>
<p>The smaller, more artery-clogging particles are increased not by saturated fat, but by sugary foods and an excess of carbohydrates, Dr Chowdhury said. “It’s the high carbohydrate or sugary diet that should be the focus of dietary guidelines,” he said. “If anything is driving your low-density lipoproteins in a more adverse way, it’s carbohydrates.”</p>
<p>While the new research showed no relationship overall between saturated or polyunsaturated fat intake and cardiac events, there are numerous unique fatty acids within these two groups, and there was some indication that they are not all equal.</p>
<p>When the researchers looked at fatty acids in the bloodstream, for example, they found that margaric acid, a saturated fat in milk and dairy products, was associated with lower cardiovascular risk. Two types of omega-3 fatty acids, the polyunsaturated fats found in fish, were also protective. But a number of the omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, commonly found in vegetable oils and processed foods, may pose risks, the findings suggested.</p>
<p>The researchers then looked at data from the randomised trials to see if taking supplements like fish oil produced any cardiovascular benefits. It did not.</p>
<p>But Dr Chowdhury said there might be a good explanation for this discrepancy. The supplement trials mostly involved people who had pre-existing heart disease or were at high risk of developing it, while the other studies involved generally healthy populations.</p>
<p>So it is possible that the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids lie in preventing heart disease, rather than treating or reversing it. At least two large clinical trials designed to see if this is the case are currently underway.</p>
<p>A new study questions the link between saturated fats and heart disease</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015843&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The CBI Friday registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) into the Rs 5,000-crore alleged bribery case relating to the supply of aircraft engines to state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) by London-based Rolls Royce. The agency named unknown officials of HAL, owner of Aashmore Private Ltd Ashok Patni and Rolls Royce in the PE, registered after a complaint was received from the Defence Ministry to look into the supply of engines.</span></p>
<p>According to the PE, the agency would probe alleged payment of bribes or kickbacks in the purchase of spare parts of helicopter engines by the Industrial and Marine Gas Turbine Division of HAL. The allegations surfaced after a letter received by HAL claimed bribes were paid to officials in HAL and other departments concerned with bagging contracts.</p>
<p>Rolls Royce had conducted an internal audit in which it was found that money had been paid to a commercial advisor — Aashmore Private Limited — allegedly as kickbacks to swing the deal in favour of the UK-based company.</p>
<p>The allegation was that Aashmore provided “sales and logistics support, local business expertise and strategic advice” in dealings with HAL in the energy sector. HAL, through its Industrial and Marine Gas Turbine Division, buys and maintains gas turbines for ONGC and GAIL. Rolls Royce has maintained the company “will cooperate fully with the regulatory authorities and&#8230;will not tolerate misconduct of any sort”.</p>
<p>Rolls Royce, in a letter to HAL in December last year, had said it had employed a Singapore-based person identified as Ashok Patni and his firm Aashmore Private Limited as the “commercial advisor” in India.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015831&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The list contained the names of 16 lawyers — from Shahid Azmi, who was killed for defending the accused in the Ghatkopar blasts case, to Kerala’s T Shanavas, who was arrested after he appeared in court to oppose the ban on SIMI. Several of those named in the list were attacked by other lawyers in court premises as they had appeared for terror suspects despite being forbidden by Bar associations.</p>
<p>“Such things didn’t happen even when the British were ruling us. Today, a lawyer who wants to defend an innocent is threatened,” said Maulana Attaur Rehman of the Shah Waliullah Institute.</p>
<p>Alleging a “nexus between the Maharashtra police and the underworld”, the Muslim bodies demanded a probe into the threats recieved by Pracha.</p>
<p>Condemning the threats, Saleem Engineer of the Jamaat-e-Islami said the security agencies often failed to follow due procedure and then framed innocents in “inter-state cases” if they were acquitted by a court. The cleric alleged that officials were “intoxicated by power” and often misused the powers given to them by law.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015825&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Tension gripped Piro town of Bhojpur, Bihar, after a 28-year-old Muslim youth was shot dead by unidentified assailants Wednesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p>After Akbar Khan, a shopkeeper, was killed at Piro, the police said they had to face resistance from local residents, who torched at least half a dozen shops in the town.</p>
<p>Though the reason of the killing is not yet ascertained, adequate police personnel have been deployed to help avoid any communal clash. The shops which have been targeted belong to Hindus.</p>
<p>“As there are chances of a backlash, we are not taking any chances,” said a senior police officer. Top police officers from Patna have reached the spot.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015823&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Close to a year after they began investigations into the sensational murder of a senior priest at a seminary linked to the Vatican, the Bangalore Police Friday claimed a breakthrough with the arrest of three priests, who allegedly conspired to carry out the killing. </span></p>
<p>An internal rivalry over control of seminary’s assets has been cited as the motive for the killing of K J Thomas, the rector of the St Peter’s Pontifical Seminary, on the intervening night of March 31 and April 1 last year. Karnataka police chief Lalrokhuma Pachaua identified the accused as Father Illyas Daniel, William Patrick and Peter.</p>
<p>Thomas was found murdered in a room at the seminary, which is involved in the training of priests, on the morning of April 1, 2013 by the principal of the seminary Fr Patrick Xavier. The case was a major challenge for the police, with pressure to crack it coming from the CM and senior Congress leaders in Delhi. A few relatives of the deceased priest from Kerala recently approached the high court, seeking a CBI inquiry because of the delay in the police probe.</p>
<p>Police sources said priest Illyas Daniel served at Gulbarga, William Patrick at Kengery and Peter at Shiluvepura in Bangalore. “Two more priests who were involved are still at large. We will nab them soon,” a source said. The three arrested priests were produced before a court and taken into police custody for a week. DGP Pachaua said Ilyas and his associates confessed to the offence.</p>
<p>He said Thomas had been working in the seminary for many years and Illyas and other accused were unhappy with him for various reasons. Also, there was resentment among the accused that many of them were being sidelined for important posts and that only a few persons were occupying important seats. They wanted to bring change in the system inside the seminary and rise to prominence, the DGP said.</p>
<p>“The accused persons required important documents relating to the seminary to gain prominence. These records pertained to lands that were granted to the seminary. Therefore, they hatched a conspiracy to break into the seminary and obtain these documents,” Pachau said.</p>
<p>They allegedly decided to execute their plan on March 31, 2013 as it was Easter time and the accused knew most at the seminary would be away and there would be no one other than Fr Thomas and a few others. Police said on the night of the murder Illyas, William Patrick, Peter and others met near the Yeshwantpur Circle and walked up to the seminary armed with rods and other weapons. “They began to break open locks of seminary rooms and started searching for the documents. Fr Thomas came out of his room and saw the accused, who then assaulted him causing his death. They left no clue behind,” the police chief said.</p>
<p>Police said they cracked the case following several leads. Five persons, including three priests present at the time of the killing at the seminary, were subjected to narco tests. The investigations led them to Illyas and his associates.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015817&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Shakti Mills cases: Photojournalist’s case adjourned to March 24.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015813&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Observing that a strong message should be sent out to society, sessions court Principal Judge Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi Friday awarded life sentence to four men for the gangrape of a 19-year-old telephone operator inside the premises of the dilapidated Shakti Mills compound in Mahalaxmi on July 31 last year.</span></p>
<p>Ashfaque Shaikh (24), Vijay Jadhav (18), Mohammed Qasim alias Bangali (20) and Salim Ansari (27), who were found guilty of the gangrape on Thursday, were also fined Rs 10,000 each, which would be paid to the victim for her medical expenses.</p>
<p>As per the new Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013, the life sentence will continue up to the convict’s natural life. One juvenile delinquent involved in the case is facing charges separately and will be tried before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB).</p>
<p>Two young women, a photojournalist and a telephone operator, were assaulted within less than a month of each other by two groups of five men each in the Shakti Mills compound. In each case, one of the accused was a juvenile.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old photojournalist was gangraped on August 22, 2013 by four adults and a juvenile, who first beat up and tied her male colleague with whom she had gone to the mill on a shooting assignment.</p>
<p>On August 31, the 19-year-old telephone operator went to the police to complain that she too had been gangraped in the same mill a month earlier on July 31.</p>
<p>Three of the accused — Jadhav, Qasim and Ansari — are also involved in the gangrape of the photojournalist along with another person Siraj Rehman. The court on Thursday found all four guilty in the photojournalist’s gangrape, too. The court, however, reserved the sentencing till Monday, after Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam moved an application seeking addition of section 376 (e) in the case.</p>
<p>As per the new amendments, whoever has been previously convicted of an offence, punishable under section 376 or section 376(a) or section 376(d) and is subsequently convicted of an offence punishable under any of the said sections, shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with death. Nikam, however, did not specify if he would press for the death penalty in the photojournalist’s case.</p>
<p>The court, in a strongly worded judgement, observed Friday that the act was far from being termed as a “lenient crime”.</p>
<p>The accused were called to the dock and informed about the verdict. Each one said they had a family to fend for and prayed for mercy. Nikam pointed out that the victim was shattered, too. “She is still in the vegetative state. The medical officer has informed this court that the girl is still suffering with an acute post-traumatic stress. She has been scarred by these shameless men. Let us not be kind towards these unkind men,” he argued.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015813&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having fielded Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee from the Diamond Harbour seat in West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress seems to have accepted the reality of dynastic politics. After fielding Kamalapati Tripathi’s granddaughter Indira Tiwari from Varanasi, the party has also fielded Parvez Ahmed, grandson of former president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, from Barpeta in Assam.<br />
<strong>NOT OUT YET</strong></p>
<p>Even as the Congress high command on Friday chose to replace sitting MP from Anandpur Sahib Ravneet Singh Bittu with Ambika Soni, there is an interesting sidelight to the decision. Bittu, who had earlier been declared candidate from the constituency, had begun his campaign in right earnest, sending emails about his campaign on a daily basis to the media. Ironically, even on Friday journalists received two emails from his office about his campaign. There are also indications that if Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tiwari does not contest again from Ludhiana due to health problems, Bittu could be fielded from there.<br />
<strong>Lost in transit</strong><br />
It took the CBI more than two weeks to register the preliminary enquiry into the HAL-Rolls Royce deal as the reference made by the Defence Ministry to CBI was lost in transit. The initial complaint from the ministry instead of coming to the CBI headquarters landed at the agency branch in Bangalore, which caused the delay. The Bangalore branch of CBI, it is learnt, did not inform the headquarters even as senior officers frantically went looking for the complaint. CBI Director Ranjit Sinha later pulled up his officers in Bangalore for the delay.<br />
<strong>CALLED OFF</strong><br />
The Ministry of Home Affairs has called off the meeting on encounter policy, scheduled to take place next week. The ministry had convened the meeting of state chief secretaries and DGPs on March 26 to discuss a national policy in cases of encounter deaths. However, after several states expressed inability to appear for the meeting citing compulsions relating to the Lok Sabha elections, the ministry deferred the meeting until after elections.</p>

<p>It will take no less than Narendra Modi performing yoga under his tutelage for Baba Ramdev to forgive the BJP for not fielding any of the 30-odd candidates he suggested. Modi will join Ramdev’s Yoga Mahotsav at Ramlila Maidan on Sunday. Ramdev on his part is ready to go to Varanasi to campaign for BJP’s prime ministerial nominee and denies any differences with the BJP over candidates.</p>
<p>“Modiji will come to Ramlila and do yoga to honour the highest traditions of India where the king and people follow the path of spirituality in unison. This is to dispel the myth that India is a religion-neutral country,” he said. The BJP, he added, will soon give a written commitment to the economic agenda he had unveiled some time back at Talkatora Stadium. Asked if he is ready to campaign for Modi in Varanasi, he said: “Why not.”</p>
<p>Ramdev has been sounding public warnings to the BJP about how the party is becoming overconfident. Sources say he was upset because the BJP paid little heed to the list of candidates he had submitted but Ramdev denied it.</p>
<p>He put up a strong defence of Modi’s decision to fight from two seats saying that it is an “emotional decision, not a political one”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015794&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Former Army chief General V K Singh on Friday filed his nomination as the BJP candidate from Ghaziabad, declaring his age as “62 years and 11 months” — the age he had claimed when he had gone to the Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p>He had been embroiled in a controversy over his age after he contended that his date of birth should be treated as May 10, 1951, as mentioned in his matriculation certificate, for the purpose of retirement. The Defence Ministry rejected it, saying May 10, 1950 was the date he had entered in his UPSC form for NDA. Singh had contested this in the Supreme Court but later withdrew his petition.</p>
<p>While filing his papers Friday, Singh confirmed that the age in his nomination papers was the same as the one in his “matriculation certificate”.</p>
<p>Flanked by supporters, he said, “The issues that I am fighting this election are the ones that concern the people directly, beginning from good, strong governance.”</p>
<p>Shazia Ilmi, the AAP candidate for the constituency who also filed her nomination on Friday, said Singh will have to deal with a certain degree of anti-incumbency. “No development has taken place in Ghaziabad, in spite of a prominent leader like Rajnath Singh being the sitting MP here. There has been no development and that’s something V K Singh will have to answer for,” she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015772&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

In a rare display of affection, Modi hugged the 42-year-old actor, who went to seek support and explore possibility of an alliance in rest of Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>Brother of Congress leader and Union Tourism Minister K Chiranjeevi, Pawan Kalyan is looking at the possibility of a BJP-TDP-Jana Sena tie-up which could deal a big blow to the Congress in Seemandhra where the party faces complete rout over the state’s bifurcation.</p>
<p>“I and my party won’t be contesting elections. We will support some non-Congress candidates. We intend to fight against the Congress. Congress hatao, desh bachao,” said Pawan Kalyan.</p>
<p>Given the fluctuating political fortunes in Seemandhra, a BJP-TDP-Jana Sena tie-up could alter the political equations as the Jana Sena may swing or break votes in several coastal constituencies, upsetting the calculations of leading contender YSR Congress Party.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chiranjeevi on Friday gingerly tested the waters in Srikakulam district of Seemandhra where anti-Congress sentiments run high over division of state.</p>
<p>Chirajeevi, accompanied by Seemandhra PCC chief Raghuveera Reddy and several former ministers, started a ‘mass-contact’ programme. Wary of embarrassing protests, dissention and criticism in public, Chirajeevi, who was appointed chairman of campaign committee, decided to call it a ‘mass-contact’ programme. “We will talk to people, tell them why the division of state became necessary and why each region will benefit from the division. Our first priority is to boost the morale of party cadre,” he said.</p>
<p>The Congress first plans to tour Seemandhra and hold public meetings to explain the circumstances and compulsions for bifurcation, before launching a full-fledged campaign so that its candidates do not face angry crowds.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015788&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[A day after the BJP stitched together a six-party alliance in Tamil Nadu to take on the state’s two main players - AIADMK and DMK.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015745&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dmk1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015783" alt="BJP president Rajnath Singh with alliance partners in Chennai. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dmk1.jpg" /></a> BJP president Rajnath Singh with alliance partners in Chennai. (PTI)
<p><strong>Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK)</strong></p>
<p>Being the only one in the group that can claim to have a vote bank across the state, the party floated by actor-turned-politician Vijayakant, was expected to bargain hard for a lion’s share once the discussions moved to seat-sharing. At the end, the party cornered 14 seats, including five from where it had won over a lakh votes in 2009, and another two with over 90,000.</p>
<p>With the DMK and the AIADMK holding 20-30% vote share, the Congress (and its splinter, Tamil Manila Congress) occupied the third place for decades since 1970s. There were a few newcomers, but none could claim the statewide appeal that these three had. That changed in 2006, when the angry ‘Captain’ burst into the scene. Vijayakant was the only winner among the 232 candidates it fielded. But it got 8.34% votes, playing spoilsport in most constituencies. In 2009, he went alone once again despite advice against it, and won 10.30% votes. In the severely-splintered Tamil Nadu vote bank, these are significant numbers. It went for an alliance for the first time in the 2011 Assembly election and won 29 of the 41 seats it contested as part of the AIADMK-led alliance, emerging as the second biggest party in the House.</p>
<p>Vijayakant had a spat with AIADMK general secretary and Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa inside the Assembly, after which the latter said she regretted aligning with his party. Her party worked on DMDK MLAs and has so far managed to prise out nine. But for a party that garners every vote in its leader’s name, this is unlikely to have a major impact on its electoral prospects. After being the junior partner last time, this election is the stage where Vijayakant has to prove if his party can pull itself and partners through. For, that will be his chip to stake claim for his real ambition — Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK)</strong></p>
<p>This was one of the most difficult pieces in the NDA jigsaw, as the question was about accommodating the competing interests between the DMDK and the PMK, rivals for the same piece of communal vote pie in the same region of influence. Though a settlement was reached, this rivalry is bound to continue.</p>
<p>The party has its roots in Vanniyar Sangam, an outfit working for the welfare of the Vanniyars, an intermediary caste that accounts for about 12% of the state’s population. Though this figure is not very impressive, that it is concentrated in the north and north-western districts makes it influential beyond these figures.</p>
<p>Since the formation of its political wing, PMK, in 1989, Ramadoss has been claiming exclusive right over the community votebank. However, it was not as if the community was under-represented. Parties like Toilers Party and Commonweal Party formed by leaders from the community were very influential post-Independence before being subsumed in the Congress. Now, Vanniyars are spread across parties.</p>
<p>What made Ramadoss and his party different was its appeal among the poorer section of the community. By aligning with the frontrunner in successive elections, PMK won seats and vote share, and Ramadoss began portraying himself as the kingmaker. Whenever this strength was tested, as is the case now, Ramadoss returned to the hardline caste roots, primarily being anti-Dalit, that is said to have an appeal among the core voters.</p>
<p>The threats to him are two-fold, from the DMK which fielded senior Vanniyar leaders to take on Ramadoss, and the DMDK that has eaten into the Vanniyar votes he has invested every last penny on.</p>
<p>The party performed poorly in the 2009 Lok Sabha and 2011 Assembly polls. These results were tied to Rajya Sabha nomination for his son Anbumani, which did not materialise. This time, Anbumani is contesting for the first time, surely eyeing Cabinet slot in the NDA government.</p>
<p><strong>Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK)</strong></p>
<p>In Tamil Nadu, the loudest voice endorsing BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi is heard not from its regional HQ, Kamalalayam, but from Thayagam, office of the MDMK. Its general secretary Vaiyapuri Gopalaswamy alias Vaiko was the one most enthusiastic about the alliance with BJP, a party with which he has had good relation during Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s NDA. The MDMK’s eagerness to be part of a grand coalition is understandable, considering the reversals it had to face in the recent past. Few of its senior members returned to the parent DMK, and it was forced to sit out of the last Assembly election after being ejected from the alliance by lead partner, AIADMK. Winning a handsome vote share — and possibly a few of the seven seats —  it is important for it to stay relevant in the coming days.</p>
<p>Once the most promising young leader in DMK, Vaiko launched the MDMK in 1994 after being expelled. The party did not prosper as he would have liked, and remained electorally relevant only in a few seats, mainly in south Tamil Nadu. But in its area of influence, the MDMK still has a committed bunch of cadre who will provide the last-mile connectivity to alliance partners. This would especially be of help for the BJP that has a product in Modi, but not the foot soldiers to sell it.</p>
<p><strong>Kongunadu Makkal</strong> <strong>Desiya Katchi (KMDK)</strong></p>
<p>The party from the Kongu region, the industrialised western belt, is a new start-up in the sub-regional, caste-based political grouping, espousing the cause of the intermediary communities, particularly the Gounders. Like Vanniyars in the north, this is a strong community in the west; and like their fraternal caste mates, they position themselves socially and politically as anti-Dalit. What makes the caste more influential is their financial might — according to some estimates, the region contributes to more than a third of the state’s revenue.</p>
<p>The original outfit, the Kongu Nadu Munnetra Kazhagam, cut its teeth in the 2009 general election where it contested 12 seats and won 1.91% of votes polled. That figure, however, does not convey the real picture. In four of those constituencies, the fledgling party scored over a lakh votes, pushing the DMDK to number four. With double digit vote share at Coimbatore (15.54%), Erode (13.90%), Pollachi (13.35%) and Tiruppur (12.85%), the party proved its significance.</p>
<p>It chose the wrong side by deciding to contest as part of the DMK alliance, and won none of the seven it contested. And since then, it has splintered into three, with the KMDK emerging as the most influential among the lot. They are key partners for the BJP to have a fighting chance from Coimbatore, an important constituency for the saffron party.</p>
<p><strong>Indiya Jananayaka Katchi (IJK)</strong></p>
<p>Numerically, this is the surprise constituent in the NDA. Formed just before last Assembly election, the IJK contested from 126 seats, and forfeited deposited in every one of them. The numbers were so dismal that its candidates got over only three figures in half of them, lowest being 173 votes.</p>
<p>What it lacks in strength, it makes up for clout. Its founder T R Pachamuthu is one of the richest edu-preneurs in the state, who owns the SRM Group that runs several private professional education institutions. The group has interests in software, construction and road transport. More importantly in the election season, he also owns Puthiya Thalaimurai (New Generation), a news channel that is arguably the best in business at the moment.</p>
<p>To be fair, the channel has not glorified its owner as much as the other Tamil news channels do, but it is likely to favour a fresh, alternative politics — which is what the BJP claims to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Bharatiya janata party (BJP)</strong></p>
<p>Among the smallest parties in the coalition, the party draws its power from being the leader of the national-level alliance. In the land of Dravidian politics, there is little space left for the BJP. It won none in 1996 — the most creditable performance was present state unit president Pon Radhakrishnan coming runner up from Nagercoil (now Kanyakumari constituency).</p>
<p>In 1998, however, contesting in alliance with the AIADMK, it won three seats — Coimbatore, Kanyakumari and Nilgiris. It vote share went over double to 6.9%. The partnership lasted only about a year, and the DMK came forward to offer support. In 1999 election, the BJP retained the three seats and won Tiruchy as well, increasing its vote share to 7.1%. Many predicted a lotus bloom, which did not happen.</p>
<p>In the 2004 Lok Sabha election, the AIADMK and the BJP were washed away in the widespread displeasure against incumbent government at Centre and state, winning none of the 39 seats. Nothing changed in 2009 election as well, and Radhakrishnan remained the only strong candidate.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015745&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A fake letter by Uma Bharati expressing a wish to contest from here, a fake sting operation involving sitting MP Kailash Joshi, mysterious hoardings welcoming L K Advani to the Madhya Pradesh capital, the delay over announcement of its candidate for Bhopal seat. The events of the past few days are causing a great deal of embarrassment for the BJP.</span></p>
<p>Just when it appeared that Advani’s decision to settle for Gandhinagar had finally ended conjectures over his possible candidature from Bhopal, a letter purportedly written by Bharati surfaced Friday, which said she was keen on contesting from Bhopal, not Jhansi from where she has been fielded.</p>
<p>The letter purpotedly written by Bharati and carried by a section of the media quoted her as accusing CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and state chief Narendra Tomar of going great lengths to ensure that she is kept out of the state.</p>
<p>In the evening, Bharati issued an official statement saying she never wrote any letter to party chief Rajnath Singh. “All this is baseless, unfounded and shameful,’’ she said blaming the forged letter on “forces that are hatching conspiracies to create hurdles to prevent Narendra Modi from becoming Prime Minister and BJP from coming to power’’.</p>
<p>She said she had come to Nagpur Thursday to address a meeting along with Nitin Gadkari and Prahlad Patel and was stuck there due a leg injury. She said she could travel to Jhansi only after medical advice.</p>
<p>The fake letter surfaced amid speculation that she was in Nagpur to meet top RSS leaders.</p>
<p>It’s an open secret that MP BJP leaders want Bharati to be kept away from the state arguing that that her presence could destabilise the party and the government.</p>
<p>The fake letter followed another controversy over a fake sting operation that showed Joshi, sitting at his home accompanied by local leaders, jokingly demanding Rs 1 crore from someone over the phone.</p>
<p>While Congress approached the EC with copies of the ‘sting operation’, Joshi’s son and minister in MP government Deepak Joshi alleged that an hour before the CD was made public he got a call from a local television network demanding money for hushing up the matter. He said he would approach the police after getting call records.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015765&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barely 10 days after the alliance was announced with much fanfare in the presence of Trinamool general secretary Mukul Roy, the Peace Party has quietly called off his ties with TMC. So has the Rishipal Ambawata faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union that had joined hands with TMC the same day. Both cite the departure of Anna Hazare and TMC’s inevitable digression from Hazare’s 17-point agenda as the main reason for the decision.</p>
<p>“They did not invite us for the March 12 Ramlila rally and showed no inclination to talk to us,” Peace Party president Dr Mohammed Ayub said.</p>
<p><strong>Maut ka saudagar’ apt description of Modi, says Congress</strong></p>
<p>The Congress Friday revived the ‘maut ka saudagar’ tag for BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi, claiming it was an “apt title” for him and blaming him for the Godhra incident as well as the riots in Gujarat that followed. “BJP had lost three byelections after Modi became chief minister&#8230; he knew he was losing. So he orchestrated or allowed the Godhra train tragedy and then the riots to take place. If you don’t call him maut ka saudagar, what else will you call him,” Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said.x</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015757&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Singh said Narendra Modi was very clear about fulfilling Bihar’s demand if the NDA came to power.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015752&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Former bureaucrat and outgoing Rajya Sabha member N K Singh quit the JD(U) on Friday and will join the BJP on Saturday. Singh told The Indian Express on Friday that he was disappointed at not being re-nominated to the Rajya Sabha, and especially “by the manner in which it (the denial of nomination) was done”.</span></p>
<p>Singh said the JD(U) had moved its focus away from development to survival following the split with the BJP. He said he had been a prime mover of the demand for special category status that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been aggressively pursuing with the central government, and could now see it being fulfilled by a likely NDA regime.</p>
<p>“I have resigned from the primary membership of JD(U), and have given detailed reasons in a letter to the Bihar chief minister. It is true that I was disappointed at not being re-nominated to the Rajya Sabha but I was more upset at the manner in which it was done, by being asked to contest the Lok Sabha election from Banka, which I declined. If Nitishji had wanted me to stand for Lok Sabha, he should have told me well in advance,” Singh said.</p>
<p>Former deputy chief minister and BJP legislature party leader Sushil Kumar Modi said: “N K Singh will join BJP at 3 pm tomorrow (Saturday) in Delhi. He has done a lot for national and international branding of Bihar with his intellectual inputs. He will surely be an asset to us.”</p>
<p>Asked if he was hopping to the BJP because the party appeared to be on the ascendant, Singh, whose younger brother Uday Singh is the BJP MP from Purnea, said: “I have worked as secretary to Prime Minister A B Vajpayee, and have been a member of the Planning Commission during NDA rule. I am one of the few leaders who has not attacked the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, directly or indirectly.”</p>
<p>Singh said Narendra Modi was very clear about fulfilling Bihar’s demand if the NDA came to power.</p>
<p>Without revealing details of his letter to Nitish, Singh said his association with the JD(U) was strong at the time the chief minister was taking huge development initiatives, which he had “frittered away post the NDA split, and focused on the strategy of survival”.</p>
<p>Asked what role he saw for himself in the BJP, Singh said: “Surely a role in the think tank, I guess. But I will join BJP without any condition”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015752&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Senior Uttarakhand Congress leader and Pauri MP Satpal Maharaj crossed over to the BJP on Friday, pushing the state government of Chief Minister Harish Rawat towards instability. </span></p>
<p>At least three of the Congress’s 33 MLAs in the 70-member house are Satpal loyalists, including his wife Amrita Rawat, who is a minister in the state government. One independent MLA supporting the government is also in the Satpal camp.</p>
<p>The MP has been bitterly critical of Chief Minister Harish Rawat. He has reportedly been the most annoyed by the chief minister’s refusal to give the horticulture portfolio to his wife. Amrita Rawat had horticulture in the government of Vijay Bahuguna, who was chief minister before Rawat took over last month.</p>
<p>The Uttarakhand BJP is happy to have Satpal Maharaj as a significant Thakur leader which it has been missing, especially in the Garhwal region.</p>
<p>“The BJP lacked a prominent Thakur face in Garhwal to counter CM Rawat’s influence among Thakur voters who have considerable presence across the state. Although Rawat is from Kumaon, he is in a position to strengthen his grip over Thakur votes in Garhwal following his elevation as CM,” a BJP leader said.</p>
<p>Pauri faced the brunt of last summer’s natural disaster, and the Congress is believed to be facing major anti-incumbency at the seat. Satpal had announced he would not contest the Lok Sabha election before he joined the BJP. The BJP has fielded former CM B C Khanduri at the seat.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015735&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ssin-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015654" alt=" Amarinder Singh to take on senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley, who is fighting his maiden electoral battle. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ssin-med.jpg" /></a> Amarinder Singh to take on senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley, who is fighting his maiden electoral battle.
<p>Bowing to the “order” of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh Friday agreed to run for the Lok Sabha from Amritsar and take on senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley, setting the stage for what is expected to be a keen contest.</p>
<p>Amarinder had been reluctant to contest saying his wife, Patiala MP Preneet Kaur, needed him for campaigning there. He had also opposed an earlier proposal by Punjab Congress chief Partap Bajwa to field him from Bathinda.</p>
<p>“I got a call from the party president half-an-hour ago. She asked me to contest from Amritsar as the party needed me there. I agreed immediately. I had said yesterday that I would not ignore the orders of the party president. Hence, I stand by my word and commitment to the party,” Amarinder told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>“I know it will be a problem for Preneet and me to contest two seats but I will handle the Amritsar constituency and ask my trusted colleague Sukh Sarkaria to handle her campaign in Patiala,” Amarinder said.</p>
<p>Sources said Preneet Kaur had sent urgent messages to Sonia, requesting her not to nominate Amarinder from Amritsar saying she, a three-time MP from Patiala, was facing anti-incumbency and needed her husband to campaign for her.</p>
<p>Amarinder is the MLA from Patiala and was chief minister from 2002 to 2007.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A minor scuffle between Kashmiri students and locals turned serious at the Mewar University in Chittorgarh with both sides pelting stones at each other injuring one. The local police rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control.</p>
<p>According to police officials, the Kashmiri students wanted to postpone their practical classes and schedule them after offering namaz. They were in discussion with the college authorities when local boys attacked them. The Mewar University has over 550 Kashmiri students, out of which 250 were present during the incident and they retaliated by pelting stones at the locals. “No Kashmiri student was hurt in the incident but one local boy sustained minor injuries. The situation is now under control and police deployment has been sent to the college campus to maintain law and order,” said Prasanna Khamesra, superintendent of police, Chittorgarh.</p>
<p>Locals, however, had a different version that the police refused to corroborate. The local boys said that the Kashmiri students had raised ‘Pakistan zindabad’ slogans ahead of the India-Pakistan match scheduled for Friday evening and in retaliation to this they had attacked the Kashmiri students. The police, however, maintained that no such incident was reported to them.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015651&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kalmadi-med.jpg" /></a> Congress MP Suresh Kalmadi said he will announce his decision on contesting the polls in the next two days. (PTI)
<p>Sulking after being denied Pune Lok Sabha seat renomination, sitting Congress MP Suresh Kalmadi today said he will announce his decision on contesting the polls in the next two days, even as Congress leaders tried to seek his support for the official candidate Vishwajeet Kadam.</p>
<p>Kalmadi, who was closeted with his supporters at his residence to discuss the future course of action, said his consultations with them were still inconclusive and would continue tomorrow.</p>
<p>When contacted, Kalmadi, who had been suspended from the party following the CWG scam, confirmed that Maharashtra minister Harshawardhan Patil (Congress) had called on him today seeking his support for the party&#8217;s official candidate and state Youth Congress president Vishwajeet Kadam.</p>
<p>&#8220;He sought my support. I told him I would abide by my supporters&#8217; opinion,&#8221; Kalmadi said.</p>
<p>About his meeting with Kalmadi, Patil said, &#8220;we have requested him to involve his supporters in the election campaign of Kadam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked whether he wanted Congress high command to nominate his wife Meera for the Pune seat in view of the CWG scam allegations against him, Kalmadi replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&#8220;If not me because of the so-called scam, my wife could have been given the ticket in my place. I had told the high command to consider my wife&#8217;s nomination as she is an active member of the party engaged in social work in slums,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When asked why his wife too was not considered for the seat, he said &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will announce my decision on contesting the polls in the next two days,&#8221; the MP said.</p>
<p>Kalmadi also said that during today&#8217;s discussions, many of his supporters wanted the high command to revoke his suspension effected after his arrest in the CWG case in 2011.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NCP leader and state deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, a known Kalmadi detractor, today held a joint meeting<br />
of Congress and NCP workers at Congress Bhavan to chalk out election strategy to ensure the victory of Kadam, who enjoys a<br />
close rapport with the NCP leadership.</p>
<p>Kalmadi, a three-time MP from Pune, is still considered a heavyweight in city politics with his strong base of supporters in the civic body.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015644&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi-m4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011836" alt="modi-m" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi-m4.jpg" /></a> Congress has declared that it will give a tough fight to Modi both in Varanasi and Vadodara. (PTI)
<p>Congress&#8217; city unit chief Narendra Rawat will take on Narendra Modi in Vadodara Lok Sabha constituency but the party is still undecided on a nominee to be fielded against the Bharatiya Janata Party&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate in Varanasi.</p>
<p>Rawat has emerged as the party candidate in Vadodara after the primaries held for the seat, party spokesman Shaktisinh Gohil said on Friday.</p>
<p>Congress has declared that it will give a tough fight to Modi both in Varanasi and Vadodara.</p>
<p>It has, however, refused to specify who will be the nominee in Varanasi, saying at least three candidates have been shortlisted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a former Congress MP J K Jain suggested that senior leader Karan Singh would be the ideal candidate to take on Modi in Varanasi since Singh is a scholar, well versed in the Hindu ancient scriptures and had been associated with the Benaras Hindu University.</p>
<p>Party General Secretary Madhusudan Mistry had said a few days back that the Congress will give a &#8220;good fight&#8221; to Modi on Varanasi seat and did not rule out fielding an &#8216;outsider&#8217;.</p>
<p>Among the local candidates, the names of Rajesh Mishra and Ajay Rai are doing the rounds. A section in the Congress wants an influential leader pitched against Modi, while others want a celebrity to be fielded against him.</p>
<p>A section feels that after the exit of BJP veteran Murli Manohar Joshi from the electoral contest from the holy city, fielding a Brahmin candidate by Congress could be advantageous.</p>
<p>Senior Congress leader Anil Shastri in a tweet had said &#8220;If BSP &amp; SP are serious on defeating Modi from Varanasi, they along with Congress should put up a joint candidate against him&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015636&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nirmala-med.jpg" /></a> <br />&#8220;Instead of decrying attempts by Narendra Modi to honour Patel as a national leader&#8230;, Congress should come clean on how they have celebrated him,&#8221; Nirmala said. (PTI)
<p>BJP on Friday attacked Rahul Gandhi for &#8220;changing&#8221; facts while targeting the party and asked the Congress leadership to introspect over the &#8220;lack of faith&#8221; of its leaders in the party instead of looking into BJP&#8217;s affairs.</p>
<p>Party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said Gandhi had recently attacked BJP and its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for claiming the legacy of Sardar Patel and cited certain figures to target the development during the NDA rule. &#8220;He was wrong on both counts,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of decrying attempts by Narendra Modi to honour Patel as a national leader&#8230;, Congress should come clean on how they have celebrated him,&#8221; she said, and quoted a report which claimed that over 460 official projects, institutions and other entities were named after members of Gandhi family but almost none, barring the police academy in Hyedrabad, after Patel.</p>
<p>Gandhi, she said, claimed in his rallies that only 2,650 kms of roads were built during the NDA rule even though his own government&#8217;s affidavit in Supreme Court said it was 23,814 km.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder who gives him authority to change facts. Are you trying to mislead the country? Are you trying to reject the affidavit filed by your own government in the Supreme Court?,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Referring to Finance Minister P Chidambaram&#8217;s decision to not contest the Lok Sabha poll and defection of Congress leaders like Satpal Maharaj to the BJP, she said there is a challenge to Congress leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the number of leaving the party, not wanting the ticket&#8230; This reflects a lack of faith in the leadership. They should introspect over it rather than looking into affairs of other parties,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015630&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bjp-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015462 " alt="BJP, which drew a blank in the last two parliamentary elections in Tamil Nadu, hopes to reverse the trend this time around, seeking to cash in on the 'Modi wave.'" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bjp-med.jpg" /></a> For party&#8217;s campaign, grassroot workers and BJP&#8217;s municipal councillors are contacting every voter to seek support for the party. (PTI)
<p>BJP on Monday claimed that the Congress will repeat its assembly election failure in Delhi and will come &#8220;third&#8221; in all seven seats in the Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a massive support for the BJP and Narendra Modi in Delhi. We are sure that all seven BJP candidates will win by record margins,&#8221; Delhi BJP&#8217;s chairman of campaign committee Vijay Kumar Malhotra said.</p>
<p>He announced that BJP Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi will address a public rally in the national capital on March 26 to seek support of people for the Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>Asked about venue of Modi&#8217;s rally, he said it is being finalised. Malhotra said before Delhi goes to poll on April 10, Modi may address a few more rallies.</p>
<p>About party&#8217;s campaign, Malhotra said grassroot workers and BJP&#8217;s municipal councillors are contacting every voter to seek support for the party.</p>
<p>Taking potshot at the Congress party, he said it struggled to find candidates due to which all sitting MPs have been fielded.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Congress will come third in all the seven seats,&#8221; he said. Congress had suffered a humiliating defeat in the recent Delhi assembly election, winning just eight out of 7O seats.</p>
<p>The BJP leader also targeted the Aam Aadmi Party accusing it of &#8220;misleading&#8221; the people of Delhi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015619&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kejriwal-main5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993080" alt="Kejriwal had in a letter to the EC termed the gas price hike as violation of the Model Code of Conduct." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kejriwal-main5.jpg" /></a> Kejriwal had in a letter to the EC termed the gas price hike as violation of the Model Code of Conduct.
<p>Election Commission has taken note of AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal&#8217;s complaint that on a proposal by Reliance Industries, petroleum ministry is going to hike gas prices from April 1 and said it would examine the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Commission will look into it and the urgency shown in going ahead with the decision,&#8221; Election Commissioner H S Brahma told a press conference here flanked by Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampat. &#8220;A decision that was awaited for so long could be put on hold for another two months,&#8221; Sampat said.</p>
<p>The commission was to review poll preparations in Uttar Pradesh. Kejriwal had in a letter to the EC termed the gas price hike as violation of the Model Code of Conduct and alleged that the decision was aimed at providing windfall gains to Mukesh Ambani&#8217;s Reliance Industries.</p>
<p>Sampat directed effective deployment of central forces for peaceful and impartial polling and warned that officials found to be working in a partisan manner would be immediately removed from election duty. &#8220;Clear directions have been given for effective deployment of central security forces at the polling centres for conducting elections in a peaceful and impartial manner,&#8221; Sampat, who has been camping in the state capital since yesterday, said.</p>
<p>On complaints of some political parties that certain officials were working in a biased manner, Sampat said, &#8220;Any official found to be working in a partial manner would not be allowed to continue with poll-related work.&#8221;<br />
He said representatives of some political parties had submitted certain complaints. These would be verified and suitable action taken.</p>
<p>On the complaint of some political parties that fake cases were being filed against political workers and leaders, he said the chief electoral officer of the state would take appropriate steps. About political leaders making derogatory allegations and comments against their opponents, Sampat said the EC would not desist from taking action against anyone crossing the line of decency or violating the Model Code.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015622&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/harsh-tt.jpg" /></a> Delhi BJP president Vardhan, who was party&#8217;s Chief Ministerial candidate in the assembly polls, filed nomination for the Chandni Chowk constituency . (PTI)
<p>Harsh Vardhan, Meenakshi Lekhi,Ajay Maken, Ashutosh and Rakhi Birla were among a host of leaders from BJP, Congress and Aam Aadmi who filed nomination papers for the April 10 Lok Sabha polls in Delhi.</p>
<p>Delhi BJP president Vardhan, who was party&#8217;s Chief Ministerial candidate in the assembly polls, filed nomination for the Chandni Chowk constituency where Union Minister Kapil Sibal and AAP&#8217;s Ashutosh are other two formidable contenders.</p>
<p>Exhuding confidence in winning the seat, Vardhan said there has been a wave for BJP in the entire country and the party will come out with spectacular performance in the election in the national capital as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am proud that Narendra Modi and the BJP high command have chosen me as the candidate for Chandni Chowk.This constituency is very special to me as I was born and spent the first 15 years of my life here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ashutosh, accompanied by large number of AAP supporters also filed his nomination today. In the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, Sibal had won the seat defeating BJP&#8217;s Smriti Irani. In 2009, he beat BJP&#8217;s Vijender Gupta.</p>
<p>BJP spokesperson Lekhi and Maken also filed their nomination papers before the Returning officer at Jamnagar House for the prestigious New Delhi constituency.</p>
<p>Maken, an AICC General Secretary and Communication Department chairman, was accompanied by his mother, wife, two daughters, son and some supporters.</p>
<p>Lekhi came to the Returning Officer&#8217;s office, herself driving a white colour open jeep to give a message of women empowerment. She was accompanied by senior BJP leader V K Malhotra, her husband Aman Lekhi and son Pranay Lekhi, who is handling her social media campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would just be talking about development work done by me and I would like to extend my best wishes to the contenders,&#8221; Maken told reporters.</p>
<p>When BJP candidate Lekhi was asked whether Maken had an upper hand due to his experience, she said, &#8220;I know election<br />
management. This time I am a challenge for him and you should ask this question to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aam Aadmi Party has fielded journalist-turned-politician Ashish Khetan from the seat. He filed his nomination papers yesterday. Khetan is the founder of news portal gulail.com.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015588&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Friday alleged that the BJP had sold party tickets in the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;BJP has sold its tickets&#8230;the party has done nothing in Haryana,&#8221; he said, adding that the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) will vanish from the political secne of the state after the polls.</p>
<p>He was speaking at the poll office in Bhiwani after accompanying Congress nominee Shruti Choudhary who filed her nomination seeking re-election from Bhiwani-Mahendergarh seat.</p>
<p>Shruti, in her affidavit, declared total assets worth Rs 11,95,70,000 including Rs 27,000 cash and liabilities of Rs 3,91,67,000.</p>
<p>Speaking on the occasion, the MP condemned the attack on her mother and Public Health Minister Kiran Chaudhary at a public meeting in Narnaul two days back, saying only criminal-minded people could do it.</p>
<p>She said her opponents had failed to face her in the polls and were now using such derogatory moves.</p>
<p>She said she believed in people&#8217;s court and they would give a suitable answer by defeating such forces in the election.</p>
<p>Congress leaders from the state displayed a show of unity by coming together on the occasion.</p>
<p>AICC working committee member Satyavrat Chaturvedi, Rajya Sabha MP Birender Singh, ministers Satpal Sangwan, Rao Narender Singh, CPS Rao Daan Singh, CPSs Anita Yadav and Ram Kishan Fauji marked their presence.</p>

<p><strong>INDIRA AND AFTER</strong></p>

<p>This election was fought in the immediate backdrop of the assassination of PM Indira Gandhi by her guards, followed by riots that saw Sikhs being hunted down in several cities. Just before this was a phase of separatism and Sikh militancy, while Assam in 1983 had seen the massacre of thousands in Nellie. A shaky Indira had been taking an ambiguous stand on both Assam and Punjab — until t the storming of the Golden Temple, which angered Sikhs and eventually led to her assassination. Rajiv Gandhi (MP from Amethi, constituency of his deceased brother Sanjay) was instantly sworn in as PM although the cabinet had more senior members such as Pranab Mukherjee. What seemed to dictate judgment completely was concerns about national security.</p>

<p><strong>STANDOUT FEATURES</strong></p>
<p>This remains the last election that gave any single party a clear majority. It was the first time the Congress won a three-quarters-plus majority. It was the poll debut of Hindu-right BJP. Five independents were elected, a record low.</p>
<p><strong>THE LEADERS</strong><br />
N T Rama Rao had founded the Telugu Desam Party just months earlier; in its first LS election, it contested 34 seats and won 30 against the Congress wave, and became the largest opposition party.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015097&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mamata4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015590" alt="West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee addresses party workers' convention ahead of Lok Sabha election." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mamata4.jpg" /></a> West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee addresses party workers&#8217; convention ahead of Lok Sabha election.
<p>In an apparent dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi, West Bengal Chief Mnister Mamata Banerjee on Friday said she loved the people of Gujarat, but not &#8216;NaMo&#8217; and termed the BJP as &#8220;communal&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the people of Gujarat, but not NaMo, NaMo,&#8221; she told an election rally in Nadia district.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some are saying why I am not taking names (of Modi). Why should I name everyone? Can everybody be named? Let them be. I will speak about policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember there is Lakshman rekha. I maintain political courtesy. And, that is I speak politically and on policies. I am not like Congress, CPI(M) and BJP,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have paid Rs 74,000 crores as interest payment for the huge loans taken by the previous Left Front government in the last three years. If they had to pay so much then would it have been Namo, Namo or No, No?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Banerjee hit out at the Gujarat Chief Minister for taking credit for development work in in his state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlike in Gujarat there is no riot in West Bengal, while the number of child deaths and maternal deaths are much lower in West Bengal,&#8221; she claimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only the Trinamool Congress which can resist the communal BJP and unmask the Congress which while running the government at the Centre followed anti-people policies like FDI in retail and was also responsible for price rise,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015587&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former bureaucrat and outgoing Rajya Sabha member N K Singh quit the JD(U) on Friday and will join the BJP on Saturday. Singh told The Indian Express on Friday that he was disappointed at not being re-nominated to the Rajya Sabha, and especially “by the manner in which it (the denial of nomination) was done”.</p>
<p>Singh said the JD(U) had moved its focus away from development to survival following the split with the BJP. He said he had been a prime mover of the demand for special category status that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been aggressively pursuing with the central government, and could now see it being fulfilled by a likely NDA regime.</p>
<p>“I have resigned from the primary membership of JD(U), and have given detailed reasons in a letter to the Bihar chief minister. It is true that I was disappointed at not being re-nominated to the Rajya Sabha but I was more upset at the manner in which it was done, by being asked to contest the Lok Sabha election from Banka, which I declined. If Nitishji had wanted me to stand for Lok Sabha, he should have told me well in advance,” Singh said.</p>
<p>Former deputy chief minister and BJP legislature party leader Sushil Kumar Modi said: “N K Singh will join BJP at 3 pm tomorrow in Delhi. He has done a lot for national and international branding of Bihar with his intellectual inputs. He will surely be an asset to us.”</p>
<p>Asked if he was hopping to the BJP because the party appeared to be on the ascendant, Singh, whose younger brother Uday Singh is the BJP MP from Purnea, said: “I have worked as secretary to Prime Minister A B Vajpayee, and have been a member of the Planning Commission during NDA rule. I am one of the few leaders who has not attacked the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate, directly or indirectly.”</p>
<p>Singh said Narendra Modi was very clear about fulfilling Bihar’s demand if the NDA came to power.</p>
<p>Without revealing details of his letter to Nitish, Singh said his association with the JD(U) was strong at the time the chief minister was taking huge development initiatives, which he had “frittered away post the NDA split, and focused on the strategy of survival”.</p>
<p>Asked what role he saw for himself in the BJP, Singh said: “Surely a role in the think tank, I guess. But I will join BJP without any condition”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015531&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Plagued by desertions, Congress on Friday dismissed the contention that its leaders are quitting due to its bleak poll prospects and asked BJP why it was keen to field such candidates if there is a wave for Narendra Modi as claimed by the saffron party.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are two kinds of waves. One is natural and the other is fan created. BJP has the other wave. If there is strong support for the cadre based BJP and there is a wave for Narendra Modi, why are they inducting our leaders and fielding them,&#8221; party spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said.</p>
<p>He was responding to questions on its MP from Garhwal Satpal Maharaj joining BJP today. The 62-year-old leader has been with Congress all along barring a few years in 90s when he joined the breakaway Congress (Tiwari).</p>
<p>Former Home Minister and one-time senior Congress leader Buta Singh&#8217;s candidature was announced for Lok Sabha election on a Samajwadi Party ticket from Jalore constituency in Rajasthan.</p>
<p>Singh, who also served as the Union Agriculture Minister in the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet at the Centre between 1984 and 1986, was elected to Lok Sabha eight times between 1962 and 2004. He was Home Minister between 1986 and 1989.</p>
<p>Hailing from Jalandhar in Punjab, Singh was also the Governor of Bihar from 2004 to 2006 and a former chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes between 2007 and 2010.</p>
<p>Gohil, however, downplayed the desertions saying such things happen in the election season. &#8220;And one who engages in more horsetrading manages to take such people,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015541&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bjp6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015579" alt="bjp" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bjp6.jpg" /></a> BJP President Rajnath Singh, party&#8217;s PM candidate Narendra Modi and senior leader LK Advani during party&#8217;s Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting in New Delhi (PTI).<br />
Downplaying Shiv Sena&#8217;s decision to field candidates in UP and other states, BJP on Friday asserted that the two parties are &#8220;inseparable&#8221; and any &#8220;shortcoming&#8221; can be resolved through talks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are standing together firmly for the next elections and the alliance would achieve its best result by winning majority of the 48 seats in Maharashtra,&#8221; BJP President Rajnath Singh said.</p>
<p>He stressed that the relationship between the two parties that has remained strong since the times of Bal Thackeray cannot break at any cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Balasaheb Thackeray was there, he was not just a leader known in Maharashtra but all over the country. Since that time, BJP and Shiv Sena have very strong, old and unbroken relations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can vouch with confidence that the relations of BJP with Shiv Sena cannot break at any cost. If there are any shortcomings in the alliance, we can resolve through talks,&#8221; Singh said while denying there was any issue related to Shiv Sena fielding candidates anywhere else.</p>
<p>He said if there are any smaller issues of coordination, the general secretary incharge of Maharashtra, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, will resolve them.</p>
<p>Rudy said, &#8220;We firmly together stand for the next elections and the alliance would achieve its best and will succeed in getting a majority of the 48 seats in Maharashtra.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an apparent riposte to BJP&#8217;s recent overtures to Raj Thackeray, Shiv Sena on Friday said it will field candidates in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi for Lok Sabha election but at the same time stressed that it will not contest against Narendra Modi and BJP chief Rajnath Singh.</p>
<p>Rajnath Singh said there have been regular talks with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackarey. &#8220;There is not just a political relation with him, but we also share personal ties with him,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Shiv Sena, an NDA constituent led by Uddhav Thackeray, insisted that its alliance with BJP is restricted to Maharashtra. The Sena is miffed due to former BJP chief Nitin Gadkari&#8217;s luncheon meeting with MNS chief Raj Thackeray, estranged cousin of Uddhav, in Mumbai on March 3rd.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have our alliance with BJP in Maharashtra, not in UP. We will strive to expand our party in other parts of the country. Shiv Sena will field 20 candidates in Uttar Pradesh,&#8221; Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut told reporters on Friday.</p>
<p>It will also contest five seats in Bihar and seven in Delhi.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uddhav&#8217;s son and Yuva Sena president Aaditya Thackeray in a tweet said that Sena would not field candidates against Modi, who will contest from Varanasi in UP, and Rajnath Singh in Lucknow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who even believe such funny rumours, well, I feel sorry for them. Therefore, obv (sic) not contesting in Varanasi and Lucknow,&#8221; Aaditya tweeted.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015578&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Former Army Chief and BJP candidate V K Singh on Friday filed his nomination papers from Ghaziabad Lok Sabha constituency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will win from Ghaziabad Lok Sabha constituency. I would like residents of Ghaziabad to vote for me as BJP is the only party which can give a stable government to the country.</p>
<p>After winning elections, I would work for the welfare of Ghaziabad&#8217;s people,&#8221; Singh said.</p>
<p>Asked if he would prefer to become Defence Minister if NDA wins the upcoming elections, he said that he has not thought about this and would continue working for the people.</p>
<p>On the issue of being an outsider in Ghaziabad constituency, Singh said &#8220;being a soldier, the whole country is mine. So I am not an outsider in Ghaziabad&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;When a soldier fights at the border, he serves the country. Being a soldier, the whole country is mine. Ghaziabad&#8217;s people are also mine. I am not an outsider in Ghaziabad,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>On being asked if he would request anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare to campaign for him, he replied &#8220;I would be very happy if Hazare comes forward to campaign for me&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015506&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modimumbaim.jpg" /></a> BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi .(PTI)
<p>Congress on Monday resurrected the &#8220;maut ka saudagar&#8221; barb against Narendra Modi, blaming him for the Godhra incident and the subsequent communal riots in Gujarat, and said the description fitted the BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate.</p>
<p>BJP had lost three bye-elections after Modi became Chief Minister but after that he &#8220;allowed&#8221; the Godhra train tragedy and the riots. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t call him maut ka saudagar (merchant of death), how else can you describe him,&#8221; party spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil told reporters.</p>
<p>His remarks came in a response to a question on whether Congress still thinks that Modi is &#8216;maut ka saudagar&#8217;.</p>
<p>The comments of Gohil, a former CLP leader of Gujarat and known detractor of Modi, is bound to kick up a row as Sonia Gandhi&#8217;s same barb during the campaign in Gujarat assembly elections in 2007 had sparked a huge political controversy.</p>
<p>After the crushing defeat of the party, Congress had refrained from making such remarks fearing a communal polarisation as Modi had used it to the hilt to his advantage.</p>
<p>The Congress spokesperson&#8217;s comments came even as Rahul Gandhi has in last many interactions with party leaders asked them to refrain from personal attacks.</p>
<p>However, it is also true that Congress has stepped up attack on Modi in the last few days as campaigning for Lok Sabha election picks up.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015522&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1990342   " alt="" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/shinde-m1.jpg" /> Ravi Shankar Prasad met Shinde and urged him to ensure security of BJP leaders during the Lok Sabha elections. (PTI)
<p>Allaying concerns of BJP that their leaders were under threat, Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Friday assured the party that they will be provided security.</p>
<p>He said this after a BJP delegation led by Ravi Shankar Prasad met him and urged him to ensure security of BJP leaders during the Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;All BJP leaders who are under threat will be provided security,&#8221; Shinde told reporters after the meeting.</p>
<p>Prasad said they raised the issue of terror threat to BJP leaders and requested him to ensure fool-proof security to them during campaigning.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some elements who want to hamper election process. We told him to ensure proper security,&#8221; he said.<br />
The Home Minister, however, said the government has no information about possible threat to them from terror groups.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no information regarding terror threat to BJP leaders,&#8221; he said. Yesterday, Shinde said adequate security has been given to BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. &#8220;We have given adequate security to Modi,&#8221; he had said.</p>
<p>BJP spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman had yesterday cited media reports which quoted Intelligence sources as saying that the lives of the top BJP leaders were under threat. &#8220;There is a threat to all BJP leaders. Based on IB sources, a section of media has been reporting that the BJP leaders&#8217; lives are under threat and the BJP is very concerned and worried,&#8221; she had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015500&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jaswant-singh-medium.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2015542" alt="JASWANT-SINGH-MEDIUM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jaswant-singh-medium.jpg?w=480" /></a> BJP Leader Jaswant Singh denied BJP ticket from Barmer. (PTI)
<p>The Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday snubbed senior leader Jaswant Singh by denying him a ticket in the Lok Sabha elections in Rajasthan and instead decided to field Col Sonaram Choudhary in Barmer.</p>
<p>The denial of party ticket to Singh, who is considered close to L K Advani, comes a day after the party patriarch was virtually forced to choose the Gandhinagar seat in Gujarat, against his wishes to contest from Bhopal in Madhya Pradesh.</p>
<p>There is speculation that Singh might contest as an independent but there was no confirmation. Choudhary had recently defected from the Congress.</p>
<p>Singh (76), currently a Lok Sabha member from Darjeeling, sought a ticket from Barmer, saying this was his last election and would like to contest it from his home.</p>
<p>The former Union Minister, who has held the portfolios of Finance, Defence and External Affairs during the NDA regime, has had his share of problems with the party ever since he wrote a book on his visit to Pakistan praising its founder-leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah.</p>
<p>The book was banned in Gujarat following some adverse references to Sardar Patel and he was expelled from the party briefly after the controversy over the book.</p>
<p>Singh was also the Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha from 2004 to 2009. He was also the NDA candidate for the Vice President&#8217;s post in 2012.</p>
<p>The changing power equations in Rajasthan, with Vasundhara Raje registering a thumping victory in the assembly elections, have apparently forced the party to deny him the ticket and give it to Choudhary, a Jat leader from the area.</p>
<p>The BJP declared three other seats in Rajasthan, where Manoj Rajoriya was given the party ticket from Karauli-Dholpur (SC) seat, Sanwarmal Jat from Ajmer, who will contest against Sachin Pilot of Congress and P P Choudhary from Pali Lok Sabha seat.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015508&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>50 poets from 21 countries, including India are participating in a festival of poetry focussing on world peace and unity organised by the Sahitya Akademi in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Sabad- A World Poetry Festival aims to present multiple voices of many tongues and visions, styles and  structures to reveal the imaging, civilising and uplifting geography of contemporary poetic imagination of the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Verses which will be recited here celebrate the spirit of independence and will stand against the imperialistic tendencies of certain countries who take over the land of others,&#8221; Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari, President, Sahitya Akademi said.</p>
<p>Tiwari spoke after inaugurating the four-day festival which ends here on March 24. Incidentally, the event is being held in the 150th Birth Anniversary year of Swami Vivekananda and the 100th year of Rabindranath Tagore receiving the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through medium of poetry we want to establish unity of human beings. Poets do not belong to a nation. According to Rabindranath Tagore every country is my country,&#8221; Tiwari said.</p>
<p>Prominent participants at the festival include George Szirtes (UK), Les Wicks (Australia), Kunwar Narain (India), Nikola Madzirov (Macedonia), Najwan Darwish (Palestine), Oscar Cruz (Cuba), Ingrid Storholmen (Norway), Pai Tafdrup (Denmark), Philip Nikolayev (USA) and Tanure Ojaide (Nigeria).</p>
<p>&#8220;Poets belonging to various countries will express their feelings towards humanity in front of the audience which will create a sense of unity. The main focus is unity of human beings,&#8221; Tiwari said.</p>
<p>At the inaugural session poets read out their poetries on a range of issues like war, human atrocities and poetry inspired by India in German, Arabic, Macedonian and English languages.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015475&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Throwing his weight behind Narendra Modi, Yoga guru Ramdev on Friday said that the BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate can provide a stable and honest government to the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi can provide a stable and honest government to the country,&#8221; Ramdev said .</p>
<p>He said that Modi will also participate in the &#8216;YogaMahotsav&#8217; to be held in Ramlila Maidan and across various districts of the country on March 23. Ramdev further said that &#8220;various evil forces&#8221; are creating hurdles for Modi.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many allegations are being made against Modi which are untrue. Evil forces are trying to create hurdles on his way of becoming the Prime Minister but they will be defeated with time,&#8221; said Ramdev. Taking a dig at Congress and Aam Aadmi Party, he said that Congress is already on its way to destruction and AAP is working on the agenda of Congress.</p>
<p>He, however, said that the &#8216;Yoga Mahotsav&#8217; will be a social and spiritual event and even UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi are welcome to be a part of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Yoga Mahotsav has three objectives. It was on March 23 that three freedom fighters Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev laid their lives for the freedom of India on March 23 in 1931. Centre should acknowledge them as martyrs and give them the status of martyrdom,&#8221; Ramdev said.</p>
<p>Secondly, the event is aimed at promoting Yoga and third objective is to blend rationality and development with spirituality. The &#8216;yog Mahotsav&#8217; will be held in 650 districts of the country and crores of people are expected to participate.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015456&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on Saturday urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh not to succumb to Italian government’s pressure, which has already approached the United Nations for the release of marines facing trial in killing Indian fishermen.</p>
<p>In a letter to the Prime Minister, Chandy said the two marines, chargesheeted for murdering fishermen from Kerala, should not be released without trial.</p>
<p>“People of Kerala are anxiously following each stage in the case. The marines had fired deadly shots at the fishermen without any provocation. If the undertrials are released under pressure from the UN or any foreign country, that would give rise to prejudices and belittle our judicial system,’’ Chandy said.</p>
<p>Chandy’s letter was made public in the wake of media reports that Italy has sought the UN intervention, and UN General Assembly Chief John Ashe is coming to Delhi in this regard.</p>
<p>The Congress government in Kerala has resorted to a tough stand, fearing that release of the marines would serve as a weapon for the Opposition LDF in the LS elections.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015455&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Infosys co-founder and Congress candidate Nandan Nilekani on Friday filed his nominations for the Bangalore South Lok Sabha constituency, where he is locked in a tough battle against five-time MP BJP&#8217;s Ananth Kumar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everywhere I went, the refrain was &#8211; We want change now,&#8221; said billionaire Nilekani, who had his political baptism only recently after overseeing implementation of &#8220;Aadhar&#8221; scheme as Chief of Unique Identification Authority of India.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after filing the nomination, he said he stands a chance to win the elections as people&#8217;s response to his campaign was highly positive.</p>
<p>Nilekani, who a day before entering the fray declared that he and his wife have assets worth Rs 7,700 crore, said people&#8217;s complaints revolved around the absence of their MP, and a lack of accountability when it came to addressing local challenges here, an apparent dig at Kumar.</p>
<p>He said he would continue to meet the people at their doors and seek votes for bringing in change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have given shape to a five-point agenda involving problems related to roads and infrastructure, waste segregation, shortage of water, education and jobs for all,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kumar had filed his nomination on March 19. Barring once, BJP has held this middle-class dominated constituency with anti-Congress tilt since 1991, with Kumar winning since 1996.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015449&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>After locking in a six-party alliance for the Lok Sabha election in Tamil Nadu scheduled for April 24, the BJP aims at utilising &#8216;Modi wave&#8217; in the state and will soon finalise a strategy in this direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will hold a meeting on March 24 in which our General Secretary P Muralidhar Rao will participate. We will be deciding on holding Modi&#8217;s public rallies in Tamil Nadu in consultation with allies,&#8221; state unit BJP president Pon.<br />
Radhakrishnan said.</p>
<p>BJP, which drew a blank in the last two parliamentary elections in Tamil Nadu, hopes to reverse the trend this time around, seeking to cash in on the &#8216;Modi wave.&#8217;</p>
<p>The party is confident of putting up a better show in constituencies like Coimbatore, Kanyakumari and Nilagiri (SC) and it intends to invite Modi to address rallies, possibly in all these or at least one of these constituencies.</p>
<p>The Gujarat Chief Minister&#8217;s two public rallies in September last at Tiruchirappalli and February this year in Chennai, had drawn impressive turnouts, quite uncharacteristic for a BJP leader in the state.</p>
<p>BJP had sealed its seat-sharing agreement with DMDK, PMK, MDMK, IJK and KMDK on Thursday. It also has the support of 39 small outfits.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015440&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan on Friday said it will strike a liberalized trade deal with India only after a new government takes over following the Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>The PML-N government here has put off a cabinet meeting scheduled for today that would have discussed among other things the long-pending NDMA (non-discriminatory market access) status to India to boost bilateral trade ties.</p>
<p>Information and Broadcasting Minister Pervaiz Rashid said one of the reasons for postponement was that all cabinet members were not available for the meeting.</p>
<p>India is going for elections in May, and the PML-N government would now strike a trade deal with the new government, he was quoted as saying by the Dawn daily.</p>
<p>Sources told PTI that the cabinet meeting on the issue will now take place in &#8220;couple of weeks&#8221;.</p>
<p>Commerce Ministry spokesman Muhammad Ashraf said that the cabinet was scheduled to discuss, among other things, matters<br />
related to trade with India during the meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Ministry always remains prepared and provides professional input to the cabinet whenever a matter related to trade is to be discussed in the cabinet,&#8221; Ashraf said.</p>
<p>The cabinet meeting was to take two important decisions regarding trade with India — abolishing the negative list of tradable items (1,209 items) and allowing import of more than 7,000 items via Wagha border. Currently, only 138 items are importable from India via this route.</p>
<p>NDMA is a nomenclature chosen by the Pakistan government to avoid political ramifications at home of giving India the most-favoured nation (MFN) status.</p>
<p>Information Minister had said earlier this week that Pakistan will deliver on promises made to India regarding normalisation of bilateral trade ties.</p>
<p>&#8220;The previous PPP government made certain promises to India on trade and we will deliver on these promises. The promises were made by Pakistan government and we are not promising anything extra,&#8221; Rashid had told reporters.</p>
<p>A special government panel chaired by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has already decided to ask the federal cabinet to approve a fresh roadmap for granting NDMA status to India.</p>
<p>India has agreed to provide a level playing field to Pakistani traders and will give tariff concession on various products pertaining to strong sectors such as textile, cement,surgical instruments from here.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015387&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kejriwal7.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003507" alt="Aam Aadmi Party on Friday sacked two leaders from Uttar Pradesh for demanding money in exchange of party tickets. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kejriwal7.jpg" /></a> Aam Aadmi Party on Friday sacked two leaders from Uttar Pradesh for demanding money in exchange of party tickets.
<p>Sending out a strong message to party office bearers, the Aam Aadmi Party today sacked two leaders from Uttar Pradesh for demanding money in exchange of party tickets.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference at his Tilak Lane residence, AAP National Convener Arvind Kejriwal announced sacking of Avadh Zone convener Aruna Singh and Hardoi&#8217;s treasurer Ashok Kumar for demanding money in lieu of giving party tickets for Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last few days we have received complaints that our party workers at the district level have been taking money in return of party ticket. We initially found it to be untrue. &#8220;These two demanded money from prospective candidates in exchange of party tickets. We received complaints, following which we asked for evidence. When the party looked into the evidence, we found the allegations to be true&#8221;, Kejriwal said.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, no kind of financial transaction occurred. Based on the evidence, we decided to sack the two,&#8221; he said, adding that the party was investigating 3-4 more cases. A party leader said one Rajesh Kumar from Sitapur had alleged that money was being taken in exchange of tickets, following which a sting was done by a news channel.<br />
&#8220;Initially, a news channel reporter brought a voice record (sting) before our notice, it was not clear. So, we asked the TV reporter to get fresh evidence and verified it after which an action was taken against the two.&#8221; said the leader.</p>
<p>Kejriwal asked the media and also the candidates looking for party tickets to conduct a sting operation if they found anyone demanding money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whosoever does that, conduct a sting. We will verify it and the person will not be in the party for more than 24 hours after that,&#8221; he said. Kejriwal added that whenever such cases come up, the party looks for the voice and raw footage before arriving at any conclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sending out a clear message, whosoever paid money for the ticket should assume that their money will be wasted. We will also cancel the ticket of the candidate who pays money,&#8221; Kejriwal said. He however, dismissed allegations levelled against former Delhi Minister Rakhi Birla who replaced North-west Delhi candidate Mahender Singh. It was alleged that Birla demanded Rs 7 lakh from Singh for campaigning.</p>
<p>&#8220;We checked the allegations levelled against her. They are untrue,&#8221; Kejriwal said, adding that Singh had not disclosed to the party that he was sent to jail in a case. Reacting to Reliance Industries refuting allegations on receiving favours from Gujarat government, Kejriwal said that the response seemed to come more from the Gujarat Government than Reliance Industries and it was like a &#8220;PR exercise&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reliance on Thursday took to social media to refute allegations of receiving favours from a Gujarat minister who is related to company promoter Mukesh Ambani, saying that the allegations are baseless and politically motivated.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015381&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/javdekar-mm.jpg" /></a> BJP spokesman and MP Prakash Javadekar. (PTI)
<p>Amid reports that talks between BJP and TDP in Andhra Pradesh failed to make a headway, BJP spokesman and MP Prakash Javadekar on Friday hoped that parties opposed to Congress would quickly clinch an electoral understanding.</p>
<p>In an apparent reference to the talks with TDP over seat-sharing in Andhra Pradesh, he said time is running out to seal the understanding that would facilitate a joint fight against Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;I welcome those who give suggestions, those who give the slogan &#8216;Congress hatao Desh bachao&#8217;. But, there must be a joint effort to do that. It cannot be an isolated, different effort. And to that end, yes, we are in dialogue with some of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, let me also remind that there is little time left. It cannot be an endless debate, endless talks. No way. Therefore, I hope in the national interest, all the parties and other forces, those who want &#8216;Congress hatao Desh bachao&#8217; will also realise the importance of time and clinching the issues so that we can jointly fight,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Javadekar was speaking at a meeting of the office bearers of the newly-formed Andhra Pradesh unit of BJP, headed by former MLA K Haribabu.</p>
<p>Former Union Minister D Purandeswari, whose name is doing the rounds as the party&#8217;s candidate for Vijayawada Lok Sabha seat, also attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Recalling the BJP&#8217;s efforts in getting special status for Seemandhra in the division of AP, Javadekar said the region should elect BJP candidates in the interest of development.</p>
<p>According to TDP sources, talks between the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the BJP over a poll alliance to the Lok Sabha and the Andhra Pradesh assembly, have failed to make any headway so far, after the latter insisted on at least 50 per cent seats in the Telangana region.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015384&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rallym.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015380" alt="EC said all returning officers should set up a 'single window permission cell' to provide permission to parties and candidates for holding rallies. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rallym.jpg" /></a> EC said all returning officers should set up a &#8216;single window permission cell&#8217; to provide permission to parties and candidates for holding rallies. (PTI)
<p>Seeking to cut bureaucratic red tape, the Election Commission on Friday issued orders for setting up a &#8216;single window system&#8217; in all parliamentary seats to provide clearance to candidates and political parties to hold rallies and public meetings during the Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>In a directive issued to all Chief Electoral Officers, the poll body said all returning officers should set up a &#8216;single window permission cell&#8217; to provide permission to parties and candidates for holding rallies, public meetings, using vehicles for campaigning and using non-commercial airports and helipads for their high-flying campaigners.</p>
<p>The returning officers will have to deploy a dedicated staff to handle the requests and forward the same to nodal officers of other departments for &#8220;prompt action&#8221;.</p>
<p>A DSP-level officer will have to camp at the permission cell to issue permissions or provide decisions after obtaining approval from competent authority of state police and land- owning agencies concerned.</p>
<p>Under the new system, the candidate or party will not have to seek separate permission from traffic police for election events.</p>
<p>An officer of the transport department will also be attached to the permission cell to decide on the use of &#8220;modified vehicles&#8221; like chariots for campaigning.</p>

<p>The communal violence of last year was an unfortunate episode but no political party should use it to derive electoral gains, Rashtriya Lok Dal leader and actress Jaya Prada has said.</p>
<p>Named as the RLD candidate for the Bijnore Lok Sabha seat after she recently joined the Ajit Singh-led party, Jaya Prada appealed to political parties against making the riots an issue while seeking votes.</p>
<p>Talking to reporters here last evening, she said that  political parties should instead focus on questions of farmers&#8217; welfare and development.</p>
<p>&#8220;The riots were unfortunate, but some political parties want to gain political mileage by exploiting the issue,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is learnt that the Purkazi Assembly segment in Muzaffarnagar would be included as part of the Bijnore Lok Sabha constituency.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015352&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI File Photo)
<p>Making his electoral debut from Patna Sahib constituency against BJP heavyweight Shatrughan Sinha, Congress candidate and Bhojpuri actor Kunal Singh has refused to call the poll battle a clash of stars and said it would be more of a contest between a prince and a pauper.</p>
<p>Earlier, Raj Kumar Rajan was to have contested from the prestigious seat, but Congress finally decided to field the Bhojpuri superstar against Sinha.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shatruji is like my elder brother, but I don&#8217;t believe it will be a clash of stars. I am not a star, rather I am a son of Bihar&#8217;s soil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was born and brought up here and am well aware of the local issues. It will be a fight between a &#8216;Raja&#8217; (prince) and a &#8216;Rank&#8217; (pauper) as that is the condition of Bhojpuri artistes as compared to Bollywood actors,&#8221; Kunal told PTI over the phone.</p>
<p>Kunal comes from a political background with his father, the late Budhadev Singh, having been an MLA from Bakhtiarpur and Danapur. The two Assembly segments fall under the Patna Sahib and Patliputra Lok Sabha constituencies, respectively.</p>
<p>Asked how he was going to counter his opponent&#8217;s mass appeal and star power, Kunal said he need not do that as the people considered him to be one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Voters are wiser now and they will elect the candidate who is with them and understands their concerns. I have a home in Patna and stay there for at least one week in a month. I meet them and try to be their voice. I have been doing my bit for them, although this will be my electoral debut. I don&#8217;t make sky-high promises, but I will try to solve their regular problems,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said that the upcoming polls would be a contest between communal and secular forces in which the people were not going to be misled by false propaganda.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 2014 Lok Sabha elections is going to be fought under different circumstances. It is a fight between communal and secular forces. They cannot trap the people through false propaganda and marketing strategies,&#8221; said the veteran actor who has received an award from President Pranab Mukherjee in 2012 for promoting the Bhojpuri language through cinema.</p>
<p>&#8220;Voters don&#8217;t believe in the so-called Narendra Modi wave as they are well aware that nobody has a magic wand which would solve problems overnight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rahul (Gandhi) is young and has the dynamism to bring change in the coming years by setting realistic goals,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015325&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maha-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015362" alt="Maharaj attacked the Uttarakhand government, accusing it of doing nothing for the victims of floods and said people were leaving the hills for the plains in search of livlihood." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maha-med.jpg" /></a> Maharaj attacked the Uttarakhand government, accusing it of doing nothing for the victims of floods and said people were leaving the hills for the plains in search of livlihood.
<p>Senior Uttarakhand Congress leader and Pauri MP Satpal Maharaj crossed over to the BJP on Friday, pushing the state government of Chief Minister Harish Rawat towards instability.</p>
<p>At least three of the Congress’s 33 MLAs in the 70-member house are Satpal loyalists, including his wife Amrita Rawat, who is a minister in the state government. One independent MLA supporting the government is also in the Satpal camp.</p>
<p>The MP has been bitterly critical of Chief Minister Harish Rawat. He has reportedly been the most annoyed by the chief minister’s refusal to give the horticulture portfolio to his wife. Amrita Rawat had horticulture in the government of Vijay Bahuguna, who was chief minister before Rawat took over last month.</p>
<p>The Uttarakhand BJP is happy to have Satpal Maharaj as a significant Thakur leader which it has been missing, especially in the Garhwal region.</p>
<p>“The BJP lacked a prominent Thakur face in Garhwal to counter CM Rawat’s influence among Thakur voters who have considerable presence across the state. Although Rawat is from Kumaon, he is in a position to strengthen his grip over Thakur votes in Garhwal following his elevation as CM,” a BJP leader said.</p>
<p>Pauri, which Satpal represents, faced the brunt of last summer’s natural disaster, and the Congress is believed to be facing major anti-incumbency at the seat. Satpal had announced he would not contest the Lok Sabha election before he joined the BJP. The BJP has already decided to field former chief minister B C Khanduri at the seat.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015351&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Archive) " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sandeepdikshitm.jpg" /></a> Sandeep Dikshit said that there is no such thing called &#8216;Modi wave&#8217;. (Express Archive)
<p>Congress candidate and sitting MP Sandeep Dikshit on Friday filed his nomination papers from East Delhi Lok Sabha constituency.</p>
<p>Flanked by hundreds of Congress workers and amid slogan shouting, Dikshit, 49, submitted his nomination papers before the Returning officer at Deputy Commissioner&#8217;s office in East Delhi.</p>
<p>Exuding confidence of retaining his seat, Dikshit said, &#8220;Though we lost the Delhi assembly elections, there is no loss of enthusiasm among party workers. We are confident of winning this time around as the so-called wave is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an apparent attack on AAP-led Delhi government, Dikshit said, &#8220;An illusion was created by making attractive promises and people thought to give other parties a chance thinking their lives would be better. They were attracted towards those promises of other parties. This happens sometimes, but now that so-called wave is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>On a question on BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi&#8217;s &#8220;wave&#8221; in the country, Dikshit said there was no such thing on ground and it was just a &#8220;creation&#8221; of media.</p>
<p>&#8220;As far as Modi&#8217;s wave is concerned, there is a lot of confusion and resentment in the party. One candidate is angry about not getting Lok Sabha ticket, while another is not ready to contest from the given seat. What kind of wave is that?&#8221; Dikshit said, adding that Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi has given a strong leadership to the party.</p>
<p>Dikshit faces a three-cornered contest in the constituency as BJP has fielded Maheish Girri while AAP&#8217;s Rajmohan Gandhi is the other main contender.</p>
<p>On his way out of the DC&#8217;s office after filing nomination papers, Dikshit was hoisted on shoulders by party workers, who jostled to meet and shake hands with their leader.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015318&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>BJP&#8217;s Delhi unit president Harsh Vardhan on Friday filed his nomination papers from Chandni Chowk parliamentary constituency, and will take on Union Minister and Congress leader Kapil Sibal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very happy to contest elections from the locality where I have done my pre-medical schooling. My childhood friends and relatives also reside here. I&#8217;m confident of winning from Chandni Chowk,&#8221; Vardhan said after filing his papers.</p>
<p>The Delhi BJP chief said if elected he would develop the area which is a &#8220;holy place&#8221; as Delhi Assembly, historical Red Fort, Jama Masjid are located here, ensuring that he would treat all the problems plaguing the people of Chandni Chowk &#8220;like a doctor&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;BJP is going to win all seven seats of Lok Sabha in the capital. The people of this country will definitely make Narendra Modi the prime minister,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Before his nomination, Harsh Vardhan along with his supporters visited different areas in Chandni Chowk.</p>
<p>Vardhan, 59, had entered the political fray in 1993 when he successfully contested the Delhi Assembly polls from Krishna Nagar constituency in East Delhi in 1993. He went on to retain the seat in the 1998, 2003 and 2008 Assembly elections. He was also the BJP&#8217;s chief ministerial candidate for 2013 Assembly elections.</p>
<p>Fondly called &#8220;Doctor Saab&#8221; by supporters and opponents alike, Vardhan is known for his efforts in eradicating polio in Delhi when he was the Health Minister.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015304&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kirrongul-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015266" alt="Gul Kirron" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kirrongul-480.jpg" /></a> After wishing each other luck in elections, the ladies have been taking digs at each other on Twitter.
<p>BJP candidate Kirron Kher and Gul Panag from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday  filed their nominations for the Chandigarh Lok Sabha seat.</p>
<p>Kirron filed her papers with the returning officer here followed by Gul Panag, an election office spokesman said. Kirron was accompanied by her actor husband Anupam Kher, local BJP President Sanjay Tandon two times ex-MP Satya Pal Jain.</p>
<p>Putting up a brave face despite meeting initial resistance from certain sections of the local BJP against her candidature, Kirron said that there were no differences within the party.</p>
<p>Asked about ex-MP Harmohan Dhawan, who was a front runner for the saffron party ticket, she said &#8220;I am confident that Dhawan will canvass for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeking to downplay the disaccord within Chandigarh BJP over Kirron&#8217;s candidature, her husband Anupam Kher said differences do surface in a family as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Differences do occur among members of a family as well but these get resolved,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He exuded confidence that the entire Chandigarh BJP leadership will support Kirron and &#8220;fall in line&#8221; reposing faith in her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dhawan, who was conspicuous by his absence during Kirron&#8217;s nomination, continued to keep his cards close to his chest and maintained that he will take any decision after having feedback from his supporters here.</p>
<p>As Kirron left the venue, AAP&#8217;s candidate Gul Panag filed her nomination with the returning officer.</p>
<p>She was accompanied by her father H S Panag and other supporters.</p>
<p>Earlier incumbent MP Pawan Kumar Bansal of Congress, who has represented Chandigarh four times in the Lok Sabha, and<br />
Jannat Jahan of BSP had filed their nominations on last Tuesday.<br />
Chandigarh is going to polls on April 10.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015272&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Archive)
<p>In a riposte to former BJP chief Nitin Gadkari&#8217;s recent overtures to MNS chief Raj Thackeray, the Shiv Sena on Friday decided to field its candidates in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Delhi for the Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have our alliance with BJP in Maharashtra, not in UP. We will strive to expand our party in other parts of the country. Shiv Sena will field 20 candidates in Uttar Pradesh,&#8221; Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut told reporters.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party will also contest the Lok Sabha elections in Bihar (on 5 seats) and Delhi (7 seats), said Raut.</p>
<p>Shiv Sena is said to be miffed due to the recent strain developed in the relations between Uddhav and Gadkari over the latter&#8217;s luncheon meeting with the MNS chief in Mumbai on March 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uddhav&#8217;s son and Yuva Sena president Aaditya Thackeray in a tweet said that Sena would not field candidates against BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial nominee Modi (who will contest LS election from Varanasi in UP) and saffron party chief Rajnath Singh (contesting from Lucknow).</p>
<p>&#8220;Those who even believe such funny rumours, well, I feel sorry for them. Therefore, obv not contesting in Varanasi and Lucknow,&#8221; Aaditya tweeted.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015207&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shaktimillsm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002755" alt="The verdict comes nearly eight months after two young women were gangraped inside the Shakti Mills." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shaktimillsm1.jpg" /></a> The verdict comes nearly eight months after two young women were gangraped inside the Shakti Mills.
<p>A sessions court on Friday sentenced four convicts in the gangrape of a 19-year-old telephone operator inside Shakti mills compound on July 31, 2013, to life imprisonment. As per the new Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013, the life sentence will continue up to the convict&#8217;s natural life.</p>
<p>The victim, a 19-year-old telephone operator along with her then boyfriend had taken a shortcut through Shakti Mills to go to Siddhivinayak Temple on July 31, 2013, when they were dragged into the compound and the woman was sexually assaulted. She reported the case only a month later after another woman &#8211; a 22-year-old photojournalist was gangraped in the same premises.</p>
<p>The four accused &#8211; Vijay Jadhav (18), Mohammed Qasim alias Bangali (20), Salim Ansari (27) and Ashfaque Shaikh &#8211; were awarded life sentence.</p>
<p>While special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam sought maximum punishment looking at the henious nature of the crime, the defence invoked reformatory approach to be applied in this case pointing out at the accused young age. They argued that the convicts came from the lower strata of th society and have faced severe drug abuse and are uneducated. Nikam argued, &#8220;The accused treated women as their property to be looted. They showed no mercy towards them. They brutally attacked the women and took turns in indulging in both natural and unnatural sexual acts.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015230&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Legendary Indian writer Khushwant Singh passed away yesterday at the ripe old age of 99. Even in death, he wanted to make people laugh, as is proven in his self-written epitaph where he says, “Here lies one who spared neither man nor God; Waste not your tears on him, he was a sod.&#8221;</p>
<p>Khushwant Singh was, for many of us, our first introduction to the world of humour; he showed us the best jokes and one-liners from around the world, in his multiple joke books and columns. Here the best jokes that this master creator and aggregator of humour showed us over the years.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitabhbachchan2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005809" alt="Amitabh Bachchan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitabhbachchan2.jpg" /></a> Congress had alleged that Gujarat government was trying to take advantage of Big B&#8217;s status to influence the voters.
<p>The Election Commission of India has ordered to defer the shoot of the Gujarat tourism ad film by megastar Amitabh Bachchan until the poll-process is over in the state.</p>
<p>K Ajay Kumar, Principal Secretary to the Commission in a letter to Anita Karwal, the Chief Electoral Officer of Gujarat, informed that the ECI has directed that the proposed shooting of the film &#8216;Khushboo Gujarat Ki&#8217; for two days on March 11 and 12 be deferred in the entire state until the completion of the election process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please inform all concerned,&#8221; the letter said.</p>
<p>The communication was in response to a letter by Karwal in reference to the matter after Narendra Ravat, president of the city unit of the Congress and now party candidate against Narendra Modi nominee from Vadodara parliamentary seat, raised strong objections over shooting of this ad film.</p>
<p>He alleged that it was violation of Model Code of Conduct in force.</p>
<p>Ravat had written to both to Karwal and the Chief Election Commissioner V S Sampath in this regard.</p>
<p>However, Bachchan had already conveyed a message on morning of the March 11 informing his inability to come for the shoot at Champaner-Pavagadh.</p>
<p>Bachchan was to fly to Vadodara on morning of March 11 and reach Pavagadh for the two-day shoot but cancelled his programme on health grounds.</p>
<p>Following the orders, all arrangements made at the Champaner-Pavagadh site had to be wound up.</p>
<p>Former Union Minister of State for Railway and Congress party nominee from Chhota Udepur LS constituency, Naran Rathwa had also took objection to the ad shoot as the site is part of the reserved seat.</p>
<p>Both Ravat and Rathwa had alleged that Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government was trying to take advantage of the Bollywood actor&#8217;s celebrity status to influence voters in their areas.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015129&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Infighting and protests have broken out within the opposition Congress in Chhattisgarh over the distribution of tickets for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. </p>
<p>While supporters of former Union Minister, the late Vidyacharan Shukla are enraged over the denial of ticket to his daughter Pratibha Pandey, some senior leaders have parted ways with the party following the declaration of candidates. </p>
<p>Although nobody wants to speak about it openly, some partymen feel that the rift within Congress over the issue of ticket distribution may add to its woes, especially after its losses in three consecutive state Assembly elections. </p>
<p>Congress has declared nominees for all 11 parliamentary constituencies in the state, but speculation is now rife about a possible change of candidates for some of the seats. </p>
<p>After the deadly Jiram valley Naxal attack of May 25 last year, the party had given priority to the kin of the victims in the allotment of tickets for the recent Assembly elections. </p>
<p>Given the above position, the supporters of Shukla were confident that his daughter Pratibha would be handed a ticket for the upcoming polls. And, their hopes rose when Deepak Karma, the son of the late Mahendra Karma, who was also slain in the Naxal attack, was declared as the candidate for the Bastar Lok Sabha seat. </p>
<p>All eyes were on the Mahasamund seat for Pratibha as her father had represented the constituency for several years. </p>
<p>But the expectations faded when former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi was made the party&#8217;s nominee for the seat. Now, a section of Congress workers are opposed to his candidature. </p>
<p>Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee (CPCC) general secretary and former minister Vidhan Mishra claimed that the sacrifice made by VC Shukla &#8220;had gone in vain&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8220;The martyrdom of the victims of the Jiram valley attack was honoured by giving election tickets to their relatives, then why was Pratibhaji was ignored?&#8221; said Mishra. </p>
<p>Mishra, who was a close aide of Shukla&#8217;s, had earlier written to the party high command pressing Pratibha&#8217;s candidature. Kin of Shukla and former minister Amitesh Shukla, too, said that, &#8220;Pratibha should have been given the ticket&#8221;. </p>
<p>However, he added that, &#8220;If the party high command has decided to go with Jogi then all party workers will together fight to make him victorious.&#8221; </p>
<p>The state leadership, however, claims they had recommended Pratibha&#8217;s name in the proposed list of candidates. The party high command had taken the final call on the choice of candidates, the state Congress leadership said. </p>
<p>&#8220;We had recommended Pratibha&#8217;s name&#8230; (But) the final decision in this connection was taken by the central election committee,&#8221; PCC chief Bhupesh Baghel said. </p>
<p>Motilal Sahu, who was injured in the Jiram valley Naxal attack, was also seeking a ticket from the Mahasamund seat. </p>
<p>But, after the announcement of Jogi&#8217;s candidature, he resigned from the party along with hundreds of his supporters. </p>
<p>Prior to that, Sahu had also staged a protest at the Congress headquarters here opposing Jogi&#8217;s selection. </p>
<p>In a similar move, the supporters of veteran party leader and MLA Satyanarayan Sharma ransacked the party headquarters after he was replaced as the candidate for the Raipur Lok Sabha seat. </p>
<p>Before that Chhaya Verma, who had been initially nominated as the Congress candidate for Raipur, was replaced by Sharma. </p>
<p>However, Verma, who belongs to the Kurmi community, was later reinstated as the nominee for the seat. </p>
<p>When asked to comment on the rift within the party over the list of candidates, leader of Opposition in the state Assembly, TS Singhdeo, said that all party workers and leaders should show unitedly contest the polls and leave behind all issues. </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not possible to make all the ticket aspirants in the party happy. This is the time to show sportsman spirit and together contest the elections,&#8221; Singhdeo said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015121&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A case of violation of the election Model Code of Conduct has been registered against the Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate for Kairana constituency, Kartar Singh Bhadana, and two others, police said.</p>
<p>Also, district authorities said that Rs 1.23 crore in cash was seized from a car in the area on Thursday with the money suspected to be meant for use in the elections.</p>
<p>Bhadana was on Thursday booked over allegations involving the holding of a dance by him at Jamalpur village during election campaigning.</p>
<p>Cases of Model Code violation were also registeted against BSP candidate Kawar Hasan and SP contestant Nahid Hasan on Thursday in Shamli district, police added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, city magistrate VS Rai told reporters today that Rs 1.23 crore in cash was recovered from a car on Jansath Roard on Thursday.</p>
<p>Police are questioning the accountant of one Luxmi Trading firm in connection with the seizure. It is being suspected that the cash was to be used in the election campain. District authorities said they have informed Income Tax officials about the matter.</p>
<p>Election Commission has set a ceiling of Rs 50 lakh as the maximum sum of money which can be carried in cash ahead of the polls.<br />
Ferrying of any sum more than that in cash needs prior authorisation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015073&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rahul-kejriwal-modi-spoof.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015044" alt="Here's a compilation of some election spoof videos, mocking Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rahul-kejriwal-modi-spoof.jpg" /></a> Here&#8217;s a compilation of some election spoof videos, mocking Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal.
<p>As the race for the Lok Sabha gets heated, politicians and parties have been busy addressing rallies and selecting candidates. No stone is being left unturned in efforts to reach out to the voters, and social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter have turned out to be a very effective tool in this regard &#8211; with parties sharing campaign videos, emailers etc. However, what have been the highlights this season are the spoof videos on politicians across party lines. Rahul Gandhi, Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal &#8211; these leaders, in their various avatars, have clearly been the stars of these videos. While a video shows Kejriwal as &#8216;Nayak 2&#8242; and another depicts Modi as superhero &#8216;Krrish&#8217;, there&#8217;s a &#8216;Sholay&#8217; spoof video showing Amitabh Bachchan &#8216;convincing the popular &#8216;Mausiji&#8217; to vote for oldest political party.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a compilation of some such videos which, if not encourage you enough to go out and vote, certainly ensure good humour:</p>
<p><strong>Narendra Modi:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Modi&#8217;s &#8216;Krrish&#8217; spoof</strong>: This video shows BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi as superhero Krrish, who is out to protect the people of this country from all the evils. Not only does he don an overcoat like Krrish, he even jumps over buildings and flies like the superhero.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/rDYkfiZqh2U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>The Great Dictator-Modi spoof</strong>: In this video, Modi&#8217;s face has been superimposed on that of Charlie Chaplin, who had played Adolf Hitler in the 1940 American comedy &#8216;The Great Dictator&#8217;. This is a parody of the globe scene in the movie.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/ChuLUw9c6Z8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Congress/Rahul Gandhi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sholay-Congress spoof</strong>: Remember the popular Sholay scene where Amitabh Bachchan goes to Mausiji with a marriage offer on behalf of Dharmendra for Hema Malini, and ends up saying all negative things about his friend &#8216;Veeru&#8217;? This is a spoof video of the same scene wherein Amitabh is asking Mausiji to vote for &#8220;the oldest political party&#8221;, without naming Congress.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/UmsaVOj0hIQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Dhongress &#8211; Hasiba Ameen</strong>: This video has already gone viral across social media. It mocks the Congress campaign video where a youth party worker Hasiba Ameen talk about how only a young leader like Rahul Gandhi can understand the plights of a young India. A young girl has acted in this video and &#8216;Rahul Baba&#8217; is shown with a lollypop in his hand at the end of it.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/vttpHmKpvAA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Rahul&#8217;s youth campaign spoof:</strong> This video features a young boy as another youth brigade worker of &#8216;Dhongress&#8217;. This video and the Hasiba Ameen videos are part of the same series.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/PIs0EDNH2d8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Arvind Kejriwal</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nayak-2 featuring Alok Nath:</strong> This video shows the rising of a man who vows to eradicate corruption with the blessings of &#8216;Sanskari&#8217; Alok Nath. The actor is shown donning the popular &#8216;muffler&#8217; and Nehru cap, and fighting corruption with the help of a broom.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/_RENcw7a140?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Arnab Goswami-Kejriwal spoof:</strong> This video is of a YouTube fest wherein Arnab Goswami is interviewing Arvind Kejriwal, who is in his trademark muffler and nehru cap, coughing in response to questions.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/laXS-ySZvcA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Tragediwal on Dukhdarshan:</strong> The video features the same group of youngsters who have acted in the &#8216;Dhongress&#8217; video. This video mocks Kejriwal and his 48-day stint as the Chief Minister of Delhi.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/uCXuh-fnKuw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015024&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Archive)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kartichidambaram.jpg" /></a> Karti will replace his father P Chidambaram in the Sivaganga seat. (Express Archive)
<p>Ending the suspense over <a href="http://indianexpress.com/elections/profile/politician/palaniappan-chidambaram/" target="_blank">P Chidambaram’</a>s Sivaganga seat, the Congress Thursday nominated his son Karti. The finance minister, said to have been eager to pass on the baton, is likely to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha later.</p>
<p>The Congress fielded veterans Ghulam Nabi Azad and Mani Shankar Aiyar respectively from Udhampur and Mayiladuthurai. Aiyar has three years left in the Rajya Sabha, and the party might not regain this seat in a bypoll, but the absence of an alternative forced the decision.</p>
<p>Controversial guru Acharya Pramod Krishnan who has lodged an FIR against RSS leaders, was given the ticket to Sambhal. Purnmasi Ram, inducted Wednesday from the JD(U), will defend his Gopalganj seat. The Congress retained sitting MPs Mahabal Mishra and Ramesh Kumar in West and South Delhi, completing the renomination of all seven MPs in Delhi.</p>
<p>Against Sushma Swaraj in Vidisha is Laxman Singh, brother of Digvijaya Singh. Laxman was with the BJP in 2009 when he lost from Rajgarh. He was expelled in 2010 for slamming Nitin Gadkari who had called Digvijay Singh “Aurangzeb ki aulad”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014883&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>AFTER MANDAL AND RAJIV</strong></p>
<p>THIS ELECTION was determined by the stability slogan. And so much was also happening economically and socially that it was hard to assess its impact. The Mandal Commission report set in motion new political processes in north, splitting parties and dislodging  the Congress from UP and Bihar, setting a trend that is yet to be reversed. The socialist stream split and the Samajwadi Janata Party ;ed by Chandrasekhar in opposition to V.P Singh was formed, while Mulayam Singh Yadav emerged as the new leader of the socialist in UP. The assiasination of Rajiv Gandhi in Tamil Nadu happened during the course of campaigning and cast a long shadow not just on ties with Sri Lanka but also in terms of the shape of the polls and of the Congress.</p>

<p>The Congress formed a minority government. Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv’s wife, refused to ‘take over’ and former Andhra Pradesh chief minister P V Narasimha Rao was picked as India’s first PM from south India. He had decided not to contest this election because of ill-health. Later, he won a byelection from Nandyal in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p><strong>STANDOUT FEATURES:</strong> This government was India’s first and only (so far) single-party minority government to last its full term. It was the first time in electoral history that the size of the electorate fell. Rationalisation of electoral rolls may have been the reason.</p>

<p>The political career of India’s current PM of 10 years, Manmohan Singh, was launched at this time, as Rao decided to pick a “specialist” economist. I G Patel too was considered but he refused.</p>
<p><strong>TN SESHAN</strong> was the election commissioner and this was when the EC moved from a backroom role to loudly proclaiming its autonomy. Because of his hyperactivity in an increasingly multi-party scenario, the Lok Sabha in 1993 brought in a constitutional amendment to make the EC a multi-member commission instead of a single-member one, and it has remained so.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014142&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The battlelines are drawn in Haryana, with candidates decided, and the contest is unpredictable with four major players in the fray.</span></p>
<p>With the Congress battling 10 years of anti-incumbency, the BJP forming an uneasy alliance with the Haryana Janhit Congress, main opposition the Indian National Lok Dal in disarray with its two top leaders behind bars, and the Aam Aadmi Party looking to carry on from its Delhi performance, political equations in the state are constantly changing.</p>
<p>The BSP, Trinamool Congress and a few independents could also play significant roles in the elections.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda finds himself in an difficult position with party stalwarts being reluctant to enter the poll fray and a few key leaders joining the BJP. Young Dalit leader Kumari Selja, the sitting Lok Sabha MP from Ambala preferred the easy way by managing a Rajya Sabha seat, while Rao Inderjit Singh and chief parliamentary secretary Dharambir have left the Congress to contest on BJP tickets from Gurgaon and Bhiwani-Mahendergarh respectively.</p>
<p>State Congress chief Ashok Tanwar was reluctant to contest from Sirsa and senior minister Capt Ajay Singh Yadav declined his Lok Sabha ticket in favour of his son from Gurgaon, but the party instead decided to field a sitting MLA.</p>
<p>The party suffered another setback when a close confidant of Hooda, MLA Venod Sharma, quit the party hoping to contest the elections for the HJC. The BJP, however, prevailed on its alliance partner to deny him the ticket and he may contest as an independent.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Congerss has fielded six sitting MPs and three sitting MLAs and a former MLA from the 10 seats in the state despite anti-incumbency.</p>
<p>The main opposition in the state is struggling with its own problems. INLD patriarch and former chief minister Om Parkash Chautala and his son Ajay Chautala are in jail and debarred from contesting elections. Om Parkash Chautala’s younger son Abhay and grandson Dushyant have taken over the reins of the party and are hoping for “sympathy” votes.</p>
<p>The INLD, which had been contesting past elections in alliance with the BJP, has already declared that it will back Narendra Modi in Prime Ministerial race.</p>
<p>But INLD was not spoilt for choice either. Barring first-timer Dushyant, all its candidates are veteran MPs or MLAs.</p>
<p>Though the BJP and the HJC have cobbled up an alliance agreeing to contest eight and two seats respectively, it remains an uneasy alliance. While HJC chief Kuldeep Bishnoi was the obvious choice from Hisar, it was the other constituency (Karnal) that has been the subject of disagreement. Bishnoi offered it to Venod Sharma, but then BJP leader Sushma Swaraj opposed it.</p>
<p>The seat was then offered to Bishnoi’s elder brother Chander Mohan, former deputy chief minister of Haryana, who was in controversy over his relationship with Fiza. This move too backfired with opposition from party workers.</p>
<p>The BJP too faced problems in finding candidates and five of its eight candidates have their roots in Congress.</p>
<p>The AAP, which thinks its best bet is in Haryana, could find it difficult to repeat its Delhi performance. It may pose a challenge in NCR, particularly in Gurgaon from where party stalwart Yogendra Yadav is contesting, but given the caste and other factors, the party is up for a tough time.</p>
<p>The BSP, which is contesting all 10 seats, and a number of independents shall bring up the rear, but the Lok Sabha results would be most keenly watched by Hooda who is to face assembly elections in October this year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014879&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rajnathvaikovijaykantm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014972" alt="BJP president Rajnath Singh, DMDK President Vijayakanth and MDMK chief Vaiko at a meeting to make formal announcement on seat sharing for Lok Sabha polls, in Chennai.

(PTI)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">After manoeuvring through the congested Tamil Nadu political space for months, the BJP finally managed to stitch together a meaningful alliance to take on the two Dravidian majors. It is a coalition of contradictions, one with the potential to either upset the giants or unravel, depending on the ground-level coordination between the partners.</span></p>
<p>“This alliance will create new political history not just in Tamil Nadu, but nationally. We will all work together to form the next government at the Centre headed by Narendra Modi,” BJP president Rajnath Singh said in Chennai Thursday after concluding alliance discussions with five parties — DMDK, PMK, MDMK, KMDK and IJK.</p>
<p>As expected, the principal opposition party, DMDK, led by Vijayakant, managed to corner the highest number of seats, 14 of the state’s 39, while the PMK and the BJP got eight each. There were seven for the MDMK and one each for the KMDK and the IJK.</p>
<p>The BJP was initially eyeing a partnership with AIADMK, owing to the rapport between their leaders, especially between Modi and J Jayalalithaa. However, Jaya eventually sought to maximise her gains by going it alone rather than limit herself to a secondary role so early. That was when the BJP explored other alliances.</p>
<p>The first round of efforts were taken by political activist Tamilaruvi Manian, who held several rounds of informal talks with the regional parties other than the AIADMK and the DMK, culminating in the alliance today. It was he who received the highest applause from cadres of all the alliance partners when Rajnath formally announced the launch of an NDA in Tamil Nadu Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, despite having a strong reason to look for an alternative to the two Dravidian majors, efforts at bringing them all together on a single platform were drudging forward at the best of times, often beset with reversals, setbacks and roadblocks.</p>
<p>The main issue among the smaller parties was the common votebank for which they have been fighting against one another in the past.</p>
<p>The most serious among these was the competing interests of the DMDK and the PMK, two parties that have been at war since the formation of the former in 2005. Based on vote shares over the last few elections, political observers note that the DMDK has been a potential threat to the PMK by weaning away the intermediary caste votes, including from the Vanniyar community that is the fountainhead of the PMK. This is something that had become almost irreconcilable for the latter, especially its founder-leader, Dr S Ramadoss.</p>
<p>Though Ramadoss eventually agreed to the idea of exploring an alliance that would include the DMDK, apparently owing to the pressure brought upon him by members of his family — most notably his son and former union minister Anbumani Ramadoss — his displeasure was evident from his absence at the formal announcement today. After rounds and rounds of discussions that went on in Chennai and Delhi, the BJP leadership was finally able to convince Anbumani and his party about the need to compromise on some of the constituencies if the alliance was to make any mark in the upcoming elections.</p>
<p>On their own, these parties have a limited ability to challenge the electoral hegemony of the two Dravidian outfits. But like compounding interest, the coming together of these players could offer a stiff challenge to the established parties — and perhaps even win a few constituencies.</p>
<p>For instance, a back-of-the-envelope calculation on the combined vote-share of the parties in 2009 shows that the front can claim over a lakh votes in at least 26 of the 39 constituencies in Tamil Nadu. These include seats in north Tamil Nadu such as Dharmapuri, Sriperumbudur, and Kancheepuram, where the PMK and the DMDK are strong; Coimbatore, Namakkal, Erode and Tirupur in the west where the BJP and the KDMK are relatively strong; and southern constituencies like Virudhunagar, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari where Vaiko’s MDMK can play a crucial role.</p>
<p>As significant as it was for the BJP to stitch together a right partnership to face the poll, the splintering of main coalitions will be an equally important factor that would determine the fortunes of the coalition in Tamil Nadu.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014737&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lkadvanim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014964" alt="Advani issued a statement announcing his intention to stick to Gandhinagar. (Express Archive)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lkadvanim.jpg" /></a> Advani issued a statement announcing his intention to stick to Gandhinagar. (Express Archive)
<p>With the RSS once again stepping in to broker peace, veteran BJP leader L K Advani Thursday agreed to go along with the decision of the party and contest the Lok Sabha polls from Gandhinagar, a day after he precipitated a new crisis in the party by indicating that he wanted to move to<a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/advani-thanks-bhopal-party-asks-what-for/" target="_blank"> Bhopal.</a></p>
<p>Advani’s climbdown came after BJP chief Rajnath Singh announced that it was up to the former deputy prime minister to choose between Gandhinagar and Bhopal &#8211; seen as being part of a script written by the RSS.</p>
<p>“Today, Shri Rajnath Singh informed me that the Madhya Pradesh unit of the BJP has also suggested my name for contesting the Bhopal parliamentary seat. He has further informed me that after consulting all colleagues in the parliamentary board and the central election committee of the party, it has been agreed that the choice between the two parliamentary seats should be left to me,” Advani said in a statement.</p>
<p>“I have decided to contest the 2014 general elections from Gandhinagar itself,” he added.</p>
<p>The peace formula, sources said, was scripted after the party’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi met RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and former BJP chief Nitin Gadkari met RSS leader Suresh Soni Wednesday night.</p>
<p>While Bhagwat left for Nagpur Thursday morning, his deputy, Bhaiyyaji Joshi, remained in the capital to oversee the resolution of the latest crisis in the BJP.</p>
<p>According to the plan, Modi called on Advani and “emphasised that the people of Gujarat are keen that Advani represent Gandhinagar Lok Sabha once again”.</p>
<p>Leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley, also met Advani to pacify him and appealed to him to contest from Gandhinagar. Sushma Swaraj, who had met Advani Wednesday, also called on the party veteran, as also former party president Venkaiah Naidu.</p>
<p>Modi, Jaitley and Naidu, all of who did not meet Advani Wednesday, visited him Thursday according to the RSS plan to provide an honourable exit to the elder statesman, it is learnt.</p>
<p>Based on the feedback of these leaders, Rajnath Singh spoke to Advani over phone and assured him that he would make a public statement that Advani would be allowed to choose his seat, with the tacit understanding that Advani will pick Gandhinagar.</p>
<p>“I have consulted the members of the parliamentary board and the central election committee of the party on this issue telephonically since most of the members are traveling in various parts of the country. It is the unanimous view of the party that the choice of where to contest from should be left to Shri Advaniji himself,” Singh said in a statement. “The party will respect the opinion of Shri Advaniji with regard to his choice of constituency for contesting the election.”</p>
<p>With Rajnath providing an exit route, Advani issued a statement announcing his intention to stick to Gandhinagar and thanking the party’s Madhya Pradesh unit for offering him the Bhopal seat.</p>
<p>While the truce bore the stamp of RSS approval, the ideological parent of the BJP did not take credit for it unlike in June when the RSS chief’s intervention was made public after Advani had resigned from all party positions protesting against Modi’s elevation as the party’s chief campaigner for the Lok Sabha polls.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014608&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jaswantm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014958" alt="Jaswant was elected to the Lok Sabha from Darjeeling in 2009.

<p><em></em>After L K Advani’s, a rebellion is brewing among BJP workers in Barmer, too. It is a seat that Advani loyalist Jaswant Singh wants to contest one last time but the recent induction of Col Sonaram, a former Congress legislator from the region, has posed a challenge to Jaswant’s prospects. Aides of Jaswant said he has made up his mind to contest from Barmer and is likely to file his nomination on March 24, be it on a BJP ticket or as an independent. Barmer is widely seen as a family seat with Jaswant’s son Manvendra Singh having contested it twice and winning it in 2004. The family’s village, Jasol, falls in the district. Since Col Sonaram joined, Vasundhara Raje has been lobbying for a ticket for the Jat leader on the argument that Barmer has a large Jat population. And Jaswant is said to have taken offence at this last-minute dithering. Party sources said Raje wants to keep Jaswant out of the state anticipating yet another power centre if he goes on to win and hold an important portfolio. If she is made to relent, she is likely to try accommodating Sonaram in Pali, again with a sizeable Jat population. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/l-k-advani-decides-to-contest-from-gandhinagar/" target="_blank"><strong>RSS gives Advani illusion of choice</strong></a> Party workers in Barmer have protested against Sonaram’s possible candidature, saying they had been working against him for six elections and could not possibly go out seeking votes for him. Some workers threatened to resign if Sonaram is given a ticket while others have questioned the point of feedback meetings where they had proposed Jaswant’s name. It was Advani’s rebellion that prevented the BJP election committee from denying a ticket to Jaswant Singh outright Wednesday. Rajasthan leaders’ eyes will be on the next CEC meeting, with Advani having climbed down Thursday. Jaswant was elected to the Lok Sabha from Darjeeling in 2009. He is no longer inclined to contest from there and the party has announced senior leader SS Ahluwalia as its candidate. The BJP announced 21 candidates for Rajasthan late Tuesday, holding back names for the Barmer, Pali, Ajmer and Dholpur-Karauli. The party is undecided whom to field in Ajmer, which is likely to see stiff competition from union minister and state Congress chief Sachin Pilot.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014873&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Archive)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mayawatim.jpg" /></a> Mayawati said that the Samajwadi Party has a tacit understanding with the BJP. (Express Archive)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">In a rare press conference, BSP chief Mayawati Thursday said the fact that Narendra Modi is contesting from Varanasi and Mulayam Singh Yadav from Azamgarh is an attempt by these parties to give a “communal” colour to the elections. She dismissed reports she is likely to contest from Lalganj in Azamgarh and that her close aide Satish Chandra Misra would challenge Modi in Varanasi. </span></p>
<p>Some of her statements and replies:</p>
<p><strong>On Modi and Mulayam:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“This (Modi contesting from Varanasi and Mulayam from Azamgarh) is a conspiracy so that elections can be given a Hindu-Muslim colour at the right time. I urge Hindus and Muslims not to let this work. I urge the chief election commissioner to keep a watch on activities of these two parties in Poorvanchal, otherwise the atmosphere of the whole country could get disturbed because of their tacit understanding. This election appears to be shifting from the issues of poverty, inflation, unemployment, terrorism and corruption to one between secular and communal forces. The BSP will use all its strength to stop the BJP and its communal allies from coming to power.</p>
<p><strong>On a post-poll alliance with BJP:</strong></p>
<p>No question of taking support from the BJP&#8230; We have formed government with them three times in UP. Our experience has not been good. In a situation where the BSP can form the government, we will accept support only from secular parties.</p>
<p><strong>Would that include SP?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>As far as the Samajwadi Party is concerned, we do not consider it a secular party. It has a tacit understanding with the BJP.</p>
<p><strong>On likely allies if the BSP holds the key to power: </strong></p>
<p>Let the results come. .. no question of any alliance with BJP.</p>
<p><strong>On talks with Mamata, Jayalalithaa</strong></p>
<p>Our party is fighting the elections alone. So, no question of talking to Mamata Banerjee or Jayalalithaa while the elections are on.</p>
<p><strong>PROMISES</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Mayawati said the BSP does not release a manifesto but issues an appeal. She released a 24-page booklet stressing various commitments:</p>
<p><strong>SC/STs and OBCs</strong></p>
<p>Efforts to introduce reservation for SC/STs and OBCs where it has not yet been, such as legislature and private sector; “additional” reservation for SC/STs who converted to Islam or Christianity “without disturbing the existing system”. If government bodies give works to private institutions on contract, reservation to SC/ST and OBCs should continue.</p>
<p><strong>Upper castes</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“A meaningful attempt will be made to remove poverty and unemployment by making available reservation to them.”</p>
<p><strong>Employment</strong></p>
<p>MGNREGS gives jobs 100 days a year; BSP promises 365 days a year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014745&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">L K Advani Thursday thanked the Madhya Pradesh BJP and members of the election committee for proposing his name for Bhopal. But party sources in Bhopal told The Indian Express there had been no such proposal.</span></p>
<p>The BJP veteran released a brief letter that said, “I am deeply touched by the gesture of my party colleagues.” A senior leader said the list sent by the state election committee to the central panel on March 12 did not recommend any name for Bhopal. “The seat was kept vacant as desired by the leadership,” he said, adding Advani’s name was not in circulation then.</p>
<p>BJP leader Narendra Tomar is on record as saying he was not aware about someone having recommended Advani’s name from the state. Sitting MP Kailash Joshi was the first person to “invite” Advani after announcing he was not interested in contesting any longer. When speculations began, party leaders in MP maintained they expected an outsider because the seat had been kept vacant at Delhi’s instance but not Advani.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, whose closeness to Advani is well known, has not uttered a word about the former deputy prime minister’s candidature from Bhopal since the controversy began.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014892&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the clarion call by Shia cleric Kalbe Jawwad to defeat the Congress and the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls, Narendra Modi is surprisingly garnering support from over 35,000-strong Shia community in Varanasi. The BJP also asked its minority cell to woo the Shia Muslims.</p>
<p>Varanasi has nearly three lakh Muslims, most of whom are weavers. Also, the Gujarat riots have taken a back seat with local issues gaining prominence. “There is no doubt that Shia Muslims in Varanasi are supporting Modi.</p>
<p>The support will come mainly from Dosipura, which is a Shia-dominated area,” Maulana Mohammad Aqeel, Imam-e-Juma Dara Nagar Masjid in Varanasi said. Dosipura has 15,000 to 20,000 Shias.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014886&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modisupportersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003086" alt="Many tickets have been given to leaders recently drafted from the Congress, usually with Modi’s blessings." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modisupportersm.jpg" /></a> Many tickets have been given to leaders recently drafted from the Congress, usually with Modi’s blessings.
<p>The BJP has declared 21 of 26 candidates and the five who remain to be announced are for seats where the BJP is either unsure of victory or has not found a candidate who appealed to Modi. Many tickets have been given to leaders recently drafted from the Congress, usually with Modi’s blessings, while his rivals and those seen as close to them have been sidelined.</p>
<p>In Jamnagar, the battle is between sitting Congress MP Vikram Madam and his niece Poonam Madam, inducted from the Congress with Modi’s blessings. Then a fresh face, Poonam got an assembly election from Bhanwad, which she won. Poonam is also credited with enabling a BJP victory in Salaya municipality in Jamnagar district, which has a sizeable Muslim vote, and which was traditionally with the Congress. “The public knows that she is the only person who can pose a threat to the sitting MP,” says Jamnagar city BJP president Hasmukh Hindocha.</p>
<p>In Bhavnagar, Dr Bharti Shiyal, 48, was preferred over a veteran leader with RSS roots, six-time MP Rajendrasinh Rana, who is known for his closeness to Modi’s rival Sanjay Joshi. Rana won thinly in 2009. Shiyal is a Koli leader.</p>
<p>Vitthal Radadiya, 56, another Congress heavyweight, has been rewarded with Porbandar. Last year Modi dealt a huge blow to the Congress, especially Shankersinh Vaghela, when he pulled confidant Radadiya, along with his MLA son Jayesh, over to his side. Radadiya had supported Vaghela in toppling the Keshubhai Patel-led BJP government in 1997, a rebellion largely seen as an anti-Modi one.</p>
<p>In Bardoli, union minister Tushar Chaudhary will contest his once close aide and former Congress MLA Prabhu Vasawa. Even in 2009, Vasawa was managing Chaudhary’s campaign. Chaudhary is the son of late chief minister and tribal leader Amarsinh Chaudhary.</p>
<p>In Patan, is currently with the Congress, the BJP has brought in an old Congress face and now state minister, Liladhar Vaghela. A Thakur, he was also Modi’s choice in 2004 against Congress heavyweight Vaghela from Kapadvanj. Liladar lost that election but remained in Modi’s good books.</p>
<p>Purshottam Rupala has recently fallen out with Modi and does not feature in the list. The BJP has retained its sitting MP, Naran Kachadia for Amreli, who was brought in by Modi in 2009.</p>
<p>The name of actor Paresh Rawal is doing the rounds for Ahmedabad East, which would be a snub to six-time MP Harin Pathak. Rawal is a self-proclaimed Modi fan. Pathak, who has been winning with heavy margins, is considered a staunch supporterof Advani.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014882&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a complaint by an octogenarian and her daughter alleging that the managing committee of their housing society on Pali Hill in  Bandra  was misleading home owners and pressuring them to sell 60 per cent of the premises to actor Aamir Khan, who apparently wants the land to build a bungalow for himself, the deputy registrar of cooperative societies has summoned both parties to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Taking cognizance of a complaint by Dr Pamela de Sa (87), and her daughter Dr Geneve de Sa (50), both residents of Virgo Co-operative Housing Society, the deputy registrar of co-operative societies, S N Patil said Thursday that such a proposal cannot be termed a ‘redevelopment proposal’. “Aamir Khan’s proposal can go through if 100 per cent consent from all members is acquired. In the case of redevelopment, only 75 per cent consent is enough, but in this case, all members should agree to a proposal of selling majority of the premise of the plot.” He added, “Such a situation can also lead to aggrieved parties going to court.”</p>
<p>The family had complained  to the deputy registrar last week that the society’s managing committee has been pushing Khan’s proposal, which they alleged was a “falsely conceived redevelopment scheme”.</p>
<p>“The managing committee is favouring the acceptance of a proposal from Aamir Khan who is trying to purchase 60 per cent of the flats for his own residence by forcibly dis-housing the existing members of the society and compelling them to search for new premises,” the de Sas had written to the deputy registrar on March 11.</p>
<p>The society has 23 members and comprises two ground-plus-three-storey buildings, Marina Apartments and Bella Vista, each of which has 12 flats. Khan owns two flats in Marina and one in Bella Vista, and first expressed interest in acquiring a part of the plot in December 2011.</p>
<p>Kondon Sabloak, member secretary of the society, said it was the society that had approached Aamir Khan to ‘redevelop’ the building. “We fear that no builder will touch this building as the total floor space index (FSI) of the plot is used and builders cannot get any added incentive in redevelopment of this plot. This plot is under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) II and does not have incentive FSI. Aamir Khan’s proposal is the only beneficial proposal we have received so far,” he said.</p>
<p>Sabloak added that Khan had sent his original proposal in December 2011 and it was later revived following requests from the managing committee.</p>
<p>Khan has offered to buy 20,000 sq ft of the 36,207 sq ft (3,364 sq m) property at the rate of Rs 70,000 per sq ft of carpet area from society members interested in selling their flats or garages to him.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a spokesperson for Khan said, “We would like to clarify on behalf of Mr Aamir Khan that he denies all allegations regarding him putting any pressure on his society to go in for redevelopment. The fact of the matter is that Mr Khan left the building more than a year ago, after an incident of a slab of concrete falling on the head of one of the members, resulting in the member being hospitalised”.</p>
<p>“Thereafter, over the months, in his absence, the society had several meetings and discussions, regarding redevelopment. The general body eventually passed a resolution with 80 per cent majority members voting in favour of redevelopment. Thereafter, society made a request in writing to Mr Khan to make an offer. Mr Khan gave the matter due thought and made an offer. In his offer letter, he also suggested to the society to invite other offers to ensure best value for the society and its members. Mr Khan strongly denies any allegations of pressure tactics or misconduct on his part and takes strong exception to attempts being made to defame him,” said the spokesperson.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The CBI has arrested eight doctors possessing medical degrees from Russia and China for allegedly acquiring registration certificates from the Medical Council of India through fraudulent means and not by clearing mandatory screening test. </span></p>
<p>The probe agency after a nationwide raid has also arrested five other doctors and a few MCI officials for facilitating the crime.</p>
<p>During the raid, one of the doctors employed at Asansol in West Bengal allegedly tried to commit suicide, but was overpowered and arrested. The doctor reportedly was to get married next week.</p>
<p>The CBI said the accused doctors in connivance with MCI officials used fake documents to register themselves with MCI. “As per the rules, the doctors who receive primary medical qualification degree by medical institutions abroad are required to pass a mandatory screening test in India to get the permanent registration certificates to practice here. In the present case, the accused doctors had not allegedly cleared the said screening test conducted by the National Board of examination,” said a CBI spokesperson.</p>
<p>The CBI said three of the doctors were working in government hospitals in Gujarat, Bengal and Chhattisgarh.</p>
<p>The CBI also conducted raid at the premises of a Meerut medical practitioner who was allegedly a conduit between the MCI officials and the potential candidates from abroad. Probe officials said the arrested people told investigators that they paid up to Rs 20 lakh for getting registration from the MCI. Several top MCI officials are also under the agency scanner.</p>
<p>In its FIR, the agency also alleged that the fake registration certificates generated by the MCI were dispatched in a hurried manner. The verification in respect of the degrees obtained by these doctors from medical institutions abroad was shown to have been conducted even before the submission of the applications to MCI requesting for registration.</p>
<p>The accused have been charged with cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy under the IPC and sections of Prevention of Corruption Act.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014866&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/saharamacedoniam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014955" alt="Subrata Roy is flanked by the Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski (right) and Minister of Finance Zoran Stavrevski (left)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/saharamacedoniam.jpg" /></a> Subrata Roy is flanked by the Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski (right) and Minister of Finance Zoran Stavrevski (left)
<p><strong>By: Xhelal Neziri</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The arrest of Sahara Group chief Subrata Roy has been received with shock and embarrassment in a rather unlikely part of the world — Macedonia.</span></p>
<p>Last year, this small Balkan country of 2 million people located to the north of Greece had laid out the red carpet and welcomed the controversial Indian businessman as a saviour of its weak economy. The Republic of Macedonia has a record unemployment rate of 30 percent, with every third person living in poverty and is eager for foreign investment.</p>
<p>And Roy made three trips — in January, July and October 2013 — with his entourage and announced big plans as he rubbed shoulders <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">with Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski and other top government ministers.</span></p>
<p>He said he would invest a whopping 2.7 billion euros in businesses in Macedonia in the next five years, which would include building a ‘Las Vegas’ and bringing 20,000 cows into the country.</p>
<p>Roy also argued that fraud and debt allegations against Sahara in India and reports about its financial condition were all fictional and had nothing to do with planned investments in Macedonia. The ‘Sahara India Parivar’, he claimed, was worth 22 billion euros and had one million employees.</p>
<p>The Macedonian government presented him as a very human businessman who wants to help the poor because Mother Teresa, who was from the Macedonian region, helped a lot of poor people in India. Macedonians believed Roy’s nice-sounding promises and thought their government had finally found a great investor who would save the Macedonian economy.</p>
<p>But news that he has been arrested and sent to jail in an alleged fraud case has come as a shock. “If it’s too good to be true, then probably it isn’t,” has been the first reaction of many people on social media networks.</p>
<p>Government officials, who were eager to be photographed with him, have gone silent after he was detained. The Macedonian government had no comment about his arrest and asked reporters to demand answers from Roy’s firm in India. Roy’s office in Skopje said his plans to invest in Macedonia remain despite the new situation.</p>
<p>“I love this country and that is why I’m here. I came with a large delegation but there is much work ahead to start. Things grow, and I can say that I’m here with big plans and ambitions, but it takes time,” Roy had said after arriving at the airport in Ohrid in July.</p>
<p>Among his announcements was one to build a super-luxury tourist complex called ‘Saharijan Macedonia’ worth hundreds of millions of euros on an area of 240 hectares in Ljubanista village on Lake Ohrid. The complex is to include a luxury hotel by the water, high class apartments, villas, bungalows, private beaches, casinos and golf courses. Roy had also asked for an additional 17 acres of state land to house the staff who would serve the complex.</p>
<p>Following a meeting between Roy and his manager and a large government delegation led by Finance Minister Zoran Stavreski, Sahara announced that it would set up a plant in Lozovo that would make dairy products mostly for export to the Middle East and South Africa. The plant would have an investment of 211 million euros, employ about 2,000 people and have 20,000 heads of cattle.</p>
<p>Roy also claimed that his company had invested around 10 million euros in Macedonia, partially in the land of hotel Ino Spectar. He said construction activity for Saharijan Macedonia would start sometime in March or April this year and that he would bring labourers from outside to work with locals as Macedonia does not have enough manpower for such a grand project.</p>
<p>He also said experts from India would train local staff in areas such as English language, hospitality, gastronomy and other activities linked to the project.</p>
<p>In January 2013, he announced that a 32-foot statue of Mother Teresa would be built in the centre of Skopje.</p>
<p>In October, he organized the Balkan Peace Festival in Skopje, which opened with fireworks, Indian dancers and music stars and was addressed by Prime Minister Gruevski. In his speech to a half-empty hall, Roy said he had been searching for a country without corruption and had finally found Macedonia.</p>
<p>“This idea was growing in me for a long time, I was looking for a city, a country in the world that is full of love, and respect, a country without corruption, and that I found in Macedonia,” Roy had said.</p>
<p>Macedonia, incidentally, is ranked 67th on Transparency International’s list of corrupt countries and EU reports emphasise that corruption remains a major problem and a challenge for institutions in Macedonia.</p>
<p>Besides his announcements, Roy was also noticed by Macedonians for some scandalous statements. For instance, he said: “I believe that many people who live in poverty should resort to sex and increase population density. In my organisation there are many criminals, but you need to leave them to time to change, so you can then turn them into the best citizens.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shaktimillsm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002755" alt="The verdict comes nearly eight months after two young women were gangraped inside the Shakti Mills." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shaktimillsm1.jpg" /></a> The verdict comes nearly eight months after two young women were gangraped inside the Shakti Mills.
<p>A sessions court on Thursday convicted all five accused in two separate cases of gangrape that occurred on the premises of an abandoned mill in central Mumbai last year.</p>
<p>Two young women, a photojournalist and a telephone operator, were assaulted within less than a month of each other by two groups of five men each in the dilapidated Shakti Mills compound in Mahalaxmi. In each case, one of the accused was a juvenile.</p>
<p>Three of the adults — Vijay Jadhav (18), Mohammed Qasim ‘Bangali’ (20) and Salim Ansari (27) — were accused in both cases, and have been convicted in both.</p>
<p>Siraj Rehman (24) has been convicted of the gangrape of the photojournalist, and Ashfaque Shaikh (24) of the gangrape of the telephone operator. The two juveniles are facing charges before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB). Principal Sessions Judge Shalini Phansalkar-Joshi said, “All four accused in each case are held guilty under all charges.”</p>
<p>The 23-year-old photojournalist was gangraped on August 22, 2013 by four adults and a juvenile who first beat up and tied her male colleague with whom she had gone to the decrepit mill on a shooting assignment. On August 31, the 19-year-old telephone operator went to the police to complain that she had been gangraped in the same mill a month earlier on July 31.</p>
<p>According to the prosecution, on August 22, Jadhav and Ansari stopped the two photojournalists outside the mill around 6 pm, and asked them to take a different way into the compound. Jadhav and Ansari were then joined by Qasim, Rehman and a 16-year-old.</p>
<p>Once the photojournalists entered the premises, the men accused them of trespassing, and told them to meet the caretaker of the mill. One of the accused claimed the woman’s colleague resembled a person involved in a murder on the premises. The woman’s colleague was tied up with her and his belts before she was taken to another side of the mill, where the accused took turns to rape her. Ansari also showed her a porn clip on his mobile phone.</p>
<p>As the victim approached the police within hours of the attack, strong medical evidence could be recorded. “The DNA report, the victim’s and her colleague’s testimonies, all helped us support the case,” special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said.</p>
<p>In the second case, because of the delay in reporting the assault, the prosecution relied on the victim’s testimony along with circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>According to the prosecution, the woman, who was on her way to Siddhivinayak temple with her then boyfriend, took a short cut through the mill. The accused overpowered them and gangraped the the woman. Scared to return to their homes, the couple fled to Chhattisgarh. They stayed there for a month, and the woman was treated at a local clinic. The woman had to undergo treatment even after the couple returned to Mumbai and approached the police. The police filed a 365-page chargesheet in the case on October 8.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the accused were brought to the court at 11 am, and the verdict was pronounced soon afterward. All five men broke down in the court. Their lawyers will appeal to the Bombay High Court.</p>
<p>Maharashtra Home Minister R R Patil, who was present in the court, said, “In a short span of eight months, the court has delivered the judgment. It is a strong signal. It is a known fact that across the world, women are not secure. But it is different in Mumbai. It is by far the safest city. And to ensure that women feel more secure here, the state has been working towards curbing violence against women.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014152&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>By: Jane Wardell &amp; Siva Govindasamy</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Aircraft and ships ploughed through dire weather Thursday in search of objects floating in remote seas off Australia that is believed to be a “credible lead” in the hunt for the Malaysian Airlines jet missing for nearly two weeks.</span></p>
<p>The large objects, which Australian officials said were spotted by satellite four days ago in one of the remotest parts of the globe, are the most promising find in days as searchers scour a vast area for the plane lost with 239 people on board.</p>
<p>A Norwegian merchant ship arrived in the area on Thursday, but officials cautioned it could take days to confirm if the objects were part of the Boeing 777. The area where the objects were spotted is around 2,500 km southwest of Perth, roughly corresponding to the far end of a southern track investigators calculated the aircraft could have taken after it was diverted.</p>
<p>Two Royal Australia Air Force AP-3C Orions, a U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon and a Royal New Zealand Air Force P-3K2 Orion were involved in Thursday’s search.</p>
<p>Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said information received from <span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Australia had been “corroborated to a certain extent” by other satellites, making it more credible than previous leads.</span></p>
<p>The larger of the objects measured up to 24 metres long and appeared to be floating in water several thousand metres deep, Australian officials said. The second object was about five metres long. Arrows on the images pointed to two indistinct objects apparently bobbing in the water.</p>
<p>The satellite images, provided by U.S. company DigitalGlobe, were taken on March 16, meaning the possible debris could by now have drifted far from the original site. Australian officials said an aircraft had dropped a series of marker buoys in the area, which will provide information about currents to assist in calculating the latest location.</p>
<p>A Norwegian car carrier diverted from its journey from Madagascar to Melbourne and had arrived in the search area.</p>
<p>The discovery of the floating objects was revealed by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.</p>
<p>“The task of locating these objects will be extremely difficult and it may turn out they are not related to the search for MH370,” he told parliament.</p>
<p>The dimensions of the objects given are consistent with at least one of them possibly being the major part of a 777-200ER wing, which is around 27 metres long, though Australian officials cautioned the first images were indistinct.</p>
<p>The relatively large size of the objects would suggest that, if they do come from the missing aircraft, it was largely intact when it went into the water.</p>
<p>If the plane had run out of fuel, it would not necessarily have plummeted but its behaviour would have depended on whether there was someone in control and their intentions, pilots said.</p>
<p>If the debris is from the plane, investigators would face a daunting task to retrieve the “black box” data and voice recorders needed to help understand what caused the disaster.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014853&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/khushwanttm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014948" alt="Khushwant Singh is now identified as a writer first and a journalist afterwards. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/khushwanttm.jpg" /></a> Khushwant Singh is now identified as a writer first and a journalist afterwards.
<p>Delhi&#8217;s prominent citizens famously “need no introduction” — these being the words prefacing elaborate introductions at every public function.</p>
<p>Khushwant Singh, who passed away on Thursday at the age of 99, did one better — he needed no obituary.<br />
He had written one for himself well in advance: “Here lies one who spared neither man nor God/ Waste not your tears on him, he was a sod/ Writing nasty things he regarded as great fun/ Thank the Lord he is dead, this son of a gun.” (Death at my Doorstep, Roli Books).</p>
<p>Until he stopped his column ‘With Malice to One and All’ two years ago, Khushwant Singh had served as the obituarist of his generation too. Notices and personal reminiscences about the good, the bad and the ridiculous who were departing this world sat unselfconsciously among the regular fare of pointed political and social criticism, engaging trivia, plugs for India’s wandering bands of artists and writers on the make and the latest thigh-slapping, hand-shaking ethnic humour from Delhi’s clubs and bars.</p>
<p>Widely syndicated, collected in book form and read by lakhs of people, the column was perhaps more influential than Singh’s other work. He will certainly be remembered for academic and creative writing like a History of the Sikhs (OUP, 1963) and Train to Pakistan (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1956), but he loved the reach of media and used jokes to soften up the reader for a dose of subversive commentary.</p>
<p>But Singh is now identified as a writer first and a journalist afterwards. Perhaps because the Illustrated Weekly of India is long defunct and his contribution to the remaking of Indian media forgotten.</p>
<p>During Singh’s tenure at the helm of the magazine, its circulation is said to have increased seven times over to 400,000 and it became prominently visible in English-reading homes. Among Singh’s innovations was a page of jokes, cartoons and a glamour photograph which looked like it belonged in The Sun.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, in the same period, the Weekly remained a venue noted for publishing quality contemporary poetry, fiction, essays and photography. Singh clearly saw no conflict in this paradox. Neither did readers, and they voted with their subscriptions.</p>
<p>In 1981, Singh wrote of the change wrought in his tenure, 1969-1978: “What was a four-wheeled Victoria taking well-draped ladies out to eat the Indian air I made a noisy, rumbustious, jet-propelled vehicle of information, controversy and amusement&#8230;till the Illustrated did become a weekly habit of the English-reading pseudo-elite of the country.” Note the barb in the tail, coined a decade before “pseudo-secular”.</p>
<p>Indeed, Singh was a creature of paradox. Along with his brassy humour — which he celebrated by proclaiming that condoms are not designed to fit a pen — his hallmark was the gift of self-deprecation.</p>
<p>In one of his most memorable columns, he wrote of hate mail received from an irate Punjabi in Canada. The letter, written in Gurmukhi, accused him of various incestuous excesses. The envelope bore his address in English, though: “Bastard Khushwant Singh, India”. In the column, Singh applauded the postal service for the indefatigable diligence with which it had delivered this letter to his address in Sujan Singh Park, Delhi.</p>
<p>Khushwant Singh lived in an estate named after his grandfather and built by his father Sobha Singh, who was a prominent landowner and one of the contractors who built Lutyens’ Delhi, but that never went to his head. Perhaps he had become an anachronism in the world of modern opinion-makers, who take themselves in deadly earnest and are sedulously mindful of their stature. But he helped to create the constantly shifting opinion cloud that is the mark of modern media, lit by the heat-lightning of tweets and posts.</p>
<p>In real life, Khushwant Singh was nothing like Mario Miranda’s caricature that went with his column, a man whose creature comforts were a bottle of Scotch, a girlie magazine and a pile of books. He had sided immoderately with Sanjay Gandhi during the Emergency, yet returned his Padma Bhushan in protest against the armed assault on the Golden Temple in 1984, and castigated L K Advani for sowing hatred with the Rathyatra.</p>
<p>A devastating loose cannon, he needed a persona that played harmless, like that caricature. Finally, it was the delicate art of self-deprecation that let him say almost anything and get away unscathed, all his charmed life.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014253&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>BY: ROHIT TIWARI</strong></p>
<p>Releasing its Lok Sabha election manifesto ahead of other parties, the CPM Thursday called for “rejection of the Congress” and “defeat of the BJP”. </p>
<p>Several proposals were repeats of its 2009 manifesto or modification of UPA’s social welfare measures. There were some additions, including constitutional amendment to make consent of a state legislature mandatory for a new state to be carved out. This was a fallout of Andhra bifurcation despite the Assembly rejecting creation of Telangana. </p>
<p>There is a proposal to make Right to Work a constitutional right in the 48-page manifesto which proposed an MGNREGA-like legislation for urban areas and a universal food security legislation.</p>
<p>“This is an appeal to people to vote for CPM, strengthen the Left and work for a secular, democratic alternative&#8230; It has become clear this election is being sought to be projected as a battle between certain leaders and personalities, devoid of major issues and policies&#8230;,” party general secretary Prakash Karat said. He said the Congress had failed and the BJP was a “retrograde and reactionary alternative”. He added that Left parties were working with “unity” and downplayed the split with RSP in Kerala.</p>
<p>The manifesto criticised UPA policies and proposed reforms including repeal of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, decriminalisation of Section 377, abolition of death penalty, and amendment of Article 3 to make consent of state legislature mandatory for a state to be bifurcated/reorganised by Parliament. </p>
<p>The manifesto also promises employment guarantee in urban areas for adults. For youth, it talks about Right to Work as a constitutional right for the first time. It talks about a sub-plan for Muslims like its 2009 manifesto.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014799&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid the uncertainty over Captain Amarinder Singh’s proposed candidature from Amritsar, the former chief minister Thursday said he would put up a fight if AICC chief Sonia Gandhi asks him to do so.</p>
<p>Not sending out any clear signals while talking to The Indian Express over the phone from New Delhi, Amarinder said, “If the party president asks me to contest, then I will not have any option. I cannot say no to the orders of the party president.”</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/singh1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014796" alt="Amarinder has emerged as the Congress’s choice to contest against BJP heavyweight Arun Jaitley from Amritsar.

(Express Archive)
<p>At the same time, he said he would not be able to do justice to the people of Amritsar, who were looking for a change from BJP MP Navjot Sidhu, who remained an “absentee MP”.</p>
<p>Amarinder has emerged as the Congress’s choice to contest against BJP heavyweight Arun Jaitley from Amritsar.</p>
<p>“I met Sonia Gandhi three weeks ago. She offered me to contest from Bathinda or Amritsar. I  told her that I will not be able to contest since Preneet Kaur is contesting from Patiala. She needs me there,” he said.</p>
<p>Amarinder reiterated that if he contested and was elected as MP from Amritsar, he will not be able to do justice to the people as a local could. Besides being an outsider, he said he would not be able to spend the required amount of time there.</p>
<p>“The party should field a local candidate who knows the constituency and the issues. We have such candidates available from all communities, Hindus or Sikhs,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014778&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>RJD president Lalu Prasad, touring the Pataliputra constituency, hit out strongly at his former close aide Ram Kripal Yadav for joining the BJP. Prasad held a public rally at Bikram, 40 km southwest of capital Patna, late Wednesday evening to garner support for RJD candidate and his eldest daughter Misa Bharti.</p>
<p>The rally was followed by a road show in near by Bihta. “He has taken refuge with the communal forces, forgetting everything. He has compromised with the philosophy of social justice and joined those whom he always opposed. The public is not going to forgive him,” he said.</p>
<p>This was the RJD chief’s first visit to Pataliputra after the declaration of candidatures of Misa Bharti, his friend-turned-foe Ram Kripal Yadav (BJP) and sitting MP Ranjan Yadav (JD-U) for the seat. Fighting a major challenge in her electoral debut, Misa Bharti expressed angry reaction against “uncle” Ram Kripal Yadav.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014779&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/two.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014774" alt="H D kumaraswamy(Left) and Veerappa Moily (right ) (Express Archive)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/two.jpg" /></a> H D kumaraswamy(Left) and Veerappa Moily (right ) (Express Archive)
<p>Former Karnataka chief minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader H D Kumaraswamy Thursday threatened to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Chikkaballapur constituency. Following a meeting with party workers, Kumaraswamy said the JD(S) wants him to take on Union Minister for Oil and Natural Gas Veerappa Moily and BJP leader B N Bachegowda.</p>
<p>But the former CM claimed he would take a final decision after meeting party workers in Ramanagar Assembly constituency, which he represents in the state legislature. He said he was wary of dumping the Ramanagar constituency in a bid to become an MP.</p>
<p>Kumaraswamy, son of the former PM and JD(S) chief H D Deve Gowda, said, “Party workers are demanding I contest from Chikkaballapur. I will discuss this with party workers in Ramanagar and announce my decision within two days.”</p>
<p>Kumaraswamy was the MP from Bangalore Rural till last year, and quit the seat after being elected to the state Assembly from Ramanagar.</p>
<p>“Water is the main problem for people of Chikkaballapur. No one has solved this problem. Moily is saying he will provide water through the Ettinahole lift irrigation project, but it is not possible. I will not contest from here if Moily promises he will provide 24 TMC water through this project,” Kumaraswamy said in the presence of more than 10,000 party workers.</p>
<p>“Kumaraswamy is under a lot of pressure from party workers in Chikaballapur to contest the polls,” Gowda said.</p>
<p>The constituency is dominated by the Vokkaliga community, which widely supports the JD(S), and Moily is perceived to be on a weak footing this time round.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the JD(S) is keeping both the Congress and the BJP guessing over the candidates it would field in crucial constituencies in Karnataka. While the Congress and the BJP have revealed 26 and 25 candidates respectively for 28 constituencies in the state, the JD(S) has revealed only 16.</p>
<p>Starved of good candidates, Gowda’s party has been pouncing on Congress and BJP rebels.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it officially decided to field disgruntled former BJP minister V Dhananjay Kumar from Udupi-Chikamagalur.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, the JD(S) is expected to field disgruntled Congress leaders — former railway minister Jaffer Sharief in Mysore, former Bangalore police commissioner H T Sangliana in Bangalore Central and former CM J H Patel’s son Mahima Patel in Davangere.</p>
<p>This could help the JD(S) emerge as a crucial third player in some constituencies.</p>
<p>“Jaffer Sharief and Sangliana have spoken to me. I have offered them tickets. We will declare their candidatures in a day or two after they officially enter the party,” Gowda said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014752&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Friends, family and admirers gathered at the Lodhi crematorium in South Delhi on Thursday afternoon to pay their last respects to Khushwant Singh.</span></p>
<p>Singh died “very peacefully” at 99, said his son Rahul Singh. “Of late, he wouldn’t talk much, but would like to discuss the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. He had his single malt on Wednesday night. On Thursday morning he got up as usual and was doing his crossword when he decided to lie down and never woke up. He died the way he would have wanted to,” said Rahul, adding that earlier this week Singh suffered slight breathing trouble. The noted author had expressed his wish to donate his eyes but “it wasn’t possible, there was no time to do so,” said his son.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife Gursharan Kaur, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, veteran journalists Kuldip Nayar, Arun Shourie and M J Akbar, author Vikram Seth and his mother Justice Leila Seth, former Indian cricket team captain Bishan Singh Bedi, Union ministers Salman Khurshid, Kapil Sibal and Farooq Abdullah, BJP leader L K Advani, politician Jaya Jaitly, former minister M S Gill, former attorney general Soli Sorabjee and actor Vinod Khanna were among the crowd of Singh’s admirers at the crematorium.</p>
<p>“What does one say about an institution. There was a very special thing about him that was a part of the ethos of modern India — his wisdom, experience, analytical ability, fantastic generosity and his feel for the past. He was the past, he was the present, and all that he wrote was also the future,” said Khurshid.</p>
<p>“He was a very sophisticated person and always spoke from the heart. He was very loving and totally fearless. I started writing poetry because of him,” said Sibal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014763&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">On a day when the TV cameras converged again at the gates of 30, Prithviraj Road in the national capital, and the BJP’s cloak-and-dagger drama around L K Advani’s candidature in this Lok Sabha election swirled into late evening, Advani himself sat alone in his study, remembering the man who had openly loved to hate him. </span></p>
<p>“I had known Khushwant Singh since he was a member of the Rajya Sabha,” recalled Advani. The BJP leader made his parliamentary debut in the Rajya Sabha in 1970 and Singh was also in the House of Elders in the first half of the ’80s. “To the best of my recollection, our association was friendly,” Advani said. In fact, Singh was Advani’s first proposer from New Delhi when he fought his first Lok Sabha election from that constituency in 1989.</p>
<p>In 1990, Advani went on the rath yatra to Ayodhya, the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992. A nation seemed convulsed by a new political current. Between the two men, things changed. “The rath yatra made Khushwant Singh very bitter, he became my severe critic,” said Advani.</p>
<p>The bitterness spilled into public view when during a book release function at the capital’s India International Centre, Singh lashed out at Advani, then deputy PM, who was also releasing the book. He feared three types of men, began Singh, as he zestily launched into Advani: those who don’t take alcohol, don’t eat non-vegetarian food, and those who are not interested in women.</p>
<p>Singh, of course, had no way of knowing that on the evening of the day of his death, Advani would pull out to read aloud, with evident affection and twinkling enjoyment, the epitaph Singh had written long ago for himself: ‘Here lies one who spared neither man nor God/ Waste not your tears on him, he was a sod/ Writing nasty things he regarded as great fun/ Thank the Lord he is dead, this son of a gun’.</p>
<p>In fact, many years would pass after the demolition of the Babri Masjid before the ice between the two men could break. It happened last year, when Advani read Khushwantnama: The Lessons of my Life. “I completed the 188-page book almost in a single sitting,” he said. It confirmed to him what he had always felt about Singh’s writing: that “for sheer readability, he (Singh) would have few peers”. Advani would write on Singh’s book later in his blog titled Amazing author: Thought provoking book: “I must say that this book is eloquent testimony to the fact that Khushwant Singh spares absolutely no effort to be true to himself.”</p>
<p>Reading Khushwantnama also impelled Advani to make the first move. On Sunday, March 3, 2013, he called on Singh at his residence to compliment him on his book. “I offered my pranam to him.” They spent an hour together and didn’t talk politics.</p>
<p>After that meeting, Singh wrote in his column in Hindustan Times: “After he (Advani) led his rath yatra from Somnath Temple to Ayodhya and watched the Babri Masjid being pulled down I have been one of his severest critics. I used harsh words for him on his face at a public meeting he was to address&#8230; instead of ticking me off, as I expected, he brought a bouquet of roses for me and my daughter. I had to concede he was a better Sikh than I am.”</p>
<p>Said Advani: “It is a rare person, of rare integrity and character, who can say this. I admire Singh not only because of his writing, his skill with the pen, but because of his character. In my public life I have seldom come across such people. I have seen how difficult it is for a person whose profession requires him to comment on individuals to have a measure of objectivity that can enable him to see the merits of individuals he abhors.”</p>
<p>For Advani, Singh’s large heartedness towards someone he had been implacably hostile to stirs memories of another man, in a different moment. “After Gandhiji’s assassination, JP led a procession to the Organiser office, asking for a ban on the RSS. Yet later, he became an admirer of ours and when I asked him to address the annual session of the Jana Sangh in Delhi, he agreed. Several CPM leaders like EMS Namboodiripad tried to deter him. It’s a fascist organisation, they said. But JP came and in his address he said that if the BJP is fascist, I am also fascist.”</p>
<p>Advani met Singh again last month, for the last time, on February 2 to congratulate him on entering his 100th year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014760&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Writer-journalist Sadia Dehlvi was attending a calligraphy exhibition in Delhi when Khushwant Singh walked up to her and asked, “How are you so beautiful?” If she was thrown off by his impetuous question, Dehlvi didn’t show it. Instead, she confidently replied, “Well, because I am a beautiful person.” Singh responded almost immediately: “Tomorrow, my house, 7 o’clock.” That was 30 years ago; today Dehlvi is thoughtful while talking about her best friend and confidant who passed away on Thursday morning. “He touched so many lives in more ways than one — be it through his writing, helping people find jobs, reading manuscripts of young authors and journalists and editing those as if they were his own, among others,” she says. </span></p>
<p>Singh’s editor, Ravi Singh, first at Penguin and now at Aleph, couldn’t agree more. “The light has gone out. His (Sujan Singh Park) home was a place of refuge for so many people who needed help or just wanted to talk. Those with a sense of humour also have a sense of compassion. Khushwant gave his best to people, and they, in turn, became their best with him,” says Ravi.</p>
<p>Ravi began working with Singh while the latter was writing The Company of Women, published by Penguin in 1999. “He favoured short sentences, didn’t use big words and never wrote a convoluted sentence. He was the most versatile writer in India, he straddled both the literary as well as the popular fiction genre,” he says.</p>
<p>At home, Ravi remembers a man who was full of mischief, but never malice. “He liked the image he’d cultivated of a curmudgeonly old man, but he was very child-like. He grew to become my favourite person,” says Ravi. Every year on his birthday, Singh received a bouquet of flowers from the Prime Minister’s wife, Gursharan Kaur, and delighted in pointing them out to his visitors. His friends remember a man who loved gossip but wasn’t petty with people, a man who could not abide anger and rudeness, a disciplined writer who woke up every morning at 5 to write. “Khushwant always said that his greatest joy was receiving letters from readers, especially the abusive ones,” says Ravi.</p>
<p>The 99-year-old writer-historian was also famous for his 8 o’clock cut-off hour. Writer Bhaichand Patel speaks fondly of his former editor at The Illustrated Weekly of India, and his neighbour who would call him over for a chat. “You’d have to go over at seven, and he’d kick you out at eight,” says Patel. “Bottoms up and bugger off,” chuckles Ravi and remembers that if dinner was being served, he’d allow his guests to stay till nine. “Khushwant wouldn’t go to a party if you didn’t serve dinner at eight,” says Patel, who also credits Singh with encouraging him to write his first work of fiction, Mothers, Lovers and Other Strangers in 2013. “He was my mentor for over 40 years,” says Patel. “I wouldn’t have been a writer without him,” says Dehlvi.</p>
<p>“Khushwant was never afraid to live and write. He wasn’t afraid to die either, he wrote about it before. He would have approved of the way he left, he didn’t want to suffer the indignity of nurses wiping his bottom,” says Ravi. “His death is not to be mourned, Khushwant had a full life,” says Patel. But Dehlvi remembers the last words he said to her. “A few weeks ago, he said ‘Jaldi ayiyega, pata nahi kab chala jaun’. And I just looked at him and held his hand; it was always reassuring to do that; and feel that he is not going anywhere.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014759&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Inder Malhotra recalls a story Khushwant Singh loved to tell. Seeing him return from law studies in England, to the presumably hectic and distracted social whirl of pre-Partition Lahore, folks would ask his iconic builder father, Sobha Singh, what course he’d actually done. “I don’t know what course he passed,” he would reply in Punjabi, “but he passed a lot of time.” </span></p>
<p>Sobha Singh was obviously being colloquially offhanded, but could he have known that he had composed the most apt epitaph for his son’s unlikely literary career? In decades spent excelling at making – mostly, making up – his profile sufficiently controversial to keep everyone interested, Khushwant Singh’s writing is a tutorial in how to pass time by being of one’s time and place.</p>
<p>The endeavour got him on the controversial side often, most notably in his fervent editorial support to the Emergency (and specifically to Sanjay Gandhi), but his writing career was an attempt to not look away from the present, and to employ all his guile to get readers to stay on the same page as him. To this end, he would spice up accounts of his exploits, pretending to be incorrigibly debauched and addicted to gossip, even though his highly disciplined schedule too was the stuff of legend (early morning to the writing perch, drink at seven, dinner at eight, and good night at nine).</p>
<p>He’d have time for anyone who’d come calling, and, in season, copious quantities of fresh phalsa juice, but only, by appointment, please. He would produce great scholarship, by way of fiction and non, but he’d remain the aam aadmi’s favourite weekend distraction, with columns (and later books) of “Khushwant jokes”. Why, he’d get all of India to try to compete with him, and there is an archival exercise awaiting sociologists in picking trends in the bagfuls of jokes that would arrive in the mail. He could be brilliant, and also not, but you could always find someone who liked a particular piece of writing. So, you had to say, he did pass his time well.</p>
<p>In his autobiography Truth, Love &amp; A Little Malice, he pins the start of his writing career to his resolve to stop his friend, civil servant Mangat Rai, from showing off too much (importantly, also to Khushwant’s glamorous wife Kaval) at literary soirees in his Lahore flat.</p>
<p>But it would be Partition that would firmly detach him from Lahore and his legal ambitions, and towards writing. Singh, not incidentally to the symmetric arc of his life story, did not know the exact date of his birth in 1915 in Hadali in the shadow of the Khewra Salt Range. He decided on the date August 15 as the likely one, and went on to write a landmark novel about the social and political ruptures of Partition, Train to Pakistan. Malhotra, who’d discuss Saadat Hasan Manto’s Toba Tek Singh with him, marvels at the “complexities of the relationship he foretold then”. (“It’s no good!” the kind lady who typed it out for him had said. “No one is going to publish it.” Singh had the foresight too to submit the book, pre-publication, for a literary prize under a pseudonym because Krishna Menon was a judge. He won.)</p>
<p>Along with the grand The History of the Sikhs and his fictional biography of the capital city, Delhi, Train to Pakistan claims Singh’s space as a pre-eminent figure in Indian letters. But as Malhotra remembers, that status is burnished enormously on account of Singh’s courage to stand up, real-time, to extremism of every sort – in fact, he stresses, Singh was the “only Sikh intellectual” to criticise Bhindranwale in his glory days.</p>
<p>Malhotra also remembers telling Singh that he would not like to pass away before him, given his way of listing both the good and the bad of the departed person in obituaries. Weighing him thus just on literary terms, it can be asked if Khushwant Singh wrote too much. Of course, he did. But if he didn’t, he would not have been the man was, a mentor to aspiring writers and publishers, a guide to anyone who sought him out, till the last, a grateful recipient of unsolicited jokes and an engaged reviewer of the next new thing in literature, and always counsel for the need to laugh a bit and not take oneself too seriously. All in all, time very well passed. And all this before you take into account his contribution to journalism.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014757&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lgbtm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015076" alt="LGBT movement has been apolitical too long. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lgbtm.jpg" /></a> LGBT movement has been apolitical too long. (Reuters)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Members of the LGBT community will raise their issues with AAP representatives at a special programme in Delhi on Sunday. Initiated by Mumbai-based filmmaker Onir, “Face to Face” has been organised by Engendered, an arts and gender rights organisation. It is first initiative where a national-level party has proactively displayed interest in this community’s problems. </span></p>
<p>“After the Supreme Court verdict upheld Section 377, the AAP was one party that spoke in our favour. We also realised the LGBT movement has been apolitical too long. It is time we change that because unless we lobby, and lobby right, the community will not be allowed (its) rights,” said Onir.</p>
<p>The event is being termed a “conversation” between the heads of several Delhi-based LGBT organisations as well as feminists and AAP representatives Dilip Pandey and Atishi Marlena.</p>
<p>Myna Mukherjee of Engendered says the idea is to have an exchange in gender, equality and human rights since the problems rarely get discussed at a lobbying level “although this is at an informal level”. It’s an open event that Mukherjee says will be attended by several LGBT artistes and feminists.</p>
<p>Atishi Marlena said the party had raised issues concerning the transgender community even during the Delhi assembly elections. “We were the only party to have taken up issues relating to their identity, access to healthcare, education and livelihood options. In the Lok Sabha elections, we plan to include these issues in our manifesto. Our efforts will include constitution of transgender welfare boards across states.”</p>
<p>After the meeting at Gallery Engendered SPACE, Shahpurjat, Onir plans to take this event to Mumbai and Kolkata too. “I have faith in the manifesto and vision of AAP. Also, most of their candidates include professionals such as artistes, teachers, engineers and doctors, which gives me hope that they will be more open to discussing the problems of the queer community.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014756&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/parmar.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014750" alt="Paranjaditya Parmar’s name was announced for the Panchmahal seat, but withdrawn in “15 mins”. (Express Archive)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/parmar.jpg" /></a> Paranjaditya Parmar’s name was announced for the Panchmahal seat, but withdrawn in “15 mins”. (Express Archive)
<p>The Congress central election committee (CEC) Thursday declared Thasra MLA Ramsinh Parmar as the candidate for the Panchmahal seat, following a controversy over Paranjaditya Parmar, son-in-law of AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh, being picked for the same seat on March 18.</p>
<p>Though Paranjaditya’s name “sneaked” into the Congress candidate list, party sources claimed the team that drew the list was unaware of this. Party leaders said his name was announced for the Panchmahal seat, but withdrawn within “fifteen minutes”.</p>
<p>This, after objections were raised of there being “too many from one family in the Parliament”, sources said. Digvijaya was recently elected to the Rajya Sabha and his brother Lakshman Singh was also in the race for a Lok Sabha ticket.</p>
<p>Sources said Shankersinh Vaghela, who lost the Panchmahal seat in 2009, made way for Paranjaditya. Vaghela himself chose to contest from Sabarkantha seat, apparently to honour an “understanding” he had with the AICC general secretary, sources said. “I was already an MLA, but decided to contest the Lok Sabha polls only because I was asked to,” Vaghela said.</p>
<p>The panel of names sent for the Panchmahal seat by the party’s Gujarat unit had Balasinor MLA Mansinh Chauhan, Ramsinh and Paranjaditya on it. Sources said the CEC had finalised Chauhan’s name, pending announcement after Holi. “Somehow Paranjaditya’s name crept into the list but was withdrawn within 15 minutes,” said Gujarat PCC chief Arjun Modhwadia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chauhan and Ramsinh threatened to resign over his candidature. Paranjaditya Parmar was unavailable for comment.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014730&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Prathap Simha, newspaper columnist and author of a Narendra Modi biography, is one of the most talked-about BJP candidates this election. Simha, whose nomination from Mysore has triggered murmurs of dissent among senior leaders, discusses his arrival in politics in this interview.</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to contest?</strong></p>
<p>As a journalist, I have been always connected to society and expressed my views on development. Contesting is just a natural step towards becoming an agent of change. Of course, like many others, I am inspired by Modiji. He signifies hope and has specific ideas for developing the country.</p>
<p><strong>It has been said you were fielded on the insistence of Modi and the RSS. </strong></p>
<p>My selection has been accepted at the local, state and national levels. Some media houses are reporting internal party discussions that took place before the finalisation of candidates.</p>
<p><strong>As a new face in the region, how will you convince voters?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It is true that I am new to the region. But I have a readership base in the Krishnaraja, Narasimharaja, Chamaraja and Chamundeshwari regions. In Kodagu, apart from the readership base, the people there are a race of patriots ready to serve the nation. I believe that with a leader like Modi, they will support me in my campaign. In Hunsur and Piraiyapattana, we need to reach out more.</p>
<p><strong>What will your campaign focus on?</strong></p>
<p>The focus of the BJP campaign is national empowerment, for which electing Modi to power remains the key. Other parties speak on terrorism, black money, poverty eradication and eventually after coming to power do nothing about it. People are interested in electing a leader with clear ideas. Modiji has already shown he can be counted on.</p>
<p><strong>Will you continue to be a journalist?</strong></p>
<p>I will continue to write columns.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014744&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modimumbaim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015105" alt="BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi addressing an election rally in Wardha on Thursday. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modimumbaim.jpg" /></a> BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi addressing an election rally in Wardha on Thursday. (PTI)
<p>BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi Thursday spelt out his vision for agriculture, stressing that he favoured policies that would double per-hectare production with innovative practices at low cost, usher in land reforms and promote use of technology, value-addition with agro-based industries and direct market linkage.</p>
<p>He was talking to farmers from across the country at a ‘chai pe charcha’ programme in this hailstorm-affected village of Yavatmal district — one of the 35 most suicide-affected districts in the country.</p>
<p>Modi, however, refrained from committing anything on increasing the prices of farm products as one of the ways to take farmers out of crisis, though he said the government must help farmers do better by making available better farm inputs, technology and loans on lower interest rates.</p>
<p>He advocated a dedicated railway farm transport machinery to ensure better and fast delivery at cheaper rate. “Farmers could get Re 1 more on every litre if milk could be transported by trains instead of tankers,” he said. Modi said he supported genetically modified crops. “I am all for use of technology,” he said.</p>
<p>“More farmers have ended lives in India than soldiers who have become martyrs. My sentiments are with the families of those who have committed suicide. There is no greater inspiration for me than to do something for you. Getting connected with you gives me strength to solve your problems. I will not be able to sleep well till I do that,” he said. Striking a contrast to his pro-business image, Modi said banks usually did nothing against industries defaulting on loans but pestered the poor farmers for recovery.</p>
<p>Modi also said Madhya Pradesh, under the leadership of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, had marched so much ahead in agriculture that it had left the BIMARU tag behind. He also praised Chouhan for keeping election responsibilities aside to tour hailstorm-affected parts of the state and also sitting on a dharna to demand Central aid.</p>
<p>Modi termed as “kushasan” (bad governance) the UPA government’s “inaction” on the Supreme Court’s order to distribute foodgrains stored in government godowns among the poor. He criticised the government for letting the grains rot and then giving it to liquor manufacturers at cheap rates. He also criticised the Centre for not giving permission to install gates at the Sardar Sarovar project and depriving Maharashtra of “absolutely free” power worth Rs 400 crore.</p>
<p>State unit chief Devendra Fadnavis and many BJP nominees from Vidarbha were present on the occasion. Farm activist Kishor Tiwari of Vidarbha Jan Andolan too participated in the discussion.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014726&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to the letter mailed by the Cyber Cell, the two articles — based on separate interviews of Pracha — headlined “Rakesh Maria should be arrested for conducting activities which are terror related: Advocate Pracha” and “Substantive evidence against police of aiding and abetting the real terrorists: Advocate Pracha” have been asked to be pulled down.</p>
<p>Pracha, who is defending German Bakery bombing convict Himayat Baig, has alleged that Maria should be arrested for implicating an “innocent” man in the blast probe. In one of the interviews by journalist M Reyaz, the article quotes Pracha as having “substantive evidence” against Maria, and accuses him “of using underworld to threaten him”.</p>
<p>Pracha confirmed that he had made the allegations in the two interviews. “If Rakesh Maria finds whatever I have said defamatory, he should send a legal notice to me.”</p>
<p>When contacted, editor of TwoCircles.net Kashif Ul-Huda in an email response said, “We see it as an attempt by Mumbai Police to scare us in taking down the story.”</p>
<p>The summon, mailed on Wednesday, read: “It is submitted that a false and grossly offensive comments are found to posted in the above mentioned links, which are causing annoyance, inconvenience, insult and hatred to the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai (Maria)”.</p>
<p>Maria however, did not wish to comment on the controversy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014733&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The Bombay High Court Thursday set aside the Maharashtra Chief Minister’s discretionary housing quota, observing that the allotments of flats under the quota were “illegal”. The court added all the policies of the state government, giving the CM the discretion to allot flats under a quota are “bad in law”.</span></p>
<p>The court restrained the state government from making any further allotments of the 2 per cent of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority flats and 5 per cent flats on private land under the purview of Urban Ceiling Land Act, under the chief minister’s quota. The state can, however, frame a fresh policy that would be “fair”, it said.</p>
<p>“This is the first time that a court has set aside the discretionary powers of the chief minister. The court has observed that the method adopted by the state government shows that the state government was treating the allotment as a private venture,” said lawyer Uday Warunjikar, who represented petitioner Manohar Bait.</p>
<p>The High Court, however, clarified the status of the allotments made under the quota prior to its decision would be determined in another criminal PIL filed by activist Ketan Tirodkar.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014732&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Centre is planning to file a curative petition in the Supreme Court (SC) against its order to commute to life term the death penalty of 15 convicts on grounds of delay in disposal of their mercy petitions by the President. A review petition filed on the subject was dismissed by the apex court last week.</p>
<p>The Centre wants to oppose the SC order as it is of the opinion that the apex court’s decision is tantamount to one constitutional body challenging the authority of another — the President of India.</p>
<p>“We have decided to move a curative petition. We are in the process of building a stronger case as the government cannot be seen as going soft on cases relating to terror and heinous crimes. Moreover, the law is silent on grounds of delay. It does not specifically say the death sentence would be commuted to life term if there is a delay from the President’s office,” said a senior Home Ministry official.</p>
<p>Dismissing the Centre’s review petition on March 12, the SC had said it found no merit in it. It had also rejected the government’s request to hear it in an open court.</p>
<p>A three-judge Bench had passed an order on January 21 commuting the death penalty.</p>
<p>The Centre, in its review petition, said the case ought to have been heard by a minimum of five judges as it involved a substantial question of constitutional law.</p>
<p>“The President is the sovereign authority and it is in the prerogative of his office to take the desired time in deciding the mercy pleas of prisoners on death row. The SC order will have a cascading effect on similar cases, including the one involving commutation of death sentence of the killers of Rajiv Gandhi,” said the official.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014714&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The disinvestment procedures were elaborate, and scrupulously adhered to, he said. Every step was explained through press statements.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014725&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">As a two-member CBI team visited former disinvestment minister Arun Shourie in connection with its preliminary enquiry into the alleged irregularities in the divestment of Hindustan Zinc Ltd (HZL) during the NDA regime, Shourie laid out the facts of the case before the agency, underscoring that the charges it was probing had been rejected in toto by the Supreme Court as recently as December 2012. </span></p>
<p>Shourie is learnt to have told the CBI that the recommendation to disinvest 25 per cent was raised to 26 per cent because under company law, an investor acquires an important say in a company’s management only if he has at least 26 per cent equity.</p>
<p>He is believed to have stressed that the entire process had been transparent, and that Attorney General G E Vahanvati had, before the CBI reopened the decade-old matter, opined that there was no case for challenging the decision.</p>
<p>Shourie apparently reminded the officials that the decision had not been questioned at the time, not even by MPs most vociferously opposed to privatisation.</p>
<p>He explained to them that every decision was taken after it had been considered by the inter-ministerial group in which all concerned ministries — in particular the administrative ministry which was, in this case, Mines — were represented; the core group on disinvestment headed by the cabinet secretary; and a separate valuation committee comprising two members from the Ministry of Mines, and the CMD of the company.</p>
<p>“Every proposal was referred to, and the decision was taken by, the Cabinet Committee on Disinvestment presided over by the PM, and the role of the Ministry of Disinvestment was that of a facilitator,” he is learnt to have said.</p>
<p>The disinvestment procedures were elaborate, and scrupulously adhered to, he said. Every step was explained through press statements.</p>
<p>On the queries related to the Supreme Court judgment on the disinvestment of HPCL and BPCL, Shourie is believed to have said that the judgment had no relevance to the HZL case. It was delivered in September 2003, after the disinvestment of HZL (April 2002), and the court did not say that it would have retrospective effect.</p>
<p>The CBI officers also recorded the statement of Vedanta group chairman Anil Agarwal. The agency had last year registered a PE against Agarwal and unknown officials in connection with alleged irregularities in the disinvestment of HZL. The agency believes that the loss to the exchequer due to the alleged irregularities runs into hundreds of crores of rupees.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014725&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Decision on naming Sudhir Choudhrie yet to be taken.</em></p>
<p>Nearly two weeks after Defence Minister A K Antony ordered a CBI probe into the alleged bribery case involving British major Rolls Royce’s contracts with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the agency initiated a probe and said it is likely to register a preliminary enquiry (PE), instead of a regular case.</p>
<p>CBI officials argued they will first examine the allegations of bribery through a verification process during the PE as they are yet to find any “direct evidence” of the allegations. The agency will also set a deadline of two months to finalise its investigations, said officials.</p>
<p>The PE is also likely to name HAL and Rolls Royce officials, but a decision whether to include the name of alleged arms dealer Sudhir Choudhrie in the case is yet to be taken, a senior CBI official said. The agency said that after receiving communication from the Defence Ministry, they are in the process of collecting the documents and contracts between HAL and Rolls Royce.</p>
<p>Soon after a CBI probe was announced, Rolls Royce had offered to return the commission paid by India. The agency said it will also contact Rolls Royce representatives to seek their version before finalising its investigations.</p>
<p>Choudhrie’s role is also being probed in connection with the 2007 Soltam deal worth Rs 208 crore, in which he was first named by the CBI. The case, closed in 2010 for want of sufficient evidence, has been reopened by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to dig out fresh evidence against Choudhrie to be examined by the CBI. Choudhrie’s name first came up in the Rolls Royce bribery case after he and his son were questioned by Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in UK last month.</p>
<p>The agency is also likely to mention Rs 5,000 crore worth of contracts received by Rolls Royce in its PE. It is suspected that hefty commissions were allegedly paid to intermediaries to bag defence deals.</p>
<p>The British firm had already admitted to hiring a private firm as a “commercial advisor” for deals in India and that it was paid a certain percentage of the contract value. The “advisor” has been identified as the Aashmore Private Limited, a company led by Singapore-based Ashok Patni.</p>
<p>The CBI also said that it has sought a detailed report through Interpol on the role of Patni and Choudhrie. The reference from the Defence Ministry recently received by the CBI also cited the ongoing anti-corruption investigation into the company by SFO as well as red flags raised by HAL that conducted an internal probe after receiving several complaints.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014713&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">India will vote in favour of the resolution on Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council, the UPA government is learnt to have decided in possibly its last major foreign policy decision. The vote is expected on March 28 in Geneva.</span></p>
<p>This is the third time when Delhi has decided to vote in favour of the resolution, and sources said the decision has been taken in view of “diplomatic” as well as “political” considerations in mind.</p>
<p>While India is okay with the majority and substantive part of the text of the draft resolution UNHRC 25 which has been circulated in Geneva — accessed by The Indian Express — negotiators are working on softening the language of paragraph 8 of the resolution, which calls for the need for an “independent and credible international investigation” and “investigate alleged violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes”.</p>
<p>Sources said New Delhi has been quite favourable to the UNHRC resolution — moved by the US, the UK, Montenegro, Macedonia and Mauritius — as it highlights many of India’s concerns.</p>
<p>New Delhi is particularly pleased with the inclusion of the “13th amendment” in the resolution. Paragraph 6 of the motion says, “&#8230;encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to provide the Northern Provincial Council and its Chief Minister with the resources and authority necessary to govern, as required by the 13th Amendment of Sri Lanka’s constitution”.</p>
<p>India has been urging the Mahinda Rajapaksa government for the past five years — since the war against LTTE came to an end — that it was imperative for Sri Lanka to implement the 13th amendment to their constitution, which calls for devolution of powers to the provinces.</p>
<p>In fact, once Sri Lanka said it was willing to go beyond the 13th amendment, New Delhi latched on to that formulation and has been insisting on 13th amendment plus.</p>
<p>The draft resolution also talks about attacks on minorities in Sri Lanka, another area of growing concern in New Delhi. Paragraph 4 of the draft resolution says, “..urges the Government of Sri Lanka to investigate all attacks, by individuals and groups, on temples, mosques, and churches and to take steps to prevent future attacks; and calls on the Government of Sri Lanka to investigate and hold accountable perpetrators of attacks on places of worship, journalists, human rights defenders, members of religious minority groups, and other members of civil society.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014718&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jagdambika Pal, who recently quit the Congress to join the BJP, had managed the shift with great timing. While still in the Congress, he managed to get the HRD Ministry to announce a new Kendriya Vidyalaya in his constituency Domariyaganj in Uttar Pradesh, one of the last decisions taken by the UPA II Cabinet. Given the timing of his shift to the BJP, Pal has left the government no chance to withdraw the announcement.</p>
<p><strong>GRIM MOOD</strong></p>
<p>EVEN as the BJP witnesses what a witty leader described as a tussle between would-be-Prime Minister and would-have-been-Prime Minister, it has brought little cheer to the Congress camp. As per internal surveys commissioned by the ruling party, the BJP is estimated to secure “up to 180 seats” as against its own tally of 120 seats. Although the Left’s initiative to prop up a third front did not take off, Congress strategists believe they may still have “some chance” of playing a role in the formation of the next government if the BJP’s numbers were to be below 180 as indicated by its surveys. Not many in the ruling camp seem to share this optimism though.</p>
<p><strong>LOOKING AHEAD</strong></p>
<p>TOP bureaucrats these days are busy compiling a report for the next government to be formed in May after the elections. Cabinet Secretary Ajit Seth has asked all the central ministries to draw up a list of important schemes and other matters on which a decision needs to be taken in three months. Seth, who will be presenting the report card of the government before the next government, has also set a deadline of March 25 for all the secretaries to reply. He has also sought the details of the matters on which a cabinet decision is required so that it can be presented as soon as the first meeting of cabinet is convened.</p>
<p><strong>DECENT START</strong></p>
<p>A NEW entrant into the political field, actress Gul Panag, has already won some praise from the more experienced J&amp;K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah. Panag, who is the AAP candidate from Chandigarh and is active on social networks, has been liberally retweeting the posts of an account that apparently belongs to her BJP opponent Kirron Kher. This has got Panag a mention in Omar’s Twitter timeline. “Now if only Mehbooba Mufti would RT me the way @GulPanag is RT’ing @KirronKherBJP it would make for a much better political environment :-),” Abdullah tweeted on Thursday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014701&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Using medicinal herbs, scientists of Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University have developed a herbal drug to treat mastitis, a cattle disease widespread in India. Another drug they have developed treats cattle wounds. </span></p>
<p>Where the drugs differ from commercial products is that they leave no side-effects and cost much less.</p>
<p>Mastitis causes inflammation and abnormalities in the cattle’s udder area with symptoms like redness, swelling, hardness and pain at critical stage. The milk of infected animals turns watery, or even into flakes and clots that make it unfit for drinking.</p>
<p>Talking to The Indian Express, vice chancellor of GADVASU V K Taneja said, “In India, due to mastitis dairy farmers incur losses estimated at over Rs 7,000 crore annually. There are a number of medicines available but they all are chemical-based. A variety of germicides such as iodine, chlorhexidine, sodium hypochlorite, etc have been tried successfully as teat dips in preventing these infections. But one major concern that remains with these is the possible passing on of disinfectant residues into the milk. Hence, herbal drug as teat dip may be the best answer. Even WHO has emphasised the use of medicinal plants for curing mastitis as they are safer than synthetic drugs.”</p>
<p>While teat dips for mastitis in the market cost over Rs 500, the university estimates the price of its herbal drugs will be around Rs 300. The price of herbal ointment to heal wounds, too, will be around half that of synthetic alternatives.</p>
<p>Taneja added, “We have identified and evaluated some herbs for their antibacterial, anti-parasitic and fly repellent qualities. One such herb, evaluated in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration, was found to have antibacterial quality against common animal disease pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherchia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria and Bacillus cerius.”</p>
<p>Asked about plans to launch these products, he said, “We are looking for pharmaceutical companies who we can tie up with and launch these products commercially.”</p>
<p>During trials in the varsity dairy farm, the post-milking use of herbal teat dip was found effective in preventing clinical mastitis and in lowering occurrence of new intra-mammary infections.</p>
<p>“The presence of mastitis-causing organisms and drug residues of mastitis therapy in milk poses a threat to consumer health,” said Taneja.</p>
<p>The herbal ointment prevents contamination besides healing wounds in cattle and buffalo calves. Comparative trials with other herbal products showed that the time required to heal wounds with the two preparations was almost similar, indicating the high efficacy of the newly developed herbal product.</p>
<p>Work is also in progress on herbal disinfectants for animal sheds and hospitals. While common herbs like lemon-grass, aloe vera, turmeric and neem have been used in products, the university chooses not to disclose other “rare” herbs used as ingredients. “We have grown them in small quantities for trials in our herbal garden,” said Taneja.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014703&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[In mustard season, Kashmir notes it needs to produce more.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014700&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The yellow flowers have started to blossom at the first sign of warmth after a long spell of cold. Farmers of Kashmir are at work in their fields, which had been covered under snow during most of the winter.</p>
<p>“If you see these mustard fields, they look beautiful around this time. Winter here lasts six months and during that season no work takes place because of the snow. We have started working after six months,” says Mohammed Ismail of Bandipora.</p>
<p>The valley has been trying to meet an oilseed deficit by bringing more and more land under mustard cultivation. Agriculture department officials The Indian Express spoke to did not specify the demand-supply gap but said they expect six to seven quintals per hectare from 86,000 hectares, and projected a 20 per cent jump in yield since last year.</p>
<p>The snow that held up farming can also be a boon, because it means a better crop. The snowfall was particularly good in the winter just ended. “The snowfall this time was healthy, there was enough water for the fields and the produce will be good,” Ismail says.</p>
<p>“This will be Kashmir&#8217;s first produce from Kashmir after the winter,” he adds. That makes mustard a key crop and the government has taken up various measures to promote its cultivation and help farmers.</p>
<p>Altaf Andrabi, seed officer in the Department of Agriculture, says mustard growers get 33 per cent subsidy on the crop. “We have 86,000 hectares land under mustard cultivation, which yields six to seven quintals per hectare. We give 33 per cent of subsidies on high-yield varieties and this year we have provided farmers 1,200 quintals with Rs 8 lakh in subsidies to them,” Andrabi says.</p>
<p>Mustard is an annual crop. Sowing is done in the months of September and October. Once winter ends, the rising temperature causes the rapeseed-mustard crop to blossom, and harvesting is done in towards the end of May.</p>
<p>Mustard is sown as one half of double cropping. “Mustard is sown as a double crop with paddy and the variety sown is usually KoS 101,” Andrabi says.</p>
<p>Apart from its aesthetic value — tourists during the mustard season are fascinated by fields that turn the valley golden — mustard oil is used in most local dishes and is also consumed as it is considered good for health.</p>
<p>The medicinal values notwithstanding, not all farmers are keen to go for large-scale cultivation as the turnover is low in comparison to other crops.</p>
<p>“Mustard gives farmers just Rs 1,000, which in turn leads to less agricultural land under mustard,” says Andrabi, explaining why the the state has been struggling to meet its oil demand. “The state is already short in oilseed production and the yield from the mustard fields is low as cultivation is not extensive,” Andrabi says.</p>
<p>Farmers prefer to grow mustard only when the field is not occupied by other crops, or just before the paddy plantation season. It gives them the benefit of crop rotation, which replenishes the soil and prepares it for paddy cultivation, says Ghulam Nabi of Ganderbal.</p>
<p>India has nearly 4.5 million hectares under mustard production, followed by China, Canada, Poland, France and Pakistan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014700&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/veg.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014696" alt="Vegetables like coloured capsicum (above) are in high demand." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/veg.jpg" /></a> Vegetables like coloured capsicum (above) are in high demand.
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Punjab’s farmers are exporting vegetables with a GlobalGap certification, a declaration of better produce and a promise of higher profit.</span></p>
<p>The certificate is an acknowledgment of a good agricultural technique and has so far been given to four to five Punjab farmers, with some other aspirants in queue.</p>
<p>To get the brand name for their vegetables, farmers need to maintain hygiene standards for labourers, adopt specified agriculture methods, and ensure an annual audit is conducted by the company.</p>
<p>Retired IAS officer Karamvir Singh Sidhu is among those who has set the example. He has been exporting snow peas, sugar snaps and lady’s fingers to Australia, the UK and the Netherlands with the GlobalGap certification. This summer, he will export okra for the first time to Japan.</p>
<p>Sidhu, who has been farming since 2001 when he was still serving in Punjab, is now a wholetime progressive farmer at Lalgarh village in Patiala, having retired in 2012. Apart from farming on his 100 acres land, he also stocks up exotic vegetables collected from farmers of nearby areas and which he then exports. “I export exotic vegetables and had a turnover of about Rs 1.25 crore about five years ago. This year I am confident I will cross the Rs 5 crore mark,” says Sidhu.</p>
<p>Sidhu’s products are exported by Patiala Horticulture Private Ltd, of which he is the CEO. “As of now we have branded our peas Patiala Peas, while we are yet to brand our other vegetables. We maintain the books and use chemicals as per instructions of the company,” he says.</p>
<p>Some Namdhari farmers and a group of potato farmers in Jalandhar, too, have the GlobaGap certification.</p>
<p>A group of farmers from Mushkabad village in Ludhiana district is in the process of getting the certificate and they plan to export lady’s fingers and snow peas from next year. Davinder Singh, one of these farmers, says they are growing exotic vegetables which have seen a growth in demand not only in the domestic market but also abroad. The farmers do the grading and packing before sending the vegetables out in the market with the brand name Quality Veg Produce.</p>
<p>Meharbaan Singh, Sikander Singh and Lakhwinder Singh are in the same group growing vegetables. At the moment they are growing coloured capsicum, cucumber, green chillies in polyhouses, and they also engage in open farming of seasonal vegetables.</p>
<p>Davinder was honoured recently at a function organised by PAU Farmers’ Club for earning Rs 7 lakh per acre from his farm.</p>
<p>“We need to pick the vegetables from the fields 10 days before sending them out in the market in order to minimise chemical residue effects. These are the standards demanded by the companies that seek vegetables from us for export,” says Davinder. With the growing demand, even domestic buyers are seeking quality vegetables, he says. This has made certified vegetables or branded products a trend.</p>
<p>To encourage diversification, Punjab Energy Development Authority has a project of five pack houses, each built at Rs 1.08 crore, with two of these in Patiala and one each in Ludhiana, Hoshairpur and Gurdaspur. The power connections from Punjab State Electricity Power Corporation Ltd are, however, commercial ones while farmers are demanding connections under a special agriculture policy that would mean the tariff being slashed 30 per cent and the exemption of a minimum monthly charge. The pack houses have been given on lease to farmer societies for 20 years at Rs 20,000 per year. Says K S Pannu, secretary for agriculture, “We have taken up the matter with PSPCL so that the farmers can get agriculture connections instead of commercial connections.”</p>
<p>Though farmers grow exotic vegetables for export as well as for the domestic market after maintaining the required standards, they get subsidies from PEDA and Punjab Agro for freight, packaging and getting an annual audit done from companies. Only farmers who maintain their books regularly and send monthly information to PEDA or Punjab Agro qualify for both central and state subsidies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014691&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Upping the ante against Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, IAS officer Pradeep Sharma on Thursday moved the High Court seeking direction to file an FIR against him in the snooping scandal involving a young woman architect.</p>
<p>&#8220;The petition will come up for hearing in a day or two,&#8221; said Amrish Patel, Sharma&#8217;s lawyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The petition demands the court&#8217;s direction to the state authorities to lodge an FIR and hold a fair inquiry against the Chief Minister,&#8221; Patel said.</p>
<p>Sharma had earlier approached the Sector-7 police station of Gandhinagar, seeking registration of FIR against Modi, BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate, for ordering illegal surveillance of the woman.</p>
<p>But police refused to file the FIR.</p>
<p>&#8220;As per the recent judgement of the Supreme Court, police can not refuse to lodge a complaint,&#8221; Sharma&#8217;s petition said.</p>
<p>Investigative news portals Cobrapost.com and Gulail.com had claimed, on the basis of taped conversations, that Modi&#8217;s confidante and former minister Amit Shah had ordered the illegal surveillance at the behest of &#8220;the Saheb&#8221; in 2009.</p>
<p>Sharma, a 1984-batch IAS officer who is facing six criminal cases in the state, has claimed he is being victimised by the BJP government for his knowledge of the &#8220;intimacy&#8221; shared by Modi with the young woman.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014615&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Thursday said the Congress was like a sinking ship with everybody in it trying to escape to a safer destination.</p>
<p>Addressing a rally organised in favour of Akali-BJP alliance candidate Manpreet Singh Ayali at a grain market on Gill Road in Ludhiana, Badal said the Congress had always played a role of a spoiler by ignoring emotional demands of Punjabis.</p>
<p>Punjab had always faced step-motherly treatment from successive Congress governments at the Centre, he alleged.</p>
<p>Badal said the people have accepted NDA&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi as the next PM of the country, that is why most Congress leaders are upset.</p>
<p>Lashing out at Congress, he said party vice president Rahul Gandhi is no match for Modi. He compared Rahul with a person who had not even cleared a learner&#8217;s driving licence test.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modi will be the next Prime Minister, it is the writing on the wall,&#8221; the Chief Minister said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014614&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/k-wife-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014602" alt="Ammal, 84, has been given an option to present her case through an authorised legal representative, in case she cannot come herself." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/k-wife-m.jpg" /></a> Ammal, 84, has been given an option to present her case through an authorised legal representative, in case she cannot come herself.
<p>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued fresh summons to DMK chief K Karunanidhi&#8217;s wife Dayalu Ammal in connection with its money laundering probe in the 2G spectrum allocation case.</p>
<p>Ammal, 84, has been given an option to present her case through an authorised legal representative, in case she cannot come herself and answer questions of agency sleuths on March 28 here, sources said.</p>
<p>The agency, they said, wants to investigate the role of Ammal with regard to alleged channelling of Rs 200 crore to the DMK family-run Kalaignar TV through a circuitous route in which her daughter Kanimozhi and MD of the TV group Sharad Kumar are also accused.</p>
<p>The DMK supremo&#8217;s wife has, however, denied any wrongdoing in this case.</p>
<p>A charge sheet in this case, under provisions of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), is pending at present.</p>
<p>The agency has already questioned Kanimozhi and former Telecom Minister A Raja in this regard.</p>
<p>Both the DMK leaders and others have been questioned by ED about the alleged transfer of Rs 200 crore to the TV channel, in which Kanimozhi and Sharad Kumar each hold 20 per cent stake.</p>
<p>ED had earlier also scrutinised documents related to both the DMK MPs&#8217; incomes, properties and personal investments.</p>
<p>It had also initiated attachment proceedings under PMLA against other individuals and certain telecom firms involved in the case.</p>
<p>Besides the cases of Raja and Kanimozhi, a similar probe is underway under the provisions of the anti-money laundering Act against Asif Balwa, Director of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd, Rajeev Agarwal and Karim Murani of Cineyug Films (Pvt) Ltd.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014597&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/karat-medd.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014600" alt="Karat said the four Left parties would jointly contest around 100 Lok Sabha seats across the country. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/karat-medd.jpg" /></a> Karat said the four Left parties would jointly contest around 100 Lok Sabha seats across the country.
<p>CPI(M) on Thursday exuded confidence that Left and regional parties would pool in their respective strengths after the upcoming general elections in their bid to form a non-Congress, anti-BJP government.</p>
<p>&#8220;We (Left and regional parties) have earlier decided to fight both Congress and BJP. We are going together&#8230;We are working to maximise our strengths and seats in respective states or areas of strength. A concrete shape will emerge after the elections,&#8221; CPI(M) General Secretary Prakash Karat told a press conference.</p>
<p>To a spate of questions on the proposed front to be forged by 11 regional and Left parties to form a government at the Centre, he said, &#8220;We will pool in our resources and strengths after the elections&#8230;that is going to happen.&#8221;<br />
Karat was speaking to reporters after releasing CPI(M)&#8217;s poll manifesto which focused on strengthening the Left and projecting a secular and democratic alternative by &#8220;rejecting Congress and defeating BJP&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asked whether these parties would have electoral understanding or seat adjustments among themselves, he said, &#8220;We said we are coming together (against Congress and BJP)&#8230; this is not predicated with our having any electoral understanding or an alliance (with regional parties).&#8221;</p>
<p>He said CPI(M) had tried to forge an alliance with the ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu but &#8220;that has not happened.&#8221; To a question on the Federal Front idea floated by Trinamool Congress, Karat categorically said, &#8220;That is not going to come about.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the four Left parties would jointly contest around 100 Lok Sabha seats across the country. Karat rejected the contention that the walkout of RSP&#8217;s Kerala unit from the Left Democratic Front in the state would have an impact on the overall Left unity. &#8220;Just because one state unit (of RSP) has defected, it doesn&#8217;t mean that RSP is not there. This unit has defected earlier too.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Prime Ministerial candidate, he said, &#8220;In principle, we are against a PM candidate. We are parties state-based parties&#8230;it is wrong to project any one leader.&#8221;  On the projection of Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi, Karat, without naming them, said, &#8220;It is clear that the elections are being projected as a battle between certain leaders or personalities but devoid of major issues and policies afflicting the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He attacked Congress for its &#8220;record of misrule, striking failure in containing price rise or generating employment despite claiming a high rate of growth, unprecedented corruption and mega scams and failure to improve the lives of the people.&#8221; In the same breath, he took on BJP saying the saffron party was &#8220;not only not an alternative to Congress, but a retrograde and reactionary alternative.&#8221;</p>
<p>BJP had shown &#8220;its record of corruption&#8221; in states like Karnataka, he said, adding it was the NDA government which started the process of deregulating prices of petrol products. &#8220;On all the major range of issues, on economic policies, question of tackling price rise, BJP has nothing new or different to offer. It did not oppose the doubling of KG basin natural gas prices and neither retrieved the moneys which have been stacked abroad. In fact, the Mauritius route was pioneered during the NDA government and vigorously persued by the UPA government,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What we are arguing is what the country needs is an alternative based on alternative policies,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014592&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malaysian consul general in India Mohamed Hatimi Abas categorically denied on Thursday that his government had hidden any fact about the missing Malaysian Airline aircraft, during his visit to Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a wrong perception about our government. Since there were many possiblities linked to the plane&#8217;s fate, people took it otherwise. But, I want to tell you that we never tried to hide anything from the people,&#8221; Abas said on Thursday during his interaction with reporters at the Malaysia Services Exhibition.</p>
<p>He assured that the Malaysian government is doing everything possible. &#8220;Just like Indians, several Malaysian nationals were also on board the plane. My government is serious about the situation. Thus, we have sought help from more than 20 countries to find the missing aircraft,&#8221; Abas said.</p>
<p>Five Indians and a Canadian of Indian-origin were among the 239 people on board flight MH370, when it disappeared over the South China Sea, an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014594&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian Mujahideen (IM) co-founder Yasin Bhatkal and his aide Asadullah Akhtar were today denied bail by a court here in connection with a September 2008 Delhi serial blasts case.</p>
<p>Additional Sessions Judge Daya Prakash dismissed the bail plea of both the accused while allowing the application of special cell of Delhi Police seeking 15 days time to complete their probe against them in the case relating to a blast at M block market in Greater Kailash-I here on September 13, 2008.</p>
<p>The court also issued production warrants for presence of both the accused, who are presently in Mumbai under custody of Maharashtra ATS, before it on April 3.</p>
<p>The special cell, in its plea seeking 15 days more time to conclude their probe, said that an important input has been received through the central intelligence agencies regarding detention of one more suspect, who was also involved in the case, in a west Asian country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Necessary coordination is being established with central intelligence agencies to confirm the identity of this suspect so that necessary legal information for his extradition/ deportation can be taken up expeditiously,&#8221; police said.</p>
<p>They also informed the court that during investigation, Akhtar has revealed vital information about Ariz Khan, one of the wanted accused in the case, and an operation was going on to apprehend him.</p>
<p>During the hearing, advocate M S Khan, appearing for both the accused, moved an application seeking bail.</p>
<p>&#8220;A question arises for consideration that whether period of investigation can be extended from 90 days to any period not exceeding 180 days under section 43-D of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in the absence of accused,&#8221; Khan said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014582&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/naveenpatnaikm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013247 " alt="Patnaik, who is also president of the ruling BJD, filed four sets of nomination papers. (Express Archive)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/naveenpatnaikm.jpg" /></a> Naveen chose to renominate rebel MLA Prabhat Biswal who had played a key role in the 2012 &#8216;coup&#8217; against him. (Express Archive)
<p>Chief Minister and Biju Janata Dal chief Naveen Patnaik on Thursday announced the fourth list of party candidates for 41 assembly and seven Lok Sabha seats, dropping nine sitting MLAs and an MP. BJD has so far announced candidates for 111 Assembly and 17 Lok Sabha seats out of the 147 assembly and 21 Lok Sabha seats in the State.</p>
<p>Naveen chose to renominate rebel MLAs like Prabhat Biswal who had played a key role in the May 2012 &#8216;coup&#8217; against him, which was allegedly engineered by Rajya Sabha MP Pyari Mohan Mohapatra. Prabhat Biswal was again renominated for Choudwar Cuttack. Earlier, Naveen had renominated Sarada Nayak for Rourkela assembly seat though Nayak was one of the conspirators of the 2012 coup.</p>
<p>A few prominent leaders among the names announced today are sitting Kendrapara MP Baijayant &#8216;Jay&#8217; Panda, Cuttack MP Bhartruhari Mahtab, Bhadrak MP Arjun Sethi, Dhenkanal MP Tathagat Satpathy and Puri MP Pinaki Mishra. In Balasore, where the BJD in 2009 did not field a candidate, he nominated former corporate honcho Rabindra Jena, who worked at Balasore Alloys. In the tribal-dominated Mayurbhanj constituency, he dropped sitting MP Laxman Tudu and nominated sitting MLA Ramchandra Hansda.</p>
<p>Naveen is yet to declare the candidates for Bhubaneswar, Jajpur, Keonjhar and Jagatsinghpur Lok Sabha seats. For assembly election too, he is yet to decide on several key constituencies of Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur and Balasore Lok Sabha constituencies where former minister Prafulla Ghadei, former law minister Raghunath Mohanty and health minister Damodar Rout are expecting BJD nomination.</p>
<p>And also for the assembly elections, Naveen has retained most of the sitting MLAs including law and culture minister Maheswar Mohanty, Brahmagiri MLA Sanjay Dasverma, Pipili MLA Pradeep Maharathy, Chilika MLA Raghunath Sahoo, forest minister and Badamba MLA Devi Mishra, labour minister Bijoyshree Routray. Among the few MLAs dropped were Siddharth Singh of Khandapara assembly.</p>
<p>Incidentally, on Thursday Naveen recalled newly-elected Rajya Sabha MP A U Singhdeo to contest the Bolangir assembly seat in place of his political secretary Harekrishna Sarangi. Sarangi was given a BJD ticket 2 days ago. Naveen had to recall Singh Deo in the face of protest by his party workers. Soon after Sarangi was fielded from Bolangir, BJD led by Jyoti Panigrahy, former chairperson of state commission for women, staged dharna in front of the chief minister&#8217;s residence.</p>
<p>Two days ago, Naveen had to renominate nine-time MLA from V Sugnani Kumari Deo after party workers revolted against nomination of Latika Pradhan for the Kabisurya Nagar assembly seat of Ganjam district.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014558&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>West Bengal Pradesh Congress president Adhir Chowdhury on Thursday accused ruling Trinamool Congress of trying to prevent AICC vice president Rahul Gandhi from holding meeting in the state by denying permission for the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted Rahul Gandhi to come here on March 25. He also agreed. We wanted to hold meeting at Netaji Indoor Stadium, but we were told that it was booked. &#8220;We sought permission to hold meeting at the Park Circus maidan but they said that government places could not be given (for such meeting),&#8221; he alleged.</p>
<p>He claimed on the other hand, the ruling party was holding political activity everyday in government places. &#8220;If the ruling party prevents Rahul Gandhi from coming to the state by misusing power, it is a matter of regret,&#8221; Chowdhury, also Union Minister of State for Railways, said.</p>
<p>Refuting the charge, sources in TMC-controlled Kolkata Municipal Corporation, said that according to the instruction of the Election Commission, parks could not be given for holding political meetings.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014469&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/advanim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014233" alt="Election Committee, headed by Singh,decided to field Advani from Gandhinagar, angering leader who wanted to shift to Bhopal." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/advanim.jpg" /></a> Election Committee, headed by Singh,decided to field Advani from Gandhinagar, angering leader who wanted to shift to Bhopal.
<p>BJP on Thursday gave indications of yielding to sulking L K Advani&#8217;s demand for shifting from Gandhinagar to Bhopal with party chief Rajnath Singh saying the patriarch should choose where to contest, a statement which raised hopes of an early resolution to the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the choice of Advaniji to choose from where he wants to contest,&#8221; Singh told a press conference in Chennai when asked to comment on Advani&#8217;s unwillingness to contest from Gujarat as decided by the Central Election Committee (CEC) on Friday.</p>
<p>Singh said that after the CEC decision on Wednesday a proposal from the Gujarat unit that Advani contest from Gandhinagar, he had received a proposal from Madhya Pradesh unit inviting Advani contest from Bhopal. &#8220;Then I left this option to Advani as to which is the seat from where he would like to contest from &#8212; Gandhinagar or Bhopal,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The statement by Singh, who is likely to meet Advani tonight in Delhi after his return from Chennai, has raised hopes of resolving the problem that the party has encountered since on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Election Committee, headed by Rajnath Singh, on Wednesday decided to field Advani from Gandhinagar, angering the 86-year-old leader who wanted to shift to Bhopal. His desire  to shift from Modi-ruled Gujarat to Bhopal is seen as a reflection of his unease with the party&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate.</p>
<p>Since then, the party has been trying to placate Advani, with even Modi driving to his residence this morning. Subsequently, some other leaders, including Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley and Venkaiah Naidu also met Advani.<br />
Modi also met RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat here last night after which some RSS leaders are believed to have talked to Advani as well as Rajnath Singh. The BJP President said there is no confusion in the party on the issue at all. &#8220;All things which are coming (in the press) are absolutely imaginary,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014543&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/par-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014499" alt="60 MPs from Lok Sabha and 35 from Rajya Sabha did not either participate in debates." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/par-med.jpg" /></a> 60 MPs from Lok Sabha and 35 from Rajya Sabha did not either participate in debates.
<p>Fisticuffs, mike breaking, pepper spraying-the most recent incident, are some of the scenes float before eyes the moment one hears the word ‘Parliament’. And, what about the parliamentarians? They are the elements of this unprecedented chaos. However, not everyone is the same. There are some MPs follow the dictum “Silence is golden” and hardly speak or raise any questions during proceedings in the House. According to the PRS Legislative Research, over 60 MPs from Lok Sabha and 35 from Rajya Sabha did not either participate in debates, private member&#8217;s bills or pose any question. Let us take a note of these 10 well-known MPs who keep themselves tight-lipped in the five years of their terms, as compiled by PRS Legislative Research.</p>
<p><strong>Rahul Gandhi</strong>: The scion of Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, Rahul Gandhi is one of the politicians from whom a lot is expected. He comes from the most powerful political family of India, the Nehru Family and has as a huge burden of expectation as three of his predecessors have already occupied the prestigious Prime Ministerial post of India. At present, he is representing the constituency of Amethi and also the Vice President of the Indian National Congress. But, as legislators he failed to raise even one developmental question during the proceedings of the House. Though he still has a long way to go, he needs to be more active as far as his involvement in the Parliament goes.</p>
<p><strong>Lal Krishna Advani</strong>: BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani, who will be contesting in the upcoming general elections from Gujarat&#8217;s Gandhinagar constituency, is also one such political leaders who hardly raised any question during his tenure as MP. As a successful leader, he has served for 6 years in the Central Government as the post of Deputy prime minister and Home Minister. Advani was the Leader of the Opposition in the 10th Lok Sabha and 14th Lok Sabha. This veteran Indian political leader began his political career as a volunteer of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu nationalist organization.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Gandhi</strong>: UPA Chairperson, Sonia Gandhi has not participated in any parliament debate since 2006, the records in a website proves it. Ever since UPA came to power, she rarely spoke in parliament, limiting herself to speech on felicitations. The only issue based debate she has participated ever since her party came to power is “Discussion on National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill, 2004.” Also taking into account the number of questions asked, zero questions were asked by her from the time she stepped in LS career. However, it was Sonia who instrumented Congress to rise back to power in 2004. In the coming polls, she will be contesting from Rae Bareli constituency in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p><strong>Mulayam Singh</strong>: Samajwadi Party Chief and Former CM of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav who had always kicked up controversies are mostly known for delivering many misogynist statements. But he is often mum when it comes to question hour in parliament sessions. If not for asking questions, he is often in the limelight for publicly criticizing the BJP Prime Ministerial Candidate Narendra Modi over Gujarat riots in 2002 or for condemning the present ruling government over many issues related to the country. This Samajwadi supremo is all set to contest from two seats for 2014 polls—from Mainpuri and Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p><strong>Jaswant Singh</strong>: BJP’s senior leader, Jaswant Singh has held many portfolios in the national cabinet including Finance, External Affairs and Defence during the NDA regime. Singh is a self-described liberal democrat even though the Bharatiya Janata Party is often described as a right-wing nationalist organization. Though he is known for his moderate political views, he hardly raised any relevant issues related to India&#8217;s security in the parliament. This former National Democratic Alliance will be contesting Lok Sabha elections from Darjeeling, West Bengal.</p>
<p><strong>Shibu Soren</strong>: Former Chief Minister of Jharkhand, Morcha Shibu Soren was the first serving Union minister to be convicted for murder of his former private secretary, Shashi Nath Jha in 1994. He allegedly did so to cover up a case of corruption and sodomy. He represented the Dumka constituency of Jharkhand in the 14th Lok Sabha and is the President of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) political party, a constituent of the UPA. The politico who hogged limelight for the wrong reason too failed to speak up in a parliament proceedings.</p>
<p><strong>Kalyan Singh</strong>: The Bharatiya Janata Party leader, Kalyan Singh has served three times as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. During his tenure as a CM, Singh and his government are always under the scrutiny of Liberhan Commission for pre-planned manner events, misuse of power, attracting youth for support and allowing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to run the state government directly. Later in January 2010, he announced the formation of a new Hindutva-oriented political party, the Jan Kranti Party, but chose to take the role of patron while his son became the leader.</p>
<p><strong>HD Deve Gowda:</strong> Former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda has not asked a single question in the 15th Lok Sabha so far. The five-year term is ending in about three months. The supremo of the Janata Dal (S), presently representing Hassan as an MP, has surprised political observers by posing no queries through this tumultuous term. “As a former prime minister, I can’t ask starred or unstarred questions,” Deve Gowda said, in his defense. (A question listed with an asterix or star gets a verbal answer in parliament. An unstarred question gets a written reply from the minister concerned, and is open to supplementary queries), reports Indian Express.</p>
<p><strong>Chandrasekhar Rao</strong>: Telangana Rashtra Samithi Chief, K Chandrasekhar Rao is the main force behind the creation of the new state. This leader stresses that people of the both states could flourish with cooperation and said Seemandhra people who are in Telangana &#8220;are our brothers and sisters&#8221;. Rao who is a Member of Parliament from the Mahaboobnagar constituency of Andhra Pradesh hardly raised any queries in the House and as such included in this list.</p>
<p><strong>Satabdi Roy</strong>: Actress turned politician Satabdi Roy has also come up in the list of the politician who did not raise queries in the house. She has been serving as a Member of Parliament from the Birbhum constituency in West Bengal since 2009. Prior to joining politics, she is an actress, director and teacher of acting in the Bengali language film industry as well as an author of poetry in Bengali.</p>
<p>Roy made her film debut in the film called Atanka, directed by Tapan Sinha, which was released in 1986. More recently she acted in Fight 1:1, released in 2011. In the upcoming polls, she will be fighting on All Indian Trinamool Congress ticket.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014497&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/assam-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014481" alt="The other two phases of polling in Assam are on April 12 and April 24." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/assam-med.jpg" /></a> The other two phases of polling in Assam are on April 12 and April 24.
<p>Assam will go for polling next month with presence of over 235 companies of security forces from both the state and Centre.</p>
<p>The security agencies have identified many districts in the state as critical and have decided to increase presence of forces by one to eight companies in each district compared to the 2009 elections.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have finalised the plan for security deployment. For the elections in three phases in Assam, we will have a total of at least 235 companies on ground only to manage the polls,&#8221; Assam&#8217;s Additional Director General of Police (Law and Order) Ajit Prasad Rout said.</p>
<p>Out of these, over 100 companies will be from the Assam  Police, he said. &#8220;We currently have 122 companies of central forces in Assam. From there, 77 companies will be deployed for the elections. In addition, we will get 58 more companies from the Centre,&#8221; Rout said.</p>
<p>Of the new companies, ten would be from CISF, 14 from SSB, six from ITBP and 20 companies from the state police forces of Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim, he said.</p>
<p>Rout said all forces will arrive by today as area allotments, flag march and some other related works need to be completed before the polling starts on April 7. The other two phases of polling in Assam are on April 12 and April 24.</p>
<p>Usually there are 100 personnel in one company, but it may vary in some cases.  Asked about security arrangements in the 2009 elections, Rout said, &#8220;We had 209 companies of central forces and around 100 companies of the Assam Police. However, it was a two phase election that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He further said this time, each district will be having one to eight more companies of forces for a smooth polling compared to 2009. &#8220;Some districts have been identified as critical on account of recent incidents. These include Sonitpur, Kokrajhar and Chirang. We will have more presence in such districts,&#8221; the ADG said.</p>
<p>On security threat from militant organisations, Rout said ULFA has gone weaker and hence police has an upper hand. &#8220;Militancy in Dima Hasao district has also gone down. Only NDFB is evenly poised. Overall, we are better placed this time,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>During the polling phases, BSF and SSP for Bhutan border will be alerted to keep strict vigil, he said. With 4.5 lakh first time voters, Assam will see a total of 1.87 crore people exercising their rights to elect the representatives during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>The number of voters this year constitute 57.25 per cent of Assam&#8217;s total population and it has gone up by 13 lakh from 1.74 crore voters in the last Lok Sabha elections of 2009. The elections will be held in 24,275 polling stations across the state, an increase of 28.93 per cent from 18,828 booths in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014472&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maya-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014489" alt="Mayawati said that she has already gone with the saffron party in the state and would not do it again as there had been no change in its ideology." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maya-med.jpg" /></a> Mayawati said that she has already gone with the saffron party in the state and would not do it again as there had been no change in its ideology.
<p>Bahujan Samaj Party will field candidates in all 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh and will not go with &#8220;communal&#8221; BJP and its allies for government formation, its supremo Mayawati said on .</p>
<p>Releasing BSP&#8217;s list of all candidates in the state in one instalment &#8220;unlike political opponents&#8221;, she said her party is contesting the elections with full preparation to &#8220;emerge as the balance of power at the Centre&#8221;. &#8220;Once we emerge as balance of power, we will take the help of only secular parties for forming the government,&#8221; the BSP supremo said.</p>
<p>On BJP with whose support she had formed the government in UP thrice, Mayawati said that she has already gone with the saffron party in the state and would not do it again as there had been no change in its ideology.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have tried BJP thrice in UP and there has not been any change in their thinking and ideology. When we were in a coalition we ran the government as per our ideology and once they tried to interfere in it we opted out,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Instead of issues like unemployment, corruption and poverty, the coming elections appear to be a contest between two ideologies of communalism and secularism,&#8221; she said, adding that most parties have fielded their candidates keeping this fact in mind.</p>
<p>The former chief minister asserted that her party would fight the coming polls with all its strength to check communal parties from coming to power and, at the same time, said that Congress-led UPA which has &#8220;failed on all fronts&#8221; should not be allowed to return. Asked whether she would take the help of Samajwadi Party for government formation, she said that BSP does not consider it as a secular party.</p>
<p>&#8220;SP government&#8217;s tenure in Uttar Pradesh so far has been really bad specially on the law and order and development front&#8230; so there would be every effort to ensure that this time the right party leads the government at the Centre on the policy of &#8216;Sarvjan Hitai Sarvjan Sukhai (for the benefit and happiness of all),&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>On the candidature of BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi and SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav from Varanasi and Azamgarh respectively, she said, &#8220;her party believes that the decision of both contesting from Purvanchal is the result of a well planned internal understanding.</p>
<p>She alleged that such a &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; was to give the contest a communal colour, and appealed to people to ensure that the communal forces are not be allowed to win.</p>
<p>Through media, she also requested the Chief Election Commissioner to keep a close watch on the campaigning of the two as &#8220;they could spoil the atmosphere of the country&#8221;.</p>
<p>Replying to a question, Mayawati ruled out having any talks with Trinamool Congress&#8217; Mamata Banerjee or AIADMK&#8217;s Jayalalithaa saying that since her party is contesting on its own there was no question of any discussion.</p>
<p>Advising her cadres to desist from &#8220;Manuvadi&#8221; media campaign, she took strong exception to reports in a section that she would be entering into the contest from Lalganj (reserved) seat adjacent to Azamgarh from where Mulayam Singh is in the fray.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not aware that I am going to contest from Lalganjseat (in Azamgarh) and party leaders Satish Chandra Mishra or Naseemuddin Siddiqui from Varansi and Azamgarh seats respectively, I contradict such news items published in a section of media&#8221;, she said.</p>
<p>On the occasion, she released the list of names of candidates for all 80 seats in UP which she said have been decided keeping in mind the representation of all sections of society and their support to the party.</p>
<p>&#8220;On 17 reserved seats, different castes of SCs have been fielded, 15 backwards, 19 Muslims while 29 upper castes including 21 Brahmins and eight Kshatriya have been given tickets,&#8221; Mayawati said, adding that seven women have also been fielded.</p>
<p>She said her party would also field candidates in other states where the movement and the organisation has come into being and their lists would be announced soon.</p>
<p>Mayawati would begin her campaign all over the country from March 22 and devote 90 per cent of her time in UP where she would address the first meeting in Bijnore on April 3. The BSP, which does not issue poll manifestos like other parties, instead issued 24 page booklet in the form of Mayawati&#8217;s appeal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014462&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Observing that Maharashtra government cannot neglect the damage caused to persons during the August 2012 Azad Maidan riots, the Bombay High Court on Thursday sought to know if an amount has been fixed towards damage caused to public property as well as persons.</p>
<p>A division bench of Justices N H Patil and Anuja Prabhudessai was hearing a public interest litigation filed by one Sanket Satope seeking direction to the government to arrive at an amount and recover it from organisers of the rally at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai during which the riot took place.</p>
<p>Additional public prosecutor Aruna Kamat Pai informed the court that the collector&#8217;s office has arrived at an amount of Rs 2.75 crores as damages to public property.</p>
<p>&#8220;The collector&#8217;s office is conducting an inquiry against over 70 accused and 964 witnesses,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The court, however, observed that while the collector has estimated the cost of damage caused to public property, the loss caused due to personal injuries have not been considered. &#8220;According to the police report, 76 police officials, two fire brigade officials and four media persons suffered injuries during the riots. Have you (collector&#8217;s office) assessed the cost of this damage? Injuries to persons have been neglected,&#8221; Justice Patil said.</p>
<p>The bench observed that under section 51(3) of the Maharashtra Police Act, a district magistrate is duty bound to independently inquire into the damage caused to both property and persons. &#8220;Has this been done? Has a magistrate inquired into this and arrived at an amount? What steps has the state government taken to recover this amount?&#8221; the court asked.</p>
<p>The bench has directed the prosecutor to take instructions on this and posted the petition for hearing after two weeks.</p>
<p>A total of 62 persons were arrested by the city crime branch for their alleged role in the riots at Azad Maidan in south Mumbai on August 11, 2012.</p>
<p>Two youths were killed and 52, including 44 policemen, injured on August 11 when a rally called to protest alleged atrocities on Muslims in Assam and Myanmar turned violent.</p>
<p>The protesters went on a rampage, attacking police, media persons and vehicles.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014441&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>RJD President Lalu Prasad, touring the Pataliputra constituency has hit out strongly at his former close aide Ramkripal Yadav for joining BJP.</p>
<p>Prasad held a public rally at Bikram, 40 km Southwest of capital Patna, late last evening to garner support for RJD candidate and her eldest daughter Misa Bharti.</p>
<p>The rally was followed by a road show in near by Bihta.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has taken refuge with the communal forces, forgetting everything. He has compromised with the philosophy of  social justice and joined those whom he always opposed. The public is not going to forgive him,&#8221; said Prasad.</p>
<p>This was first visit of the RJD chief to Patliputra constituency in rural Patna after declaration of candidatures of Misa Bharti, his friend-turned-foe Ramkripal Yadav (BJP) and sitting MP Ranjan Yadav (JD-U) for the seat.</p>
<p>Fighting a major challenge in her electoral debut, Misa Bharti expressed angry reaction against &#8220;uncle&#8221; Ramkripal Yadav.</p>
<p>&#8220;He showed disrespect by not meeting me when I went to his residence in New Delhi to give up my seat for him. I hope the people of Pataliputra will give him a befitting reply for this,&#8221; she said addressing the meeting with her father Lalu Prasad on the dais.</p>
<p>The public meeting saw Prasad taking recourse to his oft quoted &#8216;secularism versus communal forces&#8217; speech. He pointed out that the BJP has joined hands with parties like Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navanirman Sena (MNS), which have allegedly victimized the people of Bihar working in Mumbai.</p>
<p>Pataliputra poll battle is being considered as the biggest battle by Prasad on his comeback trail, besides Chhapra, from where his wife and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi is contesting against Rajiv Pratap Rudy of the BJP.</p>
<p>Pataliputra which will go to poll on April 17 is seen as the &#8216;battle of honour&#8217; for Prasad. He had contested the seat in 2009 and lost to Ranjan Yadav.</p>
<p>The RJD chief, who has been debarred from contesting elections following conviction in a fodder scam case, has said he would spend last days of polling in Patliputra and Chhapra constituencies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014435&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/khushwantsinghm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014431" alt="Khushwant Singh wrote on as diverse issues as poetry and politics. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/khushwantsinghm.jpg" /></a> Khushwant Singh wrote on as diverse issues as poetry and politics. (Reuters)
<p>One of India&#8217;s best-known authors and journalists, Khushwant Singh elevated English writing in India with uninhibited wit and humour and was equally facile with his pen on serious issues like partition in the classic &#8216;Train to Pakistan&#8217;.</p>
<p>He ruled the literary pages with his satirical take on contemporary issues but attracted controversy over what his critics called his obsession with writing on sex.</p>
<p>Easily switching roles between author, commentator and journalist, Singh wrote on as diverse issues as poetry and politics.</p>
<p>He began his dealings with media as information officer of the Government of India in Toronto and Canada and was Press attaché and public officer for the High Commission in the United Kingdom and the Embassy in Ireland in 1948-50.</p>
<p>Later he started his writing career with Yojana, the Planning Commission&#8217;s journal which he founded and edited.</p>
<p>Singh left a mark in the field of journalism, working as editor of the now-defunct Illustrated Weekly of India, the National Herald and the Hindustan Times. His weekly column &#8216;With Malice Towards One and All&#8217; was so popular that it was syndicated in many dailies till a few years ago when failing health checked his prolific writing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a gap of 47 years, the Communist Party of India (CPI) has jumped into poll fray sans alliance with non-Left parties in the Union Territory and announced the candidature of R Viswanathan for the April 24 Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>Secretary of the party&#8217;s state unit and a four-time MLA, R Viswanathan has been fielded as its nominee for the lone<br />
Lok Sabha seat in Puducherry, joining the multi-cornered contest.</p>
<p>65-year old Viswanathan, who was Agriculture Minister in the DMK led coalition ministry in 1996, was earlier an<br />
employee in a cooperative milk producers society and also worked in the government-owned Sri Bharathi Mills in Puducherry.</p>
<p>He was enrolled as a member of the CPI here in 1968 when the late veteran freedom fighter and labour leader V Subbiah was the head of the party here.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014382&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tewari-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014390" alt="Tewari, who has been absent from his constituency since February end, had apparently taken ill and was admitted in a Delhi hospital. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tewari-med.jpg" /></a> Tewari, who has been absent from his constituency since February end, had apparently taken ill and was admitted in a Delhi hospital.
<p>The Congress on Thursday indicated that sitting MP and Union Minister Manish Tewari will be contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Ludhiana.  Shakeel Ahmed, secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs, said, “If he is medically fit, then there is no reason for him not to contest.”</p>
<p>Tewari, who has been absent from his constituency since February end, had apparently taken ill and was admitted in a Delhi hospital. Tewari had even conveyed to the high command that they could find a new face for the city as he was advised rest, sources said.</p>
<p>However, yesterday morning, a number of Congress leaders from Ludhiana went to Delhi to meet Tewari and convince him to contest from Ludhiana.<br />
Today Tewari was greeted by workers and senior leaders at his Delhi house, where he announced that he was ready to put up a tough fight against rivals despite his ‘ill health’, and would be in the city in a day or two.</p>
<p>Tewari had campaigned for a  day in the last week of February, when he had also met Congress  leaders from rural areas. Sources said that workers had expressed their grievances at that meeting, saying that the minister had hardly interacted with them in the past five  years. Tewari apologised to them. After that, Tewari was not seen  in Ludhiana.</p>
<p>The leaders who went to meet him in Delhi included district Congress committee urban and rural presidents Pawan Dewan and Malkiat Singh Dakha, senior leader K K Bawa and many others. They said, “We are happy that Tewari is fit to contest the elections and now rivals are in real trouble. The real game will start now.” SAD leader Manpreet Singh Ayali’s campaign was till now directed at Tewari’s absence. He had claimed that Tewari had already accepted defeat by running away from the scene.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014384&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though NCP managed to swap the Raigad Lok Sabha constituency with Congress, its high profile candidate and Maharashtra water resources minister Sunil Tatkare may not have a cakewalk during the elections.</p>
<p>Tatkare is locked in a tough battle with five-time MP Anant Gite of Shiv Sena, former police officer Sanjay Apranti of AAP and PWP&#8217;s Ramesh Kadam &#8211; an ex-NCP MLA. Congress stalwart A R Antulay is sulking because the seat swap happened without consulting him since he represented the constituency for four terms. However, party sources say he will not harm interests of the ruling alliance candidate.</p>
<p>Raigad constituency, about 130 kms away from Mumbai, has six Assembly segments &#8211; Pen, Alibaug, Shrivardhan, Mahad, Dapoli and Guhaghar. Pen and Shrivardhan were earlier part of the erstwhile Kolaba constituency while Mahad, Dapoli and Guhaghar were in Ratnagiri Lok Sabha constituency. The Pen and Alibaug Assembly segments are with Peasants and Workers Party (PWP), Mahad and Dapoli with Shiv Sena, Shrivardhan and Guhaghar with NCP.</p>
<p>Tatkare is legislator from Shrivardhan while state NCP chief Bhaskar Jadhav represents Guhaghar. Over the years, Congress has lost its hold over the region. &#8220;Tatkare is not even a leader of his own district and not on good terms with his own party men Bhaskar Jadhav and Uday Samant. How can one expect him to lead the people of the area?&#8221; asked PWP leader S P Jadhav.</p>
<p>Tatkare has done nothing to establish himself as a leader and does not have a vision for development. It is the PWP which has fought battles of the people, Jadhav said adding that infighting in the NCP and unrest between the Congress unit and Antulay will benefit them. However, Tatkare rubbished the allegations saying had he not worked for development, he would not have been an MLA for 15 years. &#8220;I am meeting all leaders and office-bearers of Congress and NCP and will unitedly handle the campaign and am confident of my win,&#8221; he expressed.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Tatkare and PWP leaders say Anant Gite, who has represented the constituency for five terms, has proved to be ineffective.So much so that Shiv Sena leader Ramdas Kadam has openly stated that he will not work for Gite. &#8220;I have told the party leadership that I will campaign for the party in rest of the state, except Raigad,&#8221; Kadam told.</p>
<p>The agitation against SEZ in Raigad was successful because of PWP agitation, the party leaders claim. The sprawling constituency with over 10 lakh voters is situated in the coastal Konkan region in South Maharashtra. It has been represented by Antulay and PWP&#8217;s Dinkar Patil and Ramshet Thakur twice each.<br />
Gite became a minister and represented Raigad for five terms but the &#8216;kul kayda&#8217; (a law which gives ownership right to cultivator of the land), is non-existent in the region, sources say.</p>
<p>About 80 tmc of Koyna water is released into the sea and passes through Raigad, but Gite has never thought of how it can be utilised for agriculture and to resolve water problems in the constituency, his critics say. &#8220;The khots (zamindars) are with the Congress. There is large scale unemployment and industrial units in Chiplun, Mahaad and Ratnagiri are in bad state. Tatkare has no mass base here,&#8221; locals in the area say.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a boost to PWP, MNS has pledged support to its candidate Ramesh Kadam and will not field a nominee. On the other side, AAP plans to highlight corruption allegations against Tatkare in the irrigation department, but the minister says the charges have no substance. PWP leader Jayant Patil said there is no impact of AAP in Raigad and whatever votes the candidate takes will be that of the NCP and Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our votes are fixed as we have a good base. Besides, Antulay has openly rebelled against the official nominee of the Congress and NCP. He is with us and has vote base of over 1.25 lakh. Tatkare is trying to meet him but he is not interested. Sena leader Ramadas Kadam is also upset and not working for Anant Gite,&#8221; Patil said.</p>
<p>According to political observers, Gite has always won because of PWP support, but, he never utilised the MP fund for works initiated by the party.<br />
However, Gite&#8217;s supporters say the constituency will stand by &#8220;bow and arrow&#8221; (the symbol of Shiv Sena). Congress sources say despite getting support from PWP for Lok Sabha elections, in Raigad zilla parishad Shiv Sena did not support PWP. Congress leaders say their fight in the district was always with PWP and Shiv Sena, and NCP in some areas. But, the district party unit is trying to resolve the anger among Antulay&#8217;s supporters and unitedly working for Tatkare.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014350&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amid reports about possible security threats to top BJP leaders, the opposition party on Thursday demanded that the Home Ministry ensure &#8220;foolproof&#8221; protection for them.</p>
<p>Citing media reports which have quoted intelligence sources as saying that the lives of top BJP leaders were under threat, party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said that a delegation of party leaders will meet Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde to press their demand for security.</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on Intelligence Bureau sources, a section of media has been reporting that the BJP leaders&#8217; lives are under threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;BJP is very concerned and worried,&#8221; she said, adding  that, &#8220;there is a threat to all BJP leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very concerned and anxious whether Home Ministry has taken cognisance of these reports and if it is taking any measures to ensure the safety of our leaders as they move around the country for election campaigning,&#8221; she told reporters here.</p>
<p>Sitharaman said that the media reports have said that the threat perception also included kidnapping with a possible motive of demanding release of Indian Mujahideen (IM) co- founder Yasin Bhatkal. Bhatkal is in the custody of security agencies on terror charges.</p>
<p>&#8220;With all these dimensions being played out&#8230; in the media, all reports based on IB sources, BJP is extremely worried for the safety of its leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will certainly meet the Home Minister as and when we get the time from his office&#8230; and present the demand that protection and foolproof cover be provided to all our leaders,&#8221; she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014356&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on  Thursday termed the Lok Sabha elections as a &#8220;battle of thoughts&#8221;, saying while the Congress stood for empowering the people, the opposition represented only the rich in the country.</p>
<p>In a meeting with ex-servicemen, the Congress Vice President said he would make whole-hearted attempts to fulfil the demands of the veterans including representation for the armed forces in the central pay commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;The election is a battle of thoughts in India. On one hand, there is Congress which feels that power should be in each and every hand and that is how the country can be powerful. &#8220;On the other side, the opposition thinks that the country can be run by only powerful and rich and they have no place for the poor in their ideas,&#8221; Gandhi said, without naming the BJP.</p>
<p>Addressing the veterans, he said he agreed with the view that there is a divide between the armed forces and the bureaucracy, saying, &#8220;I could feel this divide during the One Rank One Pension issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stressed that at times he would be able to meet the demands of ex-servicemen, but sometimes he would not be able to do so. &#8220;I cannot make big promises but my intentions are very clean. I promise you that whatever demands you have, I would always make a whole-hearted effort to meet your demands,&#8221; Gandhi said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014297&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pawarm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014302" alt="Pawar said that he would be happy to coordinate among various parties in the UPA. (Express Archive)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pawarm.jpg" /></a> Pawar said that he would be happy to coordinate among various parties in the UPA. (Express Archive)
<p>Narendra Modi-led BJP could suffer in the Lok Sabha polls due to &#8220;overconfidence&#8221; as its campaign is going on the lines of its 2004 &#8220;India shining&#8221; slogan, NCP chief and Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pawar, a prominent leader in the Congress-led UPA, said that he does not feel that the BJP will come near the magic mark despite the high-profile campaign.</p>
<p>He suggested that the Congress needed to be more pro-active at a time when Modi-led BJP is striving hard to reach out to the masses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congress is the main party of the UPA&#8221;, he remarked when asked how the UPA should face the challenge posed by the main opposition party and its leader in the polls.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am worried about stability&#8221;, he said when asked whether he visualised that the post-poll scenario will be a repeat of 1996 polls when BJP emerged as the single largest party but its government could last only 13 days.</p>
<p>Dismissing suggestions of a Modi wave, Pawar said that he does not feel that the &#8220;one man campaign&#8221; has been able to generate a climate favourable for the main opposition and is apprehensive that it is marred by overconfidence.</p>
<p>He suggested that in 2004, the BJP lost despite having a &#8220;towering personality&#8221; like Atal Bihari Vajpayee as its leader. He said BJP lost its way in the &#8220;feel good&#8221; and &#8220;India shining&#8221; talk and failed to realise how Manmohan Singh became Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Scotching speculation that he would like to become a Prime Minister in the case of a hung verdict, he said that his party was contesting a total of 31 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha, including 21 in Maharashtra. &#8220;Is it not irrational politics to think of the moon with such a minuscule strength?&#8221;, he shot back to a query in this regard.</p>
<p>He steered clear of questions as to how Modi would be as Prime Minister, saying that it is not proper to talk about individuals. He said that he knows Modi for long, but was unsure whether he was Prime Minister material.</p>
<p>&#8220;The highlight of this election is that for the first time someone is being projected as PM candidate and it is also for the first time, that the speeches of this PM candidate are available for people to hear all over the country as they are telecast live.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even prime ministers have not been so lucky with their speeches. The media management is being felt intensely,&#8221; Pawar remarked.</p>
<p>The NCP leader said he was not sure of the possibility and viability of a non-Congress and non-BJP government at the Centre after polls. He said such an arrangement would be &#8220;hotch-potch&#8221; and will be brought down by an outside supporter, whether Congress or the BJP, whenever it would suit them politically.</p>
<p>In reply to a question about AAP, the NCP supremo said he was not sure about the possible impact of Arvind Kejriwal&#8217;s party in the polls.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing is certain that people wearing caps are seen at many places,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Replying to a question, he asserted that he was in the UPA and would continue to remain in the UPA. NCP has become the second largest constituent of the Congress-led UPA after parting of ways by Mamata Banerjee&#8217;s Trinamool Congress and DMK.</p>
<p>Asked about what role he envisages for himself after the polls, Pawar remarked in lighter vein that after half a century in electoral politics, he has now come to the Rajya Sabha and now would like to take rest in the House of Elders.</p>
<p>However, the minister said that he would be happy to coordinate among various parties in the UPA.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014248&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/thomas-t.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014198" alt="An upbeat K V Thomas says the message to the electorate is that only Congress and UPA can give a stable government. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/thomas-t.jpg" /></a> An upbeat K V Thomas says the message to the electorate is that only Congress and UPA can give a stable government. (PTI)
<p>Congress candidate and Union Minister K V Thomas, seeking a fifth term from the prestigious Ernakulam constituency, is taking on his close friend and political novice Christy Fernandez, who is contesting as a CPI(M)-backed independent.</p>
<p>The four-time MP, who won the 2009 elections with a margin of 11,790 votes, is a former Chemistry Professor of Sacred Heart&#8217;s college here and has served as state Tourism, Excise and Fisheries minister between 2001-04.</p>
<p>Thomas has already completed the first round of campaigning and booth conventions are presently on.</p>
<p>An upbeat Thomas says the message to the electorate is that only Congress and UPA can give a stable government.</p>
<p>Listing various projects like Kochi Refinery expansion, LNG Terminal, Nedumbassery airport and Kochi Metro projects besides the Food Security Bill as among his achievements, he said the new package to revive the Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT) is before the central government.</p>
<p>On taking Fernandez, a former Gujarat cadre IAS officer, Thomas said, &#8220;We are good family friends. There is no foe in politics. We only are fighting on two fronts&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fernandez, Secretary of former President Pratibha Patil, will have to sweat it out in the polls as he was taking on a veteran. Both Thomas and Fernandez are from the predominant Latin Catholic community.</p>
<p>Fernandez was earlier criticised for being soft on BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. However, he has clarified that during the Godhra riots, he was in Kerala as Coir Board chairman.</p>
<p>BJP has fielded State General Secretary, A N Radhkrishnan, who had tested electoral waters in the constituency in 2009.</p>
<p>The Aam Admi Party (AAP) has put up journalist Anita Pratap. &#8220;Common facilities like toilets and bathrooms are lacking in various places&#8221;, she said criticising the Congress.</p>
<p>The candidates are eyeing the one lakh odd new voters in the constituency.</p>
<p>A Congress bastion, Thomas has represented the constituency in 1984, 1989, 1991 and 2009.</p>
<p>In the 1996 elections, however, Thomas had to taste defeat at the hands of LDF independent candidate Xavier Arackal.</p>
<p>In the bypoll in 1997, Sebastian Paul was elected as CPI(M) independent candidate from the constituency while in 1998 and 1999 polls George Eden of Congress emerged victorious.</p>
<p>In the 2003 bypoll and 2004 general elections, Sebastian Paul was elected from the constituency.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014191&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-cornered fight is on the cards in the North-East Mumbai Lok Sabha constituency as sitting NCP MP Sanjay Dina Patil is facing a tough challenge from BJP&#8217;s Kirit Somaiya and Aam Aadmi Party&#8217;s Medha Patkar to retain the seat.</p>
<p>The constituency has by and large remained loyal to Congress since 1967, but interestingly no candidate has won two consecutive terms. The only exception was Subramanian Swamy who had won on the trot as Janata Party leader in 1977 and 1980.</p>
<p>BJP has so far won thrice with Jayawantiben Mehta in 1989, Pramod Mahajan in 1996 and Kirit Somaiya in 1999.</p>
<p>The constituency consists of Assembly segments of Mulund, Vikhroli, Bhandup West, Ghatkopar East and Ghatkopar West, and Mankhurd Shivaji Nagar.</p>
<p>Patil had won his debut election in 2009 against BJP&#8217;s Somaiya by a slender margin of 2933 votes, mainly due to presence of MNS candidate Shishir Shinde who divided the saffron votes.</p>
<p>When contacted, Patkar said Patil has &#8220;failed&#8221; to address basic issues like redevelopment of slums, drinking water issue, transportation, roads and sewage in the constituency.</p>
<p>&#8220;He (Patil) has not spent even a single penny from the Rajiv Gandhi Awaas Yojana. Many slum dwellers are deprived of benefits due to erroneous policies of NCP,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Patkar alleged the MP never raised his voice in Parliament on national issues and also on those pertaining to his constituency.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;We want to change the political system. We have worked not only for the poor but for the middle class as well,&#8221; the activist said.</p>
<p>Patil, however, rubbished Patkar&#8217;s claims, saying he has fully utilised the MP fund for development of the constituency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am accessible to people in my constituency. We have utilised entire MP fund for carrying out developmental works. I also borrowed from the Rajya Sabha MP fund and Vidhan Parishad member fund for this purpose,&#8221; Patil said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a good chance of winning again. My entire family is working for the people,&#8221; Patil claimed.</p>
<p>Political observers feel Somaiya has an edge over Patil, as the NCP leader is more keen on contesting the state Assembly election, due later this year.</p>
<p>However, sources close to Patil said the NCP leader&#8217;s prospects are rather bright as Shiv Sena cadres are upset over former BJP chief Nitin Gadkari&#8217;s overtures to MNS chief Raj Thackeray, which did not go down well with party president Uddhav Thackeray.</p>
<p>According to political analyst Sandeep Pradhan, Patkar will eat into votes of slum-dwellers who typically are Congress-NCP loyalists, which will work in favour of Somaiya.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patkar will get a large number of votes from slum-dwellers. In 2009 elections, these votes had gone to the Congress-NCP,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Another factor working in favour of BJP is that MNS has not fielded its candidate from the constituency this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The move will prevent consolidation of votes against the saffron combine,&#8221; Pradhan observed.</p>
<p>However, Pradhan feels that some sections in BJP may try to put a spanner in Somaiya&#8217;s efforts to turn the tide because his relentless tirade against corruption has brought a top party leader under the cloud.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014126&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)
<p>BJP on Thursday continued with its efforts to placate LK Advani, who is sulking over the party&#8217;s decision to field him from Gandhinagar despite his wish to contest from Bhopal, with senior leaders, including Narendra Modi, meeting him.</p>
<p>Modi, the party&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate, went to the senior leader&#8217;s residence and was there for about half-an- hour, apparently to persuade him to contest from Gandhinagar, the seat which Advani has represented five times in Lok Sabha.</p>
<p>Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu and Sushma Swaraj, too, met Advani today. Swaraj had also met him along with Nitin Gadkari yesterday after the party announced Advani&#8217;s candidature from Gandhinagar.</p>
<p>Party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman today played down reports of differences in the party over the matter and said that the issue would be settled &#8220;peacefully and calmly&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no differences. There is nothing. If there are talks, it will be settled internally&#8230; peacefully and calmly,&#8221; she told reporters at the BJP headquarters here.</p>
<p>She did not comment when asked if the veteran leader wanted to contest from Bhopal and not Gandhinagar, but said that the party had made the announcement and senior leaders were talking to Advani.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no need to read too much into it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Though it is not clear as to what transpired at the meetings of party leaders with Advani, sources said he is adamant on contesting from Bhopal.</p>
<p>Advani has said that he be given a chance to select a seat of his choice just as other top BJP leaders like Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley and Modi had done.</p>
<p>The 86-year old party stalwart had conveyed his displeasure to Swaraj and Gadkari when they met him last night. The duo had then met BJP president Rajnath Singh to apprise him of Advani&#8217;s views.</p>
<p>Modi had last night met RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, apparently to seek his intervention in resolving the issue.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014064&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/spice-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007464" alt="The cabin crew of SpiceJet performed a small dance sequence on a song as part of Holi celebrations, with some passengers also joining in." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/spice-480.jpg" /></a> The cabin crew of SpiceJet performed a small dance sequence on a song as part of Holi celebrations, with some passengers also joining in.
<p>Mid-air Holi celebrations aboard eight flights have cost SpiceJet heavily, with the DGCA issuing show cause notice to the airline and suspending two of its pilots.</p>
<p>The cabin crew of SpiceJet performed a small dance sequence on a song as part of Holi celebrations, with some passengers also joining in.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/MgjHTF0VbBM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>The videos of these events were taken and uploaded on video-sharing website YouTube and other social media.</p>
<p>In one video, a pilot is seen coming out of the cockpit and taking photographs of the celebrations at the front of the aisle.</p>
<p>Official sources said the act constituted violation of all safety norms and two pilots were suspended.</p>
<p>SpiceJet on March 17 ran eight special flights with extra cabin crew onboard to do a 2.5-minute jig on the occasion of Holi.</p>
<p>The airline said it was looking into the issue in cooperation with the DGCA. It defended itself saying that the cockpit was manned all the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cockpit was manned at all time as per DGCA regulations that govern the situation when one pilot is outside for example to use the lavatory,&#8221; said an airline spokesperson.</p>
<p>&#8220;The dance was professionally choreographed and was Holi delight for passengers much like it is done by several airlines around the world to celebrate a special occasion. The entire dance sequence lasted 2.5 minutes,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013921&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Declaring that none of the 10 regional parties from the Northeast that have come together to form a front will go with the UPA after the polls, former Lok Sabha Speaker and Meghalaya chief minister P A Sangma Wednesday said the parties will highlight issues concerning the region and are “free to join” the NDA or the third front post-elections as per their choice. Sangma heads the National People’s Party.</span></p>
<p>“The front formed is clearly against the Congress party. The Congress has failed the people of the Northeast and we want to make sure they realise where they stand. We will highlight national issues related to the Northeast,” Sangma said.</p>
<p>Rejecting the possibility of any of the 10 parties joining the Congress-led UPA after elections, Sangma said, “The question of any of the parties joining the UPA does not arise. But the parties are free to decide if they want to join the NDA or the so-called third front after polls.”</p>
<p>The North East Regional Political Front was formed in October last year and is contesting 21 LS seats across the Northeast. Issues being taken up by the front include AFSPA in Manipur and Assam and “frequent incursion of China in Arunachal’s territory”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013826&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">India is likely to respond to a fresh request from Malaysia to expand the search for missing flight MH370 to the Southern Indian Ocean by sending in long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft to cover a vast expanse of the ocean that extends almost up to the South Pole.</span></p>
<p>Sources in the Defence Ministry have said the fresh request is for a search area that is 5000 nautical miles South and South West of Jakarta, a colossal part of the Indian Ocean where the search for a missing aircraft would an extremely challenging task.</p>
<p>Officials said long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft — primarily the state-of-the-art Boeing P 8I’s — are being readied for the task and would be deployed as soon as requisite permissions are granted by the government. This task, sources said, would be primarily undertaken by aircraft given the vast expanse of the search area.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Chinese government has sought permission to deploy its search ships in and around the Andaman sea to carry out a through lookout for the missing aircraft that primarily had Chinese citizens on board.</p>
<p>Sources said the Chinese request is to deploy its ships around the Andaman Nicobar Islands that are home to India’s tri-services military command. The Indian Navy and Coast Guard have already carried out a detailed survey of the region and have not come up with any results yet.</p>
<p>The search was temporarily suspended as the Malaysian authorities had indicated that a fresh search area would be designated shortly. It is therefore uncertain whether the Indian side will grant permission to the Chinese government to carry out a fresh search in the Andaman sea.</p>
<p>The new search area, however, is not the primary focus and Indian efforts are expected to start shortly. Given the distance involved, the search area is likely to be broken up into several parts by participating nations that include Australia and the US. Indian aircraft that will participate will also most likely have to fuel up at a friendly nation near the search area to be effective for the operations.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013823&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aamir1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013807" alt="Dr Pamela de Sa, 87, and her daughter, Dr Geneve de Sa, 50, complained to the deputy registrar of co-operative societies last week." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aamir1.jpg" /></a> Dr Pamela de Sa, 87, and her daughter, Dr Geneve de Sa, 50, complained to the deputy registrar of co-operative societies last week.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">An octogenarian woman and her daughter have alleged that the managing committee of their housing society on Pali Hill in Mumbai’s upmarket Bandra neighbourhood is misleading homeowners and pressuring them to sell 60 per cent of the premises to actor Aamir Khan, who apparently wants the land to build a bungalow for himself.</span></p>
<p>Dr Pamela de Sa, 87, and her daughter, Dr Geneve de Sa, 50, complained to the deputy registrar of co-operative societies last week that the society managing committee has been pushing Khan’s proposal, which they said was a “falsely conceived redevelopment scheme”.</p>
<p>“The Managing Committee is favouring the acceptance of a proposal from Aamir Khan who is trying to purchase 60 per cent of the flats for his own residence by forcibly dis-housing the existing members of the society and compelling them to search new premises,” the de Sas wrote to the deputy registrar on March 11.</p>
<p>The society in question — Virgo Co-operative Housing Society — has 23 members, and comprises two ground-plus-three-storey buildings, Marina Apartments and Bella Vista, each of which has 12 flats. Khan owns <span style="line-height:1.5em;">two flats in Marina and one in Bella Vista, and first expressed interest in acquiring a part of the plot in December 2011.</span></p>
<p>Pamela de Sa owns two flats in Marina, and Geneve de Sa owns two garages in Bella Vista.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Khan said, “Mr Khan has indeed sent an offer to his society after the society requested him to make an offer. We assume that the society will assess all offers received, and members will then decide on how to proceed, which is the normal process.”</p>
<p>Khan has offered to buy 20,000 sq ft of the 36,207 sq ft (3,364 sq m) property at the rate of Rs 70,000 per sq ft of carpet area from society members interested in selling their flats or garages to him.</p>
<p>His offer letter to the society, dated December 28, 2011, states that, “of the caveats/conditions in the offer is that minimum carpet area floor space index (FSI) of 20,000 square feet and proportionate 1:1 land area of the society should ultimately belong to me for this deal to go through”.</p>
<p>This means that a certain minimum number of members should be willing to sell their premises outright, so that Khan has at least 20,000 sq ft of carpet area for himself.</p>
<p>For members not interested in selling, Khan has offered to build a separate building on the rest of the plot.</p>
<p>Virgo Co-operative Housing Society member secretary Kondon Sabloak said Khan wanted to buy 60% of the property to build a bungalow for himself. According to the minutes of the meeting held in the society on December 22, 2013, 18 of the society’s 23 members voted in favour of the redevelopment scheme, while five voted against.</p>
<p>However, Geneve de Sa said: “Of the 23 members who voted, a quorum of at least 75%, or 17 members, must be physically present. In this case, only 14 were present in the meeting, while the rest sent their votes in sealed envelopes, which is like a proxy vote. This is in gross violation of the redevelopment rules.”</p>
<p>Sabloak denied the allegation. “Such allegations are baseless and are intended to spoil the development of the society by some members who have not given their consent for redevelopment. The voting was done in a fair manner and the entire process was recorded on video camera,” he said.</p>
<p>Sabloak added, “While Aamir Khan has offered to buy a majority of the flats, he will construct a separate building for the remaining residents. This is a proper redevelopment scheme.”</p>
<p>In their letter to the deputy registrar, the de Sas have written: “Without placing a general body feasibility report, the committee has obtained a majority vote supposedly for proposed development. But the mandated government guidelines for redevelopment have not been followed.”</p>
<p>Geneve de Sa told The Indian Express: “The scheme proposed by Aamir Khan is not for redevelopment and re-accomodation, it is actually for selling the society’s property to Aamir Khan and also de-registering the society. The appointment of the architect for proposed development is not done, including failing to call tenders for inviting developers for proposed redevelopment.”</p>
<p>Deputy Registrar of Co-operative Housing Societies S M Patil said he was yet to go through the complaint “in detail”, but it appeared prima facie that the proposal did not qualify as “redevelopment”.</p>
<p>“This proposal cannot be considered a redevelopment proposal as it involves selling of a majority of the plot. Under Section 79 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Housing Societies Act, redevelopment must include majority vote of 3/4th of the members and all members must be re-housed in the new building. It also mandates that a developer has to be appointed for the same. However, I will have to go through the letter in detail before taking any action in this case,” Patil said.</p>
<p>Shirish Sukhatme, president of the Practicing Engineers, Architects &amp; Town Planners Association (PEATA) and head of the redevelopment cell of the body, said: “Any redevelopment scheme involves re-accommodating all tenants in the new building. In this case the mandatory appointment of an authorised officer from the office of the registrar under redevelopment rules has not been done. The society cannot blindly sell the majority of flats to any one person, instead a society must invite private builders to redevelop a plot.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013801&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/muz.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013798 " alt="Sanjeev Baliyan at campaign in Daurala on Wednesday." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/muz.jpg" /></a> Sanjeev Baliyan at campaign in Daurala on Wednesday. OINAM ANAND
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Close to seven months after riots broke out between Jats and Muslims in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli in which more than 60 people were killed, the BJP has given Lok Sabha tickets to two leaders who face charges linked to the violence. </span></p>
<p>Hukum Singh and Sanjeev Baliyan, declared candidates by the party in the riot-hit areas of Kairana and Muzaffarnagar respectively, were part of a mahapanchayat in September which was held despite prohibitory orders and inflamed tensions.</p>
<p>Opinion in Muzaffarnagar is divided over the two getting tickets, with Muslims staunchly against the move.</p>
<p>At the Malakpur relief camp which still houses 380 riot-hit Muslim families, several said that the move only reinforced the notion that the BJP wanted to gain from the riots.</p>
<p>“That party has a history of promoting communal violence for political gain. Their leaders fanned tensions between the communities in a place where we had always lived in peace. Now by giving these two tickets, they want the Hindu vote to come to them. We will refuse to vote, but will not cast a ballot for the BJP,” said Mohammad Ashraf, who lives in the camp.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Several Jats The Indian Express spoke to, however, said it was the BJP that would gain most in the area. </span></p>
<p>“Forget about the riots, this region needs development and a strong leader. The law and order situation is not good, and there has to be a change. Even if the two leaders have been charged, the vote here is for Narendra Modi. If there is development, then there will be no communal tension,” said Ramesh Pradhan of Haraula village.</p>
<p>Asked if the BJP had polarised the electorate, Pradhan said: “It doesn’t matter. These are national elections and you vote for a national leader and that man is Narendra Modi,” he said.</p>
<p>In his campaign that started two days back, Baliyan has avoided talking about the riots at length in public, local BJP members said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, speaking to a group of a 100 people, Baliyan said: “We have to win this seat to contribute to Narendra Modi’s victory. After 10 years, this country needs a change and we have to win.”</p>
<p>“Muzaffarnagar is being watched by the country, second only to Varanasi. And we have to deliver,” was his only reference to the riots.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Indian Express, Baliyan said, “Muzaffarnagar has to move forward from the riots. For all communities, it is good if the BJP comes to power.”</p>
<p>Senior police officers said a special investigation committee is looking at charges against the two BJP leaders. “At the mahapanchayat, where inflammatory speeches were made, both were present on the dais. Along with other leaders, they were charged with violating prohibitory orders, and promoting enmity between communities,” a senior police officer said.</p>
<p>Those in relief camps, however, also said there has been no attempt made to involve them in the electoral process.</p>
<p>“We will not go back to our village to vote, it is too dangerous. Nobody from the government has come to tell us if we can vote from where we are. Political parties too have forgotten about us,” said Rashid Ali, originally from Kutba, one of the villages which saw the most violence.</p>
<p>“The only aid we get is from Muslim organisations. This time, our vote is for survival. We have no place to go, and no roof over our heads. Any party that comes to us and says we will help you, we will vote for. The sad part is, with a month to go for elections, not one party has even come and asked us about our plight,” he added.<br />
<strong>BSP MP, booked for hate speech, also files papers</strong></p>
<p>Sitting BSP MP from Muzaffarnagar, Kadir Rana, also filed his nomination from the seat on Wednesday, with his wife filing nomination papers as an independent candidate. Rana was also booked for a hate speech in the run-up to the riots. Rana was with the Samajwadi Party until 2007, switched to the Rashtriya Lok Dal, but fought the 2009 elections on a BSP ticket.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013794&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>BY: P VAIDYANATHAN IYER &amp; SUNIL JAIN</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Finanace Minister P Chidambaram Wednesday said the CBI did not have the entire facts when it registered a preliminary enquiry against C B Bhave, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, in connection with permissions granted to the MCX Stock Exchange.</span></p>
<p>“I have been briefed in the case. I don’t think the entire facts are yet before the CBI. The original licence granted to MCX-SX was only to deal in currency futures. It was not a licence to deal in equity. I think the distinction is important,” Chidambaram told The Indian Express in an interview.</p>
<p>The CBI Friday registered a PE against Bhave and former Sebi member K M Abraham for allowing MCX-SX to start trading in currency futures in 2008, and renewing it in 2009 and 2010 despite income tax raids against the Jignesh Shah-promoted Financial Technologies India Ltd and MCX, the commodities exchange <span style="line-height:1.5em;">promoted by FTIL, in June 2007. </span></p>
<p>The two entities are the promoters of MCX-SX.</p>
<p>According to sources close to Bhave, the permission to MCX-SX was granted at a time when the derivative market was completely dominated by the National Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>“The finance ministry did provide Sebi information on the tax raids. It needs to be mentioned here that MCX, at that point, was running a full-fledged commodity exchange. Subsequently, there was an update on the closure of the income tax case. Anyway, Sebi could not have denied them permission based merely on information that there were tax raids,” a source said.</p>
<p>The source also pointed out that Sebi, under M Damodaran, had allowed FTIL to pick up a marginal 5 per cent stake in Delhi Stock Exchange and Vadodara Stock Exchange in August 2007 and September 2007, respectively.</p>
<p>Finance ministry officials said the facts of the tax case against FTIL and MCX were sent to Sebi in October 2007 when FTIL wanted to buy a marginal stake in National Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>This was also to be treated as “relevant information” the capital market regulator may take note of while declaring FTIL and MCX “fit and proper” to set up a currency futures exchange.</p>
<p>“Sebi is an autonomous regulator. It is entitled to take a view,” Chidambaram said, when asked if the regulator was within its right to declare an entity “fit and proper”.</p>
<p>Sebi granted MCX-SX permission to trade in currency futures in September 2008 with a rider that it would have to dilute its promoter holding within a year.</p>
<p>“I am sure the Sebi records give reasons for why it gave them the licence for currency futures,” Chidambaram said. Satisfied with the reasons given by MCX-SX, the regulator granted it two one-year extensions in 2009 and 2010. After a two-year battle with Sebi, MCX-SX received the licence to trade in equities in July 2012.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013786&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/advanimodim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013917" alt="Advani’s desire to move from Gandhinagar was raised during the meeting but Modi was learnt to have shot down the suggestion. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/advanimodim.jpg" /></a> Advani’s desire to move from Gandhinagar was raised during the meeting but Modi was learnt to have shot down the suggestion. (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A new crisis was sparked in the BJP Wednesday after the party’s central election committee pushed veteran leader L K Advani to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Gandhinagar despite his new desire to shift to Bhopal.</span></p>
<p>Although the poll panel went ahead and announced his name for the Gujarat capital, sources said the sulking former deputy prime minister skipped the meeting and continued to insist on moving to Madhya Pradesh. The panel announced that the party’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi would contest from Vadodara as well.</p>
<p>Until about a fortnight back, Advani was keen to continue representing Gandhinagar — a seat he has won five times — and had even made public statements to the effect. However, he seemed to have developed a fear in recent days that he may not get the wholehearted support of BJP cadre in the constituency as he had opposed the rise of Modi on the national stage last year.</p>
<p>Madhya Pradesh is ruled by Advani loyalist Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Advani is believed to have told party chief Rajnath Singh Tuesday about his desire to move to Bhopal.</p>
<p>The issue was taken up Wednesday by the BJP parliamentary board that met ahead of the CEC. Sources said Advani’s desire to move from Gandhinagar was raised during the meeting but Modi was learnt to have shot down the suggestion saying the Gujarat <span style="line-height:1.5em;">BJP unit had unanimously recommended Advani’s name for Gandhinagar.</span></p>
<p>Advani had first opposed Modi being named the party’s chief campaigner for the Lok Sabha elections and subsequently its prime ministerial candidate. He had for the first time skipped the party’s national executive in Goa and had also offered to quit all party posts before he was brought around with the help of the RSS.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, he went into a sulk again and skipped the marathon central election committee meeting that approved 67 candidates. However, top party leaders did not seem to be in a mood to give in and went ahead and announced his name for Gandhinagar.</p>
<p>They also rubbed the hurt in by holding up tickets for two of his loyalists &#8211; seven term MP Harin Pathak from Ahmedabad East and former minister Jaswant Singh from Barmer &#8211; while declaring candidates for most seats from Gujarat and Rajasthan.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the poll panel generously gave tickets to people who had joined the party newly such as former Congress member Jagdambika Pal (Domariyaganj), NCP leader Vijay Kumar Gavit’s daughter Heena Gavit (Nandurabar) and JMM leader Vidhyut Mahto (Jamshedpur).</p>
<p>In an apparent attempt to assuage Advani’s sentiments, senior leaders Sushma Swaraj and Nitin Gadkari met him after the CEC meeting even as the party withheld announcing its Bhopal candidate. They returned to brief party president Rajnath Singh and are believed to have told him that Advani continued to insist on Bhopal. Advani is learnt to have told them that he too should be allowed to pick the constituency of his choice like some others in the party.</p>
<p>Sources said the leadership is worried that it would be faced with a problem if the Madhya Pradesh unit recommends Advani’s name for Bhopal and may have to turn to the RSS again to resolve the imbroglio.</p>
<p>Amid these developments, Modi called on RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat who is in the capital.</p>
<p>Totally, the BJP CEC declared 67 candidates, including 21 each from Gujarat and Rajasthan, 15 from Uttar Pradesh, three from Bihar and two from Maharashtra.</p>
<p>Prominent names included yesteryear Bollywood star Hema Malini (Mathura) and former Olympian Rajyavardhan Rathore (Jaipur Rural). While Hema Malini will be contesting against former prime minister Charan Singh’s grandson Jayant Chaudhary of the RLD, the Olympian will be contesting against Congress general secretary C P Joshi.</p>
<p>The CEC withheld tickets to five seats in Gujarat and four in Rajasthan with party leaders claiming that some more work was needed to finalise these names.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013765&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Haryana&#8217;s Excise and Taxation Minister Kiran Choudhry was injured after being attacked by a mob in Narnaul district. Kiran received head injuries and was rushed to a nearby hospital from where she was taken to a private hospital in Gurgaon.</span></p>
<p>According to the police, the incident took place around 8 pm Wednesday when Kiran was addressing a rally in support of her daughter Shruti Choudhry, sitting MP and Congress candidate from Bhiwani-Mahendergarh Lok Sabha constituency.</p>
<p>“A group of youngsters joined the crowd posing as Choudhry’s supporters and started pelting stones at her while she was speaking in village Koriawas in Narnaul district. We are conducting raids to identify and nab the accused,” said Jagat Singh Hooda, SP,<br />
Narnaul.</p>
<p>Kiran Choudhry’s PA Bansi, who answered her phone, told The Indian Express that she was not in a condition to speak and was being shifted to a Gurgaon hospital.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013759&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/01/rajiv-gandhi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988250" alt="The MHA will highlight the fact that the Tamil Nadu govt was being considerate only towards these “particular prisoners” despite hundreds serving life sentence. Express Archive" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/01/rajiv-gandhi.jpg" /></a> The MHA will highlight the fact that the Tamil Nadu govt was being considerate only towards these “particular prisoners” despite hundreds serving life sentence. Express Archive
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is set to tell the Supreme Court (SC) that the Tamil Nadu government’s decision to free all seven convicts serving life term in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case was based on “extraneous consideration” and the state was following a “pick and choose” policy as there are hundreds of other prisoners undergoing the same punishment.</span></p>
<p>Soon after the apex court commuted the death sentence of three convicts in the case on February 18, the state government had informed the Assembly that a decision had been taken to remit their life sentence, along with that of four other convicts.</p>
<p>The Centre, which had moved SC on February 21 against the Tamil Nadu government on the issue, has to file a reply before court on March 27.</p>
<p>The MHA, after seeking a legal opinion from the Law Ministry, has drafted its reply, which is being closely monitored by Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde himself.</p>
<p>“The Law Ministry is of the opinion that the state’s decision to remit the life sentences of convicted killers has to be done in consultation with the Centre. And in this case, consultation means consent. Since they were also convicted under central acts like the Passport Act, Arms Act and Chemical Explosives Act, the state cannot take a decision on its own,” said a senior official.</p>
<p>The official added that they will highlight the fact that the state government was being considerate only towards these “particular prisoners” despite hundreds of others serving life sentence in various prisons in the state.</p>
<p>“There is one more option of the Centre exercising its powers under the cumulative imprisonment clause as there are certain Central acts also under which they have been convicted. If the life imprisonment is under their purview then there are other sections where they have been sentenced raging from two-four years. The law is silent on the fact whether these sentences should be served concurrently with life imprisonment or shall start after its completion,” said the official.</p>
<p>The MHA had earlier sent two letters to the Tamil Nadu government detailing all legal and constitutional provisions under which the state government had no power to remit the life sentences of convicted prisoners on its own.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013754&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Yakub was sentenced to death by a TADA court in 2007 under charges of criminal conspiracy and for allegedly arranging finance.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013751&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Recommending that the mercy petition of Yakub Abdul Razak Memon — a convict in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts and brother of absconding accused Tiger Memon — be rejected, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is learnt to have forwarded Yakub’s file to President Pranab Mukherjee, who will take a final decision after consulting legal experts. Yakub’s defence had asked for leniency as he has been unwell and has spent nearly 20 years in jail.</span></p>
<p>MHA official said their suggestion to the President was based on the Maharashtra government’s decision that Yakub’s mercy petition be rejected. Yakub was sentenced to death by a TADA court in 2007 under charges of criminal conspiracy and for allegedly arranging finance and managing its disbursement through the co-accused. Upholding the Mumbai TADA court’s death sentence, the Supreme Court, in March 2013, had said, “It is not a hyperbole to state that he was one of the driving spirits behind the plan.”</p>
<p>In October last year, Yakub applied for presidential pardon after which a report from the state government was sought by the MHA. A senior ministry official said, “There have been no new facts which emerged either from investigation or examination of case files that could raise any holes in the prosecution theory. The apex court has upheld the conviction and the crime is definitely among the rarest of the rare.”</p>
<p>A chartered accountant by profession, Yakub was arrested from the Kathmandu airport in 1994. He was later described by the TADA court as the mastermind who played a key role in the conspiracy which “warranted death penalty”. The multiple blasts had claimed 257 lives and left 713 injured.</p>
<p>The CBI, which probed the blasts cases, alleged that the conspiracy was hatched by Dawood Ibrahim and other absconding persons</p>
<p>MHA sources said the president may either ask the ministry to review its suggestions or go ahead with its recommendation. In case a review is sought, the government may seek another report from the state government, which may also include the medical condition of Yakub. After taking over as President, Mukherjee has cleared several pending mercy petitions, including that of Mumbai 26/11 convict Ajmal Kasab, who was hanged in November 2012.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013751&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The police fired in the air and arrested JD(U) MLA Narendra Kumar Singh after his supporters and Congress workers clashed over a disputed land at a village in Bihar’s Begusarai district on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>The two rival groups were claiming possession of the property in Keshawe village under Singhaul police station area, Superintendent of Police Harpreet Kaur said.</p>
<p>The police rushed to the spot and tried to pacify the warring groups, but after failing to do so fired in the air. A lathi-charge also failed to disperse them, Kaur said.</p>
<p>The clash left 12 people injured, she said.</p>
<p>Kaur and District Magistrate Manoj Kumar also reached the village to take a first-hand account of the incident.</p>
<p>“We have arrested the JD(U) MLA for rioting,” she said, adding that action would also be taken against the Congress supporters.<br />
Singh alias Bogo Singh is a JD(U) MLA from Matihani constituency and a native of Keshawe village in the district .</p>
<p>Additional policemen were deployed in the village in view of the tension, Kaur added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013747&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The Election Commission has directed all social networking sites to scrutinise the content displayed by them to ensure that they do not violate the model code of conduct. The EC guidelines issued Tuesday also said no political advertisement will be displayed on such sites without a pre-certification.</span></p>
<p>With politicians taking to social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook in a bid to woo young generation for the upcoming general elections, the move is aimed at addressing the problem of paid news on these and other sites.</p>
<p>The pre-certification will have to be obtained from the Media Certification and Monitoring Committee which was appointed by the EC at district and state levels to scrutinise all media within its jurisdiction to identify political advertisement in the garb of news.</p>
<p>The committee is tasked with observing and compiling daily report on all ad expenditure of a candidate, including suspected cases of paid news along with supportive documents.</p>
<p>“Internet sites shall inform the commission regarding the expenditure incurred by the political parties/candidates on political ads when requested for&#8230; Internet-based media will do active scrutiny to ensure that content displayed by them during the electoral process is not unlawful or malicious or violative of the model code of conduct,” the EC has said.</p>
<p>It has also directed the sites to remove any unlawful content that comes to the notice of the election machinery.</p>
<p>Reacting to the directive, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) said the Internet companies have already put in place community standards to free the web space of hate speeches, bullying and harassment.</p>
<p>“There is a real concern that additional regulations — with their corresponding compliance requirements — will negatively impact the rights of users and citizens to use the platforms freely and without apprehension of government interference, in addition to their likely damaging impact on the functioning of such services themselves,” the IAMAI said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013743&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Congress-led UPA created a multi-sectoral development programme for 90 Minority Concentrated Districts (MCD) in the country but a review panel scrutinising implementation of the Sachar Committee recommendations did not perceive any special concern for these districts. </span></p>
<p>The panel said the government neither properly assessed development deficit in these districts, nor made adequate financial resources available.</p>
<p>“There has not been any systematic assessment of development deficits in MCDs for determination of targets under different schemes,” the evaluation panel’s interim report said.</p>
<p>Soon after the Sachar Committee Report was submitted, the Centre decided to identify Minority Concentrated Districts and give special attention to their development.</p>
<p>One of the criteria for Minority Concentrated Districts was it should have a combined minority population of over 25 per cent.</p>
<p>The report said financial resources and physical targets available to minorities, especially Muslims, were meagre and in some schemes have not been utilised, reflecting lack of coordination and absence of systematic planning.</p>
<p>“Investments in any part of minority concentrated towns have been mentioned without ascertaining whether the minority community resides there,” the report points out.</p>
<p>The review panel, headed by Amitabh Kundu, professor (economics) at Jawaharlal Nehru University, submitted its report on March 14 to the Ministry of Minority Affairs.</p>
<p>Among the recommendations was a special sub-quota for Muslims within the OBC and including Muslims in SC category, a law on the lines of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes Prevention of Atrocity Act, and incentives to public/ private sector institutions for promoting communal diversity. It called for development of institutional support system to help unemployed Muslim youth take up jobs in manufacturing and service sectors.</p>
<p>It stated that all government agencies should be directed to incorporate socio-religious categorisation of beneficiaries in their information system.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013741&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Around 300 hectares of forest land was destroyed in a fire that broke out in several parts of Wayanad sanctuary and the territorial forest division in North Kerala.</span></p>
<p>Forest Minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan said it was possible that the fire was man-made as it broke out in nearly 15 places. The state government has deputed a team of forest officials to investigate.</p>
<p>The fire remained uncontrolled until Wednesday due to the climate conditions coupled with the flowered, dry bamboo clusters across the forest.</p>
<p>Forest officials said while wild fire was usual, its outbreak at 15 places almost simultaneously has given rise to the suspicion that anti-social elements were behind the act.</p>
<p>Minor fires were also reported in in neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a farmer was arrested on charges of attempting to spark the fire at Mananthavadi in Wayanad. The farmer Balakrishnan told forest officials that he had set the forest on fire to save his farm land.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013739&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The Congress central election committee has dropped the name of Paranjadityasinh Parmar, the son-in-law of AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh, as the Panchmahals candidate following a protest from local MLAs.</span></p>
<p>State Congress president Arjun Modhwadia confirmed the cancellation saying, “His name had crept into the list of candidates by mistake.” The cancellation of the candidature, however, follows protests from workers who considered him an “outsider”.</p>
<p>The protest had started immediately after his candidature was announced along with seven others for Gujarat Tuesday. Among those who had strongly opposed his candidature are Balasinor MLA Mansinh Chauhan and Thasra MLA Ramsinh Parmar.</p>
<p>Mansinh and Ramsinh were also aspirants for the LS ticket from the seat. Their names were in the panel of possible candidates suggested by the party state unit, along with the name of Paranjadityasinh.</p>
<p>Sources said Paranjadityasinh’s name was cancelled following verbal threats from the two sitting MLAs to resign and rebellion by a section of the Panchmahals district party unit.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013737&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">As thick smoke enveloped parts of the Seshachalam forests due to a fire that broke out Tuesday, Forest Department and Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) officials Wednesday closed the pedestrian steps and walkway to the Tirupati temple at Alipiri as a precautionary measure.</span></p>
<p>Governor E S L Narasimhan is also learnt to have sought the help of the Indian Air Force to douse the flames which are slowly spreading up the slope to the Lord Balaji temple, which is still several kilometres away.</p>
<p>TTD officials shut down shops and business establishments along the 2500-step path as thick smoke was causing breathing difficulties and reduced visibility. This is the first time in the temple’s centuries-old history that the sacred steps have been shut. A wind energy plant on the Seven Hills leading to the temple has also been shut down as a precaution.</p>
<p>Officials also herded to safety dozens of spotted deer, wild boar, Indian giant squirrels, and other animals from protected areas and controlled habitats as the fire spread.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/kerala-fire-breaks-out-in-15-places-in-wayanad/" target="_blank"><strong>Forest fire in Kerala</strong></a></p>
<p>“The fire is raging several km away from the main temple at Tirumala. There is no threat to the temple and the road leading to the temple&#8230; As a precautionary measure some areas have been sealed&#8230; Forest fire and fire brigade officials hope to control the fire by Thursday morning,’’ Principal Chief Conservator of Forests B Somasekhara Reddy said.</p>
<p>While officials prevented devotees from using walkways, vehicular traffic has not been affected. “There is no threat to pilgrims and the temple. We are more worried about the devastation to flora and fauna,’’ said CCF Tirumala-Tirupati Ravi Kumar.</p>
<p>Officials said vegetation and stretches of slopes that had dried up resulted in the fire spreading so quickly.</p>
<p>TTD JEO K S Raju said that they were coordinating with the Forest Department and Tirumala-Tirupati Fire Brigade officials to deploy IAF and Indian Navy choppers if the fire is not extinguished by Thursday morning.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013738&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hail.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013735" alt="Several farmers have reportedly committed suicide in the state after their crops were damaged by the severe hailstorm. Maharashtra has suffered more than Rs 5,000 crore of agricultural loss. IE" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hail.jpg" /></a> Several farmers have reportedly committed suicide in the state after their crops were damaged by the severe hailstorm. Maharashtra has suffered more than Rs 5,000 crore of agricultural loss. IE
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Centre on Wednesday sanctioned Rs 844 crore for relief to hailstorm-hit farmers in Maharashtra after getting a nod from the Election Commission.</span></p>
<p>Several farmers have reportedly committed suicide in the state after their crops were damaged by the severe hailstorm. Maharashtra has suffered more than Rs 5,000 crore of agricultural loss.</p>
<p>Neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which was also affected by the calamity, will receive Rs 300 crore as relief.</p>
<p>The Centre has decided to release Rs 630 crore as subsidies for small and marginal farmers, and Rs 214 crore for those with bigger agricultural tracts in Maharashtra, a senior official said.</p>
<p>The decision to release the funds was taken by a high-level committee comprising Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, Finance Minister P Chidambaram, Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde and National Disaster Management authority (NDMA) vice-chairman M Sashidhar Reddy.</p>
<p>“Since the model code of conduct is in existence, we had to take the permission of the Election Commission to clear the funds. The money will be released from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF),” said an official on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The official added there was no discussion on giving compensation packages to Karnataka and Rajasthan, where a few districts have been affected by the hailstorm.</p>
<p>A central team had visited the affected states last week and the money was sanctioned based on a report given by the officials. The team submitted a report that more than 17.7 lakh hectares of agricultural land spanning across 28 districts had been hit by the hailstorm and more than 50 per cent crops were damaged.</p>
<p>The severely affected districts of Maharashtra are Pune, Sholapur, Beed, Nanded, Jalna, Parbhani, Buldhana, Dhule and Nashik.</p>
<p>“Whatever the inter-ministerial committee suggested was accepted at the high-level meeting. The money will be disbursed on an immediate basis,” said the official.</p>
<p>The Centre also sanctioned the money for flood affected states in Uttar Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
<p><strong>Maharashtra gives Rs 4000-cr relief</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Maharashtra cabinet on Wednesday chalked out a special compensation package worth Rs 4,000 crore for farmers affected by the recent hailstorms and unseasonal rain.</span></p>
<p>The state government has decided to waive electricity bills for farmers in the affected regions for six months starting February, a decision that will burden the state exchequer by Rs 200 crore.</p>
<p>Further, a one-time monetary compensation of Rs 10,000 per hectare for non-irrigated but cultivated land, Rs 15,000 per hectare for irrigated land and Rs 25,000 per hectare for land under horticulture will be given to affected farmers. However, this compensation benefit will be capped at 2 hectare per farmer.</p>
<p>The cabinet has also decided to put a stay on the recovery of crop loans for the time being apart from bearing the burden of interest of crop loans for a year. This will burden the state exchequer by Rs 268 crore.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013728&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Parveen Amanullah, an ex-JD (U) minister, will take on sitting BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha from Patna Saheb.

<p>From Jharkhand, the AAP has announced seven candidates.

Another activist, Mithilesh Dangi, who has led a farmers’ movement against land acquisition by NTPC is being fielded from Hazaribagh.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gz.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013732" alt="Local MP only, says banner for Ashit Tyagi. Gajendra yadav" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gz.jpg" /></a> Local MP only, says banner for Ashit Tyagi. Gajendra yadav
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Across the streets of Ghaziabad, banners demanding a sthaniya saansad (local parliamentarian) have been put up, some anonymously, some by small organisations affiliated to various parties. </span></p>
<p>But after the BJP, the AAP and the Congress named candidates who aren’t locals, the campaign of the two UP heavyweights — the BSP and the Samajwadi Party — too has been centred around this issue.</p>
<p>The BJP has announced former Army chief V K Singh in Rajnath’s place, the Congress will field Firozabad MP Raj Babbar, and the AAP has nominated Shazia Ilmi.</p>
<p>A hoarding put up by Ashit Tyagi — of the Rashtravadi Yuva Morcha, a registered unrecognised party who has traditionally supported BJP — in Chowdhury Mor in Ghaziabad states that Ghaziabad will not accept an ‘outsider’. It asks if the BJP — like Congress — will also make the same mistake.</p>
<p>The BSP and SP candidates are optimistic the outsider tag will work against the three heavyweights. “Ghaziabad might be close to Delhi, but here the politics is very different. People like knowing their candidate. They like knowing they can go to their sansad’s house if there’s a problem,” said Sudhan Rawat, the SP candidate, whose brother is a former MLA from neighbouring Garhmukteshwar district.</p>
<p>The BJP, for it part, says the work done during Rajnath Singh’s tenure would speak for itself. “How can he be an outsider if he’s an Indian? He was a general and has always stood firm against corruption. People will vote for him because they want a strong leader,” said Vijay Mohan, a local BJP leader. But V K Singh’s nomination has led to discontent within the party with a number of workers protesting in the streets Tuesday.</p>
<p>Shazia Ilmi said Ghaziabad will vote for her because of the “stepmotherly” treatment given to the constituency by Rajnath. “It’s right next to Noida and Delhi. But when you step into Ghaziabad, it’s like stepping back. I want development in Ghaziabad,” she said.</p>
<p>With the AAP headquarters here, Ghaziabad is often seen as the epicentre of its operations. Though there are few in Ghaziabad who aren’t familiar with senior leaders such as Arvind Kejriwal, Manish Sisodia and Kumar Vishwas, Ilmi herself is a known face primarily in the urban sections of Ghaziabad.</p>
<p>But Ghaziabad City is only one of five assembly segments here; victory in the constituency has been traditionally decided by the rural voters. Sensing this, Raj Babbar will begin campaigning Thursday from the rural, Muslim-dominated Loni segment. “We want to give the people here an option. Raj Babbar will meet people in Loni and even though he’s not from Ghaziabad, his work in the past speaks for itself,” said a close aide, who added Babbar’s victory over Dimple Yadav in Firozabad too will benefit him.</p>
<p>BSP candidate Mukul Upadhayay reminds you that his sister-in-law had defeated Babbar in Fatehpur Sikri. While filing his nominations Wednesday, Upadhayay said the BSP’s performance in the assembly elections in 2012 made him certain of victory. He would look to work “for the poor and the disenfranchised” in the district.</p>
<p>The BSP had successfully manipulated caste equations in the district, winning four of its five assembly segments. By garnering both Dalit votes and Muslims votes in the district, BSP had managed to stop the Samajwadi Party “wave” that eventually saw Akhilesh Yadav being elected chief minister. Most surprising was the BJP’s loss of their traditional Bania and upper-caste vote, with Ghaziabad City, a BJP bastion, going to the BSP.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013725&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Senior NCP leader and Minister for Medical Education Vijaykumar Gavit was sacked from the Maharashtra cabinet Wednesday after his daughter, Heena, had joined the BJP. She will contest from Nandurbar in the Lok Sabha elections.</span></p>
<p>Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar wrote to Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan recommending that Gavit be sacked from the government. Chavan sent the letter to state governor K Sankaranarayanan, who accepted the recomendation. “We have received the CM’s letter asking us to accept the resignation of cabinet minister Vijaykumar Gavit,” sources in Raj Bhawan said.</p>
<p>The NCP’s move came shortly after Heena Gavit joined the BJP in the presence of party president Rajnath Singh and PM candidate Narendra Modi in New Delhi Wednesday. The BJP announced Heena would contest the elections from Nandurbar, a tribal constituency. She is enrolled in a PG course in medicine at Grants Medical College and J J Hospital.</p>
<p>“If anyone in the party is seen hobnobbing with political rivals and communal forces like the BJP, we will take stern steps. The decision to sack Gavit was to send a signal that the NCP will not tolerate any handshakes with rivals,” Ajit Pawar said.</p>
<p>Gavit admitted, “There was pressure from the top NCP leadership not to allow my daughter to join the BJP. But how could I stop her from taking a decision?” He added, “I accept the NCP’s decision. I have nothing to complain about.”</p>
<p>Calling the development NCP’s internal matter, state BJP president Devendra Fadnavis said, “I find it strange Ajit Pawar should so emphatically accuse the BJP of being a communal party. I would like to remind him that respected Sharad Pawar was the chairman of National Disaster Management Council during the NDA government led by PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee.”</p>
<p>Vijaykumar Gavit too is likely to join the BJP and contest the assembly elections, scheduled in September 2014, from the Nandurbar belt.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013723&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Nicholas B Dirks, Chancellor of University of California, Berkeley, is a historian, anthropologist and author, most of his books on India. In this interview, he discusses the elections, Narendra Modi and the Wendy Doniger controversy:</span></em></p>
<p><strong>How do you view the current Indian political scene?</strong></p>
<p>I notice various new people running for office. Some I know&#8230; Yogendra Yadav, he is a fellow scholar. At my previous university, Columbia, he was a regular visitor, collaborated a lot with people. I never thought he would be running for elections&#8230; he is incredibly smart, conscientious, engaged. I wasn’t completely surprised&#8230; but still scholars entering elections&#8230;I am intrigued. In the US it almost never happens&#8230; But this is a movement — kind of anti-corruption currents have been captured and mobilised — a kind of movement that needs to happen.</p>
<p><strong>As a scholar of India, how do you look at the withdrawal of Wendy Doniger’s book and India’s tolerance for scholarship?</strong></p>
<p>Wendy Doniger has been a colleague with whom I have worked for a very long time. The idea that her book would be branded offensive to Hindu identity or belief seems somewhat strange since she spent her entire life in some sense in love with Hinduism and Puranic texts and stories. She comes from a particularly Freudian background and that obviously exposes her to the use of sexuality, imagery, mythology and interpretive framework. The Satanic Verses was similarly subjected to the charge that it would be offensive to certain communities. I am concerned when scholarship becomes the target of a political mobilisation. I was concerned when a book by James Laine got identified as offensive to the memory of Shivaji — the attack on the Bhandarkar library is in my view just horrible&#8230; But having said that, in addition to concerns about sedition, there were concerns about unrest, about communal conflict and so under the guise of a kind of paternalist, imperial, legal framework these kinds of understandings of how you control the circulation of things that might give offence to particular communities became coded into law.</p>
<p><strong>How do you look at the rise of Narendra Modi and the BJP?</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of people in the business world who clearly are very interested in having the Hindutva party in control, and lots of concerns have been raised about how efficient the recent government has been in organising infrastructure, controlling corruption. The real question for me is what is the current standing of the Hindu ideology which BJP is working on. Because I get the impression that there has been an effort to become more inclusive and also less doctrinaire in the BJP.</p>
<p><strong>How would a Modi-led government impact Indo-US collaborations in education?</strong></p>
<p>I came here on a regular basis when I was working with Columbia. I met Kapil Sibal and others in the Congress government who were very optimistic at some point on the passage of the Foreign Universities Bill, and he didn’t get anywhere and in fact he had to stipulate even prospective terms of condition that would have made collaborations very difficult&#8230; I have worked very closely with people like Romila Thapar and others who have spoken on the issue of textbook rewriting and almost all the top academics, scholars, sociologists, historians were very concerned about politicisation of textbooks in history&#8230; Modi, however, is a pragmatist&#8230; he may want to take a different position&#8230; he may want to completely rebrand himself and try very hard to keep any continuing concerns from Godhra from overtaking his new identity.</p>
<p><strong>Would you consider setting up a UCB campus in India?</strong></p>
<p>We have no plans to set up a campus&#8230; there is no law in India enabling that. It is not clear to me that it would be a great strategy for a university. We are exploring setting up a base office, an interactive centre for alumni&#8230; Berkeley is really interested in building up relationships we already have. I think it’s a good time to enhance exchange of students, and collaboration and opportunities, join research projects. We are in talks with IIT Delhi, Ashoka University, Azim Premji University.</p>
<p><strong>What is your view of global academic rankings and the dismal performance of Indian institutes?</strong></p>
<p>There is no single ranking system that is perfect in my opinion but through them increasingly institutions can see themselves in competition on a global kind of scale. UCB does very well on all rankings&#8230; It should also serve as a wake-up call for institutions in India to the need to invest more in these institutions. They will be well served by government and private support; a combination of both is needed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013715&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Already struggling with the departure of dozens of senior leaders, the Orissa Congress got another jolt when former chief minister and senior tribal leader Hemananda Biswal said he was “not interested” in contesting the Lok Sabha elections over the distribution of Congress tickets in the state.</span></p>
<p>On Tuesday night, the Congress announced the candidates for 118 of the 147 assembly seats and two Lok Sabha seats in Orissa. The list included 72 new faces and eight women. However, four of the 70 assembly seats going to polls are yet to be announced. The list also included union minister Srikant Jena’s name who would contest from Balasore. But for the first time, no one from former chief minister J B Patnaik’s family has been given a Congress ticket.</p>
<p>No sooner had the Congress came out with the list than Biswal, the current MP from Sundargarh, told reporters he would not contest. His name was announced for the same seat last week. Biswal said despite his opposition, the party gave tickets to two candidates in Bonei and Raghunathpalli assembly constituencies in his Lok Sabha area. Sundargarh will go to polls on April 10.</p>
<p>Biswal told The Indian Express that there was no question of changing his mind. When asked if any central leader spoke to him after his announcement of opting out, Biswal said no.</p>
<p>The tribal leader, who has served twice as chief minister in 1989 and 1999 for brief periods, was upset that former BJP leader Bhimsen Choudhury had been given the ticket to Bonai.</p>
<p>In another blow to the Congress, former Balasore MP Kartikeswar Patra resigned the party Wednesday to join the Trinamool Congress. Patra said he was resigning as Jena was nominated for the Balasore Lok Sabha seat.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013712&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The venue set the tone for the speeches by Rahul and Singh at the rally Wednesday.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013709&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Wangjing, in Thoubal district of Manipur, was a strategic choice by the state Congress committee for a Rahul Gandhi rally. It is indisputably a Congress stronghold. It is also Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh’s home turf. And it houses Manipur’s largest and only Muslim area — Lilong. All this made Wangjing the natural choice for the AICC vice-president’s “one and only big rally’’ that Manipur will have before its first round of elections on April 9.</span></p>
<p>The venue set the tone for the speeches by Rahul and Singh at the rally Wednesday. While Singh skipped any mention of development, deciding instead to heckle the BJP and dwell upon Congress’s inclusiveness, Rahul himself merely glanced over the party’s achievements and future plans in Manipur — particularly a railway network to connect the state to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>“In 1972, Indira Gandhi came here and participated in a function that gave you your state, Manipur. She said that Manipur was a real gem. This also shows what the Congress thinks of Manipur &#8211; and not just about Manipur but every single state in the country&#8230;,” said Rahul.</p>
<p>Taking a dig at Modi’s development model, Rahul said, “He talks of the Gujarat model. But what does the Gujarat model have to do with Manipur? What does the Gujarat model have to do with Uttar Pradesh or Bihar or Meghalaya or any other state for that matter?&#8230; I respect the people of Manipur, and believe that the only model that should work for Manipur is the Manipur model.”</p>
<p>The chief minister meanwhile, spoke of the riots of June 18, 2001, after the Vajpayee government declared a ceasefire with the NSCN(IM) and said the last time BJP government ruled at the Centre, “Manipur was burning.’’</p>
<p>Speaking on the sidelines, president of the Manipur State Congress Committee and deputy chief minister of G Gaikhangam said that Thoubal, apart from being a Congress stronghold was also strategically picked to host Rahul’s rally as both Lok Sabha constituencies from the state — Outer Manipur and Inner Manipur — overlap here.</p>
<p>As for Narendra Modi’s rally earlier last month Gaighangam said the Congress was not worried and “everyone was welcome in the state’’. “As a matter of fact I would say that the Modi’s rally was actually a triumph for the state because it went off smoothly despite this being a conflict zone,” he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013709&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/biswajit.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013705" alt="With her poster at least behind him, Biswajit flashes the V sign in Delhi Wednesday.Amit Mehra" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/biswajit.jpg" /></a> With her poster at least behind him, Biswajit flashes the V sign in Delhi Wednesday.

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">With Mamata Banerjee deciding to concentrate on West Bengal and the northeastern states following the snub by Anna Hazare at the Ramlila Maidan last week, almost the entire top leadership of the Trinamool Congress has left for Kolkata. Not one senior leader was present when a list of 18 candidates was announced in Delhi Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Left in the lurch is veteran actor Biswajit Chatterjee, the party’s candidate from New Delhi and the sole non-political, albeit well-known, name in the list. Biswajit does not know too much about elections or about Delhi.</p>
<p>Neither does his party. The day before nominations are to be filed, neither he nor senior party workers in the capital had any clue where nomination papers have to be filed.</p>
<p>Even the announcement of his candidature has seen much drama. Biswajeet was declared the candidate from South Delhi on the evening of the Ramlila rally when Mamata announced his name as the party’s sole Delhi candidate until then — there have been three more names since. It took the party leadership 24 hours to realise that after delimitation, South Delhi no longer includes the Bengali-dominated Chittaranjan Park.</p>
<p>He was soon shifted to New Delhi. “Even Mukul Roy did not know South Delhi no longer has a large Bengali presence,” the actor said.</p>
<p>Unofficially, though, the message is clear — as the only candidate from Delhi whose name was announced by the party chief herself, the former actor’s campaign is to be a priority over candidates in Chandni Chowk, East and Northwest Delhi. Resources are being pooled and contacts being arranged to get him campaign offices in crucial areas like Karol Bagh and Greater Kailash.</p>
<p>But with increasing discontent over tickets, even party offices in the constituency are hard to come by. Gone is the euphoria that was seen when the Trinamool had announced it was ready to open party offices in every parliamentary constituency. Biswajit himself is clearly rattled by the lack of interest. He is told not to worry.</p>
<p>“There is of course a bit of worry , but even as a debutant actor when I was pitted against some of the biggest names of Bengali cinema, I was never scared. I am proud of the responsibility that I have been entrusted with but my leader has to come here more often to give support to us candidates,” Biswajit told The Indian Express.</p>
<p><strong>Three more for Delhi among TMC’s latest 18</strong></p>
<p>The Trinamool Congress Wednesday announced 18 more candidates in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, including Rae Bareli, Pilibhit and Kanpur. The three seats in Delhi for which candidates have been announced are Chandni Chowk (Hariom Sharma), Northwest Delhi (Harinath Ram) and East Delhi (Mohammed Shahid Siddiqui).</p>
<p>Among the candidates in Uttar Pradesh are Dr Sitaram Rajput (Unnao), Umesh Kumar Mishra (Rae Bareli), Radhika Balyan (Muzaffarnagar), MM Mishra (Azamgarh) and Prabhunarayan Srivastava (Phoolpur).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013704&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Ahead of the first phase of polls for 10 Lok Sabha and 70 Assembly seats in the state, the chief electoral officer of Orissa has asked district election officers and SPs to assess vulnerability of polling stations and prepare a report indicating which polling booths would be covered by central paramilitary force personnel, micro-observers, web-casting facility, video cameras and still cameras.</span></p>
<p>In a letter to district election officers, chief electoral officer Mona Sharma instructed that in polling stations where sufficient still cameras are not available, polling personnel should capture photographs of critical events on their mobile phones. These events include preparation of the EVM, the election observer’s visit, any untoward incident, violation of voting procedure and sealing of EVMs .</p>
<p>Of the 10 Lok Sabha constituencies where polls would be held on April 10, six — Koraput, Berhampur, Nawrangpur, Kandhamal, Sambalpur and Sundargarh — are in Maoist-hit areas. To ensure polls go off smoothly on April 10 and 17, about three lakh polling personnel have been deployed in 35,896 polling stations in the state.</p>
<p>They would get Rs 400 to record clips and capture photographs.</p>
<p><strong>RSS moves court against Rahul’s remark</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thane:</strong> RSS on  Wednesday filed a complaint against Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in a Maharashtra court over his remarks linking the saffron organisation to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. The criminal complaint was filed by Rajesh Kunte, Secretary of RSS unit at Bhiwandi, a powerloom town near here. Addressing a rally at Sonale in Bhiwandi on March 6, Rahul had said, “RSS people killed Gandhiji.” <strong>PTI</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013702&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/subash-ghising.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013700" alt="SubasH ghising  Five years away" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/subash-ghising.jpg" /></a> SubasH ghising<br />Five years away
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">After five years of forced “exile”, GNLF chief Subash Ghising returned to Darjeeling Wednesday, welcomed by the Trinamool Congress which is optimistic this would help end the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha’s monopoly of the hills.</span></p>
<p>Many see the surprise return as yet another sign of the hills heading for multi-party democracy. Before the GJM, it was Ghising’s GNLF that monopolised politics here. The polls this time were already looking different from previous ones with a number of strong contenders, all of whom are campaigning vigorously.</p>
<p>The GJM had prevented Ghising from staying in the hills for the last five years but for a brief interlude during the 2011 assembly polls when he camped there. GJM leaders say he has not come back of his own but been brought back by the Trinamool to dent the support base of the GJM.</p>
<p>Ghising made it clear he is seeking ro revive his political career. Received by around 400 GNLF workers at his home, he held a meeting with them and asserted himself. “I am the original Subash Ghising. And this time I will stay,” he said. “The Gorkha Territorial Authority is in its dying stages. We have to revive the Sixth Schedule demand and find the file that was lost.”</p>
<p>Delighted, Trinamool leaders have sent Ghising a proposal to support its candidate. “We want to build an anti-GJM group here and we need Ghising for that. We have requested him to support the Trinamool candidate. We are ready to ally with his party. Mamata di has always wanted the one-party hill politics to open up,” said Rajen Mukhiya, Trinamool district president.</p>
<p>Ashok Bhattacharya, former CPM minister, said, “It is as transparent as water that Ghising has been brought to the hills by the Trinamool. The TMC, which earlier criticised Ghising and said the CPM colluded with GNLF and destroyed Darjeeling, has now joined hands with the same Ghising. Ghising would not have stayed there if he had not been provided political shelter. But we welcome him as we want a democratic atmosphere.”</p>
<p>Ghising is yet to make it clear whether he will field a candidate of his own or support the Trinamool’s Bhaichung Bhutia. “We have not decided whom we will support,” said Ghising . In 2011, Ghising fielded candidates in three assembly constituencies and each finished second.</p>
<p>S S Ahluwalia, the BJP candidate, too reached Darjeeling Wednesday. “The demand for Gorkhaland is justified. We will look into it,” he said. He held a meeting with leaders of the GJM, which is supporting him.</p>
<p>GJM chief Bimal Gurung, meanwhile, posted on Facebook: “This year’s Lok Sabha election is now clearly divided between those who are supporting Gorkhaland and those who are against the demand. This election is not about local issues but about our long standing demand of Gorkhaland. The BJP is expected to come to power and they have already decided to support our cause. This is a golden opportunity as a government which is set to come in power is supporting our long cherished demand. I, want to appeal to all the Gorkhaland loving people to unite for the sake of Gorkhaland.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013698&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Kicking up a fresh controversy, Union minister Salman Khurshid has compared Narendra Modi to a “nursery child” over claims he has been given a “clean chit” by a lower court in 2002 Gujarat riots.</span></p>
<p>Khurshid, sitting MP from Farukkhabad, targeted the BJP PM candidate again, days after he triggered a row by calling Modi “impotent” for not being able to stop the riots.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who has given Modi a clean chit. A magistrate’s court has not summoned him&#8230;. It is true. It’s like a nursery child getting a good grade and thinking that he has become a doctor and goes around claiming to be a PhD. How can that happen?” he told reporters here on Tuesday in reply to a question.</p>
<p>The External Affairs Minister’s comments came two days after Rahul Gandhi dismissed the talk of a clean chit to the Gujarat Chief Minister.</p>
<p>Modi and BJP leaders have claimed that the verdict by an Ahmedabad court in a 2002 riots case was a “clean chit” for him. Khurshid also said, “In Gujarat, the incidents that happened when he (Modi) was Chief Minister, around 170 people have been given life imprisonment in connection with that. Maya Kodnani was his minister.”</p>
<p>The BJP slammed Khurshid for his remarks, calling it “rubbish”. “He is denigrating the court. What is lower and higher judiciary?,” BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar asked.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013699&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">BJP president Rajnath Singh is expected to formalise an alternative front of six political parties in Tamil Nadu Thursday. </span></p>
<p>He is slated to travel to Chennai to announce a pre-poll alliance between DMDK, BJP, PMK, MDMK, IJK, KDMK as an alternative to the ruling AIADMK and opposition DMK in the state.</p>
<p>The BJP, meanwhile, praised suspended DMK leader Alagiri for reaching out to the saffron party with an offer to support it from outside if it comes to power.</p>
<p>“Alagiri is an important person and an Indian citizen and a voter and he has the strength. So, we are asking him, we are asking everybody,” BJP general secretary in-charge of Tamil Nadu Muralidhar Rao said Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Each and every person counts in making this campaign stronger and stronger&#8230; BJP gaining support from new persons and new quarters is a gain, it is always a gain,” Rao added.</p>
<p>Alagrir had recently met Singh with his offer of support.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013696&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Although there was initial opposition in a section of the state BJP against Mahto’s induction, they fell in line by Wednesday evening. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013690&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The Hemant Soren government in Jharkhand suffered another setback Wednesday when a JMM MLA quit the party to join the BJP. Within a couple of hours, the BJP announced that Vidyut Baran Mahto, who became the fifth MLA to move to a party not part of the ruling JMM-Congress-RJD coalition, will be its candidate for the Jamshedpur Lok Sabha seat.</span></p>
<p>Arjun Munda, who represented Jamshedpur in the 15th Lok Sabha before resigning to become the chief minister for a third time, was widely believed to be responsible for bringing in the first-time MLA from Bahragodda to the BJP fold. Despite appeals from party leaders, Munda himself had refused to contest this time.</p>
<p>Although he never stated reasons for not contesting, party leaders said Munda is driven by the desire to bring down the Hemant Soren government and — after the assembly elections in 2015 — try another shot at the CM’s post.</p>
<p>Soren had come to power by pulling the plug on a BJP-JMM alliance led by Munda.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mahto has come over to the BJP. I am not interested in contesting; I have informed the party about it,” Munda told The Indian Express. With Mahto joining the BJP, he said, “The Hemant Soren government has lost the required number (majority).”</p>
<p>Babulal Marandi, whose JVM(P) has 11 MLAs, met the Governor and submitted a memorandum claiming that the government does not have the numbers anymore.</p>
<p>Till now, three MLAs, including one from the Congress, have quit to join the TMC and two JMM MLAs have gone to the BJP. On July 18 last year, the government had passed its floor test with the support of 43 MLAs. While 37 voting against it, one was absent.</p>
<p>However, it is not a straight transfer of seats to the Opposition yet, as the anti-defection law is likely to apply in the case of Chandra Shekhar “Dadai” Dubey, who moved from the Congress to the TMC, and Hemlal Murmu and Mahto who quit the JMM. “None of these three legislators have informed me. I am considering suo motu action against them,” said Speaker Shashank Shekhar Bhokta. Two other MLAs who quit, Bandhu Tirkey and Chamra Linda, however, have escaped the anti-defection law by merging their single-legislator parties with the TMC.</p>
<p>Although there was initial opposition in a section of the state BJP against Mahto’s induction, they fell in line by Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Choosing a candidate for the Jamshedpur seat itself has been a difficult task for most parties. The JMM declared its candidate only on Wednesday — Niroop Mohanty, a former Tata Steel vice president. The AJSU and TMC are yet to declare candidates.</p>
<p>One reason for the apprehensiveness of the BJP and JMM has been the good performance of JVM(P)’s Ajoy Kumar, the sitting MP who has been re-nominated by his party. “We are hoping that Mahto benefits from the Modi wave,” said a BJP leader.</p>
<p>Ajoy Kumar said there was a plan behind Munda bringing in Mahto to Jamshedpur. “He is not looking for a win from Jamshedpur; he merely wants to bring someone over from the JMM and topple the government,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013690&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/meira.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013691" alt="Medhavi Kirti, Meira Kumar. c r sasikumar" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/meira.jpg" /></a> Medhavi Kirti, Meira Kumar. c r sasikumar
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Just when it looked like a triangular contest between IFS officer Meira Kumar, former IAS officer KP Ramaiah of the JD(U) and the BJP’s Chhedi Paswan, the entry of Medhavi Kirti as the BSP candidate has added a family twist to Sasaram. She is a niece of Meira Kumar, and the BSP believes the influence it has in this constituency, which adjoins UP, will be enough to spoil the chances of the Lok Sabha speaker.</span></p>
<p>Medhavi Kirti, who joined politics soon after postgraduating from New Delhi’s Jawahrlal Nehru University, was a minister in the Devi Lal government in Haryana. Kirti, whose husband Anuj Prakash is an IAS officer, was never a full-time politician even though she had been heading the Congress (J) that had some influence in Haryana politics during the days of Bansi Lal and Choudhary Devi Lal.</p>
<p>Relations have not been cordial between Medhavi — daughter of the late Suresh Ram, only son of former deputy PM Jagjivan Ram — and her aunt for many years now, reportedly after a dispute over land at Palwal in Faridabad. Meira is Suresh Ram’s sister.</p>
<p>Medhavi, who visits Sasaram infrequently, had campaigned for BJP candidate Munilal Ram in the 2004 elections against Meira Kumar, who won that election and retained the seat in 2009. Meira had, however, lost to Chhedi Paswan in 1999. Sasaram was long been represented by Jagjivan Ram. Kirti often talked about how the constituency continued to suffer from neglect under Meira Kumar’s tenure.</p>
<p>After floating the Jagjivan Ram Baba Saheb Ambedkar National Congress (J) in 2012, Medhavi was invited by the BSP to contest from Sasaram because its likely candidate, Pankaj Kumar Ram, joined the JD (U) a few days earlier . She is likely to file her nomination from Sasaram Thursday.</p>
<p>Explaining the rivalry between Meira and Medhavi, a senior Congress leader said: “Blood never unites. It is also about Medhavi often losing out to Meira in staking a claim to Jagjivan Ram’s legacy. While Medhavi was never committed to Bihar, Meira had stayed put here and is the true heir of the Dalit leader’s legacy”.</p>
<p>Congress national spokesperson Prem Chandra Mishra played down Medhavi’s opposition to Meira. “The BSP has some influence in areas bordering UP. It might arouse interest among voters but Medhavi does not pose any threat to Meira Kumar,” he said.</p>
<p>The BSP’s Bihar unit chief Bharat Bind, however, said that Medhavi might spring a surprise and the Congress should not take her lightly. “We have put in our best efforts in this area and have done pretty well in previous assembly elections too. Medhavi can prove that she is as much a claimant of Babu Jagjivan Ram’s legacy as Meira Kumar.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013685&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013686" alt="M K Alagiri" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/m.jpg" /></a> M K Alagiri
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The DMK on Wednesday warned its party workers against hobnobbing with suspended leader M K Alagiri in a bid to keep its cadre together ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.</span></p>
<p>Irrepressible as ever, Alagiri, the Madurai strongman and elder son of DMK supremo M Karunanidhi, hit back at the party by opposing the candidature of former Union telecom minister A Raja, blaming him for the 2G spectrum scam, which he said eventually led to the DMK’s loss in the 2011 Tamil Nadu Assembly polls.</p>
<p>His main target, however, was fierce rival and younger brother M K Stalin with whom a showdown during the Lok Sabha election looks inevitable. The DMK had suspended Alagiri in January and eventually denied him party ticket for the general elections for his persistent attack on Stalin, the heir apparent to Karunanidhi.</p>
<p>The present action came close on the heels of damaging comments Alagiri made during a meeting two days ago with his sympathisers in Madurai, where he charged the dominant Stalin faction with usurping the party and sidelining Karunanidhi.</p>
<p>“&#8230;.The party cadre have been strictly directed not have any contact with Alagiri. Those going against this stern instruction, too, will face disciplinary action,” party general secretary K Anbazhagan said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the censure is almost a reproduction of a diktat against Alagiri that was issued about 14 years ago.</p>
<p>In September 2000, Anbazhagan had ordered the DMK workers to keep off Alagiri after the rivalry between the factions headed by the two brothers intensified, leading to a series of clashes on the streets of Chennai and elsewhere. However, it was the organisation that suffered the most, with the party losing the Assembly elections of 2001. Alagiri was then welcomed back and allowed to play a more significant role in party affairs.</p>
<p>Strengthening rumours that he had preferred to remain in alliance with the Congress, Alagiri has said Karunanidhi came under pressure from a section within the DMK. The lack of unity would cost it heavily in the election, warned Alagiri, adding that his supporters were urging him to teach the DMK a lesson. He, however, has rejected the charge that he was working against the DMK and claimed he only sought to highlight and rectify the issues within the party.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013680&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Left in Kerala has started to target Congress candidate Shashi Tharoor over the death of Sunanda Puskhar. Opposition leader V S Achuthanandan Wednesday questioned why no case was registered against Tharoor for the unnatural death of his wife, his remark following those by two other CPM leaders who went on to be slapped notices by poll authorities.</span></p>
<p>VS said Congress leaders, including A K Antony, should say why Tharoor was not booked. If the wife is found dead under mysterious circumstances within seven years of a marriage, a case should be registered against the husband, he said.</p>
<p>Before V S, CPM state committee member M Vijayakumar said at a function of Left candidates Tuesday, “Tharoor is specialised in certain subjects, which I don’t know about. But he would get a PhD in violence against women.”</p>
<p>Tharoor moved the Election Commission through the district collector, who is the returning officer. He also complained against CPI legislator V S Sunil Kumar who, in a discussion on Reporter TV, alleged that Tharoor had murdered Pushkar. Tharoor said the channel did not bother to edit out the remark. The district collector Wednesday issued notices to both CPM leaders.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013683&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smaller parties based in and around Azamgarh have pledged to give Mulayam Singh Yadav a run for his money.</p>
<p>The Rashtriya Ulama Council, which originated from Azamgarh, says Mulayam’s attempt to collect Muslim votes will not cut much ice with the community and terms the decision an act of desperation. The Peace Party claims it is a serious contender and is not concerned about where the SP chief contests from.</p>
<p>The Qaumi Ekta Dal of gansgter-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari may adopt a more conciliatory approach, as it has reportedly been trying to enter into some kind of understanding with the SP. However, it appears undecided.</p>
<p>RUC vice-president Tahir Madani The Indian Express: “It is an act of desperation by the SP chief. He may be hoping for some damage control but has nothing to woo the minority community with. Muslims supported him in 2012 hoping his government would provide security.</p>
<p>Instead he gave us 150 riots in two years. What happened to the talk of 18 per cent reservation for Muslims and Urdu middle schools in Muslim-dominated areas?”</p>
<p>The RUC will contest at least four seats in UP — Azamgarh, Lalganj (in Azamgarh district, reserved), Jaunpur and Machhlishahr (reserved). In the 2009 elections, the then three-month-old party had performed well here, polling over 50,000 in all four seats. “We have worked hard these five years. These figures will increase,” said Madani.</p>
<p>Madani added the community has moved on since its youths were targeted for alleged terror after the Batla House encounter. It is now thinking about education and employment, the two fronts on which the SP government is widely seen as having failed.</p>
<p>Peace Party chief Dr Mohammad Ayub said: “We are not concerned where Mulayam Singh is contesting from. In any case, elections are won on account of work done by a party for the common man. Merely contesting from one place or the other won’t cut any ice.” Ayub, MLA from Khalilabad, dislikes the “small party” tag. “We are the fifth largest party in the state. We have four MLAs in the assembly and we have already announced 46 candidates.”</p>
<p>For the QED, party leader Mohd Mujahid said, “Obviously, if Mulayam has come here, it will have some effect.” There has been talk about Ansari (now in jail) contesting from Varanasi because of likely polarisation with Narendra Modi contesting from there.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013678&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a time when the Trinamool Congress is struggling to get good candidates for seats in north India, the announcement of Hema Malini as the BJP candidate from Mathura came as a blow to the party. The party’s lone MLA in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly, Shyamsundar Sharma, who had won from Math, had told the party leadership that he is willing to fight from Mathura provided the BJP does not field the yesteryear’s “Dream Girl”. The reason: having won eight elections, Sharma does not want to spoil his track record.</p>
<p><strong>KEEN TO CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Even as the Congress is grappling with the problem of sitting MPs and ministers opting out of the Lok Sabha contest, there is suddenly a scramble in the party with senior leaders offering to contest against BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Varanasi. While former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri’s son Anil Shastri, who had been elected from Varanasi in 1989, has expressed willingness to contest from there again if the party asks him to, two more leaders, including Rajya Sabha MPs Digvijaya Singh and Anand Sharma, are also said to be keen on taking on Modi. These potential and aspiring giant-killers may have to wait though as the party high command is in no hurry to finalise the candidate for Varanasi that goes to poll in the last phase on May 12.</p>
<p><strong>HEALTH FIRST</strong><br />
Anticipating a hot summer during the Lok Sabha polls, the Election Commission of India is not taking any chances in ensuring the well-being of those engaged in poll duties. The EC has decided to provide oral rehydration salts (ORS) to all the polling parties. The polling parties will also be directed to provide these ORS mixtures to any voter who might require it due to extreme heat conditions. Authorities have also been directed to prepare a hand-bill of “Dos and Donts” to tackle heat-stroke cases.</p>
<p><strong>MINISTER’S CHOICE</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Joint Secretary level vacancy in the HRD Ministry has been filled by a surprise candidate. While 1995-batch IAS officers from the ministry’s School Education department — Maninder Kaur Dwivedi and M Ariz Ahammed, who are about to be empanelled as JS — were said to be in the running, it is finally Y S K Seshu Kumar who has got the job. There is a good reason for his elevation too. Kumar, an Indian Forest Service officer of 1987 batch from Uttar Pradesh cadre, who took over as JS Adult Education in the ministry on Wednesday, was Officer on Special Duty to minister M M Pallam Raju. Kumar, in fact, has been with Raju since his days as MoS, Defence.</p>
<p><strong>THE REPLACEMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The Koraput Central University in Orissa is faced with a peculiar problem these days: who should replace current V-C Surabhi Banerjee, whose term has ended. As per the directions from the HRD Ministry, the senior most professor should be given charge. However, the Koraput varsity, being a rather young one, apparently has only assistant professors on its rolls. An exasperated Banerjee has now sought to know from the ministry as to how she can hand over charge to an assistant professor. It is learnt that the ministry is considering giving the V-C of Hyderabad’s Maulana Azad National Urdu University additional charge of Koraput varsity until a full-time V-C is appointed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013669&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mulayam-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988097" alt="Ramakant Yadav, the sitting MP, himself has ruled out any chance of joining the SP, claiming that he will defeat Mulayam." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mulayam-main.jpg" /></a> Ramakant Yadav, the sitting MP, himself has ruled out any chance of joining the SP, claiming that he will defeat Mulayam.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A day after Mulayam Singh Yadav announced his candidature from Azamgarh, Samajwadi Party leaders have set about trying to win BJP candidate Ramakant Yadav over to their side. </span></p>
<p>Ramakant Yadav, the sitting MP, himself has ruled out any chance of joining the SP, claiming that he will defeat Mulayam. “My victory margin will be higher than Narendra Modi’s in Varanasi,” Ramakant told The Indian Express Wednesday.</p>
<p>A number of SP leaders are optimistic, however, that sooner or later Ramakant will cross over. Ramkant is a four-term MP and his victories in 1996 and 1999 had come on an SP ticket.</p>
<p>The SP in Azamgarh has two camps, one led by Durga Prasad Yadav and the other by Balram Yadav, both ministers. SP sources say Balram has lost much of his public support in Azamgarh and is against having Ramakant back in the SP as that would reduce his stature in the party further. Balram had returned the party ticket from Azamgarh. Durga Prasad Yadav, on the other hand, is reported to be open to Ramakant joining the SP.</p>
<p>The SP’s efforts to win Ramakant back have twin objectives. One, it would upset BJP calculations with the sitting MP surrendering his ticket in favour of Mulayam; two, it would send a message across eastern UP that Yadavs are under one umbrella. If Ramakant does return, SP leaders say they are open to “rehabilitating” him from another seat, possibly Jaunpur, and “adjusting” his elder brother Umakant Yadav suitably. Umakant is a former BSP MP.</p>
<p>“For Ramakant, the options are limited. The most he can hope for is to turn a martyr for the BJP with his inevitable defeat to Mulayam Singh,” said a senior SP leader. “He has been an old colleague and still has respect for Mulayam Singh.”</p>
<p>This SP leader is in Lucknow from Azamgarh to thank Mulayam for his decision to contest Azamgarh. Several leaders from there — Ram Asrey Vishwakarma, Hawaldar Yadav, Nafees Ahmed — are also in Lucknow.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013672&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Three mysterious hoardings came up in Bhopal Wednesday, welcoming L K Advani to contest from this constituency. They were seemingly authorised by the BJP’s district unit, though no one is spelling out who actually put them up and at whose instructions they were removed around noon, State leaders did not disown them either, attributing the message to workers’ wishes.</span></p>
<p>Coming after sitting MP Kailash Joshi’s invitation to Advani, Wednesday’s “message” fuelled conspiracy theories about the rivalry between Narendra Modi and Advani, the latter’s newfound love for Bhopal, his closeness to Shivraj Singh Chouhan whose achievements he rates higher than Modi’s — besides local rivalries.</p>
<p>Bhopal district chief Alok Sharma is a contender for the seat and so was Joshi till very recently, besides mayor Krishna Gaur. Joshi, who in 2009 had refused to vacate the seat for Sushma Swaraj saying he was no football, went into a sulk after Advani’s candidature was announced from Gandhinagar because he had vacated the seat for him. Until last week, Joshi had dug his heels in before he was persuaded to retire gracefully.</p>
<p>Former chief minister Babulal Gaur, Krishna’s father-in-law, maintained he was confident about her candidature because Advani would contest only from Gandhinagar. There was talk that the display of posters was a result of rivalry among local contenders bent on scuttling one another’s chances.</p>
<p>TV channels fuelled some of the gossip by announcing the posters had come up across the city when, in fact, there were only three — Roshanpura Square, Lal Parade Ground and Moti Masjid.</p>
<p>In the end, the interest in the seat remained unrequited because the party chose not to announce a candidate.</p>
<p>The BJP has held Bhopal for two-and-a-half decades. This was one reason why Sushma had wanted to contest from here in 2009.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013665&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The wife of the Kerala college lecturer, whose hand was chopped off after he allegedly insulted the Prophet, was found dead in their house in Muvattupuzha. </span></p>
<p>Months after the lecturer, T J Joseph was attacked in 2010, the Catholic management of New Man College in Thodupuzha had suspended him from service and sources within the family said his wife Salomy was dejected by the Church’s reluctance to reinstate him as he was the sole breadwinner of the family. Her body was found hanging on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Despite demands from the state government, civil society and the university that Joseph be reinstated, the Catholic Church had taken no action. After being removed from service, Joseph had said the management’s move had pained him more than the attack he had faced from alleged Popular Front of India activists.</p>
<p>Sources said Salomy took the extreme step after she realised that Joseph would not be reinstated before March 31, the day he was to retire from service. In that case, Joseph would naturally be denied any salary or benefit.</p>
<p>Advocate Ramkumar on Wednesday said the management had tried to delay Joseph’s reinstatement until his retirement and that a criminal case should be filed against the diocese of Kothamangalam and the college management.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013663&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A candidate put forth by the Union Human Resource Development Ministry for the post of vice-chancellor to the Inter-University Centre (IUC) for Teacher Education in HRD Minister Pallam Raju’s constituency Kakinada, is under the ministry’s scanner on allegations of sexual harassment.</span></p>
<p>It is learnt that the ministry has constituted a committee to look into the complaints made against Chairman of National institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), Dr S S Jena, by a former employee.</p>
<p>While Jena was chosen to lead the new IUC, his candidature came into question when the issue of vigilance clearance came up.Taking cognizance of sexual harassment complaints that surfaced against Jena during the clearance, a four-member committee was formed.</p>
<p>The committee is made up of joint secretary, HRD ministry, Veena Ish, Jyoti Pahwa, under secretary, school education department and Dr Reny Jacob from the Delhi Commission for Women, besides an under secretary-level official from the vigilance department.</p>
<p>Depending on this panel’s report, the vigilance clearance will be decided for Jena’s appointment, senior officials from the HRD ministry said.</p>
<p>When contacted, Jena said the complaints against him were motivated. “Let the committee decide. These complaints are motivated. Let the truth come out and it will be clear. The ministry is looking into the matter,” he told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>The HRD Ministry said it was taking a serious view of the complaints.</p>
<p>Of late, there have been several complaints of sexual harassment against heads of institutions and their faculty. In 2010, a fact-finding committee had found a vice-chancellor of the Rajiv Gandhi University in Itanagar guilty of sending lewd emails and messages to a faculty member.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013659&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sri-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013606" alt="Sri Sri urged his followers to usher in “change” to save the country, which he said was on a “ventilator”. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sri-med.jpg" /></a> Sri Sri urged his followers to usher in change to save the country, which he said was on a “ventilator”. (PTI)
<p>Spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar on Tuesday reminded followers of the intrinsic relationship between wealth and the lotus in Hindu mythology, an obvious reference to the election symbol of the BJP.</p>
<p>Sri Sri urged his followers to usher in “change” to save the country, which he said was on a “ventilator”.</p>
<p>“Lakshmi kamal pe hi baith ke aati hai (The goddess of wealth rides on the lotus),” Sri Sri said to a gathering of teachers of Art of Living (AOL), devotees, and other people in Vasant Vihar in south Delhi.</p>
<p>Expressing concern over the current state of India’s economy and politics, the guru said, “Desh ventilator pe hai. Isko bachana hai. (The country is on a ventilator. We must save it.)”</p>
<p>An AOL teacher, who had come from west Delhi to attend the gathering, told The Indian Express that Sri Sri had asked devotees to vote for change. “Guruji said that we must now let the old government rest. We need a stable government and an experienced person to lead us,” said the teacher, who declined to give her name.</p>
<p>Sri Sri reportedly gave the example of an uphill ride in a car, when an experienced driver would be preferable to one without any experience. In the same vein, he is learnt to have said that if a person was undergoing surgery, he would want an experienced surgeon rather than an inexperienced one.</p>
<p>Responding to questions on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Sri Sri said, “AAP achchhe hain, magar kachche hain. (AAP are good, but they are inexperienced.)”</p>
<p>AOL volunteers had extended support in large numbers to India Against Corruption’s 2011 movement led jointly by Anna Hazare and Arvind Kejriwal. Most of them are, however, disenchanted with AAP now.</p>
<p>“Jhadu lagaane ke liye haath toh uthaana hi padta hai (One needs to use the ‘Hand’ to sweep with the ‘Broom’),” Surbhi Gupta, a 19-year old Delhi University student and AOL volunteer said, referring to AAP being supported by the Congress.</p>
<p>“I was extremely disappointed when AAP decided to quit in 49 days. The public gave them five years to show their work, and they should have performed in this period. This is the first Lok Sabha election in which I will vote, and my vote will go to BJP,” she said.</p>
<p>The BJP candidate from East Delhi, Mahesh Girri, met Sri Sri on Wednesday to seek the guru’s blessings before beginning his election campaign. Girri has been associated with AOL for over a decade, having served as the foundation’s international director, and led its various social initiatives.</p>
<p>AOL volunteers have been going around in their localities since January conducting “Happiness Surveys” that seek people’s responses on governance and the coming elections. The idea is to gauge the mood over the issues that will decide these elections, the relative popularity of parties, and levels of voter satisfaction or dissatisfaction over corruption, inflation, etc.</p>
<p>The volunteers have also been reportedly visiting colleges and educational institutions to encourage the youth to vote.</p>
<p>Manju Marwah, a 29-year-old volunteer, told The Indian Express, “About 80 per cent of the youth we interacted with in colleges do not have voter ID cards. They are not concerned about the state of affairs in the country. But Guruji said we must encourage them to vote, explain to them the importance of exercising this right, and fulfill our duty as citizens of the nation.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013598&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/anand-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013589" alt="Sharma, Commerce and Industries Minister and a Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan, belongs to Himachal Pradesh and is a Brahmin leader. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/anand-med.jpg" /></a> Sharma, Commerce and Industries Minister and a Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan, belongs to Himachal Pradesh and is a Brahmin leader. (PTI)
<p>Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma on Wednesday expressed his willingness to take on BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in Lok Sabha election for Varanasi seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Definitely. I will pack my bag and leave tomorrow for Varanasi if so desired by the (Congress) party&#8221;, he said when asked if he would consider fighting Modi in coming general elections.</p>
<p>Sharma&#8217;s remarks came amid media speculation that a known Modi-baiter Digvijay Singh, the AICC general secretary, may be chosen to take on Modi in Varanasi. Singh had been in-charge of party affairs for UP for a long time.</p>
<p>However, senior Congress leaders concerned with nomination finalisation process feigned ignorance when asked about the possibility of Singh&#8217;s candidature from the seat.</p>
<p>Sharma, Commerce and Industries Minister and a Rajya Sabha member from Rajasthan, belongs to Himachal Pradesh and is a Brahmin leader. There is a view in a section of the party that after the exit of sitting BJP MP Murli Manohar Joshi from the electoral battle in the holy city, it will be advantageous for Congress to field a Brahmin candidate.</p>
<p>Joshi himself was keen to contest from Varanasi but BJP leadership persuaded him to vacate the seat in favour of Modi.</p>
<p>Joshi will now be fighting elections from Kanpur.</p>
<p>On putting up a joint front against Modi in Varanasi, Sharma said &#8220;we are very clear about it. Congress party is not going to vacate that political space of fighting the elections on its own symbol, its own candidate and own flag.  It&#8217;s a clash of ideologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wherever he (Modi) will contest, Congress will fight against him&#8230;I am a disciplined soldier of Congress and I will be more than happy to take on somebody like Narendra Modi. It is for the leader (to decide).&#8221;</p>
<p>Congress leadership is already considering the names of three candidates for Varanasi. &#8220;Congress will field a strong candidate and we will fight with full strength,&#8221; Sharma earlier said addressing a press briefing at AICC.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013586&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Indian Air Force on Wednesday formally inducted Russia-made MI-17 V5 series helicopters, known for their manoeuvring and weight-carrying capacity, at its Jamnagar base in Gujarat.</p>
<p>Air Officer Commanding–in–Chief, South Western Air Command(SWAC) Air Marshal Daljit Singh handed over the helicopters to the helicopter unit of the Jamnagar air base.</p>
<p>&#8220;MI-17 will increase the capabilities of the unit in undertaking multifarious missions, especially in Saurashtra and Kutch regions of Gujarat,&#8221; Air Marshal Daljit singh said.</p>
<p>This helicopter unit was raised on March 3, 1972 in Guwahati. It was later shifted to Jamnagar in 1990. &#8220;The unit has the proud distinction of having served across the length and breadth of country and across the spectrum of helicopter operations since its raising,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been an integral part of relief operations during the massive earthquake at Bhuj and in tragedies like flash floods or shipping accidents,&#8221; Singh added. MI-17 V5 helicopters successfully evacuated a large number of people from Uttarakhand last year when flash floods struck the hill state.</p>
<p>&#8220;The multi-purpose Mi-17 V5 is equipped with state-of-the-art avionics and navigation systems such as on-board weather radar and autopilot,&#8221; said defence PRO Colonel S D Goswami. &#8220;The Mi-17 V5 chopper, a medium-lift helicopter which can carry over 5 tonnes of load, also has advanced night-vision equipment and a glass cockpit,&#8221; Colonel Goswami added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013571&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A twenty two-year-old married woman was not only raped by a muscleman, but also paraded naked in public, after she revealed the incident to villagers at Kachikanakheda village, near the historic Sanchi town in the district, the police said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The accused, Saudan Singh (40), had raped the woman two days ago while she attended nature&#8217;s call and threatened her not to reveal the incident to anyone, Sanchi police station in-charge Purnendra Singh said.</p>
<p>However, when the woman protested and revealed the incident to the people, the accused entered her residence forcibly and disrobed her, after which he pulled her out of her house by her hair.</p>
<p>When villagers who gathered at the spot, gave her clothes to cover herself, the accused disrobed her once again.</p>
<p>Later, her husband reached the spot and took her inside the house, the police said.</p>
<p>The victim then reported the matter to the police, after which he was arrested on Tuesday and produced before a court, which sent him to jail under judicial custody.</p>
<p>The police also seized the survivor&#8217;s torn clothes from the spot, the police said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013580&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/plane-1-480.jpg" /></a> An unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER is under way involving 26 nations.
<p>India on Wednesday received fresh request from Malaysia to search for missing Airlines jetliner. Reports suggested that Indian Navy has agreed to participate in the search as its aircraft got ready for the hunt of the plane with 239 people on board.</p>
<p>Earlier, the investigators probing the disappearance of the plane believed it most likely flew into the southern Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>New search area requested by Malaysia spanned 5000 nm south and south west of Jakarta in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/p1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2013573" alt="p1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/p1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=366" width="480" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>Sources said, India will commit only long range maritime reconnaissance aircraft for the search.</p>
<p>No wreckage has been found from Flight MH370, which vanished from air traffic control screens off Malaysia’s east coast at 1:21 am local time on March 8 (1721 GMT March 7), less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/p2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2013574" alt="p2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/p2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=366" width="480" height="366" /></a></p>
<p>An unprecedented search for the Boeing 777-200ER is under way involving 26 nations in two vast search “corridors”: one arcing north overland from Laos towards the Caspian Sea, the other curving south across the Indian Ocean from west of Indonesia’s Sumatra island to west of Australia.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pil_in_bombay_h16451-001.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013561" alt="PIL_in_Bombay_H16451 00" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pil_in_bombay_h16451-001.jpg" /></a> The PIL demands the government to properly spell out the status of Hindi language. (PTI)
<p>A PIL has urged the Bombay High Court to issue a direction to the Union government to spell out the status of Hindi language and also to rename the country as &#8216;Bharat&#8217; and not &#8216;India&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is ambiguity in respect of Hindi language&#8230; In some text books it is termed as &#8216;official language&#8217; while in<br />
others it is called as Raj bhasha (state language) or &#8216;Rashtra Bhasha&#8217; (national language). Some books even refer to Hindi as &#8216;sampark bhasha&#8217; (contact language),&#8221; the PIL said.</p>
<p>The government should clear this ambiguity in the school text books and declare what is the actual status of Hindi language.</p>
<p>The PIL, filed recently, also expressed concern with the dual name of the country viz &#8216;India&#8217; and &#8216;Bharat&#8217;. &#8220;The<br />
country should be known as &#8216;Bharat&#8217; and citizenship as &#8216;Bhartiya&#8221;, the petition, based on RTI, said.</p>
<p>The petition argues that just as an individual cannot have two names, the country also cannot be called by two<br />
different names viz India, Bharat or Hindustan.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Britishers ruled the country, its name was changed from &#8216;Bharat&#8217; to &#8216;India&#8217;. After Independence, it<br />
continued to be known as India. The country should be called as &#8216;Bharat&#8217; which is its original name,&#8221; the PIL said.</p>
<p>The petition, filed by RTI activist Manoranjan Roy, said he had received a reply from Ministry of Home Affairs in<br />
New Delhi stating that under the provisions of Constitution, Hindi was the official language of the Union although there was no provision for national language in the constitution.</p>
<p>As far as the name of the country was concerned, the government reply said that no such information was available with the department. A copy of the reply was annexed to PIL. The respondents to the petition are the Union of India and State of Maharashtra. The PIL would come up for hearing in due course.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013549&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

In its strongholds, the party has already announced the names of 32 candidates from West Bengal, 15 from Kerala and two from Tripura.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013488&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>With Russia facing sanctions from the US and some other countries after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine, India today made it clear that it will not support any &#8220;unilateral measures&#8221; against Russian government.</p>
<p>&#8220;India has never supported unilateral sanctions against any country e.g Iraq or Iran. Therefore, we will also not support any unilateral measures by a country or a group of countries,&#8221; sources in the government said in New Delhi.</p>
<p>The remarks came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin explained the situation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who underlined India&#8217;s position on &#8220;unity and territorial integrity&#8221; of countries and hoped a diplomatic solution would be found to the issue.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon had said, &#8220;There are legitimate Russian and other interests involved and we hope they are discussed and resolved.&#8221;</p>
<p>The US and the EU have imposed sanctions on several officials from Russia and Ukraine accused of involvement in Moscow&#8217;s actions in the Black Sea peninsula. Australia has also announced its decision to impose financial and travel sanctions on a dozen political figures from the region.</p>
<p>Putin signed the treaty last night with the Russian- backed leaders of Crimea, pressing ahead with an annexation that Washington and Ukraine&#8217;s new government say is illegal and unacceptable.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013513&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>RSS on Wednesday filed a complaint against Rahul Gandhi in a Maharashtra court over his remarks linking the saffron organisation to the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint was filed by Rajesh Kunte, Secretary of RSS unit at Bhiwandi, a powerloom town near here.</p>
<p>Addressing a rally at Sonale in Bhiwandi on March 6, Rahul had said, &#8220;RSS people killed Gandhiji.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his complaint to the court, Kunte said the remarks were defamatory and sought action against the Congress leader.</p>
<p>BJP has already moved the Election Commission against the Congress Vice President.</p>
<p>&#8220;I registered a criminal complaint against Rahul Gandhi with the First Class Magistrate Court at Bhiwandi. Through his speech, he has harmed the reputation of our organisation. The remarks were made with an ulterior motive,&#8221; Kunte told PTI.</p>
<p>&#8220;His allegation, that RSS men killed Mahatma Gandhi, was against the judicial verdict in the case. This is a<br />
deliberate attempt for electoral gains,&#8221; he alleged.</p>
<p>The court is likely to hear the matter on March 27.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013470&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modibjp.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013491" alt="If recent barbs against BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate are any indication, this election often seems to be about defining Narendra Modi. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modibjp.jpg" /></a> If recent barbs against BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate are any indication, this election often seems to be about defining Narendra Modi.
<p>Days after he called Narendra Modi&#8217;s impotent in relation to his handling of the Gujarat riots of 20012, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid fired a fresh salvo at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, calling him a nursery student who thinks he is a PhD.</p>
<p><a title="When politicians turn on politicians, the most insulting insults" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/when-politicians-turn-on-politicians-the-most-insulting-insults/" target="_blank">ALSO READ: THE MOST INSULTING INSULTS BY POLITICIANS</a></p>
<p>With the election season hotting up, the war of words among politicians is becoming the order of the day. If the recent barbs against BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate are any indication, this election often seems to be about defining Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>We take a look at the barbs on Narendra Modi in recent times that made the headlines:</p>
<p><strong>Modi, a nursery student: Salman Khurshid</strong></p>
<p>External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid scaled up his attack against Modi calling him a nursery student who thinks he is a PhD. Speaking to mediapersons in Farrukhabad on Wednesday, Khurshid referred to the ‘clean chit’ to Modi in connection with the 2002 Gujarat riots, saying the Supreme Court has never given one to the BJP leader. &#8220;It’s like a nursery student, who after securing good marks is assuming himself  to be a doctor and a PhD,&#8221; the veteran Congress leader went on to say.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi-m4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2011836" alt="modi-m" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi-m4.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Modi, an impotent: Salman Khurshid</strong></p>
<p>At a rally in Farrukhabad earlier this month, Khurshid called Modi impotent&#8217; in relation to his handling of the post-Godhra riots in 2002. Without naming Modi directly, Khurshid, who is a sitting Member of Parliament from Farrukhabad, asked why a man who aspires to be the prime minister of the country could not do anything during the 2002 riots. &#8220;We don&#8217;t accuse you (Modi) of killing people&#8230; Hamara aarop hai ki tum napunsak ho. (Our accusation is that you are impotent). You couldn&#8217;t stop the killers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Modi, a Hitler: Rahul Gandhi/ Nitish Kumar</strong></p>
<p>Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi launched a blistering attack on Modi on his home turf by comparing him with Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. &#8220;There are two kinds of leaders. The first type like Gandhiji belongs to those who go among people, have some ideology. Then there is another kind of leader, whose best example is perhaps Hitler. Hitler thought there was no need to go to people. He believed entire knowledge of the world is only in his mind. That kind of leader only talks that he did this and that. That leader does not require to go to people,&#8221; he said without naming anybody.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi-m1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2007854" alt="modi-m" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi-m1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar too did the Hitler comparison, saying Modi lacked the qualities to become a  Prime Minister. In his 90-minute speech at a JD(U) convention, Nitish said: &#8220;He (Modi) is behaving like Hitler by propagating fascism,&#8221; Kumar said, adding the people of the country will never make him the PM.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Modi, a monkey: Arjun Modhwadia/ Salman Khurshid</strong></p>
<p>Gujarat Congress president Arjun Modhwadia during a public meeting in Vadodara criticised Modi for repeatedly targeting Prime Minister Manmohan as he compared the state chief minister to a monkey. He talked of a monkey challenging the king of jungle to a duel from the top of a tree. &#8220;The king of the jungle will not climb the tree but the monkey will have to come down to the land some time,&#8221; he was quoted as saying. The slug fest between Congress and BJP turned personal, when in a TV interview Salman Khurshid too likened Modi to a monkey and said that he pulls crowds because his rallies are like monkey shows where people gather around to watch the monkey perform.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modisupportersm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2003086" alt="MODISUPPORTERSM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modisupportersm.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Modi, a Ravan: Ambika Chaudhary</strong></p>
<p>The UP minister sparked a controversy by seeking to draw a comparison between Narendra Modi and demon king Ravan.  Addressing a public meeting at Bairia, Handicapped and Backward Welfare Minister Ambika Chaudhary said the manner in which king of Lanka Ravan was arrogant, similar was the case with Modi.</p>
<p><strong>Modi, a Yamraj: Rashid Alvi</strong></p>
<p>AICC spokesperson Rashid Alvi appeared to compare Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi with &#8216;Yamraj&#8217;, when he said: &#8220;Had he intended to indicate Narendra Modi he would not have referred to somebody riding a horse but somebody riding a buffalo (Yama&#8217;s vehicle) &#8230; Rahulji has talked about somebody coming on a horse, he must be referring to a messiah.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/modirally_480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1991402" alt="Modirally_480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/modirally_480.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Modi, Maut ka saudagar: Sonia Gandhi</strong></p>
<p>Sonia Gandhi had during the campaign for the 2007 Gujarat Assembly polls called Modi a merchant of death for the 2002 riots in the state in the aftermath of the Godhra train carnage.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kej-nd-modi-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013486" alt="Congress leadership has already shortlisted three candidates for Varanasi to take on Modi." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kej-nd-modi-med.jpg" /></a> Congress leadership has already shortlisted three candidates for Varanasi to take on Modi.
<p>Narendra Modi could be in for a tough fight in Varanasi with the Congress declaring its resolve to put up a formidable candidate against the BJP&#8217;s PM  nominee in the Lok Sabha polls and ruling out support to AAP&#8217;s Arvind Kejriwal.</p>
<p>Congress leadership has already shortlisted three candidates for Varanasi to take on Modi and the final choice will be announced soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many names under consideration for Varanasi seat. Congress will field a strong candidate and we will fight with full strength,&#8221; party spokesman and Union Minister Anand Sharma told reporters. To a question as to why Congress is not announcing its candidate and whether it could support Kejriwal&#8217;s candidature, Sharma said, &#8220;Is there any dearth of candidates? It will be declared in the party list in time. The question does not arise (of supporting Kejriwal). Congress will fight the battle on  its own strength. Congress is a national party and will fight on the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>A senior party leader said on the condition of anonymity that the party will put up &#8220;strong&#8221; candidates against Modi in both Varanasi and the Gujarat seat from which he would be contesting.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the AICC had urged all like minded parties to support its nominee in Varanasi in the &#8220;battle against communalism&#8221;. &#8220;Do not be surprised if Varanasi witnesses a similar spectacle as Ghaziabad from where BJP chief Rajnath Singh ran away after Congress fielded Raj Babbar,&#8221; party spokesman Randeep Surjewala had said.<br />
The remarks of Surjewala came two days after party General Secretary Madhusudan Mistry had declared that the Congress will give a &#8220;good fight&#8221; to Modi on Varanasi seat and did not rule out fielding an &#8216;outsider&#8217;.</p>
<p>Among the local candidates, the names of Rajesh Mishra and Ajay Rai are doing the rounds. A section in the Congress wants an influential leader pitched against Modi, while others want a celebrity to be fielded against him.</p>
<p>A section views that after the exit of BJP veteran Murli Manohar Joshi from the electoral contest from the holy city, the Congress fielding a Brahmin candidate could be advantageous.</p>
<p>Senior Congress leader Anil Shastri in a tweet had said &#8220;If BSP &amp; SP are serious on defeating Modi from Varanasi, theyalongwith Congress should put up a joint candidate against him&#8221;. AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal has declared that he was ready to take on Modi in Varanasi but linked his final call to the people&#8217;s approval there.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013480&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday said Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi cannot escape &#8220;moral responsibility&#8221; for the 2002 post-Godhra riots notwithstanding the &#8220;clean chit&#8221; given to him by a court.</p>
<p>Pawar at the same time said he respected the verdict of the court that exonerated the BJP Prime Ministerial candidate in a Gujarat riots case.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court has said something that we have to respect. But I also say, if I am a CM of the state, and if something happens like this(riots), I cannot bypass my responsibility, moral responsibility,&#8221; the Union Agriculture Minister told a news channel.</p>
<p>On being specifically asked whether he believed that Modi had the moral responsibility when riots broke out in Gujarat, Pawar replied,&#8221; Any CM including Narendra Modi.&#8221;</p>
<p>On his earlier statement that Modi should no longer be held responsible for the communal violence as a court has exonerated him, Pawar reiterated that decision of the court should be respected.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013476&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unhappy over the distribution of tickets for the Lok Sabha elections, BJP workers staged a demonstration at the party office and in Ballia on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Even as Congress MP Jagdambika Pal joined BJP in New Delhi, party workers from his constituency Domariyaganj and nearby areas continued their sit-in at party office  against his inclusion in the party.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, they had demanded that Pal not be given a ticket for the Lok Sabha polls, claiming he had engineered the fall of BJP government of Kalyan Singh in 1998 and later became the chief minister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Party leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee had to sit on a dharna against it,&#8221; they had said. In Ballia, party workers protested against Salempur candidate Ravindra Kushwaha by burning his and party presidnet Rajnath Singh&#8217;s effigy.</p>
<p>Two factions &#8211; one demanding ticket to former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar&#8217;s son Pankaj Shekhar and the other to former MLA Ram Iqbal Singh &#8211; held protests saying the current candidate Kushwaha was &#8220;unsuitable&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013469&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/fbtwitterm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013466" alt="In the recent Delhi Assembly polls, the AAP had used Facebook and Twitter in a big way to draw support for itself. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/fbtwitterm.jpg" /></a> In the recent Delhi Assembly polls, the AAP had used Facebook and Twitter in a big way to draw support for itself. (Reuters)
<p>With political parties using social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook in a big way for campaigning in Lok Sabha polls, Election Commission has issued detailed guidelines for political advertisements on such platforms that include obtaining certification for contents before putting them in public domain.</p>
<p>The Election Commission has also asked the social networking sites to maintain expenditure incurred by the political parties and individual candidates on advertisements so that they can be produced to the Commission when requested for.</p>
<p>In separate letters to major social networking sites on Tuesday, the Commission directed them to ensure that contents displayed by them during the electoral process was not &#8220;unlawful or malicious or violative of the model code of conduct&#8221;.</p>
<p>It said the guidelines to the social media have been issued as part of the Commission&#8217;s broad efforts to address the problem of paid news.</p>
<p>All major political parties have been using the social networking sites as part of their campaign strategy, particularly to woo the young voters. In the recent Delhi Assembly polls, the Aam Aadmi Party had used Facebook and Twitter in a big way to draw support for itself.</p>
<p>Director in Election Commission Dhirender Ojha said the directive of the Commission will be applicable to a range of internet-based social media which include Twitter, YouTube, Facebook and Wikipedia.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have told the social networking sites to take pre-certification from Media Certification and Monitoring Committees at district and State levels,&#8221; he said while addressing a workshop on media&#8217;s role in the electoral process.</p>
<p>He said it was part of Commission&#8217;s efforts to address the problem of paid news.</p>
<p>The commission has already issued directions for providing details of social media accounts by the candidates while filing their nominations.</p>
<p>Ojha said it was mandatory for political parties and individual candidates to keep details of expenditure incurred on advertisement in social media. He said the expenses will be accounted for in the total expenditure incurred by the candidates.</p>
<p>He said the guidelines for the social networking sites for political advertisements have been finalised after a series of meetings with them by the Election Commission.</p>
<p>Speaking at the workshop, Delhi&#8217;s Chief Electoral Officer Vijay Dev said the EC would try its best to prevent candidates and political parties from &#8220;misusing&#8221; the social media but at the same time maintained that it was not attempting to &#8220;throttle&#8221; the social media.</p>
<p>Ojha said provisions of model code of conduct and related instructions of the Commission will be applicable for content being posted on the internet, including social media websites, by candidates and political parties.</p>
<p>He admitted that monitoring contents in the social media was an uphill task but asserted that every effort will be made to maintain decorum in the campaign and ensure a level playing field for all the candidates.</p>
<p>He said as servers of major social networking sites were in foreign countries, it was difficult to even track the origin of the contents.</p>
<p>In the letter to social networking sites, the Commission said internet-based media will have to carry out &#8220;active scrutiny&#8221; of the political advertisement before putting them for public view.</p>
<p>&#8220;In case any unlawful content coming to the notice of the election machinery and brought to the attention of the internet-based media, the same would be removed forthwith,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>In an earlier directive, the Commission had said legal provisions relating to election campaigning apply to social media in the same manner in which they apply to any other form of election campaigning using any other media.</p>
<p>Dev said expenses on social media by candidates political and parties will be monitored by the Commission and appropriate action would be taken against violators as per law.</p>
<p>He said the Commission had received two complaints regarding use of social media in assembly polls in December last year.</p>
<p>Identifying paid news as a major challenge, he appealed to the media to exercise &#8220;self imposed restrictions and discipline&#8221; to address the problem.</p>
<p>Ojha termed paid news as a complex menace that &#8220;circumvents&#8221; election expenditure laws and vitiates the electoral process.</p>
<p>Dev said 54 cases of paid news were reported during the Delhi Assembly polls last year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013454&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The non-profit organisations in India have come a long way from being a scarce entity.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013394&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The non-profit organisations in India have come a long way from being a scarce entity to having all kinds of resources for the benefit of the underprivileged. Most organisations are committed and have been known to do much for the society but some have also been known to indulge in transgressions and unscrupulous activities.</p>
<p>The sprawling non-profit sector is sometimes even looked at with suspicion and misgivings. But the few who give this noble sector a foul name have failed to discourage those whose selfless commitment to their cause has gone on undeterred.</p>
<p>A recent online survey reflects quite a few entities that have attracted funds and aid from across the globe due to their transparent and accountable nature of operations. Relief India Trust is one such organisation which believes that ‘NGOs are in the &#8220;credibility market&#8221; and they cannot afford to be above accountability.’ RIT has relentlessly pursued services towards those who have been left behind in the race of life.</p>
<p>The organisation is engaged in voluminous exercises to alleviate the conditions of life. One of the areas in which the organisation has made huge contribution and continues to do so is environment.</p>
<p>“We believe maintaining a healthy environment is central to increasing quality of life and years of healthy life. Globally, nearly 25 percent of all deaths and the total disease burden can be attributed to environmental factors. We are trying to do our bit through promotion and conservation of natural resources available,” said Shikha Dhawan, chief aid officer.</p>
<p>The services undertaken by Relief Trust India include creation of environment awareness, clean-up programmes, forest conservation, green energy and tackling pollution. The body has also received support from foreign as well as national entities in its endeavour.</p>
<p>Relief India Trust, in connection with other NGOs, have over the years helped strengthen the electoral and legislative systems and improved access to justice and public administration by developing a greater capacity to deliver the necessary services. The principle of inclusion and responsiveness in elections, including participation of women and the poor, is also fostered and pushed forward to ensure maximum representation.</p>
<p>The Thalassemia project undertaken by Relief India Trust (RIT) reflects a deep-rooted concern for the afflicted.</p>
<p>“The condition of Thalassemia is inherited and body starts making an abnormal form of haemoglobin. This condition is quite dangerous as it sounds as it further leads to destruction of red blood cells causing a dangerous anaemia disease. The condition is caused due to a defect in the gene controlling the production of either of the two proteins forming haemoglobin,” said Ms Dhawan.</p>
<p>Relief India Trust is carrying out genetic counselling to couples, providing them with possible solutions for various alternatives. Prenatal screening for pregnant women is also crucial and is carried out by their medics in a bid to control the disease in its early stages. Proper measures are thus put in place to prevent child loss during birth as the disease is capable of causing deaths to infants.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013394&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modirajnathadvani.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013555" alt="BJP is insisting that Advani should contest from Gandhinagar as his shifting of constituency will send “wrong signals”." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modirajnathadvani.jpg" /></a> BJP is insisting that Advani should contest from Gandhinagar as his shifting of constituency will send “wrong signals”.
<p>Amid the unease in his ties with Narendra Modi, BJP veteran L K Advani has expressed desire to contest from Bhopal, shifting from Gandhinagar in Gujarat, which has represented five times in the Lok Sabha.</p>
<p>Advani is learnt to have informed party chief Rajnath Singh about his preference for Bhopal, sources said. The 86-year-old leader has argued that since most of the senior party leaders were giving their preferences of seats, he too should be allowed to make a choice.</p>
<p>Advani, who was the Deputy Prime Minister in the NDA government, has said he has no problems in contesting from Gandhinagar as such but was keen on contesting from Bhopal as he considered it a safer seat, the sources said.</p>
<p>The decision, however, has been left to the party. Significantly, Advani skipped today&#8217;s crucial meeting of Parliamentary Board here where senior party leaders including Singh and Modi are learnt to have discussed the issue.</p>
<p>The party is insisting that Advani should contest from Gandhinagar as his shifting of constituency will send &#8220;wrong signals&#8221;, the sources said. His desire to shift from Gandhinagar may be seen as a reflection of the unease in his relationship with Modi.</p>
<p>Advani is not in the best of terms with Modi after he opposed Gujarat Chief Minister&#8217;s anointment as BJP&#8217;s PM candidate recently. The sources said if the party decides to field Advani from Bhopal, Modi&#8217;s confidante and former state minister Amit Shah may be given ticket from Gandhinagar.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sitting Bhopal MP and BJP veteran Kailash Joshi on Wednesday said he is not keen on contesting from the seat and he had offered the seat to the BJP patriarch.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013426&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1970897" alt="There are opportunities to create 20 crore new jobs in the country." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/ramdev-med.jpg" /> There are opportunities to create 20 crore new jobs in the country, says Ramdev.
<p>BJP on Wednesday refuted media reports about Ramdev pitching for his own favourites to be fielded by the saffron party in the Lok Sabha polls, saying the yoga guru had nothing to do with party&#8217;s ticket distribution process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baba Ramdev is a nationalist whose heart beats for the country. He has nothing to do with the ticket distribution process in the BJP,&#8221; party in-charge for Uttarakhand Radhamohan Singh told reporters here.</p>
<p>Terming such reports carried in a section of the media as absolutely unfounded, Singh who is also a party MP said the yoga guru never pitched for a BJP ticket to anyone.</p>
<p>Of late there were reports in a section of the media that Ramdev wanted some of his chosen favourites to be fielded by the party in the Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>To a question about senior party leader Bacchi Singh Rawat resigning from all party posts in protest against his name being dropped from a shortlist of probables for Nainital seat, Singh said he will soon be entrusted with the task of poll management in all five Lok Sabha seats in the hill state.</p>
<p>Singh said he had held a meeting with BJP nominees from the five Lok Sabha seats and was confident of a clean sweep by the party. &#8220;People are tired with the Congress and Modi wave is sweeping Uttarakhand as the rest of the country. We will wrest all the seats from the Congress this time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Asked whether changing the Chief Minister in Uttarakhand could brighten the Congress&#8217; polls prospects, Singh said mere promises and announcements will not do. &#8220;People are looking for concrete work on the ground. Ever since Harish Rawat took over as the new CM he has done nothing except making one announcement after another,&#8221; Singh, who represents the East Champaran seat in the Lok Sabha, said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013420&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Indian Express)
<p>Subhashree Panda, wife of wanted Maoist Sabyasachi Panda, on Wednesday joined Ama Odisha Party along with over 100 of her women supporters. Subhashree, who was set free from jail in 2012, said she would like to contest the ensuing assembly elections from Ranpur segment in Nayagarh district.</p>
<p>She was arrested and jailed for two years for her alleged links with the out-lawed CPI-Maoist party but was subsequently acquitted of the charges in 2012.</p>
<p>Sabyasachi&#8217;s father and Subhshree&#8217;s father-in-law Ramesh Panda had represented the Ranpur assembly constituency thrice on the CPM ticket.</p>
<p>She has already floated a Ranpur-based outfit Janamanch Odisha after being out of the jail. Above 100 women supporters of Subhshree also joined Ama Odisha Party along with her.</p>
<p>Welcoming Subhshree into Ama Odisha Party fold, Patnaik, who is also the son-in-law of Assam Governor J B Patnaik, said: &#8220;Subhshree is a capable leader and her joining will strengthen the party.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said AOP will field candidates in all the 21 Lok Sabha and 147 assembly seats in Odisha. If nominated to fight from Ranpur seat by the AOP leadership, Subhashree will face BJP candidate and former minister Surama Padhi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013347&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP Photo)
<p>And the politicians are doing what they do best again! No, not governance. No, not forming new policies. Ugh, NO. Not supporting important issues. They’re making fools of themselves, of course. We woke up this morning to news of Salman Khurshid saying that Narendra Modi was like a nursery student claiming to have a PhD.</p>
<p>This put us in memory mode, and we remembered all the funny, creative insults Indian politicians have thrown at each other (and the rest of the world) in the past. Here they are, all in one place, just for you:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alagirim1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013391" alt="Alagiri's statements hailing BJP prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi has also angered the party. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alagirim1.jpg" /></a> Alagiri&#8217;s statements hailing BJP prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi has also angered the party. (PTI)
<p>DMK on Wednesday warned partymen of disciplinary action against those who continue to maintain links with its suspended leader M K Alagiri.</p>
<p>The stern warning has come two days after party supremo M Karunanidhi&#8217;s son Alagiri held meetings with his supporters in Madurai to chalk out his future political course.</p>
<p>He had also recently met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh much to the embarrassment of DMK.</p>
<p>Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) General Secretary K Anbazhagan in a statement issued here charged Alagiri of attempts to create confusion among the rank and file of the party in the run up to the April 24 Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>He cautioned, &#8220;the party will not tolerate indiscipline&#8221;.</p>
<p>The disciplinary action warning is also aimed at isolating Alagiri, the strong man of Southern parts of Tamil Nadu, after his threat to play a key role in the Lok Sabha elections in the state and his statements about the bleak prospects of DMK in the hustings.</p>
<p>Alagiri&#8217;s statements hailing BJP prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi has also angered the party, prompting the latest action.</p>
<p>&#8220;I make it strictly clear that no party comrades, irrespective of their position should have any truck with the suspended Alagiri. The high command will initiate disciplinary action against anyone who violate the party decision,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The party suspended Alagiri in January accusing him of indulging in acts of indiscipline after he made some charges against his brother M K Stalin, virtually embarrassing the leadership.</p>
<p>Alagiri, though declared that he has no intention to float a new party, however made calls that his father needs to be saved from &#8220;bad&#8221; elements surrounding him, targetting Stalin.</p>
<p>The warning to partymen to fall in line with the party directive comes in the backdrop of Karunanidhi launching his election campaign from April five including in Madurai, the stronghold of Alagiri.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013370&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sp-med.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013386" alt="S&amp;P credit analyst Mehul Sukkawala said economic gloom and high interest rates have impacted debt-servicing ability." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sp-med.gif" /></a> S&amp;P credit analyst Mehul Sukkawala said economic gloom and high interest rates have impacted debt-servicing ability.
<p>Global ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s on Wednesday said an increasing focus by India Inc on lowering debt is likely to improve their credit profiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;More companies are improving their high financial leverage and boosting their credit profiles by adopting measures such as sale of equity and assets or using their free operating cash flows to reduce debt,&#8221; S&amp;P said in a report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Focus on lowering debt will likely improve their credit profiles,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The routes adopted by domestic companies include raising equity, selling non-core assets and in some cases divesting businesses, it noted.</p>
<p>S&amp;P credit analyst Mehul Sukkawala said economic gloom and high interest rates have impacted debt-servicing ability and these are the primary factors pushing companies towards this strategy. In some cases, companies are refocusing on reducing debt after years of investing for growth.</p>
<p>Citing examples, it said Tata Power&#8217;s outlook was recently revised to positive and Bharti Airtel&#8217;s rating was revised upwards after both companies started focusing on lowering debt.</p>
<p>While Tata Power announced a Rs 2,000-crore rights issue this month and raised USD 500 million through a stake sale in an Indonesian coal mine last quarter, Bharti raised USD 1.25 billion through an equity offering last year, S&amp;P added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe Bharti would continue to take measures such as sale of stakes in subsidiaries (such as Bharti Infratel) or non-core assets (such as tower infrastructure),&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Tata Steel sold part of its holding in group company Titan in 2013 and also put up land in the northwestern suburb of Borivali in Mumbai for sale, S&amp;P said, noting that it has deferred the second phase of a greenfield project in Odisha to focus on generating cash flow for the first phase.</p>
<p>Apart from that, many companies in the infrastructure sector such as GMR Infra with very high leverage are also considering selling assets or stakes in subsidiaries to improve their debt-servicing ability, financial flexibility<br />
and liquidity, it said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013346&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gearing up for Lok Sabha polls, the Railways has kept 75 companies of RPF ready for deployment in various parts of the country during the election time.</p>
<p>One RPF company consists of about 90 personnel. Railway has also provided about 1,000 coaches for the movement of polling staff and security personnel to poll-bound areas.</p>
<p>There are total 6,750 RPF personnel and about 50 trains having 1,000 coaches being made available for the polling exercise, a senior Railway Ministry official said.</p>
<p>The deployment of RPF personnel is more this time as compared to the last Lok Sabha elections in 2009. &#8220;There were 60 RPF companies deployed during the last Lok Sabha elections in 2009,&#8221; he said adding &#8220;the requirement of security personnel is more this time.&#8221;The official said the RPF deployment is likely to be in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Railways play a key role in providing logistic support during the general elections.</p>
<p>Currently about 1,000 coaches are being pressed into service and more coaches can be made available if required during the elections, the official said.</p>
<p>Some trains carrying polling materials and staff have been already dispatched to Jarkhahnd, Chhatisgarh and Tamil Nadu and more such services are being planned for other states as well.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013316&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Wednesday filed his nomination for the Assembly polls from Hinjili constituency in Ganjam district and expressed confidence about BJD retaining power in the state.</p>
<p>Patnaik, who is also president of the ruling BJD, filed four sets of nomination papers at the sub-collector&#8217;s office at the district headquarter town of Chhatrapur, official sources said.</p>
<p>Accompanied by ministers S N Patro and Usha Devi several other MLAs, the chief minister voiced confidence about his victory from Hinjili assembly constituency, from where he is running for the fourth time in a row.</p>
<p>A three-time legislator from Hinjili, Patnaik also exhibited optimism about BJD retaining power in the state by winning majority of seats in the assembly election, which are scheduled to take place with lok sabha polls.</p>
<p>After winning the assembly election from Hinjili constituency in 2000, the BJD supremo tasted victory from the same segment in his home district in successive assembly polls held in 2004 and 2009.</p>
<p>This time, Patnaik is likely to face a multi-corner contest. While Congress is yet to name its candidate, BJP has announced Devanand Mohapatra as its choice for the seat and other parties are likely to field their nominees.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013238&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001509" alt="BJP party workers want Modi to contest from Vadodara. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi6.jpg" /></a> BJP party workers want Modi to contest from Vadodara.
<p>Sitting BJP MP from Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, Balkrishna Shukla on Wednesday said he would be happy to vacate the seat for Narendra Modi, if the party decides to field him from the constituency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modi is my political guru. He had encouraged me to contest the 2009 Lok Sabha polls when I was still the city mayor. I am very happy to vacate my seat for him. I have already communicated my willingness to the party leadership,&#8221; Shukla said.</p>
<p>The MP expressed confidence that Modi would win the seat with a thumping majority.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a proud moment for Vadodara to elect the prime ministerial candidate,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Shukla had won the Vadodara seat with a margin of 1.32 lakh votes in 2009 Lok Sabha polls. He had replaced the three time seating BJP MP Jataben Thakkar after she had expressed her unwillingness to contest the parliamentary polls.</p>
<p>According to Bharat Dangar, president of the city unit of BJP, the party workers want Modi to contest from Vadodara.</p>
<p>He said Modi&#8217;s candidature from the constituency will enthuse the entire cadre and voters across Gujarat, especially central Gujarat, as Anand, Kheda and Dohad seats are currently held by the Congress.</p>
<p>The BJP has already declared that Modi will contest elections from the temple town of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, replacing the sitting MP and senior party leader Murli Manohar Joshi, who has been asked to contest from Kanpur.</p>
<p>Gujarat BJP had yesterday decided to recommend the name of veteran leader L K Advani to contest the Lok Sabha polls from his Gandhinagar constituency.</p>
<p>The state party unit also said it would strongly recommend that Modi should also contest from his home turf, too, as it is the &#8220;wish and demand of people of Gujarat as well as party workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final decision about Modi and Advani&#8217;s seats in Gujarat will be taken by the Central Election Committee during its meeting to be held today in Delhi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013227&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sharad-pawar-medium.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011704" alt="Sharad Pawar has called the state leaders to assess the situation and avert a split. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sharad-pawar-medium.jpg" /></a> Sharad Pawar has called the state leaders to assess the situation and avert a split.
<p>With a section in the Kerala unit of NCP fuming over denial of a Lok Sabha seat to it despite being a long time partner of the LDF, party supremo Sharad Pawar has called the state leaders to Mumbai on Thursday to assess the situation and avert a split.</p>
<p>A section in the NCP in the state, which has two MLAs in the Assembly, has been pressing for &#8220;drastic action&#8221;, including exercising the option of seceding from the LDF over the &#8220;gross discrimination&#8221; meted out to the party.</p>
<p>Though yet to come out openly on the issue, in internal discussions this group prefers hard decisions and cites the course opted by RSP, which quit LDF and joined the Congress-led UDF after after its demand for Kollam seat was rejected outright by the CPI(M).</p>
<p>Hardliners in NCP hold that the humiliation heaped on the party by CPI-M and CPI has become insufferable since NCP is the only LDF partner which does not have a candidate of its own in the state after Janata Dal(S)&#8217;s claim for a seat was accepted. Though initially CPI(M) rejected JD(S) demand, it later scaled down and allocated Kottayam seat for the partner.</p>
<p>They also cite the incongruence of the party continuing as a constituent of the LDF in Kerala while being a partner of the UPA at the Centre.</p>
<p>However, an influential group in the NCP state unit, led by party MLA A K Saseendran, is stiffly opposed to snapping ties with LDF, considering the prevailing situation in Kerala.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we are not happy over rejection of our demand for a seat. This has been made clear by our state president (T P Peethambaram). But this does not mean that we are heading to a split,&#8221; Saseendran said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not going to tread the path chosen by the RSP. Things are very clear since our leaders and workers are active in the campaigning for the LDF,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>On Pawar&#8217;s summons, Saseendran said his main purpose is to learn the ground realities in various states and he has called leaders from other states as part of this process.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013208&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2013100 " alt="(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/italian-marines-pti-l.jpg" /> The marines shot dead two fishermen off the Kerala coast in February 2012, sparking diplomatic tensions between India and Italy. (PTI)
<p>UN General Assembly President John Ashe has informed Italy that he will try and raise with India the issue of the two Italian marines who are being tried for killing two Indian fishermen during his three-day visit that begins on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Italy&#8217;s Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Angelino Alfano met Ashe here on Monday and &#8220;briefed him on the situation of the two-year-old case of the marines.</p>
<p>&#8220;In response, President Ashe informed the Minister that in the course of his imminent State visit to India, he will be alert for whatever opportunity presents itself to raise the issue,&#8221; a statement issued by Ashe&#8217;s spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Ashe will visit India from March 19-22, during which he is expected to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid.</p>
<p>Alfano also briefed the President of the General Assembly on issues of priority for Italy, including enhancing efforts to counter terrorism and human trafficking.</p>
<p>Alfano had also met UN chief Ban Ki-moon but according to information provided by the office of Ban&#8217;s spokesperson, there was no mention of the issue of the Italian marines and their trial in India during Ban&#8217;s meeting with Alfano.</p>
<p>A readout provided by Ban&#8217;s office about the meeting said the Secretary-General &#8220;called on Italy to ensure that refugeescrossing the Mediterranean are treated with dignity and that the principle of non-refoulement is respected.</p>
<p>&#8220;He expressed concern about reports of severe treatment of migrants, especially women, at reception camps and underscored the need to ensure their human rights.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Secretary-General praised Italy for its contribution to peacekeeping, the fight against organised crime and counterterrorism efforts, especially in North Africa, the Sahel and the Horn.</p>
<p>He thanked Italy for accepting another group of residents from Camp Hurriya.&#8221;  Ahead of his meeting with Ban, Alfano had said that Italy is willing to try the marines &#8220;at home, but in the meantime we ask for their freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marines Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone shot dead two fishermen off the Kerala coast in February 2012, sparking diplomatic tensions between India and Italy.</p>
<p>The marines, deployed on the Italian-flagged oil tanker MT Enrica Lexie, said they mistook the fishermen for pirates. They are now staying in the Italian Embassy in New Delhi awaiting trial.</p>
<p>India has removed the possibility of a death penalty but insisted that the marines would still be prosecuted under the anti-piracy law and face up to 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Italy has said the marines should be tried in Italy since the incident took place in international waters. However, New Delhi says it has the right to try the Italians as the victims were Indians on board an Indian fishing boat.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013072&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Congress on Wednesday indicated that Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari is likely to be party nominee from Ludhiana Lok Sabha constituency.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he is physically fit, I do not think there is any reason why he would not contest,&#8221; party General Secretary Shakil Ahmed told PTI.</p>
<p>Another senior leader said that at no point of time Tewari has refused to contest. Tewari, who represents Ludhiana constituency in Lok Sabha, was admitted to a private hospital&#8217;s cardiology department here on March 15 after he complained of uneasiness.</p>
<p>He was discharged after two days of treatment on March 17. Earlier, there were reports that he was inclined to contest from Chandigarh from where former Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal has been nominated by the party.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013191&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/khurshid-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995856" alt="Salman Khurshid hit out at Narendra Modi saying Supreme Court never gave him a clean chit in Gujarat riots." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/khurshid-main.jpg" /></a> Salman Khurshid hit out at Narendra Modi saying Supreme Court never gave him a clean chit in Gujarat riots.
<p>Days after his &#8216;impotent&#8217; remark, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid has fired a fresh salvo at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, calling him a nursery student who thinks he is a PhD.</p>
<p>Speaking to mediapersons in Farrukhabad, Khurshid referred to the &#8216;clean chit&#8217; to Modi in connection with the 2002 Gujarat riots, saying the Supreme Court has never given one to the BJP leader. He further pointed that it was a lower court which merely did not send any summon to the Gujarat Chief Minister, which was considered a clean chit.</p>
<p>The veteran Congress leader then went on to say: &#8220;It&#8217;s like a nursery student, who after securing good marks is assuming himself to be a doctor and a PhD.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In Gujarat, the incidents that happened when he (Modi) was Chief Minister, around 170 people have been given life imprisonment in connection with that. Maya Kodnani was his minister,&#8221; he further said.</p>
<p>The remark by Khurshid comes close on the heels of a statement by Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, who demanded &#8220;legal accountability&#8221; for the &#8220;clear and inexcusable failure&#8221; of governance during the violence, and dismissed talk of a clean chit to the BJP’s prime ministerial nominee as &#8220;politically expedient&#8221; but &#8220;far too premature&#8221;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/chavan-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996579" alt="Chavan said that the government is trying its best to provide maximum relief to the affected farmers." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/chavan-480.jpg" /></a> Chavan said that the government is trying its best to provide maximum relief to the affected farmers.
<p>Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan on Wednesday assured that his government is committed to provide relief to hailstorm-hit farmers in the state and appealed to them not to take any &#8220;untoward decision&#8221; that could harm them.</p>
<p>Chavan&#8217;s statement comes in the wake of reports that several farmers have committed suicide in the hailstorm affected districts.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you all know Lok Sabha elections have been declared and the Model Code of Conduct has been enforced. Considering the magnitude of devastation, the government is trying its best to provide maximum relief to the affected farmers,&#8221; Chavan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Myself and my cabinet colleagues have toured the affected districts and discussed the compensation to be given at informal cabinet meetings. The state government has demanded a financial package of Rs 5,000 crore from the Centre and also apprised the Election Commission of India about the damage caused,&#8221; Chavan said in an appeal to the farmers.</p>
<p>He said a high-level group comprising Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar, Finance Minister P Chidambaram, Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde, Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh and Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, has been formed. A central team has recently completed its tour of the affected areas.</p>
<p>The state government has already given orders to the district administration to provide relief as per standing orders in case of a natural calamity.</p>
<p>He appealed to the farmers to have courage and the government will go all out to help them to come out of the distress.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013103&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Slamming the CBI for the “manner in which it initiated” a preliminary inquiry against former SEBI chairman C B Bhave and former member K M Abraham, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh Tuesday called it “shocking and appalling” and said “some larger forces” seemed at work.</span></p>
<p>“This fishing expedition by CBI is detrimental to decision-making in public domain&#8230;All decision-making will come to a halt this way,” Ramesh said. He said Bhave was an outstanding IAS officer who brought integrity to capital markets. He noted the PM had the highest regard for Bhave, and added Abraham was one of the “most honest, diligent and straightforward officers”.</p>
<p>“I have known Bhave for 25 years. I know he was personally recruited in SEBI by (its former chairman) G V Ramakrishna. I know that the Prime Minister has the highest regard for his integrity. Mr Bhave is one of the most outstanding IAS officers&#8230; Abraham is one of the most diligent, one of the most honest, one of the most straightforward officers you can think of. I am shocked and appalled at the manner in which CBI has moved against them,” he said.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ramesh said there was a need to be “careful” about these issues. “India needs quick decisions taken in a transparent manner,” he said.</span></p>
<p>CBI registered a preliminary inquiry against Bhave, who headed Sebi between February 2008 and February 2011, and Abraham, whose term as a whole-time member ended in 2011, for alleged irregularities in granting sanction to MCX Stock Exchange (MCX-SX) in 2008 and for renewing recognition in 2009 and 2010.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012861&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A day after violence rocked the lignite town of Neyveli following killing of a man in firing by a CISF constable, the force was temporarily taken off duty in mine-II of NLC complex even as the one-day strike by over 20,000 employees hit mining activities on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) contingent vested with security duty at the Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) was replaced by Tamil Nadu Police personnel in mine-II as a temporary measure, apparently aimed at assuaging the feelings of workers and locals, officials said.</p>
<p>The police said the situation in the NLC township, near here, was normal and 35 persons, including workers, had been arrested in connection with Monday’s violence.</p>
<p>SP A Radhika said all arrested were produced before a court and remanded to judicial custody. NLC officials stated that the deceased T Suresh alias Raja of a nearby village was not employed with the company at present. He had worked as a contract labourer some time ago.</p>
<p>They said while mining activities had been hit due to the strike, power generation was being maintained.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012859&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[A UNDP study by Priya Deshingkar and Shaheen Akhter says seasonal migrants contribute 10 per cent to GDP<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012857&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Around 7.5-50 million seasonal migrants could miss out on voting this Lok Sabha election. Although it is tough to arrive at an exact figure in this wide range, going by the average, a number equal to or more than the electorate of Jharkhand — which has 19.95 million voters — may not vote.</span></p>
<p>At this time of the year, they work as manual labourers away from home.</p>
<p>The figures were arrived at considering the 64th round of the National Sample Survey, which says there are 15 million short-term migrants, a 2009 UNDP paper which estimates 100 million ‘circular’ migrants and a 2011 survey by five NGOs that found 48 per cent respondents voted in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>A UNDP study by Priya Deshingkar and Shaheen Akhter says seasonal migrants contribute 10 per cent to GDP.</p>
<p>In areas where agriculture is dependent on kharif, people leave in October and return before the rains, by June. “They migrate to quarries and so on. Many travel short distances to vote in panchayat elections. In Parliamentary elections most of them do not come back to vote,” said Ravi Srivastava of JNU’s Centre for Study of Regional Development.</p>
<p>A micro study by Rajasthan-based Aajeevika Bureau and four other NGOs across 15 sites in five states with 686 respondents validates this. Data revealed that 65 per cent of respondents voted in the last panchayat elections and 48 per cent in the last Lok Sabha elections. From Panchayat to Vidhan Sabha to Lok Sabha elections, participation dips 10.5 per cent at each step, notes the report ‘Political Inclusion of Seasonal Migrant Workers in India.’</p>
<p>The study notes, “The difference rises to 14 per cent when short distance movements were taken off the sample. In case of long distance movement, participation ranges from 59 per cent in panchayat election and 31 per cent in Lok Sabha elections.”</p>
<p>The report notes 54 per cent of respondents returned specifically to vote and 74 per cent voted for panchayat elections. In Jharkhand, from where migrants travel to states like Punjab and Gujarat, people returning to vote will be very less. “In places like West Bengal and Kerala, political parties give migrants incentives to return to vote. There has been no such effort in Jharkhand,” said Gopi Nath Ghosh of NGO Johar.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012857&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Seven workers of a dyeing unit died of asphyxiation, and several were taken ill after inhaling toxic gas from a waste treatment tank at Perundurai near Erode district Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>The workers were employed at the processing facility of KPR Mill in the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (Sipcot) industrial complex.</p>
<p>According to the police, P Anand, 38, a mechanic went inside the tank to work on a faulty pump.</p>
<p>However, Anand fell as he was climbing down, prompting a supervisor, N Sudhakaran, 28, to go for his rescue. The poisonous gas inside the chamber left them unconscious.</p>
<p>With no sign of the two, five other workers — Murugan, Sasikumar, Upasakthi, Japasakthi and Madan — went in, only to be asphyxiated. All seven died before they could be taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>Eight others who inhaled the gas were taken ill. Three senior staff of the dyeing unit have been arrested, said the police.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012851&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">An Indian delegation led by External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid, along with 50 leaders from major countries, will participate in the “nuclear war games” session at the Nuclear Security Summit (NSS) in The Hague on March 24-25.</span></p>
<p>Sources said a new module has been introduced in the summit to be attended by world leaders including US President Barack Obama in which “fictional nuclear security threat scenarios” will be presented, and leaders will discuss their choices. This is the first time such a session is being held and leaders from 53 countries and 4 international bodies will take part.</p>
<p>This will be part of the “informal leaders-only” session of future-oriented strategy to counter nuclear terrorism and trafficking of nuclear material, sources said. Indian officials will spend the next few days with Khurshid, so that he can respond as per India’s stated commitment on nuclear issues.</p>
<p>India will also focus on “gaps” in international nuclear security legal framework and emphasize on the need for member countries to be party to its conventions including Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.</p>
<p>India will reiterate its concerns on nuclear terrorism and breach of nuclear technology security at the third Nuclear Security Summit. “Our approach would be to focus on some pending work e.g there are still gaps in the international nuclear security legal architecture. A number of NSS countries are still not party to 2005 amendments to the Convention of Physical Protection of Nuclear Material,” senior government officials said here.</p>
<p>The other areas of focus will be greater tactical cooperation in combating trafficking of nuclear material and cooperation in sharing of best practices and technologies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012850&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Three alleged hunters, including the son of a leading hotelier in Bhopal, who allegedly shot dead a black buck and a peacock were taken into custody by police late on Monday from a village in Sehore, about 35 km from here.</span></p>
<p>The police seized three expensive foreign-made rifles and 59 cartridges from the three, who included Shaad Khan whose father Saidullah Khan is related to the erstwhile Nawab of Bhopal state.</p>
<p>Angry residents of Katpon village in Sehore district, who caught the three while they were allegedly hunting wanted to punish them. They threw stones at police and damaged a couple of vehicles before the administration called for additional force and rescue the three.</p>
<p>Police seized a black buck and a skinned peacock from the vehicle of the hunters.</p>
<p>Shaad told police that he is a shooter of national repute. His accomplices were identified as Nishad Khan and Mohammed Uves, both from Bhopal. “The accused have admitted to killing the antelope and the national bird,” said Doraha Police Station Inspector B D Bira.</p>
<p>The trio, who are in their late 30s and early 40s, were on Tuesday produced before a magistrate who remanded them in police custody till March 20. They have been booked under the Wildlife Protection Act, the IPC and the Arms Act. The police have also registered a case against villagers for creating obstruction in their duty.</p>
<p>Sehore Collector Kavindra Kiyawat, who rushed to the village along with senior police officials, said the villagers did not want the police to take the accused away. “The situation was about to take a communal turn. Tempers were running high and the tension could have spread to nearby villages with mixed population,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012849&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pic2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012843" alt="Pawan Kalyan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pic2.jpg" /></a> Pawan Kalyan
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Telugu actor K Pawan Kalyan, who launched a Jana Sena Party last week, is trying to tie up with the BJP in Seemandhra and Telangana. Brother of Congress Union tourism minister K Chiranjeevi, Pawan said he would do everything that was required to wipe out the Congress in Seemandhra and is willing to tie-up with any party against the Congress. </span></p>
<p>The popular actor landed in New Delhi Tuesday to meet senior BJP leaders and has also sought an appointment with PM candidate Narendra Modi. Pawan Kalyan is unlikely to contest himself, but said his party would support suitable candidates of any party but the Congress.</p>
<p>A tie-up with the BJP can alter political equations in Seemandhra, as the Jana Sena Party may swing or break votes in several coastal constituencies, which would affect not only the Congress but also leading contenders YSR Congress Party and Telugu Desam Party.</p>
<p>“If the BJP and the TDP come to an understanding and the TDP receives support from Pawan Kalyan’s party in Seemandhra, then they will pose a formidable challenge,” analyst T Ravi says.</p>
<p>Pawan Kalyan has taken up the slogan ‘Congress hatao, desh bachao’ and gone into confrontation with his brother. In the 2009 elections, Pawan had campaigned for Chiranjeevi, who had launched Praja Rajyam Party then.</p>
<p>The differences that have cropped up between the brothers are apparently over Chiranjeevi’s decision to merge with the Congress. Irrespective of whether the BJP and the TDP stitch together an alliance, the TDP is wooing Pawan Kalyan as he is a huge hit among the youngsters. Sources said N Chandrababu Naidu is sending feelers to Pawan Kalyan asking him to join him.</p>
<p>Chiranjeevi, who was appointed the Congress campaign committee chairman last week, is likely to come across his brother in several constituencies where they will seek to woo the 17 per cent voters of the Kapu community to which they belong. The Congress is wary about Pawan’s ability to draw young voters and is hoping that Chiranjeevi’s charm will work against his.</p>
<p>Chiranjeevi has already visited some constituencies but will officially kick off his campaign in a special vehicle March 21.</p>
<p>Chiranjeevi said Tuesday that he and other Congress leaders would explain to people during their campaign as to what led to the Congress deciding to divide the state, and also the benefits that Seemandhra would get because of the bifurcation. Pawan Kumar, in contrast, will be campaigning against the Congress for dividing the state.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012839&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nagma1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012840" alt="During the campaign on Monday.  Gajendra Yadav" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nagma1.jpg" /></a> During the campaign on Monday. Gajendra Yadav
<p>They stood for hours to catch a glimpse of her, braving the heat and the crush of sweaty bodies. They gossiped and complained while they killed time, waiting for her to arrive. And as her car rolled into the narrow Meerut lane, they went berserk. Cameras flashed, there were roars and screams as hordes of men fell on top of each other, all trying to catch her attention.</p>
<p>She had arrived, and how. Many in political circles, and some within her own party, look at her as an outsider, but looking at the crowd on Tuesday, you wouldn’t agree. Nagma, the actress, is the Congress candidate from Meerut.</p>
<p>“Main aap logon ki samasyaen sunne aayeen hoon (I have come here to listen to your problems),” she says. “The central government has been providing funds, but your state government has not been passing the benefits <span style="line-height:1.5em;">to you. You need a leader who can raise your concerns. I want to be that leader. If you elect me, I will take a home here, and stay with you.”</span></p>
<p>The huge, mostly male, mass of people around her roar, applaud and whistle.</p>
<p>She refers to nukkad-conversation issues: non-payment of prices to sugarcane farmers and better Meerut-Delhi connectivity. She talks of women’s safety and promises to find a “solution” to the problem.</p>
<p>Her biggest strength, she says, are her secular credentials. “I am Hindu and Muslim at the same time. Aap jis tarah se mujhe project karna chahein, kar sakte hain. I have been told that using my Hindu name would give me a definite advantage against the BJP,” she tells a meeting of her election workers.</p>
<p>Nagma was born on Christmas day to a Hindu mother and Muslim father. “I am as secular as they come,” she says. “I hope the people of Meerut will appreciate that.”</p>
<p>Meerut, she says, wasn’t a constituency she chose, but one that she was “destined for”.</p>
<p>“Sonia Gandhi asked me to contest from Meerut in 2004 and 2009, but it never materialized. I guess I was meant to fight elections from this place at least once in my life,” she laughs.</p>
<p>And yet, she knows that the battle is difficult, and that her party has not made things easy for itself. “There is absolutely no communication within the party. Kisi system ke tehat kaam nahin ho raha (Nothing is working). We have to win, but we can’t win like this,” she almost screams at the 30-odd men listening to her at the meeting.</p>
<p>“The party has organized a massive roadshow to introduce me to the masses, but even members within the party are not aware that it’s happening. We need to step up,” she urges the local leaders.</p>
<p>“I have only 20 days. I don’t know this place, and I don’t know if I’ll be able to know everything in time. But if you think I can do it, help me to win.” Meerut votes in phase 3 of the Lok Sabha election, on April 10.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Mulayam Singh Yadav will contest from Azamgarh alongside his current Mainpuri constituency. Samajwadi Party general secretary Ramgopal Yadav announced Tuesday that the decision to field the party chief from Azamgarh was taken on the demand of party workers and leaders from various eastern UP districts. Several other SP candidates in adjoining seats in the eastern region, too, are likely to be changed.</span></p>
<p>The SP has brought back former MP C N Singh to Pratapgarh after having replacing him with Pramod Patel in March. It announced Shivendra Singh for the Rampur Khas bypoll after Congress leader Pramod Tiwari vacated it.</p>
<p>Having fielded Mulayam from Azamgarh, the SP will be hoping to counter the influence Narendra Modi’s candidature from Varanasi will have on the eastern region. For Mulayam, the eastern region is key as his party has lost much of its base in the western region after the Muzaffarnagar riots. Eastern UP, known as Poorvanchal, has 27 seats. In 2009, the BSP won nine seats followed by the Congress and the SP with seven each while the BJP ended with only four MPs, including Yogi Adityanath from Gorakhpur.</p>
<p>Azamgarh’s caste equations suit the SP as it has a dominance of Yadavs and Muslims, both traditional voters of the SP. The combination was dented in the area after Yadavs deserted the SP in Azamgarh in 2009. The strategy is based on the premise that Mulayam as candidate would keep the Muslim-Yadav support intact. The move was in fact being discussed for over a month, long before Modi’s candidature was announced.</p>
<p>The SP is also looking at preparing the ground for another member of the Mulayam family, possibly his grandson Tej Pratap Singh, known as Teju Bhaiyya. Should Mulayam win both seats, it is expected he will relinquish Mainpuri for his grandson to contest the by-poll. Mulayam’s son Prateek is another contender for Mainpuri, considered a safe seat.</p>
<p>The party has tried such a strategy earlier. In 1999, Mulayam won both Sambhal and Kannauj, and surrendered the latter for his son Akhilesh. Tej Pratap is at present Mulayam’s representative in Mainpuri and campaigning on his behalf in the constituency.</p>
<p>Azamgarh marks the first time anyone from the family will be venturing electorally into the eastern region. Initially, Panchayati Raj Minister Balram Yadav had been announced as the candidate, but he ran into opposition from party workers and declined to contest, after which the ticket was given to Hawaldar Yadav, the district unit president of the party. Now that Mulayam has been announced as the candidate, it presents Balram a face-saver. Until a few months ago, Balram was trying to push Prateek Yadav, and dharnas were held outside the SP office by people claiming to be from Azamgarh.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Azamgarh has been where the SP prefers to start its election campaign. In 2012, the SP had announced its first election meeting here on January 1. This time, Mulayam began his rallies on October 29 in Azamgarh.</p>
<p>The SP holds nine of 10 assembly seats in Azamgarh district.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012837&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Putting an end to the suspense over its stand on one of its key MPs facing corruption charges, the Congress today denied the Pune ticket to sitting MP Suresh Kalmadi, an accused in the Commonwealth Games scam, replacing him with Maharashtra Youth Congress president Vishwajeet Kadam who is the son of state minister Patangrao Kadam. The party is also likely to deny a ticket to Ashok Chavan, the former Maharashtra chief minister who had to step down in the wake of the Adarsh scam, but his wife Ameeta could be fielded from Nanded.</span></p>
<p>The Congress, which released its third list of 58 today, is said to be looking for a “formidable” opponent to Narendra Modi in Varanasi. It is said to be exploring the option of fielding a Thakur or Brahmin leader from Varanasi. Anil Shastri, son of former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, is said to be in contention but Congress sources asserted that the party is yet to take a call on its candidate from there. Anil Shastri had been elected from Varanasi back in 1989.</p>
<p>The 58 named Tuesday included five sitting MPs from Delhi: Kapil Sibal, Sandeep Dikshit, Ajay Maken, Jai Prakash Agarwal and Krishna Tirath. The party remains undecided about giving tickets to South Delhi MP Ramesh Kumar and West Delhi MP Mahabal Mishra. AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh’s son-in-law Paranjayadityasinh Parmar has been given the ticket to Panchmahal.</p>
<p>Former Bihar DGP Ashish Ranjan Sinha will contest Nalanda, Nitish Kumar’s stronghold. Mohd Azharuddin, who chose not to contest from his Moradabad constituency, has been given the ticket to Tonk-Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan, which is currently represented by union minister Namonarayan Meena. Former union minister and close Rahul Gandhi aide C P Joshi shifts from Bhilwara to Jaipur (Rural) that is at present represented by minister Lalchand Kataria. Rajasthan PCC chief Sachin Pilot will contest from his Ajmer constituency. Union minister Chandresh Kumari, who was said to be eager to shift to Himachal Pradesh, remains in Jodhpur.</p>
<p>Punjab PCC chief Partap Singh Bajwa will contest from Gurdaspur, while former Chhattisgarh chief minister Ajit Jogi, currently an MLA, has been fielded from Mahasamund. Ajay Singh (Rahul), son of late Arjun Singh, will contest from Satna in Madhya Pradesh. Chairman of the Congress campaign committee in Orissa Srikant Jena will contest from Balasore. Haryana PCC chief Ashok Tanwar will contest from Sirsa, and Rajkumar Valmiki from Ambala in place of Kumari Selja, recently elected to the Rajya Sabha.</p>
<p>The third list covers Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Chhattishgarh, Daman &amp; Diu, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The party has announced candidates for 318 of the 543 seats.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012833&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Poacher Sansar Chand, who was blamed for wiping out Sariska’s tiger population in 2005, died of prostate cancer in a Jaipur hospital on Tuesday morning. Sansar, who was in his late 50s, died hours before he was to appear in court in a poaching case.</span></p>
<p>Sansar was brought from Delhi’s Tihar Jail hospital to Alwar for the appearance, but had to be moved to the district hospital. On Saturday, he was taken to Jaipur’s SMS Hospital , where he died at 9.53 am on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He had 10 “strong cases of poaching” against him and was named in at least 40 others. He was accused of killing over 200 tigers apart from several hundred other species. He was arrested by Delhi Police and later handed over to the CBI.</p>
<p>The first case against him was filed in 1974 at the age of 18. He is said to have entered the trade as early as age 13.</p>
<p>“Sansar operated through conduits and couriers and would never involve himself directly. Despite being the kingpin, he could not be nailed because of this modus operandi,” said Saurabh Sharma, who fought several cases against Sansar on behalf of the Wildlife Trust of India.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012829&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The BJP Tuesday named former Army chief V K Singh as its candidate for Ghaziabad, the constituency vacated by Rajnath Singh who is contesting Lucknow. The announcement was made by Rajnath Singh through a press statement on the eve of the BJP central election committee meeting in New Delhi Wednesday. He also declared Shibun Lyngdoh as the Shillong candidate. </span></p>
<p>V K Singh’s candidacy is believed to have figured in talks Rajnath had with L K Advani to discuss selection. V K Singh will be pitted against Raj Babbar of the Congress and Shazia Ilmi of the Aam Aadmi Party.</p>
<p>Rajnath inducted the former Army chief into the BJP on March 1, months after he had shared the dais with Narendra Modi last September. He had addressed an ex-servicemen’s rally in Rewari, which was also Modi’s first public rally after being formally declared the BJP’s prime ministerial candidate. V K Singh, however, had then remained ambivalent on his political affiliations by closing ranks with Anna Hazare.</p>
<p>After he joined the BJP, there was speculation he might contest from his home state, Haryana, but that was put to rest last Saturday when candidates from that state were announced.</p>
<p>During the CEC meeting that day, leaders of the party’s UP unit were assured of a high-profile candidate from Ghaziabad following Rajnath Singh’s shift to Lucknow.</p>
<p>A group of protesters from western Uttar Pradesh descended on the party headquarters in Delhi Tuesday demanding a candidate from the Tyagi community as none had been fielded in the entire region.</p>
<p><strong>Bhopal an option for Gandhinagar’s Advani</strong></p>
<p><strong>NEW DELHI:</strong> Amid demands from both the Gujarat and the Madhya Pradesh units to field L K Advani from their states, the BJP’s central election committee is set to decide Wednesday. Party leaders are not ruling out the possibility of fielding him from Bhopal.</p>
<p>The Gujarat poll committee revealed it has proposed Advani for his current seat, Gandhinagar. But former Madhya Pradesh CM Kailash Joshi said he has requested Advani to contest from Bhopal, which he has offered to vacate. Joshi told The Indian Express last week Advani has not rejected his request.</p>
<p>The Gujarat unit has reiterated its demand that Modi contest from his home state as well as from Varanasi. The CEC will Wednesday decide candidates for Gujarat, Rajasthan and the remaining seats in UP and MP. <strong>ENS</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012828&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>In this Walk the Talk on NDTV 24&#215;7 with The Indian Express Editor-in-Chief Shekhar Gupta, ISRO Chairman K Radhakrishnan speaks about the indigenous cryogenic engine that launched GSLV-D5 and why the Mars Orbiter Mission is crucial for India.</em></p>
<p><strong>I’m at Antariksh Bhavan in Bangalore, the headquarters of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where you see many smiles wherever you go and nobody is smiling more happily than its Chairman Dr K Radhakrishnan. One can’t find a space scientist with a more diverse portfolio — the Mars mission, the lunar mission, GSLV and then your own Tsunami Warning Centre, and the 24&#215;7 Disaster Management Centre. You are a man of many parts.</strong><br />
The Indian space programme is people-centric and application-centric. That’s our USP, that whatever we do, it should finally find a place for the common man.</p>
<p><strong>And you have had about eight launches in seven months?</strong><br />
Yes, since July 2013, we have had eight successful missions — PSLVs, a few satellites, the Mars Orbiter Mission and the latest GSLV-D5 with the Indian cryogenic engine and stage.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Teach us some rocket science&#8230; explain to people who can’t tell the difference between geostationary and polar.</strong><br />
Essentially, when we talk about a satellite doing remote-sensing, it has to go above the Earth from pole to pole. As the Earth rotates, and the satellite goes from pole to pole, the cameras in the satellite would be able to see the entire Earth. It can take pictures, as and when you require or periodically. In the case of communication satellites, what we do is put a satellite at an altitude of 36,000 km above the equator. The satellite would take 24 hours for one revolution, which is equal to what it takes for the Earth too (to rotate on its axis). So the satellite would be geostationary, that is, a stationary object with respect to us on the Earth. So these are the two things we generally talk about. The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle can launch remote-sensing satellites, satellites for space science experiments, satellites for communication, it has also launched Chandrayaan and the Mars Orbiter. So in the PSLV family, we have three vehicles. Now, GSLV is a more powerful vehicle. The core stage of PSLV is used in GSLV too. The second stage of PSLV is adapted and used in GSLV.</p>
<p><strong>More or less replicated?</strong><br />
Yes, and here you will see large strap-ons, liquid engine-based strap-ons.</p>
<p><strong>And I believe each one of them carries 200 tonnes of fuel?</strong><br />
Each of them carries 40 tonnes and the core has 139 tonnes of solid propellant. But the most important and crucial element of GSLV is the cryogenic upper stage and that’s what we tested successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Sir, now that I am getting my tutorial on rocket science, tell us the meaning of cryogenic. I know ‘cryo’ is something that is cold.</strong><br />
There are three varieties of propulsion used for rockets. One is the solid propellant base. That means you have got the solid fuel and the solid oxidiser, plus a few additives. This can be used in the lower stages of the vehicle. It’s easy to handle once you prepare it. But when you talk about the liquid engine, there is an oxidiser and fuel. The fuel can be kerosene or liquid hydrogen. When it is liquid hydrogen, we call it cryogenic.</p>
<p><strong>And now you go on to your next GSLV.</strong><br />
If you look at GSLV Mark III, which we are now developing, it is far more powerful compared to GSLV. In GSLV, we can put a 2,200 kg satellite into a geostationary transfer orbit — that means in an orbit where the apogee is 36,000 km and perigee is 200 km — whereas in GSLV Mark III, we can take to the orbit a satellite of 4,000 kg. So that’s almost double the capacity.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sir, if you can explain perigee and apogee&#8230;</strong><br />
Perigee means the distance closest to the Earth and apogee is the farthest point.</p>
<p><strong>So, as it goes into elliptical orbit around the Earth, sometimes it will be closer, sometimes it will be farther?</strong><br />
Exactly. So using the propulsion system in the satellite, we move it into a 36,000 km circular orbit and take it to a place above the equator.</p>
<p><strong>So when are you planning this launch, the next landmark?</strong><br />
The first landmark is an experimental mission where we will look at the atmospheric phase of this flight and we will use a passive ignition stage, in the sense that it won’t ignite. But all the lower stages will perform and we will monitor the performance of this vehicle in the crucial atmospheric phase. This is going to happen by April 2014.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>By testing out its response to atmospheric conditions, you mean that in the first 30-40 km, it will face winds and pressures which don’t exist in outer space?</strong><br />
Right.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>So when do you expect the full launch of this?</strong><br />
The full launch should be possible by 2016-17. What we have done now is testing of the engine. Some of the stage components have also been tested. So for the next two years, we will go through a qualification programme for the engine as well as the stage. Once it is completed, then we will be able to release this vehicle.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Then we can launch much bigger satellites for which we today have to go overseas?</strong><br />
We will be able to launch communication satellites weighing about 3,500 kg to 4,000 kg. Today we do it through Ariane-5 rockets.</p>
<p><strong>So, what happened in the past? Why has GSLV given us such trouble?</strong><br />
There are two reasons. GSLV, of course, is a beautiful vehicle and a simpler vehicle, except for the complex cryogenic stage. GSLV derives its heritage from the sub-systems of PSLV, in terms of the solid core stage and the liquid strap-ons and the second stage. It uses liquid propulsion where we need to get a lot of controlled components. During the flight or during the preparation phase, it can leak a little bit. The second part is incidental — in the first GSLV flight that was done in 2001, one of the strap-ons did not ignite, it did not get the fuel. But there was an inbuilt system for aborting the flight&#8230; that worked beautifully and the flight was aborted. Within 22 days — it was a record — our people brought it back to the launch pad.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>And the whole thing was saved?</strong><br />
Yes. But the satellite did not stay there for more than two months because the Russian cryogenic stage at that time did not perform to its required level. It was underperformance of that stage but nevertheless it is a first developmental flight of GSLV and a very crucial milestone for the country. The second and third flights of GSLV worked very well. It launched GSAT2 and GSAT3, what you call Edusat. In the GSLV flight that we did in 2006, one of the components in a strap-on did not perform properly. That means the vehicle had to go with only three strap-ons. It was a failure. The next flight that we undertook in 2007, the control system of one of the strap-ons failed. However, the vehicle was able to put the satellite into an orbit very close to where we wanted it. And then the satellite propulsion system was used to take the satellite, INSAT-4CR, into the right place. So nothing was basically wrong with GSLV but component failure resulted in these few failures. In 2010, we had two flights. The first one was to test our Indian cryogenic engine and stage. Here too the vehicle beautifully performed up to the end of the second stage. The cryo stage ignited and we were very happy at that time. But immediately after that, a fuel booster turbo pump stopped.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why did that happen?</strong><br />
We investigated and found there are three possibilities. One, of course, is contamination. It is sitting in a liquid hydrogen tank. It is at very low temperature and&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>How low?</strong><br />
It is 20 Kelvin or -253°C. There are dissimilar materials used in the pump and the contractions will not be uniform. We also had a possibility of a casing of the pump coming out, so these two had to be corrected. But later we found out that the most probable cause was contamination from a propellant acquisition system kept in the liquid hydrogen tank. So we replaced that, redesigned it and got a new one. We also tested this pump extensively in this low temperature condition and ensured that it works. The second part of it was, had this pump worked, are we sure that the rest of the functions would take place? We did a lot of analysis and simulation. And one thing we wanted to make sure before we took off again was to see that this cryogenic engine ignites and we are sure about it at this high altitude condition where there is vacuum. We had not tested this in the past on the ground. So we created a test facility at Mahendragiri (Tamil Nadu) and then we tested it and saw to it that we are confident about it.</p>
<p><strong>So that’s why this launch with an Indian cryogenic engine is such a landmark?</strong><br />
It’s three years of work, during which we did 45 tests on the ground on the cryogenic engine and stage. Also, why did the GSLV configuration fail? Is there something fundamentally wrong it? We did nearly 850 wind tunnel tests.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>But now you don’t have that doubt?</strong><br />
Now, we don’t have that doubt.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>So we can take the view that your successful GSLV with your own cryogenic engine is an even bigger landmark than the Mars Mission, which was ahead of the lunar mission.</strong><br />
Both are landmarks. One, in terms of technology, cryogenic technology is complex and we have done it.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>It greatly increases your range and payload.</strong><br />
Yes, and the capability of India to launch heavier satellites has now been established. The Mars Orbiter Mission is critical for space exploration. It also shows India’s capability to take a spacecraft to a distance of 400 million km, control it properly there and then conduct experiments<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>But sir, there is also scepticism. After so many rovers, so many landers, what will this bring back?</strong></p>
<p>The objective of this mission is to prove our technological capability to precisely orbit a satellite around Mars. There have been 51 Mars missions; only 21 were successful. Secondly, the scientific objective is to study the presence of methane. Why is methane important? We want to understand the existence of life on Mars.</p>
<p><strong>Could we find something that has not already been explored, given so many missions that have been successful?</strong><br />
The presence of methane or otherwise, and the origin of that, whether it is geological or biological, that is something that this mission is going to look at. Also, the atmospheric processes on Mars&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Well, the remarkable thing is the cost of the mission.</strong><br />
Cost and time, both. We have done it at 1/10th the cost.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>There is one more reason why this cryogenic is important. Because I was a sort of a participant in the tamasha that went on more than two decades earlier, of how this programme got a setback (the spy scandal). I used to then work for India Today and I had done a story saying these allegations of spying were wrong. Have you reflected very much on that? Was it a setback to ISRO?</strong><br />
The programme goes on. We have come out of all those and today we have the technology with us.</p>
<p><strong>What is it that makes ISRO different? Somehow, ISRO manages to do more tangible work than most other government organisations.</strong><br />
When we conceive a programme, we look at how it is going to be useful for people, how to reach it to people and how to build systems so that it becomes part of the value chain of those people.</p>
<p><strong>But you also have a better industry interface.</strong><br />
Yes, we had decided from the seventies that Indian industries, both public and private, are going to be part of us. We also make the best use of the academic community in doing research activities.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You got your MBA from IIM-Bangalore before you got your PhD from IIT-Kharagpur.</strong><br />
That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>So you are a businessman as well as a scientist. What made you go for an MBA before you went to research?</strong><br />
Because of the uncertainty involved in high-technology programmes like space, they had to use several of these management techniques.</p>
<p><strong>But your commercial arm Antrix has been struggling a little bit?</strong><br />
If you look at the turnover of Antrix, it has been going up. We recently launched a SPOT 6 satellite, one of the best remote sensing satellites in the world, and SPOT 7 is ready to be launched.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>I know remote-sensing is your own special field of interest.</strong><br />
That’s true. Antrix has been contributing a lot to the communication satellite programme. A number of satellites of foreign countries are lined up for launch using our PSLV. The recently launched microwave remote sensing satellite&#8230; is also going to be used by foreign customers through an arrangement with Antrix.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>But Antrix also got an undue share of controversy for getting into an arrangement with a private company. Two things appeared, one the word ‘spectrum’; second, the word ‘private company’. And somebody even put a figure of Rs 2 lakh crore, because we can’t settle for less than that for a scandal now.</strong><br />
Yes, much has been talked and written about this subject. Over the last three-and-a-half years, we have done what is best for the country, what is best for the government of India, what is best for research.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Was the controversy avoidable? Because there was no scandal.</strong><br />
I don’t want to get into the merit of it because it is going through a legal process at the moment. But what has been done is best for the country.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You have done the damage control?</strong><br />
Yes.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Kiran Karnik was on this show and he said that having seen so much of the government of India, so much of India, he has never found another Indian organisation with a commitment and integrity to match ISRO’s, which is a high compliment.</strong><br />
Thank you. We have done what we thought and what we think is best for the country.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>And you have a track record to deserve the highest of compliments. Dr Radhakrishnan, thank you very much. I know you have many more frontiers to climb and they wait— one in April and one in a couple of years from now. And towards the end of this year, you put your Mars Orbiter in space.</strong><br />
September 24, 2014 is a crucial day for the Mars Orbiter, when we have to precisely reduce the velocity of the spacecraft and make it orbit. If we miss that, then we lose the mission. But we are hopeful.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>I am sure you will take no chances. Because one thing that intrigues me all the time is how religious many of your scientists are — you find coconuts being broken, pujas, mantras&#8230;</strong><br />
We are all Indians&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>So, science or no science&#8230; you see no contradiction?</strong></p>
<p>We don’t see any contradiction.</p>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mamata-main4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995806" alt="Without naming Hazare, Mamata said: &quot;Some people are saying that Mamata Banerjee is good but the Trinamool Congress party is not. The Trinamool Congress is my own creation.&quot;" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mamata-main4.jpg" /></a> Without naming Hazare, Mamata said: &#8220;Some people are saying that Mamata Banerjee is good but the Trinamool Congress party is not. The Trinamool Congress is my own creation.&#8221;
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It is not going to be as easy for the BJP as it is being made out to be, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee said on Tuesday in her first election rally in South 24-Parganas.</span></p>
<p>“Well before the polls are over, many people have started chanting ‘Namo, Namo, Namo’ as if the BJP’s win in the Lok Sabha polls was certain. But I am telling you that the game is not so easy. I am not willing to accept that the BJP is coming to power in Delhi,” she said in Diamond Harbour, the constituency from where her nephew Abhisekh Banerjee is the Trinamool candidate.</p>
<p>“I have been in politics for a long time and as far as I understand it, where are the numbers for the BJP? The BJP’s seats will not come from Bengal, not from Bihar, from Tamil Nadu, from Kerala or from Punjab. Where will it come from?”</p>
<p>“I am not claiming that the Trinamool Congress will the number one party in the polls. But the Trinamool Congress will emerge as the third largest party and control Delhi’s politics,” the West Bengal chief minister said.</p>
<p>In what could be her first response to Anna Hazare’s charge that Mamata was good but her party was not, after the activist abruptly called off his joint rally at Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi recently, Mamata said that she would not have grown to what she is if the Trinamool was bad or corrupt.</p>
<p>Without naming Hazare, Mamata said: “Some people are saying that Mamata Banerjee is good but the Trinamool Congress party is not. The Trinamool Congress is my own creation. Had it become bad or corrupt then Mamata Banerjee would not have been there.”</p>
<p>She said there is always a miniscule percentage of bad elements in everything — among journalists, among government officials, bureaucrats and also in political parties. “I have seen many parties but I can tell you that you will not find a party like the Trinamool Congress. The bad elements are always weeded out in the Trinamool Congress,” she said and urged party members to keep the party’s image clean. “The people are the ultimate judge,” she said.</p>
<p>In an indirect dig at the Delhi fiasco, Mamata said the Trinamool was not a “slave” to anyone. “We have not gone there to beg for anyone’s favour. The Trinamool Congress will not bow its head to anyone, not to any political party, come what may.”</p>
<p>She attacked the Congress, BJP and CPM and reminded the large gathering that her party was pitted against the “syndicate” of Congress-BJP-CPM this elections. Giving a vote to Congress would be equal to giving a vote to the BJP or CPM, she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012782&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Pit against Lingayat strongman and BJP leader B S Yeddyurappa, former chief minister S Bangarappa’s daughter Geetha Shivrajkumar is hoping that Shimoga will see her the way it saw her father for many decades.</span></p>
<p>“My mother asked me to contest Lok Sabha elections to serve the people of Shimoga. Based on her request and support from my husband, I have entered politics. There is not going to be any stepping back. I will continue in this field for a long time,” the wife of Kannada film star Shivrajkumar said after making her decision, as the Janata Dal (Secular) tries to wrest the Shimoga seat from the BJP’s control.</p>
<p>The daughter-in-law of Kannada cultural icon Dr Rajkumar, who is set to make her political debut in a region dominated by her socialist father for three decades before his death, is hoping to recreate the magic of her father’s days with her film star husband in tow.</p>
<p>At a media interaction, Geeta said politics is not new to her since she grew up in the home of S Bangarappa. She said she had learnt how to respect people from her own family and her in-laws.</p>
<p>The JD(S) had given opportunities to Bangarappa at a critical stage in his political career and responsibilities to her brother Madhu Bangarappa leading her to join the party, she said. “I have not done anything wrong. So, I need not fear anyone in politics. I consider Yeddyurappa as one of the many candidates I am contesting against. There is nothing other than this in my mind. I hope the people of Shimoga will hold me in high esteem since Bangarappa did a lot for them,” she said.</p>
<p>“I will file my nomination on March 24 and then go to people at the gram panchayat levels to know what I should do for them. I will come to know the problems of common people and then I will work to solve them,’’ she said.</p>
<p>She also clarified that JD(S) leaders like H D Devegowda and H D Kumaraswamy were not trying to capitalize on the image of the family of Dr Rajkumar and sympathy for Bangarappa, who died three years ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, her husband and Kannada star Shivarajkumar said he will work to help his wife win the election and clarified that he will not work for the JD(S). “I will be campaigning for my wife and not for the party. One candidate from the JD(S) approached me to campaign for him too. But I refused,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012779&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Latching on to the revelations from the Henderson Brooks report about the Indian debacle in the 1962 war with China, the BJP on Tuesday accused the Congress-led UPA government of ignoring the national security issue by repeating the same mistakes.</span></p>
<p>“The investigations revealed show that it is the same old story of Congress approach towards national security and defence preparedness&#8230; government of the day did not really communicate well with the Army. They (government) did not take cognizance of their needs and therefore there was a gap not only of communication but of requirement and preparedness. Therefore, India had to suffer a humiliating defeat,” BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said, charging the UPA government of ignoring national security issues.</p>
<p>“The government then was of Congress led by Jawaharlal Nehru. Today it is Congress government led by Manmohan Singh. Both the governments are guilty of not giving enough attention to the very important issue of national security,” he said. “Even today, the government is not giving top priority to national security and defence preparedness. BJP will give top priority to defence.”</p>
<p>The BJP demanded that the Henderson Brooks report be made public. “The nation still feels the pain of that humiliation. The BJP would like the entire report to be made public so that more than 50 years thereafter the nation must know as to who did what wrong,” BJP deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Ravi Shankar Prasad said. This comes in the backdrop of an Australian journalist disclosing the report’s findings.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012775&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Excerpts from sections of the classified Henderson Brooks report on the 1962 India-China war that became public Monday:</em></p>
<p><strong>On an unequal battle:</strong> In 1960, China had increased its deployment in Ladakh and a war game run by the Western Command brought out that a minimum of one division was required to meet the threat. This demand was placed in September 1961 but no decision was given by Army HQ. This can be attributed to an incorrect assessment of Chinese reaction by the General Staff Branch of the Army HQ led by Lt Gen Kaul. “General Staff Branch Army HQ took little action on Western Command’s recommendations, either to strengthen Ladakh or alternatively to lessen the tension there.”</p>
<p><strong>On the role of Lt Gen Kaul, Chief of General Staff and IV Corps Commander:</strong> “Normal planning, detailed staff work and coordination, prerequisites of proper military functioning, posture and balance were progressively abandoned by General Staff Branch Army HQ. It is more a question of action on whips and supposition and then plugging holes rather than on deliberate military thought followed by planned actions. Gen Kaul&#8230;time and again ordered in furtherance of the forward policy the establishment of individual posts, overruling protests made by Western Command.”</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/china-m2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2013518" alt="china-m" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/china-m2.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p><strong>On the role of top military leadership:</strong> “Lapse in staff duties on the part of the chief of the general staff, his deputy, the Director of Military Operations, the Director, Military Intelligence, and other staff directors is inexcusable. From this stemmed the unpreparedness and the unbalance of our forces. These appointments in General Staff are key appointments and officers were hand-picked by Gen Kaul to fill them.”</p>
<p>“The mistakes and lapses of the staff sitting in Delhi without the stress and strain of the battle are more heinous than the errors made by commanders in the field of battle.”</p>
<p>On the better performance by the Western command in Ladakh: “It was a junior leaders and jawans battle and there is no doubt that they acquitted themselves well. They fought under grave handicaps and in face of defeat, yet there was no sign of undue panic and never a rout. The main reason for this was that troops fought under commanders they knew and trusted. The good name of our Army was not completely marred in Ladakh and the grave errors committed by the General Staff to an extent mitigated, thanks to the fighting ability of our troops.”</p>
<p><strong>On troop conditions in Eastern Sector under IV Corps:</strong> “There were cases of posts without supplies and food for a week or more. The condition of the men living on these isolated bleak outposts at altitudes over 12,000 ft without shelter, food or fuel, can well be imagined.”</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/chn.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2013519" alt="chn" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/chn.jpg?w=299&#038;h=600" width="299" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Unplanned action changed an Army into a mob:</strong> “The hardship and privations suffered by the men however had an important bearing on morale and leadership. No troops placed in the circumstances, as they were, could be expected to obey orders, let alone fight. It is unplanned actions like these carried out in haste and hurry that changed disciplined men into a rabble and an Army into a mob.”</p>
<p><strong>On the controversial location of Dhola post that initiated the 1962 war:</strong> The report says the Army concluded that Dhola post was set up at the wrong position and to the north of the McMahon line but its reference in location statement and situation reports did not reflect this to “avoid alarm and queries from all concerned”.</p>
<p><strong>Absolving Responsibility</strong></p>
<p><strong>On the Defence Minister categorically ordering that no minutes be kept of his meetings with Army Commanders:</strong> “This is a surprising decision and one which could and did lead to grave consequences. It absolved in the ultimate analysis anyone of the responsibility of any major decision. This could and did lead to decision being taken without careful and considered thought on the consequences of those decisions.”</p>
<p><strong>On decision to “evict Chinese” from border:</strong> “The very basis of the eviction rested on an erroneous surmise of the Chinese ‘not reacting’ to even a military show of force by us. Perhaps the defence ministry and the DIB had convinced the General Staff Army HQ regarding the lack of reaction, or it be that they reached the conclusion together&#8230;this thinking percolated down to all levels of command and brought about a sense of false complacency.”</p>
<p><strong>On Kaul’s controversial appointment as IV Corps Commander:</strong> Kaul assumed command on 4 October vide a secret signal yet this was announced “dramatically” by newspapers the very next day. “It has been verified that Lt Gen Kaul had stated, when flying out of Tezpur, that next day large headlines in the newspapers would announce his precise charter. The inference from this is obvious. He also stated that if he was not successful, there were chances that the government would fall.”</p>
<p><strong>On Kaul’s sudden “evacuation” to Delhi in the middle of operations on 17 October on grounds of ill health:</strong> “It is not known who gave the decision for his being evacuated to Delhi but neither the Army Commander nor the Deputy Director of Medical Services, Eastern command, knew about the evacuation.”</p>
<p><strong>On the “suicidal order” by Kaul for taking a Chinese position near Dhola post:</strong> “The General Staff, sitting in Delhi, ordering an action against a position 1,000 yards north east of Dhola post &#8211; to say the least &#8211; is astounding&#8230;this order could go down in the annals of history as being as incredulous as the order for ‘the charge of the light brigade’.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012770&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">North Indian migrant workers, who are slowly changing Kerala’s demography, have found way into the Malayalam celluloid. The first movie to be based on the life of migrant workers, Masala Republic, is slated for release next month and another untitled movie with a Bengali migrant as its protagonist is in the making. </span></p>
<p>The lead in Masala Republic is played by a migrant and the movie’s supporting actors include another dozen from the same community. A Kerala government study had concluded last year that the state’s migrant worker population (mainly from north and north-eastern states) was 25 lakh.</p>
<p>Masala Republic’s Director Vishak G S says the story is a political satire, woven around lives of migrant workers. “Many of them are addicted to paan masala. How the community reacts to ban on pan masala and emergence of a trade union to fight their cause are highlights of the story,’’ he said. The lead role, a paan vendor, is played by Sumangal, a migrant worker from Assam, who is an employee of a canteen in Kochi. Another migrant worker from Tibet plays the villain in the film, which also has prominent artistes from Malayalam film industry. The film was shot at Perumbavoor, a municipal town in Central Kerala, which is incidentally the largest hub of migrant workers in the state.</p>
<p>Director Akku Akbar has announced another project based on the life of migrant workers. Young actor Fahadh Faazil has been cast to play the role of a Bengali worker.</p>
<p>The migrant community in Kerala, initially employed to fill the shortage of unskilled workers in the construction sector, have now made it in many professions in Kerala. Recently at trend has started where women migrant workers, especially from Orissa, are also heading to Kerala.</p>
<p>The presence of the migrants, apart from changing the profiles of cities where they are concentrated, have also helped natives acquaint themselves with Hindi and regional North Indian languages. In the past, there have been incidents of migrants landing in trouble due to the communication gap between them and locals.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012764&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The first English-language novel by a Jharkhandi is full of practical magic <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010652&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/eye6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2010654" alt="A village in Jharkhand." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/eye6.jpg" /></a> A village in Jharkhand.
<p>Rupi Baskey was wasting away and it was all the doing of the woman who lusted after her husband. A woman as strong as her, who birthed her son in the middle of a paddy field, had been subject to a witch’s spell.</p>
<p>Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar’s The Mysterious Ailment of Rupi Baskey is the first in English to be written by a Jharkhandi and published by a major publishing firm. Those who take a cue from the title and expect a whodunit will be disappointed. The protagonist, Rupi Baskey’s ailment remains unsolved; in fact, none of the many health issues in the book are given names.</p>
<p>The novel is set largely in two fictional villages in Jharkhand’s East Singhbhum district — Kadamdihi near Chakulia and Nitra near Ghatshila — and its plot begins by talking about the family of Santhali elder Somai Baskey. Through Somai of Kadamdihi, his daughter Putki and her husband Khorda, the reader reaches Rupi, wife of Somai’s eldest son Sido. After Rupi falls ill, apparently due to witchcraft performed by Gurubari, who has an affair with Sido, the spotlight is on her as she battles with forces beyond her control, but refuses to match evil with evil spells. “There are no names to these medical conditions. If there are, I did not know. Secondly, I did not find it necessary (to explain). Some things should remain unanswered,” said Sowvendra, over a patchy mobile phone connection. He is in Pakur district, 390 km from Ranchi and closer to Kolkata than to Jharkhand’s capital, “absolutely far away from all the buzz about my book.”</p>
<p>This reticence, bordering on an absence of scepticism, is remarkable because the 30-year-old is a medical officer posted at an additional primary health centre in Pakur town. The idea of the book came from the gossip in his village —Kishoripur in Chakulia: “There was an affair outside marriage and a lot of gossip went on about it. I built my story on that.”</p>
<p>Despite the fact that readers outside Jharkhand may not have an idea about the places and cultures Sowvendra was talking about, his first draft — completed in October 2011 — set the characters in a space unencumbered by time. “When I wrote the story first, it did not have a political backdrop.</p>
<p>It was just a plain story. But when it was accepted by Aleph, my editor Anurag Basnet told me that this was, perhaps, the first time somebody was writing about Jharkhand and the adivasis there. He said that we had to give it some kind of a timeline; that no novel can stay in a vacuum; that it reads like a fable,” said Sowvendra. The final version is set in the 1970s and the 1980s’ Jharkhand. It also casts its eye back in time on Jaipal Singh Munda, the Olympic hockey gold medallist, who led one of the first adivasi political movements in the region.</p>
<p>He admits he did not go beyond talking to his immediate family while researching the book; for the political perspective, there was his grandfather and father, both active supporters of a national party: “Only when I was asked about the book’s politics in an interview did I realise that I have to stand up for a political idea.” This, from someone who also points out, “I do not see myself as an indigenous writer. I see myself as just a writer. ”</p>
<p>This is a rare despatch from Jharkhand, which talks about the suffering of its protagonist at the hands of witches — allegations of witchcraft being often used to victimise women in these parts.<br />
As it turns out, the good doctor does believe that witches exist: “I believe in these things although I do not approve of women being dragged out of houses and burned after being branded as witches. In the Sarna religion, when we pray to a particular god, we have mediums through which the gods communicate with us.” He admits, though, that he is yet to witness the rituals described in the book.</p>
<p>The companion book to the lyrical Rupi Baskey should be Sanjay Bahadur’s novel, the meticulously researched Hul (Roli Books). Both talk of Santhali culture, with the latter using the plot as a means to talk in detail about a great tribal uprising that is not part of popular discourse. On the other hand, Rupi’s story lets the reader navigate the many spaces Sowvendra leaves empty. “If it is not written, it should remain mysterious,” he says.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010652&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The Working Group had identified approximately 37 per cent of Western Ghats, 59,940 sq km of natural landscape of the hills, as ecologically sensitive.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012753&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests (MoEF) Tuesday issued a draft notification earmarking 56,825 sq km of the Western Ghats as Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA), keeping it out of bounds for mining, quarrying and major construction and thermal projects. Giving in to demands from Kerala it, however, left out over 3,000 sq km from ESA demarcated by the Kasturirangan-led High Level Working Group.</span></p>
<p>The Working Group had identified approximately 37 per cent of Western Ghats, 59,940 sq km of natural landscape of the hills, as ecologically sensitive.</p>
<p>“Taking into account ESA demarcated by Kerala government for Kerala instead of Ecologically Sensitive Area recommended by High Level Working Group for the state, the total works out to 56,825 sq km,” the draft notification says.</p>
<p>As per the notification, the ESA in Kerala is spread over of 9,993.7 sq km, 9,107 sq km of forest area and 886.7 sq km of non-forest area.</p>
<p>The notification says that in exercise of powers conferred by section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 (29 of 1986) and sub-rule (3) of rule 5 of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, the Central Government notifies the identified area of 56,825 sq km across six states Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, as Western Ghats Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA).</p>
<p>The Election Commission had last week permitted the Centre to issue a draft notification. With stakeholder states particularly Kerala witnessing protests, the Veerappa Moily led MoEF had before the elections were announced said it would seek and allow changes in ESA boundaries based on recommendations of state governments. The Environment Ministry had added that it had accepted the Kerala government’s expert committee report on the issue and agreed with its recommendation to keep agricultural lands, plantations, orchards and habitations out of the ESA.</p>
<p>The BJP had opposed the decision of the MoEF to come out with the draft notification as the model code was in force and approached the EC. The EC permitted the Centre to issue the notification, adding the final notification could be issued only after elections.</p>
<p>K Kasturirangan report was submitted to MoEF in 2013 recommending that 37 per cent of Western Ghats be declared ecologically sensitive. The Ministry had at the time, conveyed in principle” acceptance of the report.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012753&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Zakia Jafri, widow of former Congress MP Ahsan Jafri who was killed in the 2002 Gulberg Society massacre, Tuesday moved Gujarat High Court challenging a magisterial court order that upheld the clean chit given to Chief Minister Narendra Modi and 59 others by the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) on their alleged complicity in the 2002 riots. The petition is expected to come up for hearing March 20.</span></p>
<p>In her petition before the magisterial court of Ahmedabad Metropolitan Court, Jafri had sought to arraign Modi and 59 others under the charges of criminal conspiracy, abetment to commit mass murder, arson and rape and also for tampering with evidence and destroying valuable records of the Home Department.</p>
<p>Activist Teesta Setalvad, who is assisting Jafri, said the petition, which runs into around 540 pages, was filed last week. In a press release, Setalvad said the petition has laid out substantive grounds for rejecting the Ahmedabad Metropolitan Court order.</p>
<p>On December 26 last year, the court of Magistrate B J Ganatra had dismissed Jafri’s protest petition against the SIT report. “The Metropolitan Magistrate committed a fundamental error in law and on facts in failing to exercise his jurisdiction. By not dealing with the substantive arguments laid down by Jafri in written and oral submissions, the Judge has simply accepted the contentions in the closure report with a non-application of mind,” Setalvad said in the release.</p>
<p><strong>Cops oppose Teesta bail, say no need to drag Modi</strong></p>
<p><strong>AHMEDABAD:</strong> The Detection of Crime Branch, Ahmedabad, Tuesday objected to Mumbai-based activist Teesta Setalvad dragging Gujarat CM and BJP’s PM candidate Narendra Modi into the case against her, her husband Javed Anand, Tanvir Jafri, the son of slain ex-MP Ahsan Jafri, and two others of misappropriating foreign funds meant for 2002 riot victims.</p>
<p>In an affidavit filed Tuesday which claimed fresh evidence against Setalvad, the DCB contended that “Modi is in no way concerned with the accused or with the matter and such tactics of maligning high constitutional functionaries, it is respectfully prayed, ought to be strongly deprecated”. The court has reserved the order for March 26.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012749&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">India has said it will appeal against a ruling by an Italian court that has barred the encashing of bank guarantees worth over Rs 2,300 crore in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal as part of its action against the firm for indulging in corrupt practices to bag the contract.</span></p>
<p>A setback of sorts came for India after a Milan court accepted the position of the Italian company that India be barred from encashing the guarantees. India has already encashed gurantees of over Rs 240 crore that had been deposited in India but the bulk of Rs 2,300 crore that was deposited in Italian banks is yet to be recovered.</p>
<p>In a statement, the AgustaWestland group has said the Italian court has recognised the “manifestly abusive enforcement of the guarantees” by the Indian government, given the “vagueness of the complaints made in relation made to alleged breaches of contract”.</p>
<p>On its part, the Ministry of Defence has said. “The Government of India will be filing an appeal against the order of the Italian court in Milan in the case relating to encashment of bank guarantees. Simultaneously, the government will vigorously pursue all options for encashment of the bank guarantees.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012747&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Goa court asked for details to solve a gangrape case.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012746&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Even AS the Supreme Court is seized of a bunch of petitions challenging the validity of the Aadhaar card, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has rushed to the SC against an order of the Bombay High Court that seeks to examine if its biometric database can be used in criminal investigation. </span></p>
<p>The latest controversy involving a flagship programme of the UPA government has its roots in the order of a Goa court asking the UIDAI to give the CBI biometrics of all residents enrolled with Aadhaar in the state to help solve the gangrape of a seven-year-old girl as the database — which includes recording of fingerprints, iris and facial images of applicants — is supposed to be devoid of duplication and tamper-proof.</p>
<p>The girl was raped in a school in Goa’s Vasco city 14 months back and the case is yet to be cracked. However, there were some chance fingerprints recovered from the scene of crime and the magistrate thought UIDAI could match these fingerprints with its database to help ascertain the identities of the assailants.</p>
<p>Aggrieved by this order, the UIDAI moved Bombay High Court and claimed validation of the magistrate’s order will open the floodgates of such directives by other courts as well other authorities.</p>
<p>The high court noted that the UIDAI has agreed to test the competence of its database in comparing the chance fingerprints with its biometric record. The high court also asked the director general of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory to examine the technological capabilities of the UIDAI database.</p>
<p>Terming the high court’s order as “erroneous,” the UIDAI has petitioned the Supreme Court that the UIDAI system has been developed “for civilian use and for non-forensic purposes”.</p>
<p>Even as the UIDAI describes its biometric technology as one of the best in the world, it pointed out that there was a 0.057 per cent occurrence of false identification. Therefore, the the implications of the False Positive Identification Rate of 0.057 per cent when applied in the UIDAI database of 60 crore residents, will imply false matches of lakh of residents, according the authority.</p>
<p>“This means any such random search, which was now being demanded by the Respondent No.1 (CBI), even if implemented in the current system, would put lakhs of innocent people under the scanner,” said its petition, besides saying such a precedent could lead to a plethora of similar requests for assistance in criminal investigation.</p>
<p>The UIDAI also asserted that sharing information with other agencies would violate a person’s right to privacy since the current data-sharing policy and guidelines clearly provides that biometric data cannot be shared without the consent of the resident.</p>
<p>“Building a system that can search using latent fingerprints, quite like criminal database searches, is not within the constitutional and legal mandate and scope of UIDAI and fundamentally against the core reason residents have provided their data voluntarily to UIDAI,” it maintained.</p>
<p>The UIDAI added that the questions relating to privacy was also a subject matter of the bunch of PILs currently being adjudicated by the SC and hence no order could be passed to share information of the applicants in the meantime.</p>
<p>The SC is hearing a bunch of petitions that have challenged the validity of the Aadhaar card in absence of a pertinent legislation and has also disputed its compulsory nature. By an interim last September, the apex court restricted all authorities from denying a benefit or service to any citizen of India for want of the Aadhaar card.</p>
<p>The SC will hear the UIDAI petition on March 24.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012746&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/eye5.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2010651" alt="Next month, Roy will find himself in the Mecca of football — Old Trafford football stadium in Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Manchester United FC. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/eye5.jpg" /></a> Next month, Roy will find himself in the Mecca of football — Old Trafford football stadium in Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Manchester United FC.
<p>A strange silence inhabits early afternoons at Rahul Vidya Niketan’s dormitories. A silence loaded with anticipation. At this shelter for children of sex workers set up at Baruipur, on the outskirts of Kolkata, run by Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (a collective of 65,000 sex workers), the early hours of afternoons are when the wardens ready themselves for the rest of the day. “They arrive hungry from school (run by DMSC) and need to be fed. The younger ones have to be bathed too,” says Pintu Maity, a member of the committee. As the clock strikes 2 pm, children line up for their lunch (soya nuggets curry, rice and daal) and then head to their dorms for an afternoon nap.</p>
<p>All, except a gang of gaunt boys, who quickly change into jerseys and shorts. They rush to the adjacent field for their afternoon practice. “I tell them to take a break of half-an-hour before practising, but who will listen?” says coach Biswajit Majumdar, who has been with the school for the past four years. Among this group is 16-year-old Rajeeb Roy, son of Rekha, a sex worker associated with DMSC.</p>
<p>In the past few days, Roy has seen a stream of visitors from newspapers and television channels. He is one of the two boys from Kolkata to be selected by the renowned Manchester United football club to train with the U-21 team (the other being Arko Dey from Baranagar area of the city).<br />
Next month, Roy will find himself in the Mecca of football — Old Trafford football stadium in Greater Manchester, England, and the home of Manchester United FC. He is going for a 15-day training session. Not a mean achievement for a boy who used to play barefoot at the BK Paul Avenue ground near Sonagachi, the red-light district in north Kolkata.</p>
<p>Sitting at the committee’s cramped Sonagachi office in Kolkata, Roy remembers his days spent in Asia’s largest red-light area. He points out his house, a narrow, grey building in the maze. “I used to live on the fourth floor of the building. My best friend, Kaushik Saha, lived on the third floor,” he says. As Roy dribbles a football on the terrace of the office and poses for our photographer, he looks worried. He tries to spin the ball on his finger but fails. “I don’t concentrate on these kind of skills. I am an attacker for my team,” he says. Eventually, Saha comes to his rescue. He spins the ball on his finger and then, delicately, like a chef handling a soufflé, transfers the ball from his fingers to Roy’s, whose abashed face lights up with joy and our photographer gets the perfect shot.</p>
<p>“My mother would lock me in my room after lunch so that I could take a nap, but I would quietly sneak out to play with my friends,” says Roy, looking at the sprawl of Sonagachi. He smiles nervously when we ask if we could talk to his mother. “She is a very shy person. She won’t say no to an interview because of me, but I don’t want her to feel embarrassed about these things,” he says.</p>
<p>Roy used to spend the money he got from his mother for his lunch break to pay the entry fee to football tournaments taking place in the city. “We would pool in our resources to participate in these events,” he says.</p>
<p>Talking about his journey to selection for Manchester United, he says, “Last month, I was selected along with 30 others to participate in a camp in Goa through a nationwide school championship competition. The coaches from Manchester United selected 11 of us.”</p>
<p>When Roy reached the camp, he was concerned about how people would perceive him. “I arrived late because I took a train from Kolkata. Everybody else took a flight. There were children from rich families who spoke English,” says Roy. Not being able to communicate in English was a big issue in his head. “But I made friends quickly. There was a boy from Mumbai who spoke very good English and translated for me when I interacted with the coaches. He told me that it was perfectly fine if I was not able to communicate in English, a lot of Spanish footballers don’t speak English either,” says Roy.</p>
<p>But after a while he adds that he is tired of answering the same questions. “People keep asking me how it feels to be my mother’s son and then achieve something like this. I don’t know how to answer that question,” he says.</p>
<p>Understandably enough, the teenager prefers to tell tales of mischief and merrymaking. He talks about the little shrine dedicated to his favourite Brazilian player, Oscar, in their tiny one-room apartment. His mother didn’t know why a poster of a baby-faced Brazilian man was sharing shrine space with idols of Durga and Shiva. “She would get really irritated and tried removing it many times, but every time, I would bring it back,” says Roy, with a laugh.</p>
<p>Roy feels the real turnaround came in his life when his mother sent him to Rahul Vidya Niketan two years ago. “Here (at Sonagachi), things are not okay and there are a number of bad influences around. One of my close friends is into drugs now. Yesterday, he came to me and asked for Rs 10 as a treat for being selected for Manchester United. I felt really bad. He, too, was a good footballer,” says Roy.</p>
<p>In Rahul Vidya Niketan, Roy was a part of a sports programme initiated by Samarjit Jana, founder of DMSC. “Jana believes that sports is the best way of integrating children of sex workers with the mainstream society. Today, our football coaching centre at Baruipur, which was only meant for children of sex workers, have applicants from across the board,” says Majumdar, who was a first-class player in the Kolkata circuit. In the four years since its inception, the coaching centre sent players to represent India in the Homeless World Cup in Mexico in 2012 and in Poland in 2013. “These kids are determined and talented. But as you can see, they need better nutrition. Most of them can’t even afford a proper pair of shoes. We need to supply all that. That is why we need donors to support these kids,” he says.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010649&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The Congress leaders had then refused to oblige her.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012737&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While actress and former Miss India Gul Panag has secured ticket from the Aam Admi Party to contest from Chandigarh, Congress leaders are claiming that way back in 2004, she had approached them for a Congress ticket. She was said to have met Jairam Ramesh and Salman Khurshid at 99, South Avenue, the then party’s Policy and Planning office, in 2004 to seek a Congress ticket. The Congress leaders had then refused to oblige her.</p>
<p><strong>FAMILY PUSH</strong></p>
<p>Many Congress veterans are still lobbying hard to secure party tickets for their children, although the party has already obliged many of them. Maharashtra Congress chief Manikrao Thakre, for instance, is seeking a ticket for his son Rahul to contest from Yavatmal. Former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot wants a ticket for his son Vaibhav. The Congress high command is, however, not amused and would like these veterans themselves to contest.</p>
<p><strong>VOTERS’ DISCOUNT</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>With the Lok Sabha polls just weeks away, efforts are on nationwide to involve more and more voters in the electoral process to ensure a healthy voter turnout. Authorities in some states are going the extra mile, too, when it comes to innovative thinking. In Punjab, for instance, Deputy Commissioners in some districts have tied up with hotels and restaurants in their areas to provide special discounts and rebates to anybody who votes on the polling day. Under the arrangement, some of these eateries will also be handing over an appreciation letter to first-time voters.</p>
<p><strong>SURPRISE TWEET</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Tuesday took many of his party colleagues by surprise with his tweet alluding to “misfire” in ticket allocation and suggesting a Congress hand, saying, “Ahmed Patel has taken undue interest in BJP internal matters. It is a dangerous enterprise.” However, he made it clear that he was not going to oblige the “Trojan horses” of the Congress leadership within the saffron party by turning against Narendra Modi. He also dismissed suggestions of him contesting against Sonia Gandhi, saying there was “not enough time” left to prepare for such a high-voltage contest.</p>
<p><strong>VOICING PROTEST</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>As the ticket distribution process is on, some disgruntled ticket-seekers are thronging the BJP headquarters to lodge protest. A group of protesters, for instance, shouted slogans against the state unit chief for the choice of party candidate in Sonipat, Ramesh Kaushik. There were protesters from Ghaziabad who were demanding a ‘Tyagi community’ candidate. Party spokesperson Vijay Sonkar Shastri, meanwhile, is said to be disappointed for being denied a ticket from Machhlishahr in Uttar Pradesh. His hopes are now pinned on a technical glitch — the party’s official candidate Ramcharitra Nishad is from a community which is designated as OBC in the state while Macchlishahr constituency is reserved for SC.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012737&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week, PCC secretary Bharati Das resigned from the Congress. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012723&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">For the past one month, the Congress, the main opposition party in Orissa, has been a source of swelling numbers for the ruling BJD with dozens of Congress leaders queuing up to join the regional party.</span></p>
<p>About a fortnight ago, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Bhupinder Singh joined the BJD expressing displeasure over a “coterie” running the Congress. Singh had wanted a Congress ticket for Kalahandi Lok Sabha seat and initially went underground for a couple of days early this month. After surfacing at a hospital, Singh went to Naveen Niwas, the home of CM Naveen Patnaik, and joined the BJD. His son Daljeet and Congress MLA from Brajrajnagar Anup Sai also joined the ruling party. Sai got the BJD ticket from the same constituency.</p>
<p>“I have been systematically sidelined by a coterie,” Singh said referring to “machinations” of union minister and chief of the election campaign committee Srikant Jena and PCC president Jaydev Jena.</p>
<p>Singh may have been the most prominent Congress deserter in Orissa, but he is not the first. Champua Congress MLA Jitu Patnaik and Talcher MLA Braja Kishore Pradhan joined the BJD ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls as Naveen tried to get sculptor Raghunath Mohapatra elected.</p>
<p>With pre-poll surveys projecting a fourth win for the BJD in the assembly elections, more Congress leaders are joining the BJD. Though the Congress won 32.75 per cent of total votes in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, the party has been hit hard by deserters this time.</p>
<p>In February, its Nayagarh district president and scion of the Nayagarh royal family, Hemendra Kumar Singh, joined the BJD. He was tipped to win from Nayagarh even on a Congress ticket but sensing a loss of popularity by the party, he quit. After him, former minister Kamala Das, who left the BJD 14 years ago to join the Congress after being charged with corruption, returned to BJD. Former Balikuda MLA Umesh Swain also followed.</p>
<p>Last week, PCC secretary Bharati Das resigned from the Congress. Hema Gamang, former Koraput MP and wife of former chief minister Giridhar Gamang, also joined BJD.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012723&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modiindiram.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012949" alt="Indira is gearing up now to face Narendra Modi and possibly Arvind Kejriwal from Varanasi." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modiindiram.jpg" /></a> Indira is gearing up now to face Narendra Modi and possibly Arvind Kejriwal from Varanasi.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Indira Tiwari, Trinamool Congress candidate from Varanasi, has been associated with the Ram Janmabhoomi case in the Supreme Court in her capacity as general secretary of the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, a post she resigned in February this year. </span></p>
<p>Gearing up now to face Narendra Modi and possibly Arvind Kejriwal in the prestigious seat, she says about Modi that neither she nor her party believes in “untouchability”. “It is a democracy after all,” she tells The Indian Express at the Trinamool office in Delhi.</p>
<p>Asked whether her party will be open to supporting Modi post polls, she replies, “It is a hypothetical question.”</p>
<p>She is proud of her association with the Hindu Mahasabha, emphasising the organisation was set up by the likes of Madan Mohan Malaviya and Lala Lajpat Rai as a social outfit, not a religious one. “I worked there from 2006 to February this year, when I resigned after Trinamool approached me to fight the elections. I was the national general secretary. I want to make it clear that it is the Hindu Mahasabha that is a respondent in the Ram Janmabhoomi case. The BJP is taking the country for a ride by making it look like they are a party. The courts have accepted that the land belongs to the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas. As an office bearer I was closely associated with that case,” she says.</p>
<p>Granddaughter of former Congress leader Kamalapati Tripathi, Indira flaunts her Varanasi roots. She says it is her city, her home where she grew up, where all “sinners”, including Modi are welcome to take a dip in the holy Ganges. “Modi’s sins will be washed away. Kejriwal is welcome, too. But I only want to ask the Aam Aadmi Party why they did a referendum in Delhi when they had to form the government but did not take people’s opinion when they resigned.”</p>
<p>Her political career started with the Congress’s students’ wing, NSUI, but she left for the Hindu Mahasabha as the Congres started losing its clout in UP. But she hopes her stint in student politics will hold her in good stead when she fights the high-profile election on May 12.</p>
<p>One question she faces is whether Muslims, who form such a large support base for Trinamool in West Bengal, will vote for her given her Mahasabha roots.</p>
<p>“I don’t look at the electorate as Hindu or Muslim, but it is true that when I fought Banaras Hindu University students’ elections for NSUI in 1982, I got massive support from Muslims in areas such as Madanpura, Lallapura, Teliabajar,” she says. “I don’t believe in discriminatory politics. I had come out in support of Saddam Hussein during the run-up to the Iraq war. Even in the Hindu Mahasabha, my role had been to initiate a liberal dialogue with people across religions.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012721&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Facing a revolt in his home turf of Ganjam district, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday juggled the BJD list, renominating nine-time MLA and Khallikote royal V Sugnani Kumari Deo as he declared the final list of 24 candidates for the first phase of assembly and Lok Sabha elections on April 10.</span></p>
<p>In the first phase, 10 Lok Sabha seats and 70 assembly seats would be up for grabs.</p>
<p>There were few surprises in Tuesday’s list as Naveen did not renominate sitting Koraput MP Jayram Pangi. He chose Laxmipur MLA Jhina Hikaka, who was abducted by Maoists in April 2012, for the Koraput Lok Sabha seat.</p>
<p>But Pangi managed to corner two seats — Pottangi assembly constituency for his son Prafulla Pangi and Kotpad for nephew Ashok Pangi, both in in Koraput district.</p>
<p>Naveen renominated Prakriti Devi Singh Deo, wife of state BJP chief and king of Patnagarh K V Singh’s younger brother Srivardhan Singh Deo for Patnagarh assembly seat. However, he ignored his Doon School mate and Rajya Sabha MP A U Singh Deo’s plea to nominate his son Arkesh Singh Deo for the Bolangir assembly seat, giving the ticket to Harekrushna Sarangi.</p>
<p>Hemendra Kumar Singh, who defected from Congress last month, got ticket for the Kandhamal LS seat. Six sitting MLAs were dropped.</p>
<p>Hema Gamang, wife of former CM Giridhar Gamang, will fight from Gunupur.</p>
<p>The announcement of the names were delayed as Sugnani Deo threw a fit after Naveen told the media that she has opted out from the electoral race owing to ill health. Last week, Naveen announced the name of Latika Pradhan, daughter of Aska MP Nityananda Pradhan for Ganjam’s Kabisuryanagar assembly seat. Deo, who has been getting elected non-stop as MLA since 1961, threw a fit.</p>
<p>As her supporters sat on dharna, Naveen offered to withdraw Latika Pradhan from Kabisuryanagar and renominate Deo.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012722&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2013018 " alt="" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tatuk-480.jpg" /> Gichik Tatuk (L) trekked three days from his village near the China border to the rally. Rahul meets people in the crowd. Dasarath Deka
<p>Gichik Tatuk walked three days from his village Tali, bordering China, and then caught a jeep from Yangte to Ziro to see Indira Gandhi’s abang-ja, or grandson, address an election rally on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I heard him talk about building roads to the farthest corners of our state. Had I got closer to him, I would have told him to come to my village, which has no road and no electricity even today,” said Gichik, who reached Rahul Gandhi’s rally wearing the traditional bopa (headgear) of cane, bear fur, a squirrel’s tail and a hornbill’s beak. He is also the gaon burha (village headman) of Tali. The village of about 600 people lies in the remote Kurung Kumey district of Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>Several others in the 4,000-strong crowd, which included about 200 gaon burhas, have trekked across mountains, some for a day, some like Gichik for three days, in the absence of roads. “My village is just 7 km from Ziro town, but about 4 km is a pucca footpath where cars cannot ply,” said Hage Manu, 60, the woman gaon burha of Michi. Pura Sara, 80, of Higa trekked about 4 km to the nearest road-head, while Nani Oma, another woman gaon burha, walked about 3 km.</p>
<img class="size-full wp-image-2013017" alt="rahul-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rahul-4801.jpg" /> Rahul Gandhi in Arunachal Pradesh.
<p>Road connectivity has long been a problem in the state, with Chief Minister Nabam Tuki repeatedly telling the Centre to connect every village on the 1,080-km China border before all villagers move out to urban centres for lack of basic amenities.</p>
<p>Rahul, who spoke for just 16 minutes in the Subansiri Stadium, focused on connectivity: roads, railway, air. He said it was the UPA that sanctioned a Rs 10,000-crore package in 2008, its most important project component being the 1,400-km Trans-Arunachal Highway, a two-lane road that would pass through every district.</p>
<p>“It is only with better connectivity that Arunachal Pradesh can march forward. We are also focusing on hydro-electric power, with this state having a potential to meet the entire country’s power demand,” Rahul said.</p>
<p>He recalled how his grandmother granted union territory status to Arunachal Pradesh in 1972, and how his father upgraded it to a state in 1987. “That was a great step Rajiv Gandhi took. But what I believe is the inherent strength Arunachal has is of its history, ecology, nature. We also believe in protecting its environment, its language, its culture,” he said.</p>
<p>Congress candidate Padi Richo too referred to Rahul’s family’s connection with the state. “The name of this town may sound like Zero. But this place has been in the heart of Congress leaders since the days of Jawaharlal Nehru,” he said. “Panditji came here way back in 1953 along with Indira. In 1957, Indira came here as I&amp;B minister to inaugurate a drinking water project in Hari and Hong villages near here; in 1972 she came again; in 1987, Rajiv Gandhi came to inaugurate the Ranganadi hydel project.” He said his father had welcomed Nehru, his elder brother had welcomed Indira, and he was lucky to be welcoming Rahul.</p>
<p>Chief minister Nabam Tuki said Ziro is the zero point from where one measures the earth. “Ziro in the Apatani language means the epicenter of the earth. This is a place with zero-problem. You can see that in the smiling faces of the people,” Tuki said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012712&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ki1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012718" alt="Kher was named as the candidate Saturday night ahead of three local aspirants — party president Sanjay Tandon and former MPs Satya Pal Jain and Harmohan Dhawan. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ki1.jpg" /></a> Kher was named as the candidate Saturday night ahead of three local aspirants — party president Sanjay Tandon and former MPs Satya Pal Jain and Harmohan Dhawan.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Actor Kirron Kher, the BJP’s candidate from Chandigarh, landed in the city amidst black flags being shown, stones being pelted and protests in different parts of the city. Kher’s candidature has met with protests in a section of the BJP with a vociferous demand for a local leader to be fielded. The area near the BJP office in Sector 33 has been turned into a fortress with barricading on the roads and heavy police presence.</span></p>
<p>Kher was named as the candidate Saturday night ahead of three local aspirants — party president Sanjay Tandon and former MPs Satya Pal Jain and Harmohan Dhawan. The agitated supporters held protests at several places.</p>
<p>The protesters waited at the Sector 29-31 roundabout with black flags to wave at Kher on her way from the airport to the BJP office in Sector 33. Sensing trouble, the police diverted a few vehicles carrying Kirron and her husband Anupam Kher as well as senior party leaders to an alternative route.</p>
<p>However, the vehicles of other BJP workers who had gone to welcome her were pelted with stones. Amit Rana, president of the BJP youth wing, who was caught in the melee, said some of their cars were damaged because of the stone pelting. Protesters laid seige on the road leading from the airport to Sector 29-31 roundabout, checking vehicles before letting them pass.</p>
<p>As Kher reached the BJP office there was complete chaos.</p>
<p>Several BJP leaders, including Harmohan Dhawan, were conspicuous by their absence. Party workers jostled with each other to be able to get close to her. Such was the situation at the party office that it was difficult for her to even walk from one room to the other. She was then taken to the conference room and the door locked.</p>
<p>Three local leaders, who had resigned from their posts after her candidature was announced, withdrew the same and agreed to support Kher. District president Bhajan Singh Maru said although they wanted the ticket for a local leader, after seeing the manner in which protests were held they decided to extend support to Kher. He said while black flags could have been shown, pelting of stones was uncalled for.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, protests continued both inside and outside the party office. Protesters carrying black flags shouted slogans asking Kher to return. When her husband Anupam Kher went out of the party office, eggs were thrown at his car.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012715&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">While the BJP is set to declare another list of Lok Sabha candidates from Uttar Pradesh, the party’s state headquarters has become a hotbed of dharnas and protests. </span></p>
<p>A Supreme Court lawyer, Ajay Agrawal, began an indefinite dharna along with over 500 supporters in Lucknow, alleging that the party is considering fielding a weak candidate against Congress president Sonia Gandhi from Rae Bareli, a seat for which he has been preparing since the past six months.</p>
<p>Agarwal claims he had been a petitioner in the Bofors pay-off case and presented numerous evidence against Sonia before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>He reached the party headquarters Tuesday afternoon with supporters in nearly 50 SUVs with banners demanding a ticket for him from Rae Bareli.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over a hundred BJP workers from Siddharth Nagar staged a dharna at the party office in Lucknow against former Congress MP Jagda-mbika Pal, who is trying for entry into BJP and seeking Dumariyaganj ticket.</p>
<p>The workers torched Pal’s effigy outside the office and raised slogans against him. “We want that the party should give ticket to any person from the party cadre other than Jagdambika Pal. We have been fighting against the Congress and Pal in Dumariyaganj for the past several years and if he is fielded from the BJP we cannot ask people to vote for him,” said Ajay Pandey, party’s district president of Siddharth Nagar, who led the protest.</p>
<p>Pandey also said two other local leaders, Pratap Singh and Prem Prakash, are camping in Delhi, seeking a ticket from Dumariyaganj. Jai Pratap had contested against Pal in the 2009 elections as BJP’s candidate.</p>
<p>There were reports of similar protests from Allahabad, where a group of BJP workers demanded a ticket for former minister Nand Gopal Gupta ‘Nandi’, who was expelled from BSP along with his mayor wife Abhilasha a few days ago. Allahabad district president Shashi Varshneya confirmed that some workers staged a demonstration demanding a ticket for Nandi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012713&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aap6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012708" alt="Soni Sori on campaign and (above, inset) Deepak Karma" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aap6.jpg" /></a> Soni Sori on campaign and (above, inset) Deepak Karma
<p>In one of the most intriguing battles this election, the son of Salwa Judum architect Mahendra Karma, since killed by Maoists, faces a woman who opposed the vigilante force, had Maoist cases slapped against her and became the symbol of police atrocities against tribals.</p>
<p>Deepak Karma and Soni Sori, candidates respectively of the Congress and the AAP, are contesting from Bastar. Both are first-timers and in their mid-30s, both hail from Dantewada, and both are vocal activists for Gond tribals though they represent two opposite strands of the Dandakaranya concept.</p>
<p>Deepak lost several of his relatives to Maoist attacks, while Sori saw her relatives jailed for years on Maoist-related charges that many find frivolous. Her husband died days after his acquittal, allegedly of injuries he sustained in jail. She favours a dialogue with Maoists; Deepak doesn’t believe it will work.</p>
<p>“The tribal is the killer, and he gets killed too. We need to rehabilitate all displaced persons to their villages,” Deepak says, underlining the mistake his father committed by evacuating tribals from interior areas during the Salwa Judum years.</p>
<p>Sori, called a “prisoner of conscience” by Amnesty International, got bail from the Supreme Court last month and the AAP soon gave her a ticket, amid protests by a section in Chhattisgarh because of the pending cases.</p>
<p>“I will follow Gandhiji’s ideals and transform Bastar. People are given guns instead of education; women face atrocities. We tribals are the victims of both Naxals and police. We will have to fight our own battle,” she told a rally in Bastar. The AAP has no presence in Bastar, and the party is banking solely on her appeal. A tribal teacher of a remote village in Dantewada has suddenly become a prominent face as the party membership in Bastar zone has crossed 15,000.</p>
<p>The party seeks votes by generating sympathy for her. It has issued an advertisement in newspapers that says: “I, Soni Sori, am a poor, helpless and powerless daughter of Bastar who received support from the entire world but got only intolerable pain, extreme insults and inhuman torture in my own home Bastar&#8230; I want to live — but am unable to live. What is my fault? Hoping to meet you.”</p>
<p>Overseeing her campaign is Delhi-based businessman Anil Singh. A Jagdalpur hotel is his temporary residence and the party headquarters in Bastar. The party is making arrangements to shift Sori too to Jagdalpur.</p>
<p>The AAP defends its decision. “She was victimised, and she is one of 3,000 tribals jailed without charges and trial. The basic charge against her is that Naxals visited her school, but they visit many schools and meet many villagers. We opted for this Bastar ki beti,” says Sanket Thakur, Chhattisgarh convener of AAP.</p>
<p>Of the seven cases she faced, six were slapped within 30 days in July-August 2010 and the seventh in 2011, this one involving an Essar-Maoist payoff. She has been acquitted in five, a sixth is under trial and the Essar case is yet to see charges framed.</p>
<p>Her opponent and his father had led a ragtag gang of tribals against Maoists. During the assembly elections, Deepak said it had been a mistake by his father to have taken the help of the Raman Singh government and police during Salwa Judum as it gave the tribal uprising a government-sponsored face.</p>
<p>“People talk of dialogue. Naxals have issued a farmaan against my family that if we try to campaign we will be kidnapped or killed. The administration has prevented me from visiting interior areas. But my people want me. I will go where no one goes. Let them kill me,” says Deepak. He, his MLA mother Devati and three brothers have Z-Plus security.</p>
<p>The seat has for two decades been with the BJP , which has fielded Dinesh Kashyap. The last non-BJP winner was Mahendra Karma in the 1990s, then an independent.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012702&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Unable to come up with a national policy on encounters, the Centre will hold consultations with state governments next week on the contentious issue of guidelines to be followed in instances of exchange of fire between police and terrorists/other criminals. The mha had earlier objected to Narendra Modi-led Gujarat government’s demand for a national policy on encounter cases arguing that law and order being a state subject, the Centre cannot frame a unilateral policy on the matter.</span></p>
<p>The two-day meeting convened by Union Home Secretary Anil Goswami is likely to be attended by the chief secretaries from the states and DGPs, said officials. In 2012, the Gujarat government facing flak for a large number of encounter deaths during Modi’s regime moved the apex court demanding a national policy. More than two dozen police officials in Gujarat are facing CBI probe in alleged fake encounter cases of Ishrat Jahan, Sohrabuddin Sheikh and Sadiq Jamal.</p>
<p>The MHA is likely to suggest states to come up with their own guidelines which can be the template for a national policy for the police force across the country later.</p>
<p>However, they cautioned that each situation will demand a different response and it will be difficult for any police force to follow a standard operating procedure (SoP) in a situation which warrants a gunfight. The police response will vary, depending on if terrorists, Maoist or criminals are facing them, said officials</p>
<p>A senior Home Ministry official said it will be difficult to implement such a policy in troubled areas of North East and Jammu &amp; Kashmir but may lead to controversy because of the AFSPA. The Home Secretary will also take stock of security arrangements for the Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>The Gujarat government had demanded a national policy arguing that it would serve to stop extra-judicial killings under the garb of fake encounters and at the same time ensure that police officers discharging their duties honestly against terrorist organisations/organised criminals are not demoralised by motivated allegations. The Gujarat police had taken the stand that the policemen from the state were being punished while police officers in other states were feted for gunning down terrorists.</p>
<p>Highlighting zero tolerance to terrorism, the Gujarat government claimed it is a vigilant state. Gujarat police said it is tough for policemen armed with service revolvers to protect citizens from terrorists carrying AK-56, and be accused of engineering fake encounters.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012692&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Central government has given the CRPF the task of constructing roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna in Chhattisgarh, where absence of proper roads has been hurting anti-Naxal operations. The paramilitary force will set up Engineering Battalions, combining road construction and security, and has recruited 34 engineers. They will start with Bijapur district where eight roads in </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Bhairamgarh have been allotted to CRPF. </span></p>
<p>State PWD proved inefficient for the task and contractors did not turn up fearing Maoist threats. The road construction, CRPF believes, could be a gamechanger in areas affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE).</p>
<p>“We have been nominated under PMGSY for constructing roads in Bastar. At first, some roads in Bijapur have been allotted . We have recruited engineers,” HS Siddhu, CRPF IG, Chhattisgarh, said. “Not many contractors come forward when tenders are floated. Our engineers will supervise construction. Roads will be built under our close watch,” said CRPF DG Dilip Trivedi.</p>
<p>The CRPF has been deliberating on setting up its Engineering Battalions. Full-fledged battalions would take some time, Siddhu said, adding the present project would pave the way. “Once we develop ro-ad building capacity, it would be a gamechanger in anti-Naxal operations,” he said.</p>
<p>“We will focus on villages along roads and develop basic facilities like sanitation, irrigation and schools so that villagers have a stake in road construction. The funds of our Civic Action plan will go for developing neighbouring areas. We expect resistance from Naxals but if villagers are roped in and they see improvement in their lives it will be hard for Naxals to damage roads,” Siddhu said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012691&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first official report to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on the Sukma encounter last week which killed 15 security personnel, the CRPF has denied receiving any specific intelligence inputs from Chhattisgarh police about an impending attack.</p>
<p>The report submitted to MHA mentioned, “There was no specific alert about an attack by Maoists either on a road opening party (ROP) or a road construction team on March 11.” Three intelligence inputs provided earlier were acted upon, the report said.</p>
<p>This brought to fore the rift between the state police and the central police force on anti-Maoist operations in the state.</p>
<p>A senior officer said six Maoists were killed in the encounter and it was being verified. Chhattisgarh Police had earlier said they had given specific alerts to CRPF about a Maoist build-up in the area and they were planning an attack.</p>
<p>The security team comprising 48 personnel including six from Chhattisgarh police was attacked near Tongpal in Sukma district when the team was on its way to provide security to a road construction team.</p>
<p>“Some local newspapers reported that at least six Maoists were killed in the encounter and they have named them. We are verifying these reports and trying to ascertain the identity of persons named,” said Dilip Trivedi, DG, CRPF.</p>
<p>An official said Maoists could have taken positions a night before the attack. “It is possible that they started trickling into the area two-three days before the encounter and had taken positions a night before as they had carved out enclosures in the nearby fields. It was all done in a planned way and there were around 300 of them who had taken positions in three different directions,” said a senior officer.</p>
<p>The CRPF had earlier given a power-point presentation to Union Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, Home Secretary Anil Goswami, Director Intelligence Bureau Asif Ibrahim and DGP Chhattisgarh where they said there were three inputs on March 5th, 6th and 9th that Maoists had assembled at Badegadam, Moranga and Elignar villages, located 10-15 kilometres away from the site of encounter. But searches yielded no results, the CRPF had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012686&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(IE Photo: Faiyaz Shaikh &amp; Sandeep Daundkar)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Radhabai, a 30-year-old daily wager from Ekdara village of Beed district, was plucking cotton on March 8 when the overcast sky opened up. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/baramati-sees-polls-as-silver-lining/">Heavy rain</a> with tennis ball-sized <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/the-whole-village-looked-war-ravaged/">hailstones </a>forced her to take shelter under a tree. “Heavy wind dislodged a branch of the tree that fell on her head. She died on the spot and was lying there for hours. We got to know only when someone informed us,” said her husband, Bhagwant Gawade. Ten days since her death, Radhabai’s children Ashwini, 13, and Rama, 17, are trying to cope with the tragedy. “That day, we had asked her not to go to the fields. But she said it will help her earn an extra 100 rupees,” they said.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/severe-aberration-imd/">Heavy rains</a> and <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/amidst-his-ruined-crop-he-drank-pesticide/">hailstorm</a> have been lashing Beed over the last fortnight. Farmers across 943 villages are experiencing one of their worst economic losses. Six deaths have been reported so far. Primary survey by the agriculture department revealed that crops spread over 55,000 hectares in Beed have been destroyed.</p>
<p>District Collector Navalkishore Ram said that all standing crops of jowar, wheat, onion, cotton, etc have been destroyed, and it was perhaps the first time in 30 years that Beed had seen a hailstorm of such magnitude. “Parli, Majalgaon, Gevrai, Dharur, Vadwan, Shirur Kasar and Ambejogai talukas have the worst hit blocks. Hailstorms are being reported almost every day,” he said, adding that preliminary loss is estimated to be around Rs 50-60 crore. “Out of the 55,000 hectares, 4,500 hectares had orchards of lemon and mango and that loss is huge,” Ram said.</p>
<p>Majority of the farmers here had not opted for any crop insurance policy. Standing near what was once his golden yellow field of wheat, Parashuram Rathod, a resident of Talkhed village in Majalgaon taluka, said, “Last two years we faced drought and this year hailstorm has destroyed our standing crop. I had managed to harvest wheat, but there was no time to take it to the granary. How will I repay my loan of Rs 4 lakh?”</p>
<p>“My son wants to join B Pharma course. I had taken a loan of Rs 8 lakh. With my crops damaged, how will I pay his fees?” said Pandit Chavan of Govindwadi in Majalgaon taluka.</p>
<p>The roof of Sunita Chavan’s house was blown away. “Neighbours took my children to a nearby temple, while my mother-in-law and I took shelter under a cot. The hailstorm lasted for two hours. My house was filled with hailstones and a portion of the cowshed had collapsed,” she said.</p>
<p>The families of those who died were given immediate compensation by the district collector, but so far no relief has been announced for the injured.</p>
<p>Bhaskar Khande of Shahpur said that it took five days for the talathi to visit the village and prepare a panchnama. “The talathi did not visit the fields, he sat at one place and completed the panchnama,” he complained.</p>
<p>Political leaders — including Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar and BJP vice-president and sitting MP Gopinath Munde — have also visited the district. However, due to the model code of conduct prior to the polls, none of these leaders made a mention of compensation. The impending polls have led to a delay in the disaster management efforts of the district collectorate, as the same officials are also responsible for election preparations.</p>
<p>Beed will go to polls on April 7. “If we are not given compensation, we will not vote this year,” said some villagers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012658&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/baramatim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013038 " alt="Sunil Sitaram Kate’s banana farm in Katewadi village was washed away in the hailstorm and the heavy rains.

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It may be better known as the turf of Union minister Sharad Pawar, but farmers of Baramati have had an equally long association with natural calamities. On March 12, as officials were compiling the damage in 76 villages of Baramati taluka due to the hailstorm, the tehsildar was putting together the final balance sheet on compensation distributed to farmers hit by a drought here in 2011-12. If there is any silver lining to the current calamity, it is that the coming elections may spur the relief.</span></p>
<p>Sunil Sitaram Kate’s banana farm in Katewadi village was washed away in the hailstorm and the heavy rains that followed. The process of inspecting calamity-affected areas has never been so fast, Kate says. “We are hoping for announcements before the polls.”</p>
<p>The inter-ministerial committee that inspected the hailstorm-hit areas admits surprise at the promptness of relief operations. “This is the first time I have seen panchnamas being completed so fast,” says Nilesh Gaikwad, a member of the panel. In Baramati, 70 per cent of the panchnamas — the first stage of arriving at a compensation — were completed in just four days.</p>
<p>According to official figures available with the Baramati taluka tehsil, hailstorm destroyed 6,137 hectares of cropped area in 76 villages. The estimated loss to crops is Rs 58.87 crore, while property worth Rs 9 lakh has been destroyed and 222 livestock killed. Real damage could be to the tune of Rs 200 crore plus, say experts. The grape farmers are the worst affected.</p>
<p>Papaya, sugarcane, pomegranates, capsicum and watermelon farms have also been hit. “Grapes are harvested in three lots. While two lots were harvested, the third lot, which yields eight-nine tonnes of grapes per acre, was to be harvested in three-four days. At the current market rate of Rs 60-65 a kg, a farmer with one acre of grape crop would have earned Rs 4.5-5 lakh. Farmers are trying to sell the grapes to wineries, which are buying these at Rs 12-14 a kg,” says Chandrakant Kate, head of the Bazaar Samitee.</p>
<p>In one of the worst-affected villages, Bori, Chandrakant Patil had invested about Rs 1.5 lakh in his grape garden, partly through loan. His biggest worry is repaying the same. “A grape crop requires Rs 5 lakh of investment per acre in the first year. This involves erecting structures, laying pipelines for irrigation, labour, insecticides and fertilisers. It will take at least four seasons for me to recover,” Patil says.</p>
<p>Bori had been praised by Pawar for its rainwater harvesting system, and is the maximum contributor of export quality grapes from the belt. Almost 800 acres of land here is under grape cultivation, with 600-700 workers employed in the fields.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012666&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Santosh Bhaurao Patil, 36, of Kapadne in Dhule district stayed in a rented accommodation and had a relatively small loan liability of Rs 55,000 and pending power bills of Rs 58,800. On March 12, he walked up to his five-acre farm and, standing amidst his ruined crop of fenugreek and coriander, drank pesticide.</span></p>
<p>“During the past few days, all that he would talk about is the destroyed farm and whether we would be able to repay our loans. I did not know he would take such a drastic step. How will I bring up my children?” says his wife Kavita, as one of her children tries to console her. She has two other children, one of them two and a half years old, as well as aged in-laws, who are now her responsibility.</p>
<p>Anantrao Jagtap, a science graduate, is staring at a loss of Rs 40 lakh, with his entire grape crop on 5 acres destroyed. Located in Niphad, known as India’s Napa Valley for its grape plantations, Jagtap’s farm in Mhalsakhore looks as if a twister has run through it. Broken bamboos and cables which held together the grape vines hang loose while grapes which could have fetched him Rs 70 a kg lie strewn on the ground.</p>
<p>“I have a loan of Rs 20 lakh on this land. I had taken a crop loan of Rs 12 lakh. It will take me two years to put the entire system in place. I do not know from where I will raise this money and repay my loans,” says Jagtap.</p>
<p>What accentuates the problems of farmers like Jagtap is the state’s compensation policy. Under the present plan, mid-level farmers who own less than 2 hectares are eligible for up to Rs 12,000 per hectare of destroyed crop. Jagtap says the state should give him some relief in the recovery of loans.</p>
<p>In Nashik and Dhule, 40,000 farmers have been given nearly Rs 490 crore as agricultural loans this year. Fifty per cent of them have been affected due to the storms. The state is looking at increasing compensation to up to Rs 30,000 per hectare, but no final decision has been taken yet.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012678&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The India Meteorological Department says the hailstorms that affected Maharashtra and many parts of the country are a “rare phenomenon” and a “severe aberration”. “We have not come across such activity for a long time now. We have to assess whether such phenomenon occurred in the past 100 years. We are studying the data,” said IMD Director General L S Rathore.</span></p>
<p>Unseasonal rains and hailstorms have destroyed crops in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh this year. Maharashtra is the worst hit.</p>
<p>“This time the westerlies came in the far south direction and were more intense, with waves covering central parts of the country. Along with this, we had moisture-laden winds, which triggered instability in the environment and thus hail formation,’’ said Rathore.</p>
<p>Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology Director Dr B N Goswami said that the severe winter in the US could be responsible. The cold northern hemisphere has brought in cold and dry winds, spurring thunderstorm activity.</p>
<p>Hail is caused when raindrops are lifted up into the atmosphere during a thunderstorm and super cooled by the adjoining temperature to turn them into thick balls of ice. The hail which falls with a high velocity destroys crops.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012676&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Around 600 houses and crops worth Rs 25 crore, spread over 9,000 of the 22,000 hectares, were destroyed.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012680&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">What Lonar experienced about 5.7 lakh years ago has no geological parallel. A huge meteor impact created a 1.88-km diameter crater, the world’s only in basalt rock with salty water, that is still preserved in a 10-metre thick column.</span></p>
<p>But what happened at Pahur village 10 km away, between 2.30 pm and 3.30 pm on March 8, has no parallel either. A furious hailstorm left every house damaged, crops flattened, animals and birds dead or missing, one person dead due to shock and at least six injured. Five days later, a 40-ft under-construction well in a farm outside the village was still full of hailstones when The Indian Express visited.</p>
<p>Damaged crops now lie across the fields, the smell of dead animals and fish in the village tank fills the air, while trees lie bare, electricity poles bent and irrigation pipes broken — all a testimony to the devastating impact of that afternoon’s storm.</p>
<p>Pahur, located around 300 km from Nagpur, has 260 houses and 1,200 people. It was just one of the 57 villages of the 91 in the tehsil to be hit by what locals unanimously describe as a never-before “gaarpeet (gaar means hail, peet means assault)”.</p>
<p>Around 600 houses and crops worth Rs 25 crore, spread over 9,000 of the 22,000 hectares, were destroyed.</p>
<p>“The loss is 100 per cent,” says a villager, seeking, apart from relief, waiving off of outstanding farm loans.</p>
<p>“We had no place to hide as hailstones as big as guavas started hitting us after winds blew tin roofs away. Tins which withstood the winds turned into sieves from which water poured in, filling our houses with knee-deep water. When the storm stopped after one hour, the whole village looked war-ravaged,” says sarpanch Gulabrao Poghe.</p>
<p>A day later, Poghe says, 60-year-old Rangnath Munde died of a heart attack on seeing his entire crop damaged.</p>
<p>Nandabai Nagre lost her husband Shivaji two months ago due to heart attack. Their 16-year-old son helped till their two-acre land, and they were looking forward to a good harvest to tide over bad times. Now her only hope is government relief.</p>
<p>Earlier, excessive rains had damaged kharif crops. “Now we have to face severe fodder crunch too,” villagers say. With heavy rains following in the wake of the hailstorm, villagers haven’t had time to repair their homes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012680&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/china2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012805" alt="The Army had, through the report, aimed to draw lessons from the defeat and pinpoint accountability. Reuters" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/china2.jpg" /></a> The Army had, through the report, aimed to draw lessons from the defeat and pinpoint accountability. Reuters
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Militarily unsound plans, poor Army leadership and a baffling belief that there would be no armed response from Beijing led to the faulty implementation of the ‘forward policy’ of Jawaharlal Nehru’s government that resulted in a humiliating defeat to China in the 1962 war, say sections of the classified Henderson Brooks report that have become public.</span></p>
<p>The report was commissioned by the Army more than half a century ago and were made public Monday by Australian journalist Neville Maxwell. The Army had, through the report, aimed to draw lessons from the defeat and pinpoint accountability.</p>
<p>But it has remained classified and its publication drew little reaction from the defence ministry. The MoD Tuesday said the report remains top secret “given the extremely sensitive nature of the contents&#8230;which are of current operational value”.</p>
<p>Parts of the report, published on Maxwell’s web site briefly before being taken down, goes into details of the war and the implementation of the forward policy but is silent on the political leadership’s role and functioning as the same was not part of its terms of reference.</p>
<p>As first reported by <em>The Indian Express</em> in October 2012, no member of the political leadership including Nehru has been named in the report but it is highly critical of the Army leadership, including Lt Gen B M Kaul who was Chief of General Staff before the war and was appointed as the commander of <span style="line-height:1.5em;">the newly crated IV Corps that was routed in the Northeast. </span></p>
<p>The report, prepared by Lt Gen Henderson Brooks with the help of Brigadier Prem Bhagat, is also highly critical of the then Army Chief Gen P N Thapar.</p>
<p>The 126-page section published Monday says that while the forward policy was a politically sound one even though its introduction “certainly increased” the chances of conflict, the military action planned around it was flawed and hasty.</p>
<p>“It is obvious that politically the forward policy was desirable and presumably the eviction of the Chinese from Ladakh must always be the eventual aim. For this, there can be no argument but what is pertinent is whether we were militarily in a position at that time to implement the policy,” the report says.</p>
<p>Going into minute details of the actions before the start of the conflict as well as a blow-by-blow account of the actual hostilities, the report blames an unsound military plan as the main reason for the debacle in the war and has said that the government had advocated a “cautious policy” that was misinterpreted by Army HQ.</p>
<p>“The government who politically must have been keen to recover territory advocated a cautious policy whilst Army HQ dictated a policy that was clearly militarily unsound,” the report says, adding that the full import of the government’s instructions was not forwarded by Army HQ to its formations and commands.</p>
<p>Quoting the government’s directive that stated that forces should be concentrated along the borders behind the forward posts from where they can be used to restore a “border situation” at short notice, the report says that the Army HQ instructions were flawed and led to a situation in which troops in small numbers were isolated at poorly manned posts all along the border, making them an easy target for a strong concentrated force of the Chinese military.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that the implementation of the forward policy, in the manner it was done, was carried out deliberately by Army HQ without the necessary backing, as laid down by the government,” the report says.</p>
<p>The report has also been highly critical of the Chief of Army Staff for not giving the correct military assessment to the political leadership on the forward policy. It says that the internal military intelligence appreciation of the situation was that China would resist with force any plan by the Indian Army to take back territory but the same was not convincingly conveyed.</p>
<p>“A meeting was held in the PMO on 2 Nov 1961 and was attended among others by the defence minister, the foreign secretary, the chief of Army staff and the director Intelligence Bureau. It appears that the DIB was of the opinion that `the Chinese would not react to our establishing new posts and that they were not likely to use force against any of our posts even if they were in a position to do so,” the report says.</p>
<p>As reported by The Indian Express, the report has been more praiseworthy of the actions of the Western Command that was directing operations in the Ladakh sector and has said that Army HQ led by Gen Thapar refused to respond to a strong request for additional troops in the form of a new division to meet the Chinese threat.</p>
<p>It also says that the Western Command conducted a reappraisal on its preparedness for the forward policy and raised a pertinent question that India’s military means at that moment in time were not adequate to pursue the political decision. “It is imperative that political direction is based on military means.</p>
<p>If the two are not co related, there is a danger of creating a situation where we may lose both in the material and moral sense much more than we already have. Thus, there is no short cut to military preparedness to enable us to pursue effectively our present policy aimed at refuting the illegal Chinese claim over our territory” the Western Command had said but this was ignored by the Army HQ.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012637&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Poacher Sansar Chand, who was blamed for wiping out Sariska’s tiger population in 2005, died of prostate cancer in a Jaipur hospital Tuesday morning. In his late 50s, Sansar died hours before he was to appear in court in a poaching case.</p>
<p>Brought from Tihar Jail hospital to Alwar, he was to be produced in the court of the additional chief judicial magistrate on March 14 for a hearing related to poaching — he was to appear for another hearing Tuesday — but had to be moved to the Alwar district hospital.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Sansar was shifted to SMS Hospital in Jaipur. But his condition deteriorated and he died at 9.53 am Tuesday.</p>
<p>He had 10 “strong cases of poaching” against him and was named in at least 40 others. He was accused of killing over 200 tigers apart from several hundred other species. He was arrested by Delhi Police and later handed over to the CBI.</p>
<p>The first case against him was filed in 1974 at the age of 18. He is said to have entered the trade as early as 13 when he assisted his grandfather who used to deal in animal hides.</p>
<p>“Sansar Chand used to operate through conduits and couriers and would never involve himself directly. Despite being the kingpin, he could not be nailed because of his modus operandi.</p>
<p>He was involved in poaching from an early age but it was only after the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 came into effect that he was booked for the first time in 1974. But he went scot-free because he was considered a juvenile,” said Saurabh Sharma, who fought several cases against Sansar on behalf of the Wildlife Trust of India.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012631&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lucknow Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal&#8217;s Varanasi rally has been postponed by two days to March 25 after the district administration denied permission for it in view of the Legislative Council polls.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rally scheduled for March 23 has been cancelled due to the Legislative Council elections on the same day. It will now be held on March 25,&#8221; AAP&#8217;s national council member Vaibhav Maheshwari told PTI today.</p>
<p>Kejriwal had announced that he would take the decision on contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi against BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi after the proposed rally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Narendra Modi has announced that he will contest from Varanasi. So even I am going to Varanasi. We will ask people there on whether I should contest against Modi. If they say yes then I am ready to contest,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Additional District Magistrate (City) of Varanasi M P Singh said AAP members had sought permission for Kejriwal&#8217;s rally on March 23.</p>
<p>&#8220;The permission of the rally has been denied as their is election to the teachers&#8217; constituency of the Legislative Council on the same day,&#8221; Singh said</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012630&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/birla-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012632" alt="birla-med" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/birla-med.jpg" /></a> Mahender Singh alleged that Rakhi Birla had asked him for money in return for campaigning for him. (PTI)
<p>There was fresh controversy in the Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday, after two of its candidates returned their tickets, and a third was reported to have done the same.</p>
<p>Mahender Singh, the Delhi North West candidate, alleged that Rakhi Birla, former cabinet minister in the Delhi government had asked him for money in return for campaigning for him.</p>
<p>Khalid Parvaiz, the AAP candidate from Moradabad “gave up” his ticket after suggestions that he had defaulted on a bank loan. There were reports that Iqbal Mustafa from Faizabad too may have returned his ticket.</p>
<p>Mahender Singh said, “I am disappointed with the response that I have received from the local unit of the party. Further, when I asked Rakhi Birla to campaign for the party’s benefit in the area which is reserved for lower castes, she asked me for Rs 7 lakh, and said she was the party’s star campaigner. However I will continue to work within the party.”</p>
<p>AAP sources said Singh’s winnability was in doubt, and that Birla, who was the party’s Dalit face in the Delhi government, may now contest the seat. If that happens, it could be the trigger for another controversy because the AAP political affairs committee had last month said that no MLA would be given a Lok Sabha ticket.</p>
<p>Parvaiz, who faces allegations of default on loans, said, “The party knew of the entire bank issue, but after they got complaints, I decided to pull out to avoid a controversy. My image was being maligned.”</p>
<p>AAP spokesperson Nagender Sharma said, “They have both resigned because of personal reasons.”</p>
<p>But party sources maintained that they had received numerous complaints about both Singh and Parvaiz being “tainted”, and had therefore asked them to step aside. “We received information that we did not have earlier, that there were criminal complaints against Singh, and that Parvaiz had problems with the return of money,” a leader said.</p>
<p>AAP officials conceded that the return of the tickets indicated a larger problem with the manner in which nominees were chosen.</p>
<p>“Because of the paucity of time, things have at time been rushed. Therefore there are chances that there have been some miscalculations, and sometimes not everybody has been taken on board, However, the party is firm that if something wrong is found with candidates, we will withdraw their candidature,” a leader said.</p>
<p>The latest churn follows the withdrawal from the race of Savita Bhatti, wife of the late Jaspal Bhatti, in Chandigarh, claiming she was getting very little support from the party’s local unit. Actor Gul Panag is now the AAP candidate at the seat.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012620&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ravi-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1975367" alt="If the report holds Nehru responsible (for India's defeat) and rightly so. The nation still feels the pain of that humiliation, said Ravi Shankar Prasad." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ravi-m.jpg" /></a> If the report holds Nehru responsible (for India&#8217;s defeat) and rightly so. The nation still feels the pain of that humiliation, said Ravi Shankar Prasad.
<p>Fifty years after the Sino-Indian war, Congress on Tuesday battled it out with BJP over a report which is said to blame former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru&#8217;s &#8220;forward policy&#8221; for India&#8217;s defeat in the conflict amidst calls by the saffron outfit for the release of the top-secret document.</p>
<p>The two parties locked horns over the issue after an Australian journalist, who had covered the war in 1962, uploaded a portion of the Henderson Brooks report on his website.</p>
<p>&#8220;It (the report) holds Nehru responsible (for India&#8217;s defeat) and rightly so. The nation still feels the pain of that humiliation.</p>
<p>&#8220;BJP would like the entire report to be made public so that more than 50 years later, the nation finds out who did what wrong,&#8221; said BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad.</p>
<p>While BJP claimed that there was a similarity between the 1962 debacle and the manner in which the UPA government had handled defence matters, particularly in terms of preparedess, Congress said that the rival party was playing cheap politics ahead of Lok Sabha polls.</p>
<p>Prasad said that the time had come for a debate as to who had secured the country more —— Nehru or the first Union Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.</p>
<p>He said that through their acts, Nehru and the then Defence Minister Krishna Menon had left the Indian armed forces to fend for themselves in a state of &#8220;complete unpreparedness&#8221;.</p>
<p>Supporting Prasad&#8217;s demand for the report to be made public, party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman said that would have a bearing on the upcoming polls.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact remains that it will certainly tell a lot many things which are important for our institutional memory and (provide) lessons to be learnt,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The Henderson Brooks report is an analysis (operations review) of the 1962 war done by two officers of the Indian army —— Lt Gen Henderson Brooks and Brig PS Bhagat, who were with the Indian Military Academy at the time.</p>
<p>The report was commissioned by the army following its crushing defeat by the Chinese.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012615&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vk-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012618" alt="General Singh's name was discussed at the previous meeting of the party's Central Election Committee on March 15 when his candidature was finalised for the seat." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vk-med.jpg" /></a> General Singh&#8217;s name was discussed at the previous meeting of the party&#8217;s Central Election Committee on March 15 when his candidature was finalised for the seat.
<p>BJP on Tuesday named former Army Chief V K Singh as its Lok Sabha candidate from Ghaziabad, a seat represented by party chief Rajnath Singh earlier.</p>
<p>The party made a formal announcement in this regard and came out with a list carrying Singh&#8217;s name along with that of Shibun Lyngdoh who has been fielded from Shillong Lok Sabha constituency.</p>
<p>Singh replaces Rajnath, who has moved to Lucknow constituency, and will face Congress&#8217; actor-turned- politician Raj Bhabbar and AAP&#8217;s Shazia Ilmi.</p>
<p>However, a number of BJP workers from Ghaziabad came out to protest against his candidature outside the party headquarters even before his name was made official.</p>
<p>Party general secretary Ananth Kumar said the BJP chief approved the recommendations of Meghalaya and Uttar Pradesh state election committees on the candidates declared on Tuesday.</p>
<p>General Singh&#8217;s name was discussed at the previous meeting of the party&#8217;s Central Election Committee on March 15 when his candidature was finalised for the seat which has a sizeable number of Jat voters.</p>
<p>Singh, who recently joined the saffron outfit, accepted the party&#8217;s offer.</p>
<p>The BJP was actively considering the name of Muzaffarnagar riot-accused Sangeet Som&#8217;s name for the seat, but Gen Singh&#8217;s name finally found favour with the party leadership.</p>
<p>The former Army chief had faced the heat of a section of BJP workers during his visit to Ghaziabad on Monday.</p>
<p>Nearly half-an-hour after he reached the party&#8217;s ofice in Ghaziabad on Monday evening, some workers started raising slogans against him. There were heated arguments between supporters of the former Army chief and his &#8220;rivals&#8221;.</p>
<p>Asked about his candidature, General Singh had said, &#8220;I will contest elections from wherever the party would ask me to.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012616&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modikejriwal3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011016" alt="Kejriwal said his decision to enter the electoral fray from Varanasi was to defeat the BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modikejriwal3.jpg" /></a> Kejriwal said his decision to enter the electoral fray from Varanasi was to defeat the BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate.
<p>Firing a fresh salvo at <a title="Modi vs him: Arvind Kejriwal to wait for Varanasi’s voice" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/ready-to-contest-against-narendra-modi-arvind-kejriwal/" target="_blank">Narendra Modi</a>, AAP National Convener <a title="Arvind Kejriwal attacking Narendra Modi only to remain in news: BJP" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/kejriwal-attacking-modi-only-to-remain-in-news-bjp/" target="_blank">Arvind Kejriwal</a> on Tuesday said his decision to enter the electoral fray from Varanasi was not a &#8220;symbolic gesture&#8221; but to defeat the BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Narendra Modi has announced that he will contest from <a title="Arvind Kejriwal keeps up the suspense over contesting against Modi" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/arvind-kejriwal-keeps-up-the-suspense-on-contesting-against-modi/" target="_blank">Varanasi</a>. So even I am going to Varanasi. We will ask people there on whether I should contest against Modi. If they say yes then I am ready to contest&#8221;, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I read in newspapers and websites and that this is a symbolic fight. I must tell you that we are going there not to contest elections, but to defeat Modi,&#8221; <a title="Media sold out to Modi, will jail them if we form govt, warns Kejriwal" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/media-sold-out-to-modi-will-jail-them-if-we-form-govt-warns-kejriwal/" target="_blank">Kejriwal</a> said.</p>
<p>He was speaking at a conference &#8220;Roadmap to Indian Muslims&#8221;, which was attended by AAP leaders like Prashant Bhushan and Gopal Rai. Kejriwal invited the crowd, mostly AAP supporters from the minority community, to join him in Varanasi.</p>
<p>As he announced that he was going to defeat Modi, the crowd roared, &#8220;Abhi to Sheila hari hain, Modi teri bari hain (Sheila has been defeated. Now it is Modi&#8217;s time)</p>
<p>He said that all parties indulged in corrupt practises and communal politics and this was led by the BJP and the Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;All parties are the same. They indulge in corruption and communal politics, but leaders of all these parties are Congress and the BJP. It is important to defeat these parties&#8230;not on the basis of numbers, but by defeating their leaders. It is important to defeat Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have sent Kumar Vishwas to Amethi and he has been stationed there for the past three months. He is being attacked on daily basis, but he is too strong to back out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kejriwal added that if the BJP claims that voting for Modi would bring stability, then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has given more stability.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I had been to Bangalore, people told me that I will eat into (BJP) votes. If Modi comes to power he will give stability. Then I said if you want stability then Dr Manmohan Singh has given maximum stability in last 10 years.   People  dont want stability, they want security and justice. Stability will come even if there are elections in a year or two. But these parties will spread corruption and communalism in the name of stability and this is unacceptable to us,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012595&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi-m1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007854" alt="The petition filed demands to make Narendra Modi and 59 others accused on the charges of criminal conspiracy behind the riots." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modi-m1.jpg" /></a> The petition filed demands to make Narendra Modi and 59 others accused on the charges of criminal conspiracy behind the riots.
<p>Zakia Jafri, widow of former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri, today approached the Gujarat High Court challenging the Ahmedabad metropolitan court order upholding SIT&#8217;s clean chit to Gujarat Chief minister Narendra Modi and others in connection with the 2002 riots case.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have challenged the metropolitan court&#8217;s order which validates clean chit to Chief Minister Narendra Modi,&#8221; social activist Teesta Setalwad said here.</p>
<p>The petition filed before the High Court demands to make Narendra Modi and 59 others accused on the charges of criminal conspiracy behind the riots.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Metropolitan Judge has simply accepted the contentions in the closure report of SIT without considering substantive arguments of the applicant (Zakia),&#8221; the petition reads.</p>
<p>On December 26 last year, metropolitan magistrate B J Ganatra had rejected Zakia Jafri&#8217;s protest petition challenging the SIT clean chit to Modi.</p>
<p>On February 8, 2012, the Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT) had filed a closure report and given a clean chit to Modi and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;SIT has not conducted free and fair investigation against the accused no. 1 (Modi),&#8221; the petitioner alleged.</p>
<p>The High Court is likely to conduct the hearing on Zakia&#8217;s petition on March 20.</p>
<p>On 28 February, 2002, following the Godhra train carnage, 68 people, including former MP Ehsan Jafri, were killed by a mob at Gulbarg Society here during the riots.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012554&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Taj Hotels, Resorts &amp; Palaces on Tuesday said it has completed a USD 10-million expansion at its Sri Lankan property, the Gateway Hotel Airport Garden Colombo.</p>
<p>Operational for the past three decades, the Colombo hotel is jointly owned by Mukesh Advani and Prakash Advani, and the Hirdaramani family with 50 per cent stake each.</p>
<p>Since the inception, the hotel is managed and operated by the Taj Group, which also operates two other properties in Sri Lanka at Colombo and Bentota under the Taj and Vivanta brands respectively.</p>
<p>With this, Gateway Hotel has doubled its capacity to 200 rooms to meet the growing demand and has refurbished the lobby.</p>
<p>&#8220;The theme of the new block, consisting of 98 executive rooms and two suites, has been conceptualised to include a modern flavour of Sri Lanka and caters to all segments of MICE, leisure, corporate and transit travellers,&#8221; the company said in a statement. It put in USD 10 million in the expansion project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the hotel&#8217;s proximity to the airport and the steady growth of Sri Lankan tourism, we feel it is an opportune time to expand our inventory.&#8221; Taj Group area director Sri Lanka Rohit Khosla said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012535&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vowing to give Narendra Modi a tough fight in Varanasi, Congress on Tuesday said it will put up a formidable candidate against the BJP PM nominee and urged all like minded parties to support it in the &#8220;battle against communalism&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be surprised if Varanasi witnesses a similar spectacle as Ghaziabad from where BJP chief Rajnath Singh ran away after Congress fielded Raj Babbar,&#8221; party spokesman Randeep Surjewala said.</p>
<p>Expressing Congress&#8217; resolve to give a good fight to Modi, Surjewala said that the party is putting up its candidate with the belief that he will be winning the contest against the BJP PM candidate.</p>
<p>Surjewala replied in the affirmative when asked whether the Congress will appeal to all like minded parties to support its candidate in Varanasi against Modi.</p>
<p>He said that Congress candidate, whose announcement will be made &#8220;very soon&#8221;, needed to be supported by all like minded parties as it alone could carry forward the battle against communalism and divisive forces in a cohesive direction.</p>
<p>He faced several questions on the possible candidate for the high-profile contest, but declined to hazard any guess.</p>
<p>He claimed that the fact that Modi has started searching for a second seat in Gujarat a day after his candidature was declared from Varanasi showed that he has become &#8220;jittery and has developed cold feet&#8221;.</p>
<p>The remarks of Surjewala came two days after party General Secretary Madhusudan Mistry had declared that the Congress will give a &#8220;good fight&#8221; to Modi on Varanasi seat and did not rule out fielding an &#8216;outsider&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be giving a good fight but we are not decided whether the candidate against Modi will be a local or an outsider,&#8221; Mistry, a known detractor of the Gujarat Chief Minister, had said.</p>
<p>Among the local candidates, the names of Rajesh Mishra and Ajay Rai are doing the rounds. A section in the Congress wants an influential leader pitched against Modi, while others want a celebrity to be fielded against him.</p>
<p>Surjewala said that senior party leader Anil Shastri&#8217;s suggestion needed be seen from a wider angle of fighting communal forces.</p>
<p>Shastri in a tweet had said &#8220;If BSP &amp; SP are serious on defeating Modi from Varanasi, they alongwith Congress should put up a joint candidate against him&#8221;.</p>
<p>AP leader Arvind Kejriwal has also declared that he was ready to take on Modi in Varanasi but linked his final call to the people&#8217;s approval there.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012521&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI Photo)
<p>A special NIA court on Tuesday issued production warrants against Indian Mujahideen (IM) co-founder <a title="Bhatkal’s confession reveals Pune link to IM terror acts" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/bhatkals-confession-reveals-pune-link-to-im-terror-acts/" target="_blank">Yasin Bhatkal</a> and two others seeking their presence before it on April 2 in connection with a case of alleged conspiracy to carry out terror acts in India.</p>
<p>During an in-chamber hearing, District Judge I S Mehta issued the production warrants after <a title="IM had plans to target Delhi’s Akshardham temple: NIA in Bhatkal’s chargesheet" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/im-had-plans-to-target-delhis-akshardham-temple-nia-in-bhatkals-chargesheet/" target="_blank">Bhatkal</a>, his close aide Asadullah Akhtar and suspected IM operative Obaid-Ur-Rehman, chargesheeted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for their alleged roles in the case, were not produced before the court today, sources said.</p>
<p>They also said that <a title="13/7 blasts: Yasin Bhatkal planned to blow up police van in Dadar" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/137-blasts-yasin-bhatkal-planned-to-blow-up-police-van-in-dadar/" target="_blank">Bhatkal</a> and Akhtar are presently in Mumbai under custody of Maharashtra ATS while Obaid-Ur-Rehman was in Bangalore in connection with the cases lodged against them there.</p>
<p>The court has now fixed the matter for April 2 for further proceedings and asked NIA to supply the copies of charge sheet and other documents filed along with it to the counsel appearing for the accused.</p>
<p>The sources said the counsel appearing for the accused told the court that scrutiny of documents filed along with the 277-page supplementary charge sheet of NIA is going on.</p>
<p>The court had on February 24 taken cognisance of NIA&#8217;s charge sheet in which Bhatkal, Akhtar, Manzer Imam and Ujjair Ahmed were named as accused for allegedly waging war against the country, conspiring for terrorist acts, membership of a terror organisation and radicalisation and recruitment of youths for IM.</p>
<p>They have been chargesheeted under various sections of IPC, including 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging war against the country), 121-A (conspiracy to wage war) and under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.</p>
<p>Bhatkal and Akhtar were among the 12 top IM members listed as absconders in the 42-page charge sheet filed earlier against arrested accused Mohammad Danish Ansari, Mohammad Aftab Alam, Imran Khan, Syed Maqbool and Obaid-Ur-Rehman under various penal provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and IPC for conspiracy to commit offences against India.</p>
<p>In its charge sheet, NIA had said that Imam and Ahmed were arrested by it on October 1 and October 30, 2013 respectively on the basis of investigation done after the arrest of Bhatkal and Akhtar from Indo-Nepal border on the night of August 28, last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is worth mentioning that Yasin Bhatkal was one of the most important members of IM who was involved in planning and execution of large number of blast cases in which more than 150 people were killed,&#8221; NIA had said.</p>
<p>NIA had alleged that Bhatkal has very strong &#8220;jihadi mindset&#8221; and he was involved in identifying, motivating, recruiting and training several youths in causing bomb blasts in the name of &#8216;jihad&#8217;.</p>
<p>Regarding Akhtar, NIA had said he was closely associated with Bhatkal for the past six years in all terror attacks.</p>
<p>On Imam and Ahmed, NIA said they hailed from Ranchi in Jharkhand and have been named in the charge sheet for their role in the conspiracy to commit terrorist acts by the IM and also for raising funds for the terror organisation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012509&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are no fence-sitters any more. Almost every man, woman and child in the country is pulling for one of NaMo, RaGa or ArKe. And all of them will probably say that they support their chosen leader because he is completely different from everyone else out there.</p>
<p>We’re sure that these men are very different, but their quotes don’t always bear this out. Here are statements made by Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal in the past few months on various burning issues that seem almost identical.</p>
<p>On women empowerment, all of them say the word ‘women empowerment’ many times</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/quote1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012506" alt="Quote1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/quote1.jpg?w=470&#038;h=600" width="470" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>On youth, all of them agree that the youth are good &#8211; possibly because they can be more easily swayed?</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/quote2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012516" alt="Quote2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/quote2.jpg?w=470&#038;h=600" width="470" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>On corruption, they have said everything possible, except for the magic words ‘My party has no corrupt members’</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/quote3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012518" alt="quote3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/quote3.jpg?w=470&#038;h=600" width="470" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Here are some made-up quotes. The first being a circular play on words from Rahul Gandhi’s ill fated slogan</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/quote5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012599" alt="quote5" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/quote5.jpg?w=470&#038;h=414" width="470" height="414" /></a></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012504&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2004917" alt="Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and UP CM Akhilesh Yadav during closing ceremony of the party's &quot;Desh Banao Desh Bachao&quot; cycle rally. (PTI Photo) " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mulayam1.jpg" /> Samajwadi Party supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav and UP CM Akhilesh Yadav during closing ceremony of the party&#8217;s &#8220;Desh Banao Desh Bachao&#8221; cycle rally. (PTI Photo)
<p>Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav will contest Lok Sabha polls from Azamgarh parliamentary seat along with his traditional Mainpuri seat. SP&#8217;s national general secretary Ramgopal Yadav announced that the decision to field Mulayam from Azamgarh has been taken on the demand of party workers and leaders from various districts of Poorvanchal.</p>
<p>Politically, Mulayam&#8217;s decision to contest from Azamgarh is seen as a move to counter the Narendra Modi&#8217;s effect in eastern region of the state after BJP announced latter&#8217;s candidature from Varanasi. Several other SP candidates in adjoining seats are also likely to be changed by the party.</p>
<p>But Mulayam&#8217;s decision to contest from Azamgarh was brewing for past one month in party, much before Modi&#8217;s candidature was announced. The decision is more for preparing ground for another entrant from Yadav family. It is expected that Mulayam after winning from Azamgarh and Mainpuri will relinquish Mainpuri where his grandson Tej Pratap Singh alias Teju Bhaiyya may contest in the bye-polls. Mainpuri is regarded as a safe seat for SP. The developments are on similar lines when in 1999 Mulayam contested from Sambhal and Kannauj, won both, relinquished Kannauj for his son Akhilesh Yadav. Presently Tej Pratap is Mulayam&#8217;s representative in Mainpuri and campaigning on his behalf in the constituency. Mulayam&#8217;s son Prateek Yadav is also a contender for Mainpuri seat.</p>
<p>With Azamgarh, it will be the first time that Yadav clan will be venturing in eastern region of the state for contesting election. Earlier, Panchayti Raj minister Balram Yadav was announced as candidate from Azamgarh but due to his severe opposition from workers, he declined to contest and the ticket was given to Hawaldar Yadav, the district unit president of SP. Mulayam&#8217;s candidature will also provide a face saving opportunity for senior minister Balram Yadav. It will also curb the severe infighting in the district among SP workers against Balram. Earlier Balram Yadav had tried to push the name of Prateek Yadav, the son of Mulayam and even dharnas were held outside SP office by people claiming to be belonging from Azamgarh. None of his trick succeeded.</p>
<p>Azamgarh holds special position for SP and party prefers to start its election campaign from the district. In 2012 assembly election SP had announced its first election meeting on January 1 though Mulayam could not attend it due to heavy rains. This time also Mulayam began his rallies from 29 October 2012 in Azamgarh. Presently SP holds nine out of ten assembly seats in Azamgarh district however Azamgarh parliamentary seats comprises assembly segments of Gopalpur, Sagdi, Mehnagar and Azamgarh all won by SP in 2012 assembly elections leaving only Mubarqpur which is represented by BSP&#8217;s Shah Alam alias Guddu Jamali who is also BSP candidate for parliament. SP had won Azamgarh in 1999 when Ramakant Yadav defeated Akbar Ahmed Dumpy. Presently, Ramakant is sitting BJP MP from Azamgarh and has been again fielded by BJP. SP sources claimed that Ramakant Yadav may withdraw and can be shifted to Jaunpur as SP candidate.</p>
<p>Mulayam is a five term MP and has been member of UP assembly eight times besides being CM of the state thrice. Presently, he is being projected as prime ministerial candidate by SP through the third front.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012490&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/singhvi-medium.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012495" alt="singhvi-medium" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/singhvi-medium.jpg" /></a> Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi. (Photo: PTI)
<p>Hitting out at BJP, Congress on Tuesday accused it of playing &#8220;cheap politics&#8221; ahead of Lok Sabha polls on the issue of 1962 India-China war in the wake of a classified report on it being made public, saying it only showed the principal opposition party&#8217;s mindset.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that such cheap allegations deserve a response,&#8221; Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said in sharp reaction to a query about BJP questioning the government&#8217;s reluctance, even after so many years, to declassify the report which reportedly blamed the Nehru Government.</p>
<p>Large parts of the still classified Henderson Brooks Report on India&#8217;s debacle has been made public online by Australian journalist Neville Maxwell, who had reported the war. Latching on to this, BJP has demanded that the entire report be made public and &#8220;Nehru has to account a lot for&#8221;.</p>
<p>Singhvi said, &#8220;Everybody knows that what happened in 1962 was a product of a complex multitude of diverse factors,&#8221; and to suggest to make it &#8220;unilinear or as a unilateral factor&#8221; was to try to &#8220;miniaturise&#8221; things which were very complex.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the eve of elections to try and play such cheap politics after 30 or 40 years shows the mindset of the BJP.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said &#8220;much more&#8221; politics could be done today about the Kargil war which happened in contemporary India during the NDA rule, but &#8220;I am not going to do it, but could ask you a question how intruders were allowed to enter India (in 1999) with all these new warships and new equipment.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, Singhvi said, on such matters the nation stands together and &#8220;we do not do cheap politics on the eve of elections unlike the BJP.&#8221;</p>
<p>To a query, Singhvi said, &#8220;Certainly, there was lack of preparedness at some level. If you are a serious student of History, you could go into it. But to suggest that Nehru is to blame or Congress is to blame is cheap politicisation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have learnt a lot of lessons. We have come a long way and nobody dares to look us in the eye as some people did in 1960s. In 2014, we are a proud country despite the divisive tactics of the BJP,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Singhvi also hit out at BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi following a clarification issued by WikiLeaks dismissing a claim that its founder Julian Assange had called Gujarat Chief Minister &#8220;incorruptible&#8221;.</p>
<p>Wikileaks clarification came against the backdrop of some BJP supporters circulating posters in Ahmedabad quoting Assange as saying, &#8220;America is scared of Modi because he is incorruptible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Singhvi said, &#8220;Whichever people are or party is spreading falsehood day in and day out should be ready to face falsehood propagated by somebody else also. A person who has the passion to play with fire should be ready for immolation also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The basic question is how much falsehood Modi spreads,&#8221; he said, adding, going through the statistics, truth would emerge about Gujarat on various parameters like human development index or economic growth.</p>
<p>States like Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Harayana are in No.1 position in some parameters while Gujarat was in sixth or seventh but Chief Ministers of those states &#8220;do not go on tom tomming their achievements which Modi does&#8221;, he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012473&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Express Archive)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/rahul-480.jpg" /></a> I have never seen such a beautiful place anywhere in the country, said Rahul Gandhi (Express Archive)
<p>Enchanted by natural beauty of Arunachal Pradesh, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi on Monday said he would like to settle there after &#8220;retirement&#8221;.</p>
<p>Addressing a rally here in Lower Subansiri district, Gandhi said he would love to settle at Hapoli, popularly known as the Apatani plateau &#8220;after my retirement&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never seen such a beautiful place anywhere in the country and am also willing to spend a few days here to enjoy the natural beauty,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gandhi also said that real development was possible only after devolution of power to panchayats and party-ruled Arunachal Pradesh had set an example in this regard.</p>
<p>&#8220;The literacy rate of the state has significantly improved in the past decade and the state government has launched several schemes for empowering youth and women,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He also referred to programmes like Skill Development Council, Employment Generation Council and the Chief Minister&#8217;s Livelihood Mission Schools. Arunachal, he said in his brief 16-minute speech, had shown the country the path of peace and zealously protected  its culture and history which should be emulated by all states of the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;The women of the Northeast are very strong as society empowers them. The people of the country should learn from the Northeast,&#8221; he said at the rally ahead of the April nine Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>Referring to the immense potential in tourism, horticulture and hydro-power sectors in the state, Gandhi said that more focus should be given on these sectors for overall development of the state as well as the entire country.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012460&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arun-jaitley.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012441" alt="Arun Jaitley is set to contest his first-ever parliamentary election from Amritsar." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arun-jaitley.jpg" /></a> Arun Jaitley is set to contest his first-ever parliamentary election from Amritsar.
<p>A bunch of gas balloons burst during the road show of senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley in Amritsar on Tuesday leading to momentary commotion, when he along with other leaders of the SAD-BJP alliance were riding in an open truck.</p>
<p>Three time Rajya Sabha MP, Jaitley arrived by a flight in Amritsar, the constituency from where he will contest his first-ever parliamentary elections replacing cricketer-turned politician Navjot Sidhu, who is a three time Lok Sabha MP.</p>
<p>The incident occurred when a bunch of gas-filled balloons, carried by senior BJP leader Anil Joshi, burst leading to flames in the air as the cavalcade was passing through Novelty Chowk here.</p>
<p>Jaitley was accompanied by Punjab Cabinet Ministers Bikram Majithia and Joshi, state BJP president Kamal Sharma among others in the open-truck cavalcade which took off from Amritsar airport.</p>
<p>Joshi received some minor burn injuries on his face in the incident while Jaitley, Majithia and others escaped unhurt.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the balloons burst due to heat or after being hit by a cracker being burst along the route.</p>
<p>Earlier, Jailtey was received at Amritsar Rajasansi Airport by Majithia and Joshi along with his party workers, MLAs and BJP local leadership.</p>
<p>Sitting MP Navjot Singh Sidhu, who made way for Jaitley to contest from Amritsar, was not present when the senior leader arrived here. However, Sidhu&#8217;s wife and Amritsar East MLA Navjot Kaur was present.</p>
<p>Jaitley also paid obeisance at the Golden Temple.</p>
<p>Later, talking to reporters, Jaitley thanked the party high command for nominating him from Amritsar and said he will serve the people of the holy city.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012435&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Leader of Opposition in Madhya Pradesh Assembly, Satyadev Katare on Tuesday said the Congress state unit has requested party high command to nominate senior leader Digvijay Singh for Lok Sabha polls from Vidisha seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both I and Madhya Pradesh Congress president Arun Yadav agree that Singh must contest from Vidisha and we have sent a proposal about this to the party high command,&#8221; Katare said.</p>
<p>Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj is the sitting MP from Vidisha seat.</p>
<p>Katare said the Congress can benefit to a great extent if Singh is made the party&#8217;s choice from Vidisha. Digvijay should agree to contest from Vidisha the same way veteran BJP leader Vijayaraje Scindia had contested against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from Rae Bareli in 1980, and Sushma Swaraj had fought against Congress president Sonia Gandhi from Bellary in 2004, he said.</p>
<p>If Digvijay Singh is announced as the Congress candidate from Vidisha, both Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Swaraj would be concentrating there rather than at other state constituencies, he said.</p>
<p>Before becoming a member of the Rajya Sabha, Singh had last year expressed his desire to contest the Lok Sabha election from Vidisha.</p>
<p>Swaraj had won the 2009 Lok Sabha election from Vidisha by a massive margin of over 4,00,000 votes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012371&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996429" alt="The CBI registered a preliminary enquiry into the audio recording between Modi and Gujarat police officials." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/modim.jpg" /></a> The CBI clarified that it has not registered a preliminary enquiry into the audio recording between Modi and Gujarat police officials.
<p>The Central Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday clarified that it has not registered any Preliminary Enquiry in the investigation of Ishrat Jahan Case.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, there were reports that CBI had registerd a preliminary enquiry into the audio recording between the Gujarat Chief Minister and top cops in connection with the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by the investigating agency, the CBI said: &#8220;News Reports are being published /telecast in a section of Media speculating about the registration of a Preliminary Enquiry by CBI in the investigation of Ishrat Jahan Case&#8230;It is clarified that no such Preliminary Enquiry has been registered.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to reports, an audio recording allegedly on how to derail Ishrat Jahan encounter case has been provided by suspended IPS officer G L Singhal.</p>
<p>The audio recording reportedly is of a conversation that took place a day before a SIT appointed by the Gujarat high court was to submit its report in the case.</p>
<p>On July 3, 2013 CBI had filed its first chargesheet naming seven of Gujarat police officers and claimed that the encounter was fake. The chargesheet had claimed that the encounter was a part of a joint operation by Gujarat police and IB officials including former Special Director Rajinder Kumar.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012374&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1990915" alt="Arun Jaitley says that the Third Front is a failed idea and that the country shouldn't waste time on that idea. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/arun-jaitley-4801.jpg" /> Arun Jaitley says that the Third Front is a failed idea and that the country shouldn&#8217;t waste time on that idea.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley was on Tuesday accorded a warm welcome upon reaching Amritsar, the constituency from where he will contest his first-ever parliamentary elections. The ruling Shiromani Akali Dal leadership and the local BJP leaders were present when Jaitley arrived here this afternoon.</span></p>
<p>However, three-time sitting MP from here, Navjot Singh Sidhu, gave it a miss. On Saturday, when BJP had announced Jaitley&#8217;s candidature from Amritsar, Sidhu had said that Jaitley was his &#8220;guru&#8221;. Sidhu has been vocal against the Akali leadership in the past and had even accused them of scuttling his pet projects in the constituency.</p>
<p>He had said on Saturday that he would accept whatever the party decided, though he had made it clear that he would not contest the election from anywhere else. Jailtey was received at Amritsar Rajasansi Airport by Punjab Cabinet Minister Bikram Majithia along with his party workers, MLAs and BJP local leadership including Punjab cabinet Minister Anil Joshi.</p>
<p>On the way from airport to Golden Temple, where the BJP leader was to pay obeisance, Jaitley was accorded warm welcome, as the party activists showered rose petals on his long cavalcade which was moving under the tight security. There was heavy rush of SAD and BJP workers and other supporters on the roads right from the Airport to Golden Temple.</p>
<p>The VVIP cavalcade included buses, cars, jeeps and numerous security vehicles of police.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012303&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Launching a scathing attack on Rahul Gandhi, Shiv Sena on Tuesday said the Congress vice president&#8217;s dream of victory in the Lok Sabha elections is like filling gas in balloons with holes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hilarious that Congress, which can&#8217;t find candidates, is claiming to win more than 200 seats. (There is) anti-Congress wave in country, no one wants Congress ticket,&#8221; Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said in an editorial in party mouthpiece &#8216;Saamana&#8217;.</p>
<p>Exuding confidence that NDA will win more than 275 seats in the upcoming polls, he said, &#8220;Rahul Gandhi&#8217;s dream of poll victory is like filling gas in balloons with holes. NDA will win more than 275 seats in the upcoming elections under (BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial nominee) Narendra Modi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When Rahul Gandhi said that UPA will win more than 200 seats, he shocked everybody. His statement would have also shocked his mother and AICC chief Sonia Gandhi,&#8221; the Sena leader said.</p>
<p>Taking a dig at AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, he claimed that the Aam Aadmi Party would &#8220;disappear&#8221; after the elections.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012311&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-1987362" alt="Mamata Banerjee claimed that Trinamool Congress protested against the Modi government in the Parliament after the riots." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mamata-main1.jpg" /> Mamata Banerjee claimed that Trinamool Congress protested against the Modi government in the Parliament after the riots.
<p>Accusing BJP&#8217;s Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi of being an &#8220;<a title="Narendra Modi tears into Nitish Kumar,calls him opportunist" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/picture-gallery-others/narendra-modi-tears-into-nitish-kumar-calls-him-opportunist/" target="_blank">opportunist</a>&#8220;, prominent city cleric Maulana Barkati on Tuesday asked Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee to be more critical of Modi in order to prove her secular credentials.</p>
<p>The Imam of city&#8217;s Tipu Sultan Mosque, Maulana Barkati, told PTI, &#8220;We know she is secular, but if Mamata Banerjee wants to prove her secular credentials, she should be more aggressive and critical about Modi. Rahul Gandhi has been critical of Modi, we want Mamata Banerjee also to come out openly in criticising Modi.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cleric&#8217;s comment comes at a time when all political parties are aggressively trying to woo Muslims for their 28 per cent minority votes, which is a deciding factor for 28-30 seats of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state.</p>
<p>Barkati lashed out at Modi for seeking the votes of the Muslim community. &#8220;Why is he asking for the votes of Muslims, when he has a problem in wearing the Muslim cap? He should be ashamed about asking for our votes. He is an opportunist,&#8221; he charged.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012173&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/chopper480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1966059" alt="India will file an appeal against the Milan court order for the encashment of bank guarantee." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/chopper480.jpg" /></a> India will file an appeal against the Milan court order for the encashment of bank guarantee.
<p>India has reacted sharply to the order of an Italian court, which rejected a bid to recover the bank guarantee worth over 278 million euros in connection with the AgustaWestland chopper deal. The government has decided appeal against the court order.</p>
<p>In a press release issued on Tuesday, the government said that India would file an appeal against the Milan court order for the encashment of bank guarantee. It also said that India would “vigorously pursue all options” to encash the amount.</p>
<p>India has already encashed bank guarantees of around Rs 240 crore deposited in banks in India but it is yet to recover the bank guarantees deposited in banks of Italy.</p>
<p>An Italian court in Milan on Monday accepted a plea by AgustaWestland&#8217;s parent company Finmecannica to stop India from encashing over Rs 2,360 crore (Euro 278 million).</p>
<p>&#8220;With this measure, the Court granted the requests made by the companies of the Finmeccanica Group, recognising the manifestly abusive enforcement of the guarantees made by the Indian Defense Ministry, given the vagueness of the complaints made in relation to alleged breaches of contract,&#8221; Finmeccanica said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Milan court has confirmed the ruling made last January, prohibiting&#8230;the payment of collateral of more than 278 million euros deposited in relation to the contract,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The Defence Ministry had terminated the Rs 3,546-crore VVIP chopper deal on the grounds that Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland had breached the integrity pact by allegedly paying kickbacks.</p>
<p>The formal cancellation of the deal was announced after Defence Minister A K Antony met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and apprised him of developments in the case.</p>
<p>India had frozen the deal following a series of reports in The Indian Express that exposed claims that kickbacks worth 51 million euros were generated in the deal to supply 12 state-of-the-art helicopters to the IAF to fly VVIPs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012207&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Holi hai! It’s time to eat some jalebi, and put a little (err&#8230;) colour on people’s faces, and most importantly, laugh maniacally while convincing people you’re not high. The evening of holi is slightly different, though. Most of us sit at our computers and do what we do best &#8211; browse the internet looking for funny one-liners we can share so our friends think we’re cool. Well, we knew you’d be tired, so we’ve got the most colourful (literally) tweets from this month all in one place here for you:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="size-full wp-image-2012133" alt="Wikileaks on Tuesday clarified they never endorsed Modi. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/wiki-reuters-480.jpg" /> Wikileaks on Tuesday clarified they never endorsed Modi. (Reuters)
<p>A day after Whistle-blower Julian Assange-founded website Wikileaks denied they ever endorsed BJP&#8217;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi as &#8220;incorruptible&#8221;, the Wikileaks Twitter page on Tuesday accused BJP of using the fake Assange-Modi endorsement to raise funds. The Wikileaks website added that Modi&#8217;s supporters were using fake propaganda to shore up support for the BJP prime ministerial candidate and tarnish Assange&#8217;s image.</p>
<p><strong>This is what Wikileaks tweeted on Monday    </strong></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23India&amp;src=hash">#India</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BJP&amp;src=hash">#BJP</a> used fake <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Assange&amp;src=hash">#Assange</a>-<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Modi&amp;src=hash">#Modi</a> endorsement to raise funds <a href="https://t.co/pGvukVvxuI">https://t.co/pGvukVvxuI</a> <a href="https://t.co/TejwxChzjX">https://t.co/TejwxChzjX</a></p>

<p>Wikileaks also pointed out the cable where the term &#8220;incorruptible&#8221; was used. Apparently, a Rajkot Congress party leader Manoharsingh Jadeja praised Narendra Modi&#8217;s accomplishments, where he used the word &#8220;incorruptible&#8221;. He substantiated his argument by saying, &#8220;As long as Modi is the Gujarat CM, Congress would face a tough challenge.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The Narenda <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Modi&amp;src=hash">#Modi</a> &#8220;incorruptable&#8221; quote comes from Rajkot Congress party leader Manoharsinh Jadej: <a href="https://t.co/leCkQ8PNSK">https://t.co/leCkQ8PNSK</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bjp&amp;src=hash">#bjp</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23india&amp;src=hash">#india</a></p>

<p><strong>In fact, back in 2011, Modi&#8217;s own blog had acknowledged the cable as positive news backing his strong credentials. </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/chopper.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1981527" alt="The Defence Ministry had terminated the Rs 3,546-crore VVIP chopper deal on the grounds that Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland had breached the integrity pact by allegedly paying kickbacks." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/chopper.jpg" /></a> The Defence Ministry had terminated the Rs 3,546-crore VVIP chopper deal on the grounds that Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland had breached the integrity pact by allegedly paying kickbacks.
<p>Days after the Defence Ministry scrapped the tainted AgustaWestland chopper deal, a court in Italy has now rejected a bid by India to recover the bank guarantees worth more than 278 million euros. According to a <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/03/17/finmeccanica-india-idINDEEA2G0BQ20140317" target="_blank">Reuters report</a>, this announcement was made by Italian defence group Finmeccanica.</p>
<p>The Defence Ministry had terminated the Rs 3,546-crore VVIP chopper deal on the grounds that Anglo-Italian firm AgustaWestland had breached the integrity pact by allegedly paying kickbacks.</p>
<p>The formal cancellation of the deal was announced after Defence Minister A K Antony met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and apprised him of developments in the case.</p>
<p>India had frozen the deal following a series of reports in The Indian Express that exposed claims that kickbacks worth 51 million euros were generated in the deal to supply 12 state-of-the-art helicopters to the IAF to fly VVIPs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012086&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A week after Maoist organisation Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh (CMAS) leader Nachika Linga announced and then called off his scheduled surrender, Maoists in Koraput district have urged the tribals to disown his plan of joining electoral politics.</p>
<p>In a signed two-page letter written in Odia and released Sunday night, Daya and Aruna, secretaries of Srikakulam-Koraput Divisional Committee and Narayanpatna Anchalika Committee of the Maoists respectively, termed Nachika’s surrender move as “drama” that would serve his own interests at the cost of larger interests of the Maoist-hit block.</p>
<p>“During 2012 panchayat polls, school and mass education minister Rabi Nanda, Koraput MP Jayram Pangi, MLAs Jhina Hikaka and Raghuram Padal had signed on a 10-point charter of demands. But BJD has not fulfilled any of the demands. In next poll, Nachika has demanded BJD ticket for Laxmipur. He has weakened the agitation by telling people that they would get  facilities by going the electoral way. Without caring for people’s problems, Nachika has demanded withdrawal of cases against him,” the Maoists alleged in the letter.</p>
<p>Nachika, 42, started CMAS in Narayanpatna block and has more than 50 cases of Maoist violence against him. He shot to prominence in April 2012 when he helped the Maoists abduct BJD MLA Jhina Hikaka when he was returning home at night. He has been underground after he allegedly led an attack on police in 2009. He was supposed to surrender at Balipeta village before hundreds of his tribal supporters on March 11. However, with large number of BSF and local policemen lurking in the background, Nachika did not turn up at the meeting.</p>
<p>But Nachika’s plan may come cropper with Maoists now looking for an opportunity to kill him for his act of betrayal. “Our party gifted the land agitation to Nachika. When the battle was on, Nachika supported BJD in 2012 panchayat polls without caring for the peoples’ agitation. In Narayanpatna block, all sarpanch and zilla parishad candidate Zuro Mouka were elected. But till date, block chairman Malti Tada and other sarpanch in 9 grampanchayts are yet to be seen. Zuro Mouka has now become the don of Damanjodi,” the letter reads. It also urged the tribals to boycott the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls in Koraput scheduled to be held on April 10.</p>
<p>Police officials in Koraput said Nachika’s plans of surrender at a local court on March 11 would have saved him. “The letter from Maoists as good as a death warrant for him. If he delays his surrender, he will be of no use to the next government. The police and the Maoists would then be too eager to kill him,” the official said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011977&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 31-year-old worker of Neyveli Lignite Corporation was killed on Monday when a CISF constable on security duty opened fire allegedly in self defence on being attacked, sparking a flash strike by a section of the PSU workers who clashed with the security men.  Agitated workers damaged an office of the central force inside the company premises, and a joint meeting of the various trade unions are to discuss the next step of action.</p>
<p>T Suresh, attached to NLC’s first mine, died when Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) constable Ram Momen Singh opened fire after being allegedly attacked for preventing his attempt to enter the second mine without authorisation.</p>
<p>The constable was later arrested and produced before a local magistrate court which remanded him to 15 days custody, the police said.</p>
<p>Tension prevailed in the second mine area in Neyveli in the district as the CISF gate office came under attack twice and enraged workers clashed with security personnel, prompting police to resort to lathicharge and teargas.</p>
<p>Around 20 workers and three CISF personnel were injured in the incidents and were undergoing treatment in NLC hospital, police said adding pickets had been posted in the area.  DSP A Radhika said police lobbed 12 teargas shells to disperse the crowd and the situation was under control now.</p>
<p>According to police, Suresh and his colleague Krishnamoorthy, both workers of NLC’s first mine, attempted to enter the second mine at 1 pm. As they did not have permission to enter the mine, the CISF constable stopped them.</p>
<p>After a quarrel, the duo, allegedly in an inebriated state, attacked the constable who then opened three rounds of fire from his Self Loading Rifle, police said. Suresh died on the spot while his accomplice managed to escape unhurt.</p>
<p>As news spread, people from Suresh’s village ransacked the CISF gate office. District collector Kirlosh Kumar ordered an inquiry.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011976&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A key suspect wanted in connection with the April 2013 bomb blast outside the Bangalore headquarters of the BJP allegedly trained with a terrorist group in Afghanistan, some of the men arrested in the case are believed to have told the police.</p>
<p>The fugitive, Abu Backer Siddique, 45, is allegedly also linked to a series of attacks on BJP and Right-wing leaders in Tamil Nadu and is thought to be one of the last missing links in the BJP office blast case. The Tamil Nadu CB-CID’s special investigation division has announced a Rs 5 lakh-reward for information leading to his capture.</p>
<p>Sources said police learnt that Siddique is a key figure in the bombing plot after the arrest last month of Parvai Basha, the alleged explosives supplier for the BJP office blast, and the arrest in October of three alleged key perpetrators of the blast — Police Fakrudeen, 35, Panna Ismail, 38, and Bilal Malik, 25 — all linked to the proscribed Al Ummah outfit from Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>Siddique, who holds a masters degree in literature, has emerged at the top of the leadership pyramid for the conspiracy as the possible financier and the key link involved in bringing together two factions of the disjointed Al Ummah.</p>
<p>“Siddique was missing from the police radar for nearly 16 years. Some of the accused who have now been arrested are saying that he received training with a terror outfit in Afghanistan. This is under investigation,’’ Karnataka Police sources said.</p>
<p>Officials in the Tamil Nadu Police also acknowledged that Siddique had received terrorism training in Afghanistan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011975&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whistleblower Julian Assange-founded website WikiLeaks Monday said it never endorsed the BJP’s prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi as “incorruptible”.</p>
<p>In a series of tweets, WikiLeaks claimed it never said Modi was incorruptible. “Rather he is popular because he is ‘viewed’ as ‘incorruptible’,” WikiLeaks tweeted.</p>
<p>The whistle-blower website’s clarification came in the backdrop of some BJP supporters circulating posters quoting Wikileaks founder Julian Assange saying that “America is scared of Modi because he is incorruptible”.</p>
<p>The BJP, however, downplayed the WikiLeaks tweets. “We don’t need a certificate from Wikileaks or Assange on Modiji,” BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011974&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/narvekar-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011971" alt="Rahul Narvekar" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/narvekar-main.jpg" /></a> Rahul Narvekar
<p>Shiv Sena spokesperson Rahul Narvekar has quit the party to join the NCP, which has nominated him as its candidate from Maval for the Lok Sabha elections.</p>
<p>Narvekar, the urbane face of the Shiv Sena who represented the party’s views on English news channels, had withdrawn his nomination from the legislative council elections held last week.</p>
<p>He had been nominated by the Shiv Sena which did not have adequate numbers to get him elected.</p>
<p>Narvekar claimed he withdrew his nomination as some leaders of the party were working against him and he was not in a position to secure the remaining votes necessary to get elected.</p>
<p>Narvekar had last week claimed he had tried to get in touch with Sena president Uddhav Thackeray before the elections but could not get through to him. Soon after withdrawing his nomination on March 14 Narvekar had initiated meetings with senior NCP leaders, including Sharad Pawar.</p>
<p>His entry into the party was announced at a press conference in Mumbai by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.</p>
<p>“I have been working in the Shiv Sena for the past 15 years. It feels sad to leave a party you have worked for. There were some leaders in the party who were not too happy with my progress and worked to ensure that I did not succeed in the MLC elections,” Narvekar said.</p>
<p>Narvekar’s father-in-law Ram Raje Nimbalkar is a senior NCP leader and belongs to one of Maharashtra’s erstwhile royal families. Sharad Pawar is said to have played a key role in getting Narvekar married into the Nimbalkar family.</p>
<p>In the polls, Narvekar will face Shrirang Barne who has been nominated by the Shiv Sena from Maval. Sena MP Gajanan Babar had quit the party after it did not renominate him. The NCP was struggling to find a candidate with its MLA Laxman Jagtap deciding to contest as an independent.</p>
<p>Narevkar’s exit from the Shiv Sena is not likely to hurt the party electorally as he did not have an independent support base. However, it has dented the Sena’s public image as a leader known as its urban face and close to Thackeray’s son Aditya has left so close to the elections.</p>
<p>Three outgoing MPs have quit the Shiv Sena in the last fortnight.</p>
<p>Narvekar told The Indian Express he had been in touch with the NCP leadership. “I have met NCP chief Sharad Pawar several times,” he said.</p>
<p>At the press conference where his name was announced as NCP’s Maval candidate, Narvekar rubbished reports that he suddenly withdrew from the council poll without informing the Sena leadership. “The withdrawal happened with permission of the Sena leadership,” he said.</p>
<p>He also scotched speculation that he was the dummy candidate for the NCP from Maval amid reports that he was being fielded to hurt the Sena and help Jagtap, who is said to be close to Ajit Pawar.</p>
<p>Although the Shiv Sena in Maval seems to have been rattled by the development as it fears its votebank would be eroded, party candidate Shrirang Barne underplayed Narvekar’s move.</p>
<p>He said Narvekar is from Mumbai and has no hold in the Raigad area of Maval constituency.</p>
<p>“But what is amazing is that the NCP, which was born here, does not find a candidate in Pune district. It had to go all the way to Mumbai to look for a candidate,” he said. “Let them play games, I don’t care&#8230;I will win by a historic margin.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011965&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The current market price of an apartment in the society, with a saleable area of 1,345 sq ft, is estimated to be upward of Rs 2.5 crore.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011959&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rti-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011963" alt="The current market price of an apartment in the society is estimated to be upward of Rs 2.5 crore." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rti-main.jpg" /></a> The current market price of an apartment in the society is estimated to be upward of Rs 2.5 crore.
<p>The Maitri cooperative society, with 84 high-profile members, has seen a sudden rush of senior bureaucrats and police officers queuing up for preferential allotment of a house in the 13-storey public housing building being built near Mumbai University in Kalina.</p>
<p>The Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) is constructing high income category homes on the housing board-owned plot for the society of gazetted state and central government officials. The rush is due to the fact that MHADA’s revised rules could render more than a fourth of the original 84 members ineligible on the grounds that they already own homes in Maharashtra under a government quota.</p>
<p>According to documents obtained under the Right to Information Act, 19 officials from the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, Indian Revenue Service and Indian Railway Accounts Service have submitted their names to MHADA.</p>
<p>Some of the aspirants for the two-bedroom flats include Amitabh Rajan, additional chief secretary in the home department; Dhananjay Kamalakar, joint commissioner of police (Law and Order); Rajvardhan Sinha, additional commissioner of police in the Economic Offences Wing; Rajesh Agrawal, principal secretary in the IT department, and Vikas Kharge, secretary to the chief minister.</p>
<p>On the eve of the last assembly election in August 2009, the state government had decided to hand over land meant for public housing stock to the society.</p>
<p>But it was only early this year that the the housing board started to build on the plot.</p>
<p>The current market price of an apartment in the society, with a saleable area of 1,345 sq ft, is estimated to be upward of Rs 2.5 crore. However, MHADA will make them available for less than half this price.</p>
<p>“We were recently informed by MHADA that as per their revised rules, a person owning a house anywhere in Maharashtra under any government quota will not be eligible for a MHADA house. When we had earlier submitted names of our 84 original members, only those owning a house in Mumbai were ineligible,” said an IAS official who is also a member of the society.</p>
<p>According to MHADA vice-president Satish Gavai, at last count, 54 of the original members had submitted their documents, and been declared eligible. He added that several of the remaining members may not satisfy the revised criteria. “If the others do not submit their documents, then the new applicants could be considered but that call will have to be taken by the state government,” Gavai said.</p>
<p>The housing body usually receives at least a hundred applications for every home that it releases in its annual lottery. However, MHADA rules allow the state government to use its discretion for preferential allotment of land and homes meant for public housing.</p>
<p>The list of members of Maitri Cooperative Society includes private secretaries and personal assistants from the office of the chief minister, deputy chief minister and some other ministries. It also has bureaucrats and officials from departments such as housing, registration and stamps, revenue, the central civil aviation ministry and MHADA itself — all departments that were, at some point or the other, involved in sanctioning the project.</p>
<p>MHADA had earlier this year approved a request from the society to increase the size of the homes from the originally proposed carpet area of 861 sq ft to 1,076 sq ft. With the floor space index (FSI) increasing from 2 to 2.7 due to change in civic norms, the total saleable area of the apartments has gone up proportionally.</p>
<p>Official documents from 2010 show that the housing board had estimated the sale price to be as low as Rs 2,888 per sq ft. The existing rates in Kalina, which is in close proximity to the commercial business district of Bandra Kurla Complex, are between Rs 16,000 and Rs 20,000 per sq ft.</p>
<p>“We haven’t decided the prices of the apartments yet. However, I have categorically said that MHADA will recover the cost as per our pricing policy, no more, no less. Since these are higher-income group houses, we will also recover our 35 percent premium,” Gavai said.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, the state government has directed the housing board to hand over a huge stock of public housing to societies of legislators from the state and central governments, mediapersons, bureaucrats and gazetted officers. Around the same time that the Maitri society was allotted a vacant plot in August 2009, a ready-to-move in residential complex was handed over to Rajyog society, comprising over 200 Maharashtra MLAs and MLCs. No new allotments have been made since, after it was found that several of the legislators had grabbed public housing despite owning a house in Mumbai.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india18.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011962" alt="The committee has recommended the need for the creation of a special Act on the lines of the SC/ST Act for Muslims in the country. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india18.jpg" /></a> The committee has recommended the need for the creation of a special Act on the lines of the SC/ST Act for Muslims in the country.
<p>A committee appointed by the central government to review the implementation of the recommendations of the Sachar panel has suggested that a law on the lines of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act be enacted to safeguard the Muslim community.<br />
The committee headed by Amitabh Kundu, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, submitted its report to the Ministry of Minority Affairs on March 14.</p>
<p>“The committee has recommended the need for the creation of a special Act on the lines of the SC/ST Act for Muslims in the country. It has been seen that the members of the Muslim community face similar challenges to that of the SC community, and in certain cases, they are more violent challenges,” sources who played a role in the drafting of the report said.</p>
<p>The committee has suggested that the new law could supplement the communal violence Bill, which is facing political opposition.</p>
<p>The panel has also recommended that a special sub-quota for Muslims be created within the OBC category, and has stressed the need to include Muslims in the Scheduled Castes category.<br />
The interim report identifies Muslim OBCs as one of the most deprived sections, and says many Muslim OBCs actually belong to the SC category. Dalit Muslims are currently not included in the SC category, and are notified as OBCs.</p>
<p>In its evaluation of the implementation of the Sachar recommendations, the committee has said that while the central government has created institutions like the Minority Affairs Department to address the problems of the minority community, there is a lack of convergence and coordination in these institutions.</p>
<p>“The institution building process to address the concerns of the minorities has been successful at central level, for which we laud the government. However it has not succeeded in creating the convergence of these institutions. There has been no coordination established between various bodies at the state and central level which is a matter of concern. There is also no punishment over the failure to implement schemes and this has led to the unsuccessful implementation of the Sachar recommendations,” the sources said.</p>
<p>Almost seven years after the submission of the Sachar report, the Centre decided to set up a committee to review the implementation of the recommendations. The primary task of the Kundu panel, which was set up on August 5 last year, was to evaluate the process of the implementation of the decisions taken on the recommendations of the Sachar committee, and to assess the important programmes initiated by the ministry and the schemes covered by the Prime Minister’s 15-point programme. The committee had been asked to submit a report in six months.</p>
<p><strong>‘FOCUS NOT ON MUSLIMS’</strong><br />
<em>What the committee has found</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Due to political compulsions, focus of development not on Muslims, but on other minorities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Institution-building process successful, but no coordination at central and state levels for effective implementation of recommendations.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india17.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011956" alt="M K Alagiri with supporters in Madurai, where he attacked his brother and paid compliments to Jayalalithaa and Narendra Modi.PTI" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india17.jpg" /></a> M K Alagiri with supporters in Madurai, where he attacked his brother and paid compliments to Jayalalithaa and Narendra Modi. PTI
<p>Dissident DMK leader M K Alagiri, the rebellious elder son of party president M Karunanidhi, Monday ruled out launching a new political outfit as speculated but not before launching a stinging attack on his younger brother and rival, M K Stalin, complimenting Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa and saying he would welcome Narendra Modi as the next Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Alagiri alleged Stalin was selling party tickets to moneybags, said Jayalalithaa was keeping the discipline in her party and acknowledged there is a wave in favour of Modi and that he would welcome him as the next PM based on his good performance as the chief minister of Gujarat.</p>
<p>Alagiri’s clarification on a new party, which came as posters appeared in his stronghold of Madurai proclaiming the advent of ‘Kalaignar DMK’, would offer relief to the DMK leadership that is jittery about a full-blown rebellion in the ranks ahead of a tightly-fought general election.<br />
However, even as he absolved Karunanidhi for the present situation of the party and ruled out a split, Alagiri was scathing in his criticism of Stalin and his faction without naming anyone.</p>
<p>“The DMK is no longer in Karunanidhi’s control. He is now in some crisis situation, and saving him and the party from it should be our first priority,” Alagiri told supporters who attended the meeting he convened in Madurai.</p>
<p>“It is evident that the DMK candidates were decided after collecting money. Those who have been working for the party have been ignored in favour of unknown persons who got paid seats. All 35 candidates should be changed,” he said, adding that Karunanidhi himself had said there could be some changes in the Lok Sabha candidates’ list.</p>
<p>Although suspended from the party on disciplinary grounds, the former south zone convenor of the DMK, former union minister and MP from Madurai still has influence among the cadre in south Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>Stalin has managed to win over the allegiance of a good number of second-rung leaders from the region who swore by Alagiri until recently. But the elder son’s capability to hurt the party in a tight election cannot be underestimated. He displayed that ability in the Assembly election of 2001 when his men worked against party candidates which led to the DMK’s defeat.</p>
<p>Alagiri admitted that the present crisis was precipitated by party cadre who had put up posters “out of love for him”, which led to the confrontation with the dominant faction led by Stalin.</p>
<p>In what is seen as a comment made to irritate the leadership, he complimented Jayalalithaa, with whom he has no love lost, for maintaining tight discipline within her party. “That is not the case with the DMK,” he said.</p>
<p>Later, speaking to a news channel, Alagiri said there was a Modi wave in the country ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. “He is a good administrator. I will welcome if he becomes the Prime Minister,” he said, amid reports that he met BJP president Rajnath Singh.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011954&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/saurabh-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011925 " alt="It has been decided to make special arrangements which will not inconvenience the community or the polling process, said  Saurabh Rao. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/saurabh-main.jpg" /></a> It has been decided to make special arrangements which will not inconvenience the community or the polling process, said<br />Saurabh Rao.
<p>District Collector Saurabh Rao said the polling date (April 17) will not be changed, but has assured Christian organisations that special arrangements will be made so that the solemn mass can be observed peacefully on Maundy Thursday. This is a special holy day for Christians, who are miffed that the Election Commission did not take their views into account before declaring the election date.</p>
<p>Six churches, including Church of Our Lady of The Immaculate Conception (City church), St Joseph’s church, Ghorpuri, St Joseph’s church, Khadki, St Francis de sales church, Shaanwadi, St Anthony’s church at Model Colony and St Sebastian church at Daund, will be affected as schools on their premises will be polling centres.</p>
<p>Diago Almeida, president of the Catholic Association of Poona, has threatened to boycott the general elections if the date is not changed, while the Bishop of Poona, Rt Rev Thomas Dabre, has sent letters challenging the date that clashes with Maundy Thursday to the EC and Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan.</p>
<p>“We have not got any reply yet. We do not think it is fair to hold elections on a day which is most holy for us. This is the day when Jesus Christ called his disciples, washed their feet, sat with them for supper and gave the command of service. This is the core of the observance of our faith,” said Father Malcolm Sequeira, Vicar General, Diocese of Poona.</p>
<p>Rao said that his team has visited the schools and alternative arrangements will be made, such as putting up special barricades and separate entrance and exits. He said he spoke to the state Election Commissioner and it has been decided to make special arrangements which will not inconvenience the community or the polling process. “We will request the Bishop if they can postpone the mass timings to 6.30 pm or 7 pm,” Rao said.</p>
<p>Father Salvador Pinto, parish priest at City church, Nana Peth, said the district election office is yet to contact them. “There has been an extension in the timings of polling from 5 pm to 6 pm. How can we conduct the mass when there will be no time to prepare the seating arrangements?” he said, adding that they will take up the matter with the state EC again.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011924&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ram-main.jpg" /></a> Only Modi can take the country out of the current political and economic crisis. (PTI)
<p>BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi will participate in a ‘<a title="BJP’s ‘Chai Pe Charcha’ may run into Election Commission trouble" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/bjps-chai-pe-charcha-may-run-into-election-commission-trouble/" target="_blank">chai pe charcha’ </a>(tea-talk) programme with farmers in Yavatmal on March 20.</p>
<p>With this, it is now clear that Modi will have no public programme at Nagpur, where party’s former president Nitin Gadkari is pitted against sitting Congress MP Vilas Muttemwar.</p>
<p>Earlier, it was speculated that a ‘chai pe charcha’ would be held at Nagpur since Modi’s public rally had been scheduled for Wardha. Political grapevine had it that Gadkari didn’t want Modi to have any rally in Nagpur and that he would like to win the election on his own.</p>
<p>Gadkari told The Indian Express that the speculation was totally unfounded. “Modiji’s schedule is very tight and the priority is to meet farmers’ families in Yavatmal, which is the worst farmer suicide-prone district of Vidarbha. He has said that he will give some time to Nagpur later sometime,” he said.</p>
<p>Asked if he is worried that the Muslim votes that he has carefully nurtured over the years might not get cast against his name at the end of the day if Modi campaigned in city, Gadkari said: “There is no such possibility.”</p>
<p>Modi is set to meet RSS leaders at the organisation’s headquarter here.</p>
<p><strong>Never gave statement against Modi: Ramdev</strong><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Nagpur:</strong> Yoga guru Ramdev has refuted a newspaper report here quoting him having said at a press conference that Modi was in a hurry to become Prime Minister. In another press conference here on Monday, Ramdev said The Times of India had wrongly reported his statements on Sunday. “If I had said any such thing, would others not have reported? Would the news channels not have run it?” Ramdev asked, seeking a clarification from the newspaper. He also categorically said Modi had his support for PM’s post. “Only Modi can take the country out of the current political and economic crisis,” said Ramdev. Local newspapers had reported on Monday that Ramdev said BJP workers were filled with over-enthusiasm about the elections. On Monday, he also said Kejriwal should fight elections against Rahul Gandhi. “Modi is a patriot and Kejriwal fighting election against him shows how his mind works,” Ramdev said. About Rahul Gandhi’s statement on Modi’s culpability in Gujarat riots, Ramdev said: “He (Rahul) is frustrated that he has lagged miles behind Modi in the race and is hence making such statements.” Ramdev had a lunch with BJP nominee Nitin Gadkari at the latter’s residence on Monday and also campaigned for him for two days.    ENS</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011917&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/crop-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011901" alt="The revised estimate says crops on total 18 lakh hectares were destroyed." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/crop-main.jpg" /></a> The revised estimate says crops on total 18 lakh hectares were destroyed.
<p>The state government is finding it extremely difficult to meet the enormous challenge of compensating the farmers affected by hailstorm, with the latest damage figure pegged at Rs 10,000 crore. The revised estimate says crops on total 18 lakh hectares were destroyed.</p>
<p>Last week, the damage was estimated to be on about 13 lakh hectares.</p>
<p>“Ready-to-harvest Rabi crops on over 18 lakh hectares have been damaged. The area is same in terms Kharif crops that were damaged by excessive rains last year. But the damage is higher this time since the Kharif crop was in cultivation stage. Also, the damage this time is more in the horticulture sector,” said a senior official.</p>
<p>As per the norms, the Centre can pay compensation only up to Rs 1,250 crore.</p>
<p>“There is an empowered group of ministers at the Centre that can increase the compensation by 1.5 times in special cases. Like, Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,500 for dryland, Rs 6,000-Rs 9,000 for irrigated land and Rs 8,000-Rs 12,000 per hectare for horticulture. But even that would be very much less than the actual damage that has happened in the present case,” said the official.</p>
<p>He said the Kharif damages couldn’t be calculated in terms of money since they were at cultivation stage. “But as per norms, they were paid Rs 1,041 crore as a whole, of which Rs 824 crore had come from the Centre,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Crop damaged, farmer ends life in Nashik</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nashik:</strong> A 42-year-old farmer in Daregaon village in North Maharashtra&#8217;s Satana taluka of Nashik district committed a suicide by consuming poison  Sunday ,sources said. The farmer, Atmaram Sitaram Pawar, took the extreme step, unable to bear losses of his pomegranate and gram crops on seven acres of land, due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms, the police said here Monday. He is survived by his parents, wife, a son and two daughters. His body has been handed over to his relatives after post mortem. <strong>PTI</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011900&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>He faces not only candidates of other parties in the political fray, but also formidable opposition from within the BJP with several leaders raising questions about his health. But Tapan Sikdar, BJP candidate from Dum Dum, one of the few constituencies that the BJP is aiming to win in Bengal, says he is ready.</p>
<p>Sikdar, a former minister of state in the two NDA governments, first won from the constituency in 1998 with a margin of 1.39 lakh votes and then in 1999 with a margin of 1.36 lakh votes. In 2004 he lost to his closest rival, Amitava Nandi of the CPM, by 91,000 votes. He contested in 2009, too, polling 55,000 votes.</p>
<p>“This time paribartan of the government at the Centre is our sole objective and we are working to fulfil that. The Congress has destroyed the country socially and economically. In the first UPA government the CPM was their accomplice and in the second UPA government it was the Trinamool Congress, which was its partner. It is the NDA government under Narendra Modi which will be able to take the country back to the path of glory,’’ Sikdar said, sitting at his Shyam Bazzar residence in north Kolkata.</p>
<p>In 1998, when he first contested from Dum Dum, he had a formidable opponent in CPM’s Nirmal Chatterjee and not even his well-wishers expected him to win. In fact he left the counting centre alleging rigging and said he would challenge the verdict in the court. However, he went on to win and nobody went to court. In 1999, Sikdar faced another CPM leader Anil Bhattacharya and again he scored over his CPM rival. But as the TMC-BJP alliance lost in 2004, Sikdar lost to the Amitava Nandi and again in 2009.</p>
<p>“In 2004 there was a wave against the TMC-BJP alliance and in 2009 there was a anti-CPM wave that brought Mamata Banerjee to power. And now it is the anti-Congress wave that is sweeping the country. People want to get rid of the corrupt, anti-people Congress,’’ Sikdar said.</p>
<p>However, the BJP candidate is banking not only on the perceived anti-Congress wave but on the good work he has done in the constituency with about 14 lakh voters. “Tapanda was one who without considering the political allegiance of a person, made the utmost use of the MPLAD fund, going in for development of the area,’’ Ritesh Tewary, secretary of the state unit, told The Indian Express. According to party sources, election managers of Sikdar are also banking on the two lakh Hindi-speaking people of Dum Dum.</p>
<p>There is dissension within the party with some saying he is not in best of health. “I am aware of the opposition but I don’t care. I know I am fit to fight the battle,’’ he said.</p>
<p>However Saugata Roy, TMC candidate who won with a slender margin of 20,000 votes in 2009, does not consider him a threat. “He got only 55,000 votes in 2009 and I don’t think he will be able to increase his margin,’’ Roy said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011868&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past one month the Congress, the main opposition party in Orissa, has been a source of swelling numbers for the ruling BJD with dozens of Congress leaders queuing up to join the regional party.</p>
<p>About a fortnight back, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Bhupinder Singh joined the BJD expressing  displeasure over a “coterie” running the Congress. Singh had wanted a Congress ticket for Lok Sabha elections from Kalahandi and initially went underground for a couple of days early this month. After surfacing at a hospital, Singh went to Naveen Niwas, the home of CM Naveen Patnaik, and joined the BJD. Along with Singh, his son Daljeet and Congress MLA from Brajrajnagar Assembly seat Anup Sai also joined the ruling party. Sai got the BJD ticket from the same constituency.</p>
<p>“I have been systematically sidelined by a coterie,” Singh said referring to “machinations” of union minister and chief of the election campaign committee Srikant Jena and PCC president Jaydev Jena.</p>
<p>Singh may have been the most prominent deserter from the Congress in Orissa, but he is not the first. Champua Congress MLA Jitu Patnaik and Talcher MLA Braja Kishore Pradhan joined the BJD just before Rajya Sabha polls as Naveen went all out to get noted sculptor Raghunath Mohapatra victorious. However, Mohapatra lost to Ranjib Biswal of the Congress.</p>
<p>With all pre-poll surveys projecting a record fourth win for the BJD in the 147-member assembly, more Congress leaders are joining the BJD. Though the Congress won 32.75 per cent of total votes in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls, desertions on eve of polls this time have made it difficult for the party to find willing candidates for the 147 assembly and 21 Lok Sabha seats in the state.</p>
<p>In February, Nayagarh district president of Congress and scion of the Nayagarh royal family, Kumar Hemendra Singh, joined the BJD. Hemendra was tipped to win from Nayagarh even on a Congress ticket but sensing a loss of popularity by the party, he quit. BJD sources say Hemendra will contest from Nayagarh Assembly seat.</p>
<p>After him, former minister Kamala Das, who 14 years ago left the BJD to join the Congress after being charged with corruption, returned to the BJD. Former Balikuda MLA Umesh Swain also joined the BJD.</p>
<p>Last week, PCC secretary Bharati Das and spokesperson Ashok Samal resigned from the Congress. Congressman Sanatan Mahakud, who fought unsuccessfully from Champua in Keonjhar also resigned to join BJD.</p>
<p>Recently, former Speaker Sarat Kar resigned from the party.</p>
<p>Days ago, Hema Gamang, former Koraput MP and wife of former Congress chief minister Giridhar Gamang joined BJD. Hema who won the Koraput Lok Sabha seat in 1999 and the Gunupur assembly seat in 2004 on a Congress ticket may be the BJD candidate from Koraput. She would fight against her husband, the Congress candidate. There have been other notable desertions including former finance minister Ramakrushna Patnaik, Dalit leader Sura Sethi and PCC spokesperson Arya Kumar Gyanendra.</p>
<p>Gyanendra, who joined Trinamul Congress, alleged that the mining and builder mafia was calling the shots in ticket distribution</p>
<p>There is strong buzz that former MP from Dhenkanal, K P Singh Deo may quit Congress to join the BJD after the party favoured Sudhir Samal for the Lok Sabha seat.</p>
<p>Former state president of the BJP, Suresh Pujari, said the BJD may sink under the weight of Congressmen joining the regional party.</p>
<p>“Everyday someone or the other is leaving the party. It’s not just adverse publicity for us, but demoralises the party cadre. It’s time for us to introspect,” said former PCC chief Niranjan Patnaik. The former PCC chief has been languishing since he was unseated from PCC president’s post and his brother Soumyaranjan Patnaik was expelled from the party on charges of anti-party activities.</p>
<p>Chief whip of the Congress Prasad Harichandan said the desertions won’t affect the party as those who left did not have much of an electoral base.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011866&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
