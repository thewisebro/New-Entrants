				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kangana480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002654" alt="Kangana Ranaut will soon be seen in 'Queen'." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kangana480.jpg" /></a> Kangana Ranaut will soon be seen in &#8216;Queen&#8217;.
<p>Actress Kangana Ranaut is miffed with the fact that an actor has to be constantly in the glare of public eye.<br />
&#8220;The worst thing of being an actor is that you are constantly in limelight. There are times when I feel like being left alone. I was 17 when I started working and I don&#8217;t remember living on my own. I don&#8217;t know if I deserve this stardom,&#8221; the actress said.</p>
<p>Kangana, 26, made her acting debut in 2006 with &#8216;Gangster&#8217; and later appeared in hit films like &#8216;Fashion&#8217;, &#8216;Raaz – The Mystery Continues&#8217;, &#8216;Once Upon A Time In Mumbai&#8217;, &#8216;Tanu Weds Manu&#8217;, &#8216;Shootout at Wadala&#8217;, &#8216;Krrish 3&#8242; and others.</p>
<p>She had also gone to New York to study filmmaking and had a great learning experience there.<br />
&#8220;It was a unique experience to go back to school. I enjoyed sitting in the classroom, attending lectures, doing homework. I never had any formal education in acting. I understand the techniques of filmmaking but I wanted to understand it better,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Kangana enjoyed the anonymity while studying abroad. &#8220;It was a refreshing change to be anonymous and be myself. While I was studying in New York, I was cooking for myself, doing my laundry, travelling by subways. I found it relaxing and really enjoyed staying alone,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>However, the actress left the course mid-way as she had to promote her film &#8216;Queen&#8217;, which releases tomorrow. But,she is going back in June to complete the course.</p>
<p>When asked if the course encouraged her to write a screenplay for a movie, she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I want to write a script. I would love to write and direct but I don&#8217;t know when that will happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are aspects of college life shown in &#8216;Queen&#8217; Kangana says she was quite studious during academic days.<br />
&#8220;I was a medical student, so I spent most of my school days studying to become a doctor. I was very studious. I was always paranoid about my results. I would stay up all night to study. Most of the time I would either be at home or in library with my head in the books all the time. I would always compete to top the class,&#8221; she said.<br />
&#8216;Queen&#8217;, directed by Vikas Bahl, stars Rajkumar Rao, Lisa Haydon and others.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002652&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gg480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002635" alt="'Gulaab Gang' to release tomorrow. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gg480.jpg" /></a> &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217; to release tomorrow.
<p>Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla- starrer film &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217; will hit theatres tomorrow across the country as scheduled as the Delhi High Court today lifted the stay granted on its release by a single judge bench on the ground that the movie depicts an activist and her &#8216;Gulabi Gang&#8217; in poor light.</p>
<p>&#8220;The film can only be shown after giving a clear disclaimer that it has nothing to do with the life of Sampat Pal (respondent) and her organisation Gulabi Gang,&#8221; a division bench of acting Chief Justice B D Ahmed and Justice Siddharth Mridul said.</p>
<p>The film is scheduled for nationwide release tomorrow and it had landed in trouble after a single judge bench yesterday stayed its release by nearly nine weeks after taking note of defamation law suit filed by Sampat Pal, a Uttar Pradesh-based activist.</p>
<p>Pal, who runs &#8216;Gulabi Gang comprising women vigilantes wearing pink sarees, said she and her members help harassed women and girls by resorting to peaceful means and the prommos of the film show that the lead actor, playing her character, was shown as an anti-social element, wielding swords and sickles, contrary to her real life persona.</p>
<p>The larger bench agreed in the forenoon to hear today itself the plea of producer Sahara One Media and Entertainment Ltd against the interim order of single judge bench.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did you come to know that the film is based on your life? Why you came so late&#8221;? the bench said.</p>
<p>Citing the case records, the counsel for Pal said there was no delay on her part and she has moved the court after the producers refused to reply to the legal notice.<br />
Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, appearing for the producer, said &#8220;the law is well settled that the pre-publication injunction cannot be granted in such cases.&#8221;<br />
Countering the plea, Pal cited the earlier High Court judgement and said the release of &#8216;Bandit Queen&#8217; was first stayed and was allowed to be screened only after some objectionable portions were removed.</p>
<p>During the hearing, the court said &#8220;the film may be influenced from your life but it is not you. Tell us the storyline as to whether she has been shown in good or bad light.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Good,&#8221; the counsel for the producer replied. &#8220;The protagonist is shown as a crusader of women&#8217;s right,&#8221; senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for the distrbutors, said.</p>
<p>The lead actor is shown as an anti-social element, wielding swords and sickles, contrary to her real life persona, the counsel for Pal said, adding Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla &#8220;are on record&#8221; as saying that the film is based on Pal and her &#8216;Gulabi Gang&#8217;.<br />
&#8220;You can always seek damages,&#8221; the bench said and fixed the matter for further hearing on February 10.</p>
<p>The single judge had restrained the producers and their agents from &#8220;releasing, exhibiting, distributing and promoting&#8221; the film in India till the next date of hearing on May 8, saying &#8220;irreparable damage and injury&#8221; would be caused to Pal if it is released.</p>
<p>The single judge had noted that while the producers might suffer monetary loss, Pal will suffer both financial loss, as her copyright over Gulabi Gang has been used without her permission, as well as loss of reputation &#8220;which cannot be calculated in terms of money&#8221;.</p>
<p>Pal in her plea has claimed her permission was not sought prior to making of the film and had alleged it contains defamatory content which would adversely affect her reputation.</p>
<p>She has alleged that as per the film&#8217;s prommos, the lead actress playing her character was shown as an anti-social wielding swords and sickles, contrary to her real life persona.</p>
<p>While staying the release of the film &#8211; censored or uncensored&#8211;the court had rejected the argument of the producers that Pal should not be granted any relief as she came to the court at the last minute despite knowing about the making of the film since March 2013, saying it found no merit in the contention.</p>
<p>The producers&#8217; counsel had argued that the intention of Pal from the start was to derail the film&#8217;s release at the last moment as she took no action, till filing of the case, after sending a cease-and-desist notice in June 2013.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002633&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an innovative way of marketing his film, actor Ayushmann Khurrana will be singing and dancing on a road tomorrow in south Mumbai.</p>
<p>Khurrana, who will be seen in &#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217; opposite Sonam Kapoor, will be doing a gig for a flash mob at Nariman point outside a popular restaurant, sources said.</p>
<p>While planning the activity, the team decided to have it around this area as it was in synchronisation with the content of the film, they said.</p>
<p>In &#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217;, Ayushmann plays a person working in a corporate setup and someone who is removed from his job. Hence, the team thought to have the flash mob in a corporate area.<br />
The film, produced by YRF, is set to release on March 14.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002551&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gulaabgang.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1978921" alt="Gulaab Gang" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gulaabgang.jpg" /></a> Gulaab Gang features Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla.
<p>The Delhi High Court today agreed to hear the appeal of &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217; film producers who have challenged its order staying release of the movie which is claimed to be based on the life of activist Sampat Pal and her organisation Gulabi Gang.</p>
<p>A bench of Acting Chief Justice B D Ahmed and Justice S Mridul agreed to hear the plea during the day after it was mentioned before it by senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, appearing for the producers, Sahara One Media and Entertainment Ltd.</p>
<p>The court said it will hear the plea after the producers will file a compact disc of the lawsuit and other related documents before it. The court asked for the compact disc as it is a paperless electronic court (e-court).<br />
The producers approached the division bench challenging the order of the single-judge who yesterday stayed till May 8 the nationwide release of the Madhuri Dixit-Juhi Chawla starrer, which was slated to hit theatres tomorrow, on the plea of Pal claiming the film is based on her group Gulabi Gang, comprising women vigilantes in UP wearing pink sarees.</p>
<p>Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva had restrained the film&#8217;s producers and their agents from &#8220;releasing, exhibiting, distributing and promoting&#8221; the film in India till the next date of hearing on May 8, saying &#8220;irreparable damage and injury&#8221; would be caused to Pal if it is released.</p>
<p>The single judge had noted that while the producers might suffer monetary loss, Pal will suffer both financial loss, as her copyright over Gulabi Gang has been used without her permission, as well as loss of reputation &#8220;which cannot be calculated in terms of money&#8221;.</p>
<p>Pal in her plea has claimed that her permission was not sought prior to making of the film and had alleged that it contains defamatory content which would adversely affect her reputation.</p>
<p>She has alleged that as per the film&#8217;s promos, the lead actress playing her character was shown as an anti-social element, wielding swords and sickles, contrary to her real life persona.</p>
<p>While staying the release of the film &#8211; censored or uncensored, the court had rejected the argument of the producers that Pal should not be granted any relief as she came to the court at the last minute despite knowing about the making of the film since March 2013, saying it found no merit in the contention.</p>
<p>The producers&#8217; counsel had argued that the intention of Pal from the start was to derail the film&#8217;s release at the last moment as she took no action, till filing of the case, after sending a cease and desist notice back in June 2013.</p>
<p>He had also offered that a disclaimer can be run at the start of the film that the incidents depicted in it are not in any manner related to Pal, her life or her organisation.</p>
<p>The bench, however, had rejected the offer and said &#8220;simply saying so will not do&#8221;.</p>
<p>It had also questioned Pal as to why she moved the court at the &#8220;nth hour&#8221;.<br />
&#8220;You should have come a month back,&#8221; the court had said.</p>
<p>Her lawyers had also agreed that she moved the court very late, but contended that she can&#8217;t be punished for delay as release of the film could result in causing irreparable damage to her reputation.</p>
<p>The court had directed the film&#8217;s producers to immediately inform their distributors about the injunction on its release.</p>
<p>It had observed that while the release of the movie can be pushed back, &#8220;reputation once lost will not come back&#8221;.</p>
<p>Pal&#8217;s group is actively involved in fighting social injustices against women, at times, adopting unconventional means.</p>
<p>It was formed in 2006 by Pal in UP&#8217;s Banda district. This region is marked by a deeply patriarchal culture, rigid caste divisions, female illiteracy, domestic violence, child labour, child marriages and dowry demands.</p>
<p>It hit the spotlight by punishing oppressive husbands, fathers and brothers, coming to the aid of women being repeatedly subjected to domestic violence.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002511&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The exclusive first look of Priyanka Chopra&#8217;s look in her much awaited biopic on World Boxing champion Mary Kom is finally out.</p>
<p>The first look shows Priyanka Chopra in a boxing ring wearing her full boxing kit and all set for a bout.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mary4801.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2002489" alt="mary480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mary4801.jpg?w=480&#038;h=504" width="480" height="504" /></a></p>
<p>The first schedule of the film began towards the end of 2013 with debut director Omung Kumar.</p>
<p>Priyanka Chopra also made several trips to Mary Kom&#8217;s homeland Manipur to understand and get into her character better. Priyanka observed her life there closely and the struggles she faced.</p>
<p>Priyanka Chopra also missed out on her cousin Saurabh’s wedding celebrations in Delhi, for her &#8216;Mary Kom’.The former Miss World tweeted, “Missing mere brother Saurabh ki shaadi celebrations in delhi!The whole family is there!Grrr! Can’t wait to go.Full chopra style gaana shaana.”</p>
<p>After a few weeks of shooting, &#8216;Mary Kom&#8217; project remained uncertain. However, director Omung and producer Sanjay Leela Bhansali were sure of taking the project forward.</p>
<p>With the first look of the film going viral on social networking site, Priyanka Chopra looks all set to finish this schedule of &#8216;Mary Kom&#8217; before she moves on to Zoya Akhtar’s film.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002475&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kanganarevolverrani.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2002457" alt="Kanganaranaut" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kanganarevolverrani.jpg?w=450" /></a> &#8216;Revolver Rani&#8217; presents Kangana Ranaut in a look like never seen before.
<p>After making headlines for her peppy character Rani in her upcoming film &#8216;Queen&#8217;, Kangana Ranaut is all set for a bold, rustic and goon avatar in &#8216;Revolver Rani&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Revolver Rani&#8217; presents Kangana Ranaut in a look like never seen before. This time she comes as Alka Gujjar, the &#8216;Woman who will take the pants of mankind&#8217; almost literally.</p>
<p>The actress essays the role of a local goon who loves &#8216;phasion, phun aur gun&#8217; – Fashion, fun and guns. Kangana gets it right with the rustic accent and look which is yet again de-glam.</p>
<p>In a sequence in the trailer, Kangana dons a quasi Princess Leia look of the Star Wars series. Though she checks the costume box there but lets her hair be.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kanganaprincessleia.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-2002456" alt="kanganaprincessleia" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kanganaprincessleia.jpg?w=450&#038;h=266" width="450" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>The film also stars Vir Das as an aspiring actor who wants to make it big in Mumbai and seeks Kangana&#8217;s help for the same. The trailer&#8217;s snippets also suggest that Vir Das plays Kangana&#8217;s boy toy in the film!</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kanganavir.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-2002460" alt="kanganavir" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kanganavir.jpg?w=450&#038;h=266" width="450" height="266" /></a></p>
<p>The film also stars Piyush Mishra, Zakir Hussain and Pankaj Saraswat and is slated for release on 11th April.</p>
<p>The film is directed by Sai Kabir Shrivastav and is produced by Raju Chadha and Crouching Tiger Production.</p>

<p>&#8216;Vicky Donor&#8217; actress Yami Gautam has joined a list of celebrities who are endorsing an initiative to donate food towards the welfare of the underprivileged.</p>
<p>The stars are campaigning for the initiative &#8220;Food for the soul&#8221; launched by Food Panda with the NGO Uday Foundation, where people can log on to the portal and make monetary donations that amounts to a food item like foodgrains, pulses, vegetable oil, biscuits and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Living in our sheltered and cocooned worlds, it is often easy to forget that we lead a life of privilege. The Food for Soul campaign sensitises us towards the fact that there are many who are not even fortunate enough to get a basic square meal a day.</p>
<p>&#8220;This reminds us to share the joy we feel on eating great food with the less privileged. I am glad to partner with this campaign and join in spreading the cheer that only food can bring into our lives&#8221; she said in a video message.</p>
<p>TV actresses Ishita Sharma and Kritika Kamra are the other stars who are endorsing the initiative.<br />
FoodPanda, that has been online since May 2012, plans to extend the campaign in the coming months by tying up with NGOs in other cities as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are millions of underprivileged children in India who struggle for every meal, every day. Through this initiative, we aim at touching some of these lives by providing them with food and healthcare,&#8221; said Rohit Chadda, MD Founder Foodpanda.in.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002424&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/randeep480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002421" alt="Randeep Hoods plays a kidnapper in 'Highway'." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/randeep480.jpg" /></a> Randeep Hoods plays a kidnapper in &#8216;Highway&#8217;.
<p>After the success of his latest film &#8216;Highway&#8217; where he played the role of a kidnapper, actor Randeep Hooda wants to take a break from doing dark roles as he feels they affect his mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to the roles I play people think I&#8217;m too serious and cranky. (Doing such roles) is very hard on you as one has to go through those emotions. It affects your life as well as the people around you,&#8221; Randeep told PTI.<br />
&#8220;I want to try other genres as well. I want to make people laugh. &#8216;Highway&#8217; was my first attempt towards a bit of a comic role,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old actor, who has made a name for himself by starring in films like &#8216;Risk&#8217;,'D&#8217;, &#8216;Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai&#8217; and &#8216;Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Imtiaz Ali film that saw Randeep play a kidnapper who develops empathy for the girl he has kidnapped earned the actor praise for his performance.</p>
<p>Randeep reveals that there was a time during the shooting of the film that he became depressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a little hard role and I was quite depressed. Co-star Alia Bhatt had to make me smile after I did not talk to her for 35 days. She helped me in cheering up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such things happen with roles. Whenever I see the movie, I get a little depressed,&#8221; he added.<br />
Post &#8216;Highyway&#8217;, Randeep has been busy filming for various upcoming releases. He would be next seen in &#8216;Main Aur Charles&#8217;, where he plays serial killer Charles Sobhraj.</p>
<p>&#8220;After winding up &#8216;Highway&#8217;, I have been shooting &#8216;Kick&#8217;. &#8216;Shooter&#8217; is about to complete, and &#8216;Ungli&#8217; releases in May,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Filming for Salman Khan starrer &#8216;Kick&#8217; has been a joy ride for the actor. The movie which is directed by Sajid Nadiadwala also has Jacqueline Fernandez in the lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doing &#8216;Kick&#8217; was quite enjoyable. Salman is a nice person and we have a very good director. It is probably the biggest role I have so far. I&#8217;m not playing a villain. It is a love triangle,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For Randeep &#8216;Kick&#8217; is a chance of a lifetime as he got to share the screen space with a superstar. Although the actor had no nervousness about working with Salman.</p>
<p>&#8220;No I wasn&#8217;t nervous. Salman is a very nice person. No doubt he is a superstar. He is a great human being. &#8216;Kick&#8217; is the biggest movie of my career. It&#8217;s a huge canvas. If you got a integral part to play in a Salman Khan movie, that&#8217;s what an actor dreams of,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002419&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/varundhawan.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2002403" alt="Varun" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/varundhawan.jpg?w=450" /></a> One film old and Bollywood newbie Varun Dhawan is already throwing tantrums on the film sets.
<p>One film old and Bollywood newbie Varun Dhawan is already throwing tantrums on the film sets.</p>
<p>The actor, who plays a chirpy collage student &#8216;Seenu&#8217; in the film, was seen throwing tantrum at his stylist for the film. In the video you can hear Varun say, “I have given a big hit&#8230; People are crazy about me.”</p>
<p>Even as the stylist desperately tried to convince Varun Dhawan giving him options, the actor waved her off saying, “These do not suit my personality as the &#8216;hero&#8217; of the film.”</p>
<p>The video ends at a hilarious note where the stylist throws a set of clothes and threatens to change immediately and a bamboozled Varun quits the tantrums and obeys the stylist!</p>
<p>The video shared by Varun Dhawan on Twitter is just an extension of his onscreen character Seenu and don&#8217;t we just love him for that!</p>
<p>The film also starring Nargis Fakhri and Illeana D&#8217;Cruz is directed by Varun&#8217;s father and king of comedy films David Dhawan. &#8216;Main Tera Hero&#8217; is the remake of Telugu movie &#8216;Kandireega&#8217; and is slated to release on April 4.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/total-siyapaa480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002384" alt="'Total Siyappa's' co-producer Neeraj Pandey will proceed to Pakistan for the twin premieres in Karachi and Lahore." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/total-siyapaa480.jpg" /></a> &#8216;Total Siyappa&#8217;s&#8217; co-producer Neeraj Pandey will proceed to Pakistan for the twin premieres in Karachi and Lahore.
<p>The uncertainty surrounding the exhibition of all Bollywood films in Pakistan had also put a question mark on the ambitious plans to host a premiere of E. Niwas&#8217; Indo-Pak love story &#8216;Total Siyappa&#8217; in Pakistan.</p>
<p>But now the decks have been cleared for a twin city Pakistan premiere, in Karachi and Lahore on Thursday and Friday, respectively.</p>
<p>While the film&#8217;s co-producer Neeraj Pandey will attend both the premieres with the film&#8217;s Pakistani leading man Ali Zafar, the leading lady Yami Gautam and the film&#8217;s director E Niwas have decided to stay away from the Pakistani premiere.</p>
<p>Niwas and Yami will attend the Dubai premiere on Wednesday and return to Mumbai. The film co-producer Neeraj Pandey will proceed to Pakistan for the twin premieres in Karachi and Lahore.</p>
<p>E Niwas says he decided to return from Dubai to Mumbai for practical reasons. &#8220;Neeraj has gone to Pakistan with Ali. Yami and I decided to be here for the release. There was so much uncertainty about the Pakistan premiere. This is the best we could do.&#8221;</p>
<p>However a friend of Niwas says, &#8220;There was no question of taking Yami to Pakistan. As for E Niwas, he got married in 2008. He has a wife and two small children. He didn&#8217;t want to take a risk.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002375&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>After playing the quintessential chocolate boy in most of his films, Pakistani actor Ali Zafar will be seen doing a serious role in Shaad Ali&#8217;s upcoming film &#8216;Kill Dil&#8217;.</p>
<p>Ali will be seen in a rustic and rugged avatar where he will play the role of a typical Kanpuriya and has already started prepping to get the perfect dialect for his character. Not revealing the details about the nature of his role, Zafar maintained that his role in &#8216;Kill Dil&#8217; will be different from the roles he has done by far and it is in a totally different space.</p>
<p>Produced under the Yash Raj banner, &#8216;Kill Dil&#8217; also stars Ranveer Singh, Parineeti Chopra, Govinda and is slated to release on September 5, 2014.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002367&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Songstress Miley Cyrus was caught using a teleprompter displaying the lyrics of her own tracks when she brought her Bangerz tour to Las Vegas over the weekend. Cyrus, 21, is currently on her ongoing 60-date tour which opened in February, reported Ace Showbiz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was at Miley&#8217;s Vegas concert and took these pictures because I couldn&#8217;t believe she needed a teleprompter with lyrics to all of her songs throughout the entire concert. And it&#8217;s not like they were just there for nothing &#8211; I caught her looking at them more than a few times! The show was entertaining, but she didn&#8217;t sound great,&#8221; a disappointed fan said.</p>
<p>Using teleprompter is just one of many surprising things that the controversial starlet has done at her shows. Previously, she made controversies after kissing a random fan and Katy Perry as well as smoking marijuana and simulating intimate act onstage.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002357&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Musician John Mayer thinks his ex-girlfriend Katy Perry is extremely driven about her career. The &#8216;Who You Love&#8217; hitmaker, who split from the singer last month, also praised her work ethic, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a connection to the past, a reaction to fear of the unknown. They go back with a guy they don&#8217;t like just because they know how to get to his bathroom in the dark,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old star, who had an on-and-off relationship with Perry from 2012, went on to gush about the &#8216;Dark Horse&#8217;<br />
singer, who is in Sydney, Australia promoting her upcoming Prismatic world tour. &#8221;She&#8217;s extremely driven and extremely serious about doing great work,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Perry, 29, was preciously marriage to Russell Brand and ended the wedlock after 14 months.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002349&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yami480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002352" alt=" Yami would be seen in a realistic set up." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yami480.jpg" /></a> Yami would be seen in a realistic set up.
<p>Close to two years after her Bollywood debut Vicky Donor, pretty woman Yami Gautam is returning to the Hindi film scene with Total Siyapaa. With this yet another slice of life entertainer, Yami would be seen in a realistic set up all over again, which has been created by producer Neeraj Pandey and director E. Niwas.</p>
<p>Looks like Total Siyapaa is a smile through affair, isn&#8217;t it?<br />
Absolutely. Apart from just laughter, what sets the film apart is that it is coming from sensible makers such as E. Niwas and Neeraj Pandey. You are assured that it is going to be something which is very meaningful and you take something away with yourself as you leave theatre. There is nothing preachy about the film though and it is a very funny in a non-caricaturist way. The very concept of a Pakistani boy being introduced to a Hindu Punjabi family as a prospective groom brings in endless possibilities. Due to this, madness happens and what follows next is presented in a very tasteful way.</p>
<p>There are chances of the whole concept turning a little sensitive though. How has that been taken care of?<br />
There isn&#8217;t anything offensive in there and all that Total Siyapaa does is entertain you. The biggest factor going in its favor is that it is a very light hearted film, just as was the case with Vicky Donor. The entire setup and characters are quite lively here. I am very happy that I debuted with someone like Shoojit (Sircar) sir and now for my second film I am working with Neeraj Pandey. These are not frivolous filmmakers.</p>
<p>How has the transition been from Vicky Donor to Total Siyapaa?<br />
See, I am not a trained actor who went to a training school or always wanted to be an actor. Whatever I have learnt is on the sets. For me, my learning ground has been with the people that I have worked with, especially my directors. Of course, I found the concept of Total Siyapaa very catchy and interesting. Moreover, with the kind of people who were backing it, I saw just no reason for saying &#8216;No&#8217; to it. It is very interesting in the way it has been written. The script is absolutely flawless and the way E. Niwas has interpreted it, I am very happy with the resulted.</p>
<p>Had you seen the original Only Human though?<br />
Yes, of course. I think it is important to see the movie when it&#8217;s an adaptation as it gives you a very clear insight as to what it is all about. It isn&#8217;t as if I will see the movie then I will act like the actress in there. After all, everyone bring his or her own individuality into play. Still, watching a film only helps you to understand the script better. In fact I watched Only Human with my mother without telling her that I had been approached for it. She really enjoyed the movie and then I told her that I had been offered a part in the Hindi adaptation. As a matter of fact my mom and dad had also loved Vicky Donor at the script level.</p>
<p>There are too many characters in Total Siyapaa. Was it tough to make your presence felt?<br />
No, because the character is very well defined. Also, from the promo you can figure out that all the characters are very important. What matters is that when people watch your film, they should enjoy what every character brings on the table. As for me, I approached the role by first understanding what the director wanted from me. I had to adapt to the requirements of my character. Every film teaches you something different and you have to be flexible enough to adapt to it.</p>
<p>All eyes are now on whether you would be delivering well in your second outing too.<br />
Higher expectations are always good as they work for your betterment. I do not want to sound immodest but when both critics and audience appreciate your work, there can be nothing more humble. To gain appreciation as an actor and hear people say that you can really act is a very rare combo. I absolutely cherish and relish it, more so as I didn&#8217;t have a very conventional debut. I hope the trend continues.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002350&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bollywood superstar Salman has always been known as the ladies man. According to reports, Salman Khan now will be spotted with not one, not two, but sixty girls!</p>
<p>In a special promotional song for his brother-in-law Atul Agnihotri&#8217;s upcoming film &#8216;O Teri&#8217; Salman Khan will be seen shaking a leg with sixty girls.</p>
<p>The reports further suggest that Salman Khan will have five costume changes that have been designed by his sister Alvira Khan and Ashley Lobo.</p>
<p>Atul Agnihotri said, &#8220;It&#8217;s the title track that&#8217;s being picturised on Salman Khan, Pulkit Samrat and Bilal. We have got a mix group of dancers. While we have chosen one group from &#8216;India&#8217;s Got Talent&#8217;, the others are from abroad.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002308&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aliabhatt.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2002298" alt="Alia Bhatt" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aliabhatt.jpg?w=450" /></a> Exhaustion of the past few weeks have finally caught up with Alia Bhatt.
<p>It seems the excitement and exhaustion of the past few weeks have finally caught up with Bollywood actress Alia Bhatt. This weekend, the petite but ostensibly tireless scene-stealer was laid up with an exhaustion-induced fever.</p>
<p>A friend of the actress said, &#8220;Shooting &#8216;Highway&#8217; was emotionally and physically grueling. Alia has been promoting &#8216;Highway&#8217; extensively all over the country. Even before the film was released, she was already promoting her next film &#8217;2 States&#8217;. And that wasn&#8217;t all. She was also shooting nights for Shashank Khaitan&#8217;s &#8216;Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhaniya&#8217; and simultaneously dubbing for &#8217;2 States&#8217;. All of this multi-activity proved too much for 20-year old girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to reports, Alia Bhatt is now recovering from nervous exhaustion. &#8220;She has been advised to rest it out. She&#8217;s a livewire and cannot rest easy. You won&#8217;t find Alia in the same place for more than five minutes. But for now, she&#8217;s taking it easy,&#8221; says the friend.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002297&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pop star Shakira&#8217;s son has taught her to simplify.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old singer, who has 15-month-old Milan with partner Gerard Pique, said the little boy&#8217;s need for her attention means she has had to be more focused in her work so that she has more free time to be with him, reported<br />
Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well I think he&#8217;s taught me, in general, he&#8217;s taught me how to simplify because he requires me most of the time. So I<br />
have to kind of learn how to be a little more direct with my own work, with the way I tackle my work,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Shakira said she and Pique are so similar. &#8221;We&#8217;re very much alike. We&#8217;re so similar. Our personalities are so similar we don&#8217;t understand how we get along so well, being so similar. We&#8217;re so compatible. We want the same things, we like the same things, we hate the same things. We&#8217;re so passionate the same way, we need passion the same way.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002202&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;Cate was spotted leaving the tattoo parlour with a black bandage around her wrist,&#8221; a source said. It is still unclear what design Blanchett went for, with a staff member at the Shamrock declining to comment on their A-lister visitor&#8217;s inking.</p>

<p>Actor Ashton Kutcher feels having too many flings is gross.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Two and a Half Men&#8217; star, who is believed to have recently got engaged to his former &#8216;That 70s Show&#8217; co-star Mila Kunis, said eventually single life gets tiring, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a single guy can be a lot of fun&#8230; When you&#8217;re financially independent (and) can do whatever you want, whenever you want&#8230; For every girl you have a good time with for one night, if you want to stay single, that&#8217;s the same girl that you have to not call back. After a while, being the one-night-stand guy is also just a little gross,&#8221; he said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/highway.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2002071" alt="Highway" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/highway.jpg?w=450" /></a> Producer Sajid Nadiadwala is elated with the response that Alia Bhatt-Randeep Hooda starrer &#8216;Highway&#8217;.
<p>Producer Sajid Nadiadwala is elated with the response that Alia Bhatt-Randeep Hooda starrer &#8216;Highway&#8217; has garnered and says that the film was always meant to be profitable.</p>
<p>The movie, directed by Imtiaz Ali, got a slow start compared to his earlier projects, but gradually gelled well with the audience.</p>
<p>&#8216;Highway&#8217; was made at a cost of Rs 18.25 crore (including P&amp;A). The movie has already clocked more than Rs 27 crore at the Indian box office and the international theatrical collection is more than Rs 8 crore.</p>
<p>The film had made Rs 15.5 crore revenue even before release, making the total revenue pie more than Rs 50 crore.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was both an honour and a challenge when Imtiaz entrusted me with the release of &#8216;Highway&#8217;. We worked with our distribution partners at UTV to give the film appropriate release across 800 screens with carefully selected cities and cinemas across the country,&#8221; Sajid said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was always a profitable film. What was heartwarming was the way the audiences warmed up to the movie. We not just made a super hit film but a much loved one which will be seen and remembered with much fondness for years to come,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The film which released on February 21 is still running successfully across theatres.</p>
<p>Echoing similar sentiments, Imtiaz said, &#8220;I am happy that the film has reached the audience. We are moved by the response and are very thankful.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002070&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sonamkapoor2.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2002064" alt="Sonam Kapoor" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sonamkapoor2.jpg?w=450" /></a> Sonam Kapoor is playing an aspiring politician in the film based on Anuja Chauhan&#8217;s book &#8216;Battle for Bittora&#8217;.
<p>Actress Sonam Kapoor, who is playing an aspiring politician in her upcoming film based on Anuja Chauhan&#8217;s book &#8216;Battle for Bittora&#8217;, says it has an interesting love story.</p>
<p>The yet-to-be-titled film is an adaptation of the love story between two upcoming politicians who despite being in love are contesting elections against each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am doing a film where I am playing an aspiring politician. It is based on Anuja&#8217;s book. We read that book and we bought the rights. It has an interesting love story. I am very excited about it,&#8221; Sonam, 28, told PTI in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the scripting is done and it depends on how the director portrays things. I like to prepare for my role in advance and I will do workshops for this film as well. I do little work but I do the best of my ability,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>According to grapevine, the makers are considering Imran Khan, Aditya Roy Kapur and Sidharth Malhotra to play the male lead opposite Sonam.</p>
<p>This film is likely to go on the floors in September-October this year. Besides, Sonam is happy to share screen space with superstar Salman Khan in Sooraj Barjatya&#8217;s next film.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am doing that film&#8230; I am very very excited about it. It is for the second time I will be working with him. I am looking forward to work with Soorajji. The film will show me in a different light&#8230; I cannot reveal anything about my role,&#8221; Sonam said.</p>
<p>2013 was an amazing year for Sonam with two of her films – Aanand Rai&#8217;s &#8216;Raanjhanaa&#8217; and Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra&#8217;s &#8216;Bhaag Milkha Bhaag&#8217;&#8211; winning popular and critical acclaim.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year is pretty interesting for me. There are three different films &#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217;, &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217; and &#8216;Khubsurat&#8217;. I have finished filming for &#8216;Khubsurat&#8217; and I will start working on &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217;. I like to play different roles. I hope this year too turns out to be great,&#8221; Sonam said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002060&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Delhi High Court today stayed the nationwide release on Friday of Hindi film Gulaab Gang, starring Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla, on the plea of activist Sampat Pal who claimed that the film has been inspired by her group Gulaabi gang.</p>
<p>Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva restrained the film&#8217;s producers, Sahara One Media Entertainment Ltd, and their agents from &#8220;releasing, exhibiting, distributing and promoting&#8221; the film till the next date of hearing on May 8.</p>
<p>The court was of the prima facie view that &#8220;irreparable damage and injury&#8221; would be caused to Pal if the movie is released.</p>
<p>It noted in its order that while the loss to the producers would be monetary, she will suffer both financial loss, as her copyright over Gulaabi gang has been used without her permission, and loss of reputation &#8220;which cannot be calculated in terms of money&#8221;.</p>
<p>Pal in her plea has claimed that her permission was not sought prior to making of the film and had alleged that it contains defamatory content which would adversely affect her reputation.</p>
<p>Pal was present in court, dressed in a pink saree, which has come to symbolise her group.</p>
<p>Her group is actively involved in fighting social injustices against women, at times, adopting unconventional means.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001630&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rensil480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001608" alt="Rensil is now on the cusp of releasing his debut novel Kohinoor Express." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rensil480.jpg" /></a> Rensil is now on the cusp of releasing his debut novel Kohinoor Express.
<p>Director and screenplay writer has joined the list of Indian authors to sign up Leading publication house Westland Ltd.</p>
<p>Rensil, who&#8217;s now on the cusp of releasing his debut novel Kohinoor Express, to be published by Westland Ltd, has previously directed ‘Kurbaan’, the screenplay of which was written by D&#8217;Silva himself and was nominated for several Indian awards and has also written the screenplay for nationally acclaimed Bollywood film ‘Rang De Basanti’.</p>
<p>Kohinoor Express is a historical thriller set in the 1800’s. It follows the trail of the Kohinoor after it was taken from Ranjit Singh by the British (after the last Sikh War), and handed over to Queen Victoria. The novel charts the story of that epic journey.</p>
<p>Talking about his book, Rensil says, “The novel was born out of my fascination for the Kohinoor and my decade long research into the history of the diamond. I have repeatedly visited the Tower Of London, just to gaze at it. And have spent many hours delving into its past. While I have in the last ten years written and directed many stories for the movies, advertising and television, few stories have excited me as much as this has.”</p>
<p>Other authors to have been singed up by Westland Ltd include, Amish Tripathi (Shiva Trilogy), Ashok Banker (Mahabharata Series), Ashwin Sanghi (Krishna Key) and Rashmi Bansal (Follow Every Rainbow).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001602&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pritam480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001574" alt="Pritam: I agree that music does contribute sizably to a film's opening and eventual business, but again, music is not everything. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pritam480.jpg" /></a> Pritam: I agree that music does contribute sizably to a film&#8217;s opening and eventual business, but again, music is not everything. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)
<p>Over a decade ago, a then-leading composer wryly stated that had he been working abroad, there would be islands among his assets because of the number of hit soundtracks he had given. By that yardstick, Pritam would probably have purchased a small country!</p>
<p>The indefatigable hit-spinner for 11 years now, Pritam has also added huge sums to the coffers of his films&#8217; business as well as the music labels. In short, in an era when we can quantify sums, from 2011 until today, Pritam has scored music for films that have made over 1500 crore, which is over one-fourth of the total theatrical business done by Hindi cinema in that phase!</p>
<p>Space here permits only his biggest musical hits to be mentioned &#8211; Dhoom (2004), Gangster (2006), Life In A&#8230;Metro, Jab We Met and Bhool Bhulaiya (2007), Race, Singh Is King and Kismat Konnection (2008), Tum Mile, Love Aaj Kal and Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009) and Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai and Action Replay (2010).</p>
<p>After the 100 crore &#8216;grosser&#8217; became the new benchmark, Pritam has spun out Ready (2011), Barfi! (2012), Race 2, R&#8230;Rajkumar, and Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (2013) and the 300 crore Dhoom:3. And now, with Shaadi Ke Side/Effects, Pritam has another musical winner coming up.</p>
<p><strong>Last year was very good for you, proving yet again how bang-on you were, come your big b-o. hits, or Phata Poster Nikhla Hero or Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai Dobaara. But why are you still not content with some of your music?</strong><br />
That is something for which I cannot really blame any filmmaker! When I compose a basic melody and start working on its final graph, a certain mental &#8216;vision&#8217; of the finished final song, so to speak, is there in my head. And that keeps evolving as I reflect upon it. In many cases, after the song has been shot, which means that the filmmakers and everyone else are very happy with it, I like to work even more on the song that will be heard on the film&#8217;s audio. I am constantly scrutinizing my own work and trying to reach that final concept I have in my head!</p>
<p>So, when this is not fully possible because of natural things like deadlines, I feel dissatisfied. I don&#8217;t change the composition, but work only on the orchestration and production. And while I know that this is a personal preoccupation, and it is the intrinsic power of the song that actually makes it a hit, I have also found that most of my massive hits have been those in which all levels are satisfied, including my expectations, the film&#8217;s execution and the way the song is filmed!</p>
<p>In the process, of course, I am probably losing a lot &#8211; I lose money in working even more on the song, I probably spend the kind of time that can make me do one more song or one more film, and I also lose out on family time too! But that&#8217;s how I am made!</p>
<p><strong>How many filmmakers give you that luxury in this world of fast music and work?</strong><br />
Anurag Basu, Ayan Mukerji and Dinesh Vijan are three of the people who I love working with, because when a director or creative producer is like-minded, music becomes a collaborative effort. Nothing but the best will do for them, and that&#8217;s when the vibe is superb and work becomes enjoyable!</p>
<p>As a composer, I need that back-up, that support and that fuel for my energy. There is so much of idea exchange as they love and respect my integrity and passion. We even have fights that are for the better, in terms of results. We all know that whatever we are doing is for the good of the song and the film.</p>
<p>Of course, there are those few extreme cases where the filmmakers leave everything to me &#8211; and that too gives good results! (Smiles)</p>
<p><strong>What about the break from work that you are supposed to be taking now?</strong><br />
I hope that I can really take a break to spend time with my family and by myself. I have finished work on Holiday with A.R. Murugadoss and have just one song left to do in Kabir Khan&#8217;s Phantom. Anurag&#8217;s Jagga Jasoos will be my next film. Though I have not been signing any new films now, I am too much of a workaholic to stay away for long from work. I can&#8217;t live without it!</p>
<p><strong>Your assistant tells me that every second film that matters is or was first offered to you, like Hasee To Phasee.</strong><br />
I think that with my approach to work and the way films and songs are made today, I can do only a maximum of four to six films a year. Actually, there is need for every composer to be busy with that much work &#8211; it will be great if all of them have good projects and do great music! Yes, when Hasee&#8230; came to me, I had too much work on hand.</p>
<p><strong>You composed three songs for Yaariyan and were yet termed a &#8220;guest composer&#8221;, when some others scored just one track in the film!</strong><br />
That was done at my request. I was to do the entire film earlier, but as it happened, I could not get the time needed to work on all the songs, and Bhushan (Kumar)-ji asked me if he could take them from others.</p>
<p><strong>While probably contributing a &#8216;guesstimated&#8217; 150 crore business to your four to five 2013 releases from your music that gave the films huge initials as well as sustaining power, you have also shown your versatility and have suddenly become a favourite for awards as well. What are your views on all these aspects?</strong><br />
I agree that music does contribute sizably to a film&#8217;s opening and eventual business, but again, music is not everything. The director is really the most important. As for versatility, it is funny that people have woken up to the variety in my songs only now. Yes, Race 2, Yeh Jawaani&#8230;, Phata Poster&#8230;, Dhoom 3 and R&#8230;Rajkumar all released in a single year, but I have been true to my films throughout. In 2007, Life In A&#8230;Metro was all rock, Jab We Met had a Punjabi flavour and Bhool Bhulaiya had a different flavour as well as a Bengali song.</p>
<p>As for awards, I am cool about them. But I neither work for awards nor feel that they are more important than my music being loved instantly by the maximum people and still remembered years later.</p>
<p><strong>We have talked about this before, but what happens when some really good song or music fails to get its due? We would like to ask this question afresh as you are now a veteran of over 100 films.</strong><br />
I think that over the years, I have come to realize that a good song or score eventually resurfaces at some point. Today, people do know of my songs in, say, an Ek Khiladi Ek Haseena or an Ankahee.</p>
<p><strong>You have just delivered solid punches with your first entry, so to speak, into the domain of Karan Johar (Yeh Jawaani&#8230;), Prabhudheva (R&#8230;Rajkumar), Aamir Khan (Dhoom 3) and Farhan Akhtar (Shaadi Ke Side / Effects). Were you especially charged about proving something in these cases as they had never worked with you before?</strong><br />
No, I don&#8217;t think that way. I composed what the films needed, whether it was the fully desi score of R&#8230;Rajkumar, for which Prabhu Dheva insisted that I do not put it anything Western, or what Rongita Nandy and Saket Choudhary wanted in Shaadi Ke Side/ Effects. I did not think that I have given Farhan anything so hatke to sing in &#8216;Yahaan Wahaan&#8217;, but he has raved about singing that song.</p>
<p>He stated that you have made him sing an essentially Indian kind of song, which is a first for him.<br />
(Smiles) He did a good job, and the film needed that kind of a song.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001569&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/simi.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2001505" alt="Simi" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/simi.jpg?w=450" /></a> Simi Garewal says she wants to act in films but feels she is a difficult person to cast.
<p>Veteran actress Simi Garewal says she wants to act in films but feels she is a difficult person to cast.</p>
<p>Simi, who gave memorable performances in films like &#8216;Do Badan&#8217;, &#8216;Karz&#8217;, &#8216;Siddhartha&#8217;, &#8216;Mera Naam Joker&#8217; and others, would love to come back on the silver screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a difficult person to cast. I don&#8217;t know what roles filmmakers will be able to offer me. I would love to act in films again&#8230; acting is my first love. I have been getting offers but nothing tempting or attractive to captivate me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Simi says there have been lot of changes in the way things function today in the film industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are tremendous changes that have come in the film industry like technology wise, story telling, diverse films are made today, our films match international standards, there are roles and subjects for everyone, change in background score and music. I am enjoying watching films,&#8221; she said last night during a press conference of Indian Film Festival of Melbourne awards.</p>
<p>Simi, who is on the jury of Indian Film Festival of Melbourne, is all praise for the festival ambassador Vidya Balan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think she was wonderful in &#8216;The Dirty Picture&#8217;&#8230;not many actors would have been able to do this film. She can do diverse films like &#8216;The Dirty Picture&#8217;, &#8216;Kahaani&#8217; etc,&#8221; the actress said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001502&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pop star Shakira says she would love to have &#8220;eight or nine&#8221; kids with her partner Gerard Pique, but her plans to have a second child are on hold for the time being.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old blonde beauty already has a 15-month-old son Milan with Gerard, who is Spanish football player, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it weren&#8217;t because of my music projects, I would be pregnant already. I would love to have eight or nine kids with Gerard&#8211;my own soccer team,&#8221; Shakira said.</p>
<p>However, despite the singer&#8217;s busy schedule, she insists her son Milan will always be on the top of her priority list.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since he arrived I don&#8217;t have much time&#8211;I have to rush back home&#8211;so he has helped me learn how to focus,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have a baby, when you feel his love, you feel so at peace with the world. You just want to share the good news and share how happy you feel,&#8221; she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001484&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cate Blanchett, who won the best actress award at the Oscars for &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217;, almost missed her big moment as she was drinking at the bar with fellow nominee Julia Roberts.</p>
<p>Blanchett revealed that she lost a track of time while chatting to &#8216;Pretty Woman&#8217; star, reported Daily Express.</p>
<p>Blanchett said, &#8220;the blessing and the curse of this (best Actress award) is it happens at the&#8230; end of the eveningand so you watch so many other extraordinary people get up there and you lose track of the fact that you&#8217;re even nominated.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then you get taken by surprise, &#8216;It&#8217;s my turn&#8217;, and I was with Julia Roberts in the bar for rather too long and just got back to my seat in time.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001479&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hughjackman.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2001474" alt="Hugh Jackman" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hughjackman.jpg?w=450" /></a> Huge Jackman says he is well aware that at some point in future someone else would take his place.
<p>Actor Huge Jackman says he is well aware that at some point in future someone else would take his place as Wolverine in the &#8216;X Men&#8217; series as it is &#8220;inevitable&#8221; to be in showbiz forever.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old Hollywood heartthrob, who has played the hit character in the previous &#8216;X-Men&#8217; films, will be next seen as the clawed mutant in &#8216;X-Men: Days of Future Past&#8217;, reported Ace Showbiz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure they (producers) had the discussion. They didn&#8217;t mention it to me, obviously! Look, that&#8217;s inevitable, man. Anyone who thinks they&#8217;re indispensable in this business is fooling themselves,&#8221; Jackman said.</p>
<p>The Australian actor is blessed to have starred as the powerful mutant.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I feel unbelievably blessed to have this part. I never thought in a million years I&#8217;d get to play him seven times. Every day I walk on the set with the claws and the hair, I thank my lucky stars. I don&#8217;t take any of it for granted,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m still here. I&#8217;m sure by the way, that it won&#8217;t always be my decision to always be here. At some point, someone will close the door on me,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001473&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Actor Jared Leto, who scored the best supporting actor Oscar for &#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217;, says his shiny golden statuette is partially damaged.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old actor bagged the Oscar at the 86th Academy Award held on March 2, reported Ace Showbiz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was letting some of the people that I work with take a picture with the Oscar and I was carrying it down the stairs and, boom, I hit it against the stairs, and the railing,&#8221; Leto said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I put a little nick in the back of it&#8230; so you know, that&#8217;s how it goes. It&#8217;s already lived in, as they say,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The actor said the trophy is now lying in his kitchen. &#8220;The Oscar is sitting in my kitchen, guarded by some vegan butter and a bag of popcorn!. You know, they kind of end up in the kitchen because that&#8217;s the first place that I go when I get home,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You put your keys down and you take off your jacket&#8230; and you put your Oscar in the kitchen,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001469&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shaadi480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001428" alt="'Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ tells the tale of a young urban couple and how they deal with married life and having children." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shaadi480.jpg" /></a> &#8216;Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ tells the tale of a young urban couple and how they deal with married life and having children.
<p>Farhan Akhtar and Vidya Balan starrer, ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ opened to a slow start but seems to have picked up over the weekend.</p>
<p>Trade analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted the film’s numbers, “#ShaadiKeSideEffects Fri 5.70 cr, Sat 7.55 cr, Sun 8.01 cr. Total: Rs. 21.26 cr nett. India biz only. Very good growth over weekend!,” posted Adarsh.</p>
<p>The film seems to have done well overseas, “#ShaadiKeSideEffects has grossed higher figures than #BhaagMilkhaBhaag in UK, UAE-GCC and Australia. Higher screen average in USA-Canada,” tweeted Taran.</p>
<p>Co-produced by Balaji Motion Pictures and Pritish Nandy Communications, ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ tells the tale of a young urban couple and how they deal with married life and having children, while still keeping the romance alive. Directed by Saket Choudhary, the film is a sequel to ‘Pyaar Ke Side Effects’.</p>
<p>Shubra Gupta of Indian Express, wrote, “&#8217;Shaadi Ke Side Effects&#8217; begins with a bang, pun completely intended, and we are taken in by Sid and Trisha’s life, so close to what we may have lived through. Or are wading through, as double income-no-kids turns into single income-cranky wife-desperate husband-demanding baby.”</p>
<p>She further added, ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ is fun, and real, and has some nice laugh-out-loud situations which the leads make the most of.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001320&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aamir480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001315" alt="Villagers of  " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aamir480.jpg" /></a> Villagers of Gehlaur village of Bihar say that Aamir Kahn visited their village on February 25. (Photo: Varinder Chawla) 
<p>An uproar of protest has broken out in the Gehlaur village of Bihar where once lived the legendary &#8216;Mountain Man&#8217; Dashrath Manjhi who hand-chiseled a road through a rocky mountain to connect his inaccessible village to the nearest town.</p>
<p>Manjhi&#8217;s family and the villagers claim that they were given the impression that the second season of Aamir Khan&#8217;s serial on social reform &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217; would kick-start with an episode in the mythical Mountain Man, Manjhi.</p>
<p>Says a villager, &#8220;Aamir Khan visited us on February 25 and told us that the first episode of his serial was dedicated to Dashrath Manjhi. We were all glued to the television in the community hall in our village at 10 am. We were sorely disappointed when the episode aired was about something else. Why did he visit us with the promise that the episode would be about our village hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>When confronted by the villagers&#8217; protests, Uday Shankar, the CEO Of Star India says, &#8220;There was never any plan of an episode on Dashrath Manjhi this season. We ended Season 1 of &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217; with an episode on Manjhi. And before we commenced the new season felt it would be a good idea to pay a tribute to his memory and the triumph of the human spirit that he signifies. Hence Aamir&#8217;s trip to Gelhaur.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Dashrath Manjhi&#8217;s fellow-villagers have more reason to feel disappointed. The film on Manjhi&#8217;s life &#8216;Mountain Man&#8217; directed by Ketan Mehta, lies unsold and unreleased many months after completion, with no indication or hope of a release in the near future.</p>
<p>Mehta it might be recalled, had wangled the privilege of shooting a film on Dashrath Manjhi&#8217;s inspirational tale from two other filmmakers, Neeraj Pathak and Manish Jha after fighting arduous legal battles with Pathak and with Manjhi&#8217;s family members.</p>
<p>With much fanfare the very talented Nawazuddin Siddiqui was signed to play Manjhi. The actor spent months in Manjhi&#8217;s native village in Gaya living out Manjhi&#8217;s heroic endeavour.</p>
<p>When asked about the status of &#8216;Mountain Man&#8217;, Nawaz said, &#8220;I am not sure about what is happening with the film. We&#8217;ve completed the shooting. You will have to have ask Ketan Mehta when the film is releasing.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Ketan Mehta refused to respond to the release query, he did laud Aamir Khan for visiting Dashrath Manjhi&#8217;s family. Mehta and Khan had parted under unamicable circumstances after the troubled shooting of &#8216;Mangal Pandey&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Mountain Man&#8217; is Mehta&#8217;s fourth bio-pic after &#8216;Sardar&#8217; (based on the life and politics of Sardar Patel with Paresh Rawal in the title role), &#8216;Mangal Pandey: The Rising&#8217; (about the soldier behind the Indian Mutiny of 1857) and &#8216;Rang Rasiya&#8217; (chronicling the life and love of the pioneer of calendar-art Raja Ravi Varma).</p>
<p>&#8216;Rang Rasiya&#8217; remains unreleased.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001309&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sonam480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001306" alt="Sources say the idea is to make 'Dolly Ki Doli' as a fun comedy-cum-drama instead of thrusting it into a serious biopic zone." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sonam480.jpg" /></a> Sources say the idea is to make &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217; as a fun comedy-cum-drama instead of thrusting it into a serious biopic zone.
<p>It is a known fact that Sonam Kapoor is playing a con girl in &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217;, the shooting of which would be kick-starting in a couple of months. However, what really surprised us was when the piece of news reached us that her character is actually based on a real life personality that had made headlines up North a few years back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently, there was this girl in Uttar Pradesh who had conned men into marrying her and then ran away with their money. Her sweet looks and innocent behavior made many a youngster believe in her and fall into her trap. She used to get into marital-hood and then run away with all the money and other valuables on first night itself. This continued for many months and no one could gather even a hint of where she came from and then disappeared,&#8221; informs our source.</p>
<p>When Sonam Kapoor was narrated these incidents, she was more than game to enact this character and readily stepped into the film.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously though, first time director Abhishek Dogra has tweaked the story and brought in cinematic liberties. Moreover, the makers have taken a conscious call not to sell this as a real life tale, lest it brings with it any unnecessary controversies. The idea is to make &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217; as a fun comedy-cum-drama instead of thrusting it into a serious biopic zone. This is going to be a smile through affair with an author backed role for Sonam,&#8221; our source adds.</p>
<p>We tried contacting Arbaaz Khan for his confirmation on the tale but he was unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of the other films being made on real life tales are Bad (which is based on Charles Sobhraj&#8217;s life), Rahasya (which is based on Arushi Talwar&#8217;s murder) and Mary Kom (which is based on Olympic winner Mary Kom).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001304&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A lot of ink has been spilt over how much of the filmmaking universe of the Ramsay Brothers who ruled Bollywood&#8217;s horror genre in the 1980s, went into Ashim Ahluwalia&#8217;s highly acclaimed film &#8216;Miss Lovely&#8217;.</p>
<p>Speaking out for the first time Shyam Ramsay from the Ramsay house of horrors says, &#8220;&#8216;Miss Lovely&#8217; was nothing but a desperate attempt to make a &#8216;Dirty Picture&#8217; kind of film using our family&#8217;s name in the pre-release publicity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shyam says the Ramsays feel victimized. &#8220;We were targeted, made to look like cheap sex peddlers in &#8216;Miss Lovely&#8217;. The fact is Ramsay is a brand name. We are a reputed family with decades of cinema to our credit. The whole film industry knows it. If someone still chose to portray us as sleaze hawkers it is not our problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shyam who is all set to hit theatres with his new horror film &#8216;Neighbours&#8217; says content would always be kin to Ramsays&#8217; brand of horror. &#8220;My new film Neighbours is about a seemingly normal neighbour who turns out to be a vampire. We&#8217;ve cast a super-model Roushika Rekhi as a sexy vampire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shyam asserts that the new Ramsay production abides by the banner&#8217;s reputation. &#8220;&#8216;Neighbours&#8217; has both the horror and sex quotients which are expected from us. The Ramsays have a strong image for a particular kind of cinema. We are not about to let down our audience just because some filmmaker has chosen to portray us as sleazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the Ramsays feel so strongly against Ashim Ahluwalia&#8217;s film why not take legal action against it? &#8220;It&#8217;s okay. &#8216;Miss Lovely&#8217; came and went. Not too many people saw it,&#8221; argues Shyam Ramsay.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001225&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP Photo)
<p>Barkhad Abdi, who earned an Oscar nomination for his role in &#8216;Captain Phillips&#8217;, is reportedly finding it hard to make ends meet despite finding fame with the Tom Hanks starrer film. </p>
<p>Abdi, a limousine driver, broke out with a critically acclaimed debut in the real-life inspired story about the kidnapping of a ship by Somali pirates. But according to a New Yorker story, the 28-year-old actor is finding it hard to live in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Abdi apparently earned USD 65,000 for his role in the Paul Greengrass&#8217; film but that was two years ago, E! Online reported quoting an article from New Yorker magazine.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Abdi is in Los Angeles to promote the film, he subsists on a per diem, good at the Beverly Hilton, where the<br /> studio likes to put him up. The town car is available only for official publicity events. His clothes are loaners. Recently Abdi requested that he be allowed to stay at a commuter hotel near LAX to be closer to his friend, a Somali cabdriver from Minneapolis, who shuttles him around for free,&#8221; the article read.</p>
<p>Abdi won the BAFTA for best supporting actor besides earning a best supporting Oscar nomination for his debut role.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001195&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Chat show host Ellen DeGeneres gave a USD 1,000 tip to the man, who delivered the pizzas at the Oscar ceremony. The delivery man, Edgar Martirosyan, appeared on &#8216;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&#8217; to talk about the Oscar event, that took place on March 2, reported Ace Showbiz.</p>
<p>DeGeneres and Martirosyan previously went to audience members&#8217; area as they delivered the pizzas to actors like Brad Pitt, Jared Leto and Meryl Streep.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/those-oscar-pizzas-werent-props/">In Pics: Those Oscar pizzas weren’t props</a></p>
<p>DeGeneres said that she did not have money to pay the delivery man. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any money,&#8221; DeGeneres said at the<br />
show. &#8220;Sandy? You&#8217;ve got a lot of money. You can tip him, right?&#8221; she asked Sandra Bullock, before asking Miramax film studio executive Harvey Weinstein.</p>
<p>DeGeneres managed to collect some money in Pharrell Williams&#8217; famous hat for the tip, but the pizza guy had left. &#8221;So you left before, I wanted to get you a tip and I passed Pharrell&#8217;s hat around and I ended up getting around USD 600 something like that,&#8221; DeGeneres said on the talk show. &#8221;Here is some more&#8230; here is USD 1000. Here is a total of USD 1000,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>The chat show host also asked him, &#8220;You thought you were going to bring them (the pizzas) to some producers? What did they tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, they told me I&#8217;m just going to deliver for writers and then when I was there they just told me wait here and you<br />
came out&#8230; and you said I&#8217;m going to let you know when to follow me and I was like, we&#8217;re we going,&#8221; he said. &#8221;You said just follow me and I&#8217;m going then I&#8217;m on a stage&#8230; I was in shock.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001176&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sanjayduttpeekay.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2001134" alt="Sanjay Dutt" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sanjayduttpeekay.jpg?w=450" /></a> According to reports, PK&#8217;s release has been pushed to December as Aamir Khan, is busy with &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217;.
<p>Director Rajkumar Hirani has said actor Sanjay Dutt shot for his portions in the upcoming film &#8216;P.K&#8217; before going to jail last year to serve his remaining term in the 1993 bomb blast case.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has already shot for his portions before he went (to jail),&#8221; Hirani said</p>
<p>Sanjay Dutt went to prison in May last year. There was a talk in Bollywood circles that the film&#8217;s release has been pushed to December as Aamir Khan, who features in &#8216;P.K&#8217; and is also one of its producers, is busy with his TV talk show &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217; whose second edition went on air last Sunday.</p>
<p>Also, Aamir had earlier said Hirani wanted to spend more time on the film&#8217;s editing which is why the release was pushed to December from June 6.</p>
<p>But Hirani cleared the air and insisted the reason for putting off &#8216;P.K&#8217; release was because people tend to watch more films during the festive season.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no particular reason for the delay in release. We wanted to release the film in June. But then Christmas seemed apt time. It is festive time and more people tend to watch films during this (festive) period. Also, most of Aamir&#8217;s films hit the theatres during Christmas and they have done well,&#8221; the national award winning director said.</p>
<p>The Hirani-helmed political satire also stars Anushka Sharma and Sushant Singh Rajput, besides Sanjay Dutt and Aamir.</p>
<p>Aamir Khan has had successful Christmas releases—from &#8216;Ghajini&#8217;, &#8217;3 Idiots&#8217; to last year&#8217;s &#8216;Dhoom 3&#8242;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001132&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Actress Vidya Balan said that she hopes to win an Oscar award. &#8220;I have never thought of winning an Oscar. Rather I never thought I would get the Padma Shri. I think God has been kind to me. I think getting Oscar award is not too far away,&#8221; Vidya, who is the ambassador of the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne Awards, said at a press conference, where she also announced nominations for the award function, scheduled to take place from May 1 to May 11.</p>
<p>Vidya said she is with the response her recently released film &#8216;Shaadi Ke Side Effects&#8217; received.</p>
<p>&#8220;People enjoyed the film and it feels good. I hope the film makes a mark. Life has been kind to me. I am happy with the love and appreciation that I have been getting throughout my career. I feel blessed. I try to do diverse and different roles,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>When asked if she plans to join politics, Vidya says she had no such plans.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001121&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhichawla.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000777" alt="Juhi Chawla" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhichawla.jpg?w=450" /></a> “While choosing a villain I thought it must be as big (as Madhuri Dixit) if not bigger,&#8221; Soumik said.
<p>Juhi Chawla says she thought director Soumik Sen had lost his mind when he offered the actress her career&#8217;s first negative role in his upcoming film &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first time I heard the role I thought he (Soumik Sen) has gone insane. Gradually, I got convinced after he explained it further. I thought it would be wonderful if I could do it,&#8221; Juhi, 46, told reporters at a press conference here.</p>
<p>The director joked that he had to show his musical side to the actress in order to convince her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to sing to convince her,&#8221; Soumik joked. Produced by Anubhav Sinha, the movie also stars Madhuri Dixt, who plays a firebrand leader while Juhi essays the part of a power-hungry politician.</p>
<p>Casting Juhi as the antagonist of the film was Soumik&#8217;s effort to break the mould.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had cast Madhuri as the hero of the film as it was in my mind from before but while choosing a villain I thought it must be as big if not bigger,&#8221; Soumik said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was also trying to break the mould as Charlie Chaplin, Amol Palekar have done earlier and therefore Juhi was taken as the villain for the film,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>When asked why he didn&#8217;t give credit to Sampat Pal, who is thought to be an inspiration for the movie, Soumik said that his story is a complete work of fiction and has no connection whatsoever with reality.</p>
<p>Madhuri Dixit, who was last seen on the screen in &#8216;Dedh Ishqiya&#8217;, said the film gives an important message about women empowerment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through the film we want to give out a message that women need to be empowered, they need to be educated for them to feel independent and get respect in the society. Rajjo is in every woman, there&#8217;s only the need to identify her,&#8221; Madhuri said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000775&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan will be seen in three different looks in his upcoming film &#8216;Happy Ending&#8217;.</p>
<p>Unlike playing three diverse characters in a film, Saif Ali Khan will play the same personality who will look different during three time lapses in the film.</p>
<p>Talking about this, director Raj Nidimoru said, &#8220;Saif Ali Khan will not be playing three different roles but his character will undergo change as he will be seen in three different stages of his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Directed by Krishna D K and Raj Nidimoru, &#8216;Happy Ending&#8217; starring Ileana D&#8217;Cruz, Govinda, Kalki Koechlin is produced under Illuminati Films.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000769&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gulaabgang.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000765" alt="Gulaab Gang" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gulaabgang.jpg?w=450" /></a> Sampat Pal&#8217;s argument is that the makers don&#8217;t have a permission to make a film on her life.
<p>Sampat Pal, the leader of Gulaabi gang, which has inspired Anubhav Sinha&#8217;s &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217; starring Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla, has filed a case against the film at Delhi High Court. Apparently her argument is that the makers don&#8217;t have a permission to make a film on her life.</p>
<p>The case joins the list of dozens of others when a development like this has taken place just days before a film&#8217;s release. With the film arriving this Friday and prints waiting to be dispatched, especially overseas, filing of the case couldn&#8217;t have been more ill timed for Sahara Movie Studios who are presenting the film.</p>
<p>Anubhav Sinha was unavailable for comments. A senior official attached to the film added though, &#8220;It is surprising that Sampat has filed this case when in last few months we have said hundreds of times that Gulaab Gang is not based on her story or that of Gulaabi Gang. We would be shortly sharing an official response on this case.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000764&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Leonardo DiCaprio, who once again returned empty handed from the Oscars, had plenty of sympathisers in the online community with &#8220;GiveLeoAnOscar&#8221; and &#8220;PoorLeo&#8221; trending on Twitter.</p>
<p>The internet broke into meme mode as fans took to social networking sites to share their feelings about DiCaprio&#8217;s loss in the best actor category to Matthew McConaughey.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old actor has been nominated five times including this year&#8217;s best actor and producer nomination.</p>
<p>After McConaughey, who had a small role in DiCaprio&#8217;s &#8216;The Wolf of Wall Street&#8217;, beat him last night, his fans took to Twitter to share their opinion.</p>

<p>Fans edited many famous scenes from DiCaprio&#8217;s movies to include many pictures of the actor in tears and a the golden statuette in them.</p>
<p>They also shared their opinion on Twitter. &#8220;GiveLeoAnOscar for something else at least. Like &#8220;Most Deserving Nominee Who Never Wins An Oscar&#8221; or something of the sort,&#8221; a tweet read.</p>
<p>Another fan added helpfully, &#8220;Give him an Oscar for his face.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been training for his oscar since he was a youth #GiveLeoAnOscar,&#8221; one tweet read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always a bridesmaid, never a bride,&#8221; summed up the actor&#8217;s situation by borrowing the line from romantic comedy &#8217;27 Dresses&#8217;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000738&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alizafar.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000728" alt="Ali Zafar" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alizafar.jpg?w=450" /></a> “In &#8216;London Paris New York&#8217;, kissing was essential in the film and so they got a body double to do it.”
<p>Pakistani actor-singer Ali Zafar says after his first Hindi film got good response, people of Pakistan realised that it was possible for artists from the neighbouring nation to make it big in India.</p>
<p>Ali made his acting debut in Hindi films in 2010 with &#8216;Tere Bin Laden&#8217;, which was a hit. He was later seen in &#8216;Mere Brother Ki Dulhan&#8217;, &#8216;London, Paris, New York&#8217; and &#8216;Chashme Baddoor&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think when my first film became a hit, people in Pakistan realised that it is possible to make it big in India. There is a misconception that every woman wears a &#8216;hijab&#8217; and every man keeps a beard in Pakistan. I always think that nothing is impossible,&#8221; Ali said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to India I have been welcomed here with open heart. I also get lot of appreciation for the work I do here in Hindi films,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ali disagrees that the industry favours only children of stars and not outsiders.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been an interesting journey for me. At times I wonder whether I am really acting in Hindi films. Considering that I didn&#8217;t know anyone over here and more importantly, being from Pakistan there was nothing going in my favour. I could only bank on my sincerity, talent and my hard work and I guess I have been pretty successful in doing that,&#8221; Ali said.</p>
<p>Ali has a &#8216;no kissing clause&#8217; in his contract while he does Bollywood films. &#8220;I have a clause that I won&#8217;t be kissing on screen. In &#8216;London Paris New York&#8217;, kissing was essential in the film and so they got a body double to do it. I obviously think about what people are going to feel like back home (Pakistan) and what they are going to think,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She (wife) is very understanding. She sometimes comes down and joins me while I am here for my shoots. She likes my films&#8230; she loved me in &#8216;London Paris New York&#8217;. My family has always been supportive of my acting career here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ali has an interesting slate of films lined up for release this year, including &#8216;Total Siyapaa&#8217; where he plays a Pakistani boy falling in love with an Indian girl, played by Yami Gautam. The film produced by Neeraj Pandey releases on\ March 7.</p>
<p>His next is YRF&#8217;s &#8216;Kill Dill&#8217; alongside Ranveer Singh, Govinda and Parineeti Chopra which is scheduled to release on September 5 and apparently he will make a cameo appearance in the sequel to &#8216;Tere Bin Laden&#8217;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000727&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP Photo)
<p>Actress Lupita Nyong&#8217;o says winning Oscar for her debut film was so overwhelming that she could not even sleep at the night. The 31-year-old actress won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217;, reported People<br />
magazine.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t set in. I haven&#8217;t even slept! It is overwhelming, but at the same time, this is the thing I dreamt for, it&#8217;s the thing that I availed myself for. I&#8217;m just trying to allow myself to absorb it all,&#8221; Lupita said.</p>
<p>The actress was possessive about the golden statuette. &#8221;The first half of the night I was being very, very selfish. I wouldn&#8217;t let anyone even take a picture with it. No one was holding it. But then, it&#8217;s really heavy,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000711&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hollywood star George Clooney, who starred in &#8216;Gravity&#8217; and produced &#8216;August: Osage County&#8217;, skipped 86th Academy awards to have his much-awaited vacation.</p>
<p>There were reports that he was in London by the side of his new girlfriend Amal Alamuddin but the 52-year-old actor&#8217;s representative has denied the reports, reported the New York post. &#8221;George is not in London. He is on a well-deserved, long overdue vacation,&#8221; the representative said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Gravity&#8217;, which Clooney appeared in alongside Sandra Bullock, won seven Oscars, including Best Director for Alfonso<br />
Cuaron, and best original screenplay.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000709&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

I never thought I&#8217;d take one home, so I haven&#8217;t thought that far in advance.
<p>Brad Pitt never thought he would win an Oscar and does not know where to put his golden statuette, which he picked up as a producer for &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217;. The 50-year-old actor said he never dreamt of winning and does not know what to do with the trophy, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m going to put it. I never thought I&#8217;d take one home, so I haven&#8217;t thought that far in advance,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Pitt, who made a small appearance in the film, also praised his colleague and film&#8217;s lead actor Chiwetel Ejiofor. &#8221;I think the truth is we wouldn&#8217;t have been able to make this film without Brad Pitt, because of what he brings. He&#8217;s a movie star. He&#8217;s a huge figure in this profession, in this industry.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000679&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahrukhkhan.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000672" alt="Shah Rukh Khan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahrukhkhan.jpg?w=450" /></a> SRK opined, “The film that goes a little wrong that should be your favourite.”
<p>Superstar Shah Rukh Khan is happy that he has survived in the industry and is still a star despite having several flops behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been an amazing journey till now. It is fantastic time to be here,&#8221; Shah Rukh said.</p>
<p>The actor said one should not get disturbed by a film&#8217;s failure. &#8220;I have done 70-80 films out of which 50 per cent are flops, still I am star&#8230; but those films are close to me,&#8221; the 48-year-old actor said.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/bollywood/shah-rukh-khan-takes-a-dig-at-salman-khan-again/">Also Read: Shah Rukh Khan takes a dig at Salman Khan again</a></p>
<p>Talking about his favourite film, he said, &#8220;My favourite film is &#8216;Paheli&#8217;, &#8216;Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani&#8217;. The film that goes a little wrong (kharab) that should be your favourite and you should be proud of these films.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shah Rukh feels fortunate to be part of Indian cinema at a time when it is going through several changes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many wonderful filmmakers and actors who are edgy and want to take risk, chances and take Indian cinema forward, the extent to which Indian cinema has shifted from just being a trend and fad internationally to becoming part and parcel (there),&#8221; Shah Rukh said.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/srk-goes-suave-fashionista-sonam-dazzles-once-again/#srk-9-2">Photos: SRK goes suave</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Bollywood was just a cool word earlier and it was all about singing and dancing&#8230; now when I travel abroad and talk about Bollywood, there is a sensibility and understanding of different mode of storytelling which is coming out of India.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shah Rukh started his acting career with TV shows like &#8216;Fauji&#8217; and &#8216;Circus&#8217;.</p>
<p>Apart from doing negative roles in films like &#8216;Darr&#8217;, &#8216;Baazigar&#8217;, and &#8216;Anjaam&#8217; during his early days in Bollywood, he acted in memorable films like &#8216;Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge&#8217;, &#8216;Dil To Pagal Hai&#8217;, &#8216;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&#8217;, &#8216;Devdas&#8217;, &#8216;Swades&#8217;, &#8216;Chak De India&#8217;, &#8216;Chennai Express&#8217; among others.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000670&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Oscar telecast on Sunday night pulled in a record viewership of 43 million which was up by 2.5 million from previous year. The mega ceremony, a culmination of Hollywood&#8217;s award season, was hosted by Ellen Degeneres and was telecast live on ABC.</p>
<p>Final ratings for the Ellen DeGeneres-hosted show have the Academy Awards more than 2.5 million viewers ahead of last year and even in the key demographic, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The coverage of the show averaged 43 million viewers and 12.9 rating among adults 18-49, which is a 6 per cent boost in viewers.</p>
<p>DeGeneres brought lifts among younger viewers and men with ratings among adults 18-34 and men both at their highest since 2007. Last year&#8217;s ceremony pulled in 40.4 million viewers and a 13 rating among adults 18-49.</p>
<p>The ratings for Oscars have been reasonably steady in recent years after a slide in 2008, which had an average 32<br />
million viewers.</p>
<p>DeGeneres had previously hosted the Oscars in 2007 which was watched by 40.2 million viewers and a 14.1 rating with<br />
adults 18-49. The telecast hasn&#8217;t topped that demo score since.</p>
<p>The academy, in its attempt to bring in younger audience, has been trying to revamp the event by bringing in younger<br />
stars like James Franco, Anne Hathaway and Seth McFarlane to host the three-hour-long ceremony but not to much success. DeGeneres mostly received positive reviews for her hosting duties this year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000489&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jenniferlawrence.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000641" alt="Jennifer Lawrence" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jenniferlawrence.jpg?w=450" /></a> Jennifer Lawrence turned on the sex appeal by ditching her underwear to wear a sheer outfit.
<p>She may have lost out in the best supporting category but that did not stop Jennifer Lawrence from hitting the party scene at the Oscars where she turned on the sex appeal by ditching her underwear to wear a sheer outfit.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/best-dressed-at-oscars-2014-angelina-jolie-naomi-watts-lupita/">Best dressed at Oscars 2014: Angelina Jolie, Naomi Watts, Lupita </a></p>
<p>The 23-year-old actress, popular for her goofy personality, ditched her beautiful red Dior gown for a bold Tom Ford mini during the Vanity Fair Oscars party.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jenniferoscar-460.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000643" alt="jenniferoscar-460" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jenniferoscar-460.jpg?w=450" /></a> Jennifer Lawrence in a beautiful red Dior gown at the 86th Academy Awards.
<p>The frock featured a metallic shattered-glass design and sheer paneling on the sides and back that left slivers of the Oscar nominee&#8217;s bare hip and thigh exposed. She also made over her makeup, upgrading her cat-eye to a sexy smoky eye, reported Us magazine.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jennifervanityfair-460.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000644" alt="jennifervanityfair-460" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jennifervanityfair-460.jpg?w=450" /></a> The frock featured a metallic shattered-glass design and sheer paneling on the sides.
<p>The &#8216;American Hustle&#8217; star was seen having a great time despite losing the trophy to &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; newcomer Lupita Nyong&#8217;o.</p>
<p>In a reminder of last year when Lawrence had tripped on her way to receive her Oscar, the actress grabbed headlines again by taking a tumble just after arriving at the Dolby theatre.</p>
<h5><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/oscars-2014-angelina-jolie-cate-blanchett-jennifer-lawrence/">Oscars 2014: Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lawrence on the red carpet </a></h5>
<p>Host Ellen DeGeneres ensured that she brought the topic during the ceremony, saying if Lawrence won again she would get her Oscar delivered to her seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jennifer Lawrence, by the way, I&#8217;m not going to bring up what happened last year&#8230; And you know the thing about when you fell out of the car tonight when you were getting out of the car? No one needs to know about that,&#8221; DeGeneres said.</p>
<h5><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/oscars-2014-worst-dressed-lady-gaga-julia-roberts-penelope-cruz/">Oscars 2014 worst dressed: Lady Gaga, Julia Roberts, Penelope Cruz</a></h5>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to mention that. She fell on the way out of the car. Like, on an orange cone, you tripped or something. If you win tonight, I think we should bring you the Oscar,&#8221; the host said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000631&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitabhhoneysingh.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000628" alt="Amitabh " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitabhhoneysingh.jpg?w=450" /></a> Amitabh Bachchan tweeted, “Off to shake me legs with Yo Yo Honey Singh for &#8216;Bhoothnath Returns&#8217; .. P-E-T-R-I-F-I-E-D .. !!!”
<p>Look who is giving Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan the chills! None other than B-town latest favourite Yo Yo Honey Singh!</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan is all set to shake a leg with Honey Singh for a special track in his upcoming film&#8217; Bhootnath Returns&#8217;</p>
<p>Big B tweeted, “Off to shake me legs with Yo Yo Honey Singh for &#8216;Bhoothnath Returns&#8217; .. P-E-T-R-I-F-I-E-D .. !!! Moral support and prayers needed.”</p>
<p>The film&#8217;s producer Bhushan Kumar had earlier informed, “It’s a lavishly set song that will be shot in a modern haveli resort and will involve a lot of special effects. We’ve requested Amitji to rap too. This will be one crazy number!”</p>
<p>Over 100 dancers, including children, will also shake a leg with Amitabh Bachchan, who plays the role of a friendly ghost in the movie.</p>
<p>Honey Singh, who has become a phenomenon in Bollywood, has given tracks in films like ‘Cocktail’, ‘Chennai Express’, ‘Boss’, ‘Dedh Ishqiya’ and ‘Yaariyaan’. Honey Singh’s songs have been pictured on actors like Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar and Arshad Warsi. And now the megastar would be seen rapping in the film.</p>
<p>Earlier, Big B had tweeted how he enjoyed dancing despite his age. “‘Grooving and shakin’ with the young at the shoot for ‘Bhoothnath Returns’… At times the choreographer and the production forget how old I am to be still doing this stuff… But to be honest I did enjoy myself, despite the buckets of perspiration after each approaching summer heat filled shot,” Amitabh Bachchan had posted on his blog.</p>
<p>‘Bhootnath Returns’ is a sequel to the 2008 horror-comedy film ‘Bhootnath’, which also starred Juhi Chawla and Shah Rukh Khan besides Bachchan as the friendly ghost.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000624&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Actor Brad Pitt&#8217;s dapper look in a tuxedo at this year&#8217;s Academy Awards also owes to his creative fiancee Angelina Jolie, who designed his cufflinks.</p>
<p>Brad Pitt&#8217;s tuxedo buttons and cufflinks were designed by &#8216;Style of Jolie&#8217; jewellery line with Robert Procop, reported People magazine.</p>
<p>Angelina Jolie, 38, had gifted the cufflinks to Brad Pitt as a Christmas present.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bradangelina-460.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000621" alt="bradangelina-460" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bradangelina-460.jpg?w=450" /></a> While Brad Pitt wore a tuxedo at the Oscars, Angelina Jolie ditched her love for black by opting to dazzle in a shimmery Elie Saab Couture gown.
<p>&#8220;Brad&#8217;s specially designed cufflinks were a gift from Angelina one year for Christmas,&#8221; said Procop in a statement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahrukhsalman.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000546" alt="Shah Rukh Salman" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahrukhsalman.jpg?w=450" /></a> At an event Shah Rukh Khan took a dig at his foe-turned-friend Salman Khan yet again.
<p>The &#8216;War of Khans&#8217; doesn&#8217;t look like over yet. The two hugs that we saw between SRK and Salman Khan – one at an iftar party last year and the <a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/friends-forever-salman-khan-srk-hug-again/">other one at the Star Guild Awards</a> earlier this year – haven&#8217;t seem to have cemented the damaged ties between them.</p>
<p>And at an event in Mumbai on Monday (March 3), Shah Rukh Khan took a dig at his foe-turned-friend Salman Khan yet again.</p>
<p>The actor, who was out at the unveiling event of a watch brand he endorses, apparently questioned filmmaker Kunal Kohli&#8217;s taste in films, when he said that the last film he saw was Salman Khan&#8217;s &#8216;Jai Ho&#8217;.</p>
<p>Shah Rukh Khan, who is known for his impeccable comic timing staged a &#8216;rapid fire&#8217; round at the event for the audience&#8217;s pleasure and definitely had Kunal Kohli in a fix.</p>
<p>Kunal Kohli had tweeted, “Toughest,Most Fun part of TagHeuer event,Rapid Fire wth @iamsrk,his comebacks to r answers had everyone in splits.”</p>
<p>It was during one of the &#8216;comebacks&#8217; to his replies that Shah Rukh made a snide comment at Salman Khan&#8217;s &#8216;Jai Ho&#8217;. When Shah Rukh asked Kunal Kohli the last film he saw, Kunal promptly said, “Jai Ho!”, which earned a hooting from the audience. Shah Rukh, took a while and then made a &#8216;comeback&#8217; and said, “There is no accounting for taste.”</p>
<p>Kunal Kohli along with &#8216;Gori Tere Pyaar Mein&#8217; director Punit Malhotra and actress-model Mandira Bedi had also joined SRK at the event.</p>
<p>The Karan Arjun&#8217; co-stars drifted apart after a fight at actress Katrina Kaif&#8217;s birthday party in 2008. The two Khans, it seemed had patched up, after been seen on amicable terms at an iftar party in 2013 and earlier this year at an award function.</p>

<p>Bollywood actor Aamir Khan&#8217;s television show &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217;, which returned for the second season on March 2 was too heavy for filmmaker Karan Johar.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&#8217; director tweeted, “#SatyamevJayate broke my heart&#8230;made me feel helpless yet inspired me to make a change..truly moving, heartfelt and rightfully arousing!”</p>
<p>The first episode of &#8216;Stayamev Jayate 2&#8242; started with one of the most debated and hard hitting issues prevalent in the country today – crimes against women.</p>
<p>The episode focussed on the rising number of rape cases in India and other atrocities against women in the nation.</p>
<p>The episode dealt with the sensitive issue highlighting what the &#8216;victim&#8217; goes through and urged the viewers to bring about a change.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000527&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

I think one day I will watch it, because, you know, I&#8217;ll be curious at some point.
<p>Jared Leto may have won an Oscar for his role in &#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217;, but he has admitted that he still has not seen the film. The 43 year-old actor-singer won the best supporting actor at yesterday&#8217;s award ceremony for his portrayal of Rayon, an HIV-positive transgender woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not seen the film yet. I think one day I will watch it, because, you know, I&#8217;ll be curious at some point. But it was such an intense role. It&#8217;s better for me to just leave it alone right now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Although the last 24 hours must have been full of celebrations for Leto, he may have already found out one downside to now being an Oscar-winning actor. As he emerged from his home on Monday morning, an army of photographers were waiting for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were paparazzi waiting outside of my house this morning. I don&#8217;t know if (they were there) just to kind of celebrate the day with me or find out who else I was sleeping with,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000471&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8216;Her&#8217; star Scarlett Johansson is reportedly expecting her first child with fiance Romain Dauriac.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old actresses&#8217; pregnancy news came six months after her representative confirmed last year that she was engaged to French journalist Dauriac. The couple first went public with their romance in November 2012, reported Us<br />
magazine.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Don Jon&#8217; actress, who was once married to Ryan Reynolds, had said that Dauriac helped make her a less jealous person.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think I was a jealous person until I started dating my current, my one-and-only. I think maybe in the past I didn&#8217;t have the same kind of investment. Not that I liked my partner less, I just wasn&#8217;t capable of it or caring that much,&#8221; she had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000464&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Films play an important role in cultural integration, psychological integration as well as tourism promotion besides being a very powerful medium of expression, Meghalaya Governor K K Paul said today.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we need is a total cultural integration and it is here that the role of films becomes very important,&#8221; Paul said at the inauguration of the four-day Indian Panaroma Film Festival (IPFF) here.</p>
<p>Stating that till recently, films were the cheapest source of entertainment and had a countrywide following in several languages, he said that now, even though there were other avenues of entertainment, the appeal and relevance of cinema had not diminished and continues to grow.</p>
<p>Stating that entire Bollywood seemed to get stuck in the tea gardens of Darjeeling, the Governor said that the Northeast had waterfalls, natural clouds, mountainscapes and tea gardens. He also said that there was no dearth of talent in the NE and films could play an integrative role by giving enhanced exposure to talented boys and girls.</p>
<p>The Governor released the souvenir of the Indian Panaroma Film Festival.</p>
<p>Earlier, celebrities like &#8216;Dekh Indian Circus&#8217; film&#8217;s actor and director, Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Mangesh Hadawale besides others were also introduced to the audience. &#8216;Dekh Indian Circus&#8217; was screened as the opening film at the festival.</p>
<p>The IPFF is being organised by the Meghalaya&#8217;s Department of Information and Public Relations in collaboration with the Government of India&#8217;s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting through the Directorate of Film Festivals.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000282&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey has confirmed that he is not returning for a second season of the HBO hit drama &#8216;True Detective&#8217;.</p>
<p>McConaughey, 44, who is also an executive producer of the series, said last season was final one. &#8221;I won&#8217;t be back for season two. Season one was finite,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>McConaughey decided to come to TV after his string of successful films, including &#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217;, &#8216;Mud&#8217; and &#8217;The Wolf of Wall Street&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a different time in television. It&#8217;s not there&#8217;s not that feeling of if you&#8217;re having a successful film career and somebody brings up something on television we didn&#8217;t know, at the time when I got it, where it was going to be. All I knew is I read the first two episodes, and I was in. And I was just, at the time, looking for quality.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000265&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sonamkapoor.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000266" alt="Sonam Kapoor" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sonamkapoor.jpg?w=450" /></a> Sonam Kapoor also said, “I don&#8217;t have the power like Deepika and Anushka.”
<p>Actress Sonam Kapoor is happy for the kind of work her contemporaries Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma are doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Deepika and Anushka do that (profit share). I am happy for my colleagues&#8230;they are doing fine work. I am proud of them&#8230;it is amazing. I don&#8217;t have the power (like them). Changes are coming in the industry and it is a good thing,&#8221; Sonam said.</p>
<p>According to Sonam, there is definitely a change in the way women work in Bollywood today.</p>
<p>&#8220;In one of my upcoming films &#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217; director, editor and most of the other cast and crew are women. Like women are there in ruling party (politics), etc. Sexism is there everywhere&#8230;in every industry not just film industry,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today in films the kind of roles and films are written for women is good. I am too getting good roles,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Sonam wants to support three causes – cancer as she had lost near and dear one&#8217;s, women empowerment and education.</p>
<p>On the eve of International women&#8217;s day, Femina a magazine in association with beauty brand L&#8217;oreal Paris are coming up with the third edition of L&#8217;oreal Paris Femina Women awards.</p>
<p>The awards will be held on March 27. &#8220;I am happy to be in the presence of such great women of worth, who have contributed to society selflessly and made a difference to the world we live in,&#8221; Sonam said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000264&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rabbiyajiah.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-2000336" alt="Rabya" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rabbiyajiah.jpg?w=450" /></a> Rabya claims she has audio recordings of five witnesses which strengthen her belief that Jiah was murdered.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Armed with audio recordings obtained through a sting operation, Rabiya Khan, the mother of deceased actor Jiah Khan, has moved the Bombay High Court again, alleging her daughter was murdered. Rabya said she conducted a sting operation of the prime witnesses in the case, which allegedly revealed that their statements had been manipulated by the Juhu police.</span></p>
<p>Rabya (53) claimed she had audio recordings of each of these five witnesses which strengthen her belief that Jiah was murdered. Rabya has sought a transfer of the probe to a Special Investigation Team. Rabya has earlier claimed she was threatened by a man, who allegedly met her at her house on February 25 and asked her to withdraw her case. She promptly reported this to Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria via e-mail. Confirming that her complaint had been received, Maria said he had asked the police station concerned to file an offence.</p>
<p><strong>Witnesses contacted by Rabya Khan </strong></p>
<p><strong>Surendra Yadav</strong>: the watchman of Jiah Khan’s building. Yadav, who was at the gate of the building on the day Sooraj Pancholi’s domestic help Deva came with a bouquet, has told Rabya in a recorded conversation that Deva had visited Jiah’s house twice in a span of six minutes. Yadav’s statement as recorded by the Juhu police, however, states that Deva had gone to the building only once, but left when he realised he had forgotten a card which said ‘All the Best’.</p>
<p><strong>Shankar and Bahule:</strong> owner of the flower shop from where Sooraj had ordered a bouquet. Shankar and Bahule have told Rabya that Deva had come to their shop only once and taken the bouquet along with the card with ‘All The Best’ printed on it. Their statements recorded by the police, however, say that Deva had come to their shop twice as he had forgotten the card.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Agarwal:</strong> the doctor who came to the house after Jiah’s body was discovered. After Dr Aggarwal examined Jiah, he had stated that her pupils were “dilated and fixed.” He further stated that he recommended that the police be called. Dr Agarwal has also confirmed in his tape-recorded conversation that he has not seen any froth or saliva from the mouth of Jiah. However, his statement as recorded by police states that Jiah’s eyes had popped out. The police, according to Rabya, have tried to twist the case by saying that the deceased was declared dead in Cooper Hospital, whereas Dr Agarwal confirmed that Jiah had been pronounced dead at the spot.</p>
<p><strong>Anju Mahendru:</strong> Rabya Khan’s friend . Contrary to the police statement, Mahendru has stated that she has not opened the window at the house, as it was already open when she and her friend Munnu went to the balcony to smoke. She has categorically stated that there was only one knot to the rope that was around Jiah’s neck, and not two to three as mentioned in her police statement. Mahendru has also told Rabya that there was no froth and Jiah’s eyes were closed, mouth was shut and there was a single knot behind the ear as well as a major injury mark below the chin.</p>
<p>Mahendru has also said she was asked by one of the police officers whether the round injury mark on Jiah’s face could have been caused by her bangles. She has also said that police had asked why there was no grill in the house.</p>
<p><strong>Dr Rahul Dutta:</strong> Jiah’s Doctor. Dr Dutta has told Rabya that he had met Jiah once before and realised that she was depressed, but that she did not have any suicidal tendencies. However, in his statement recorded by the police, Dr Dutta has said that Jiah had tried to commit suicide earlier.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000186&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Nyong’o steals show in gasp-inducing neckline.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000153&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">After two days of rain, the sky had efficiently cleared Sunday, and the actresses would be free to bare their backs, breasts, shoulders and midriffs, if not yet their souls. </span></p>
<p>Amy Adams arrived in a deep navy opaque Gucci column with four symmetrical flaps that appeared more protective than decorative: It seemed a correction of sorts to all the freewheeling late-disco cleavage she has displayed this season while promoting American Hustle. “It felt like me,” she said of the outfit.</p>
<p>This time it was Lupita Nyong’o, a star of 12 Years a Slave and the fashion industry’s sudden darling, who chose a gasp-inducing neckline: Almost to the navel, this daring was counteracted by the Prada dress’s demure pale-blue pleated chiffon (“The blue reminds me of Nairobi,” Nyong’o said). Despite the childish, sparkly headband she wore with it, this was possibly the best Hollywood moment for the house since Uma Thurman emerged in pale lilac almost 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Sandra Bullock, the star of Gravity, also wore a blue gown, from Alexander McQueen — a deep midnight, appropriately astronomical, shade.</p>
<p>Jennifer Lawrence didn’t disappoint in a $2 million, 100-carat diamond necklace from Neil Lane to accent her girl-on-fire orange-red strapless dress from Dior.</p>
<p>Cate Blanchett seemed somewhat stiff in an uncharacteristically busy Armani Privé gown of nude mesh and floppy sequins that, if chopped above the knee, would have at least been a satisfying figure skating outfit. On her ears were 33 carats of opal in a huge drop design.</p>
<p>Muted colours, like those worn by Blanchett and Nyong’o’s ice blue, were one of the night’s big trends, said Estee Stanley, a stylist who worked with Portia de Rossi, in a regal Naeem Khan halter with beads and lace, and Jessica Biel, dressed in a metallic sparkler from Chanel dripping with jewellery from Tiffany.</p>
<p>Probably anticipating the competitive rush of clavicles, Naomi Watts was covered up in cap-sleeved, heavily encrusted white Calvin Klein that, true to the label’s heritage, bore some resemblance to an overgrown T-shirt. Sally Hawkins ducked from underneath hanks of hair — all but apologising, adorably, for her heavily embroidered Valentino. “Thank you for speaking to me,” she said, like a scullery maid invited to the ball.</p>
<p>But for the ultimate in comfort, there was the all-too-occasional ahhh of pants — Liza Minnelli in cobalt satin pajamas, accessorised with (was this a pun?) a blue streak; and the ceremony’s host, Ellen DeGeneres, looking natty in a series of Saint Laurent tuxedos for which she thanked the designer, Hedi Slimane, by first name.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000153&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Comedienne and talk show star Ellen DeGeneres returned as Oscar host on Sunday, bringing her deadpan affability, and free pizza, to the 86th Academy Awards show while still poking fun at Hollywood royalty.</span></p>
<p>Shrugging off complaints from some critics that the breezy levity of her first Oscar stint in 2007 was at odds with the Academy Awards’ traditional sense of decorum, DeGeneres forayed into the Dolby Theatre audience several times during the show to mingle with the film industry elite, as she did seven years before.</p>
<p>While mostly veering away from the ribald streak that marked Seth MacFarlane’s widely panned stint last year, a tuxedo-clad DeGeneres showed she was not above mocking the biggest stars in town. Early reviews of DeGeneres’s latest performance were mostly positive.</p>
<p>She handed a pair of lottery tickets to American Hustle star Bradley Cooper after he lost his bid for best supporting actor; took a “selfie” snapshot with nominees that was swiftly re-tweeted more than 2 million times during the show; and even ushered a real pizza delivery guy in to hand out slices to the stars.</p>
<p>DeGeneres then called on producer Harvey Weinstein to pay the tip: “No pressure, only a billion people are watching, whatever you feel is right.”</p>
<p>She zeroed in on supporting actress nominee and last year’s best actress winner Jennifer Lawrence, recalling that the star famously tripped on the stairs to the stage on her way to accepting her Oscar.</p>
<p>DeGeneres also alluded to how Lawrence, 23, nominated for her role in American Hustle, stumbled again on the red carpet on Sunday. “If you win tonight, I think we should bring you the Oscar,” DeGeneres dead-panned.</p>
<p>Finally, DeGeneres went into how beautiful everyone looked, highlighting Jared Leto as the prettiest princess of the night. Dallas Buyers Club “deals with the serious issue of people who have sex at rodeos”, she quipped.</p>
<p>In another pithy moment, DeGeneres declared two possible scenarios for the final outcome of the Oscar race: “Possibility No. 1, 12 Years a Slave wins best picture. Possibility No. 2, you’re all racists.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000151&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Gravity tops with 7 Oscars including best director, zero for much-nominated american hustle.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000150&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In a triumph long deferred, 12 Years a Slave won the best picture Oscar at the 86th Academy Awards on Sunday night, the first time Hollywood conferred its top honour to the work of a black director.</span></p>
<p>“I’d like to thank this amazing story,” said Steve McQueen, the British-born filmmaker. “Everyone deserves not just to survive, but to live.” McQueen dedicated the film to those who had endured slavery, both in the past and in the present.</p>
<p>Only minutes before, McQueen had been overlooked for the directing award, which went to Alfonso Cuarón for Gravity, a 3-D blockbuster whose story of survival in space had been locked with McQueen’s film and David O Russell’s American Hustle in a ferocious contest for the best picture statuette.</p>
<p>Fox Searchlight, which distributed 12 Years a Slave, about a 19th-century man, Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped into slavery, carried the day with the help of an advertising slogan that reminded Oscar voters of their chance to make history. “It’s time,” said the ads.</p>
<p>12 Years a Slave won only three awards, including best supporting actress and best adapted screenplay, while Gravity won seven, the most of any film.</p>
<p>Diversity was a leading motif for ceremony that was hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, a happy-go-lucky lesbian who spent most of the evening in a tuxedo, and which also honoured Jared Leto as best supporting actor for his role as a transgender AIDS patient in Dallas Buyers Club.</p>
<p>The best actress award went to Cate Blanchett for Blue Jasmine, despite a late-season challenge by Dylan Farrow, who said that its director Woody Allen and his films should be shunned because he had, by her account, sexually molested her as a child. “Thank you so much, Woody, for casting me,” said Blanchett, who made a point of thanking Allen for using Blue Jasmine to tell a woman’s story.</p>
<p>Jennifer Lawrence followed minutes later to present the best actor award to Matthew McConaughey for Dallas Buyers Club. “Why are you laughing?” Lawrence challenged the audience, which has come to expect a trip, fall or charming faux pas every time she takes the stage. But she pulled it off without a hitch, and McConaughey thanked God and everyone else with a toothy movie star smile.</p>
<p>Spike Jonze won the original script Oscar for Her, a film that had a powerful following, particularly among young viewers, who responded to its quirky story of one man’s love affair with his digital operating system. It was the only win for Her, but that was enough to lift it above American Hustle.</p>
<p>Widely seen as one of three films in contention for the top honours, it left empty-handed, a humiliation for a film with 10 nominations and one of the better box office totals.</p>
<p>Nyong’o, who had been charming Oscar voters with her fresh face and mostly modest demeanour for months, cut loose just a little bit backstage. “I think it belongs to me!” Nyong’o replied to a question about who deserved credit for the “golden man” in her arms.</p>
<p>Less happily, Leonardo DiCaprio got nothing for his work, both as actor and as a produce, on The Wolf of Wall Street. But The Great Gatsby, in which he had starred in the early part of 2013, won awards for production and costume design. Captain Phillips also came up empty-handed.</p>
<p>The annual memorial sequence scrolled through a list of film figures who died since the last show. Harold Ramis, Karen Black, Hal Needham, Saul Zaentz, Elmore Leonard, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Shirley Temple Black were just a few of those remembered.</p>
<p>Oscar lore has it that the Academy has a soft spot for Holocaust stories, like Schindler’s List, the best picture winner in 1994. This year, it bestowed a documentary short Oscar on The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life, about Alice Herz Sommer, a 110-year-old Holocaust survivor who died just days before the ceremony.</p>
<p>There was no surprise when Italy picked up another best foreign film Oscar, its 11th, for The Great Beauty, about the life-reckoning of a literary Roman.</p>
<p>By the end of the night, with most of Hollywood eager to move past the pageantry, the rainstorms that pounded Los Angeles on Friday and Saturday even seemed appropriate: Enough with this Oscar business.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000150&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Leonardo DiCaprio failed to take home the Oscar for Best Actor at the 86th Academy Awards.</p>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio was nominated for his portrayal of Jordan Belfort in the film ‘Wolf of Wall Street’. However, the actor lost out to ‘Dallas Buyers Club’ actor, Matthew McConaughey.</p>
<p>Fans expressed their disappointment that the actor, who has been nominated three times before, was overlooked for his outstanding performance once more.<br /> Sam Craske @Sam_Craske: I can&#8217;t believe that Leonardo DiCaprio didn&#8217;t win an Oscar!</p>
<p>Savannah Brandt @SavannahBrandt: leonardo dicaprio didn&#8217;t lose an oscar, an oscar lost leonardo dicaprio</p>
<p>Aragorn @ActualAragorn: Leonardo DiCaprio. Most underrated actor of all time. He deserves a damn Oscar! #RT if you agree!</p>
<p>Andrew Marlan @AndrewMarlan: Leonardo DiCaprio doesn&#8217;t need an Oscar to prove he&#8217;s a talented actor. But it would&#8217;ve been nice.</p>
<p>ava @sunshineshire: leonardo dicaprio could be the only one nominated for an oscar and still not win an oscar</p>
<p>Mai Akirasart @Akirasart: oh god again! I can&#8217;t believe Leonardo Dicaprio didn&#8217;t get an Oscar. it made me upset.! #LeonardoDiCaprio</p>
<p>Zara @HobbiesBabe: I swear there&#8217;s like some conspiracy against Leonardo DiCaprio so he doesn&#8217;t win an Oscar #bullshit</p>
<p>Leonardo was first nominated for an Oscar in 1994 for ‘What&#8217;s Eating Gilbert Grape’ and then in 2005 for ‘The Aviator’. The actor was then nominated once more in 2007 for ‘Blood Diamond’.</p>
<p>Maybe next year will be Leo’s year!</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999727&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/irrfan480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999726" alt="Irrfan Khan for the first time confirms his presence in the film." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/irrfan480.jpg" /></a> Irrfan Khan for the first time confirms his presence in the film.
<p>After being part of the Spiderman franchise, Irrfan Khan has now hopped on to the Jurassic brand.</p>
<p>Yes, the rumours regarding Irrfan&#8217;s presence in Jurassic Park 4 are true. Irrfan Khan for the first time confirms his presence in the fourth edition of the franchise to be directed by Colin Trevorrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes I&#8217;ve been offered Jurassic Park 4. But at the moment I cannot reveal any more details,&#8221; said Irrfan.</p>
<p>A friend of the actor revealed the role is one of the 3 principal leads in Jurassic Park.&#8221;And it&#8217;s not a villain&#8217;s role, as has been reported in the international press. After the way his role was melted down in The Amazing Spiderman, Irrfan is not willing to take risks with international offers. Just because he is being offered a role in a huge franchise, he won&#8217;t run for it at the cost of his Indian projects,&#8221; says Irrfan&#8217;s friends.</p>
<p>Irrfan is committed to do a film with Tigmanshu Dhulia at the same time when he is required to be in the US to shoot Jurassic Park.</p>
<p>And there lies the dilemma.</p>
<p>Says the friend, &#8220;It is tempting to take on a project that Steven Spielberg is associated with. But there is the risk of being lost in the crowd. Irrfan is waiting for the script before he chooses between Spielberg and Dhulia.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999724&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ranveersingh480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999718" alt="&quot;I am super excited to work with Zoya,&quot; says Ranveer. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ranveersingh480.jpg" /></a> &#8220;I am super excited to work with Zoya,&#8221; says Ranveer.
<p>Actor Ranveer Singh says he is excited to be working with Zoya Akhtar and his performance in the film will surprise everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am super excited to work with Zoya as I believe she&#8217;s one of the most talented directors in the industry. Moreover it&#8217;s a part that really pushes me as an actor and gives me a chance to showcase an aspect of my performance that will surprise my fans,&#8221; he said.<br />
Ranveer plays the main lead in the film, which is reportedly titled &#8216;Dil Dhadakne Do&#8217;.</p>
<p>Zoya&#8217;s directorial venture will also have Priyanka Chopra, Anushka Sharma and Farhan Akhtar. There is buzz that Ranveer and Priyanka will play siblings, with Anushka and Farhan opposite them.</p>
<p>However, the actor&#8217;s spokesperson clarified that there is no exclusivity clause in the (film) contract, as reported. There were reports that Zoya wanted to keep the look of Ranveer under wraps and so he signed a contract with the production house stating he will not shoot for any film until Zoya&#8217;s film wraps up.</p>
<p>&#8220;He will be shooting for over 75-80 days of the total 90 day schedule of the film,&#8221; spokesperson of the actor said.<br />
Ranveer has also finally opened up to doing endorsements and has recently signed several A-list brands.<br />
Zoya&#8217;s film will reportedly be shot across Europe, Turkey, Spain, Italy and France.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999715&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Photo: Varinder Chawla)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhi480.jpg" /></a> Juhi Chawla revealed that she had refused films like &#8216;Raja Hindustani&#8217;, &#8216;Dil Toh Pagal Hai&#8217;, &#8216;Judaai&#8217; among others. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)
<p>Actress Juhi Chawla says she turned down a lot of big film offers at the peak of her career as she thought the industry would shut down without her.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you were at your peak, you stop taking chances, you become indispensable and think that without you the industry will shut down as you are young and successful. You make foolish decisions. I did not do couple of films which then became blockbusters,&#8221; Juhi said.</p>
<p>The actress revealed that she had refused films like &#8217;Raja Hindustani&#8217;, &#8216;Dil Toh Pagal Hai&#8217;, &#8216;Judaai&#8217; among others.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all in the past, so it is ok to talk about it and you learnt from it. I think most of them were two heroine projects, so I did not do it. I am responsible for Karisma Kapoor&#8217;s stardom and she doesn&#8217;t know about it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>When asked if she regrets not doing those films, Juhi says, &#8220;At that time I was still working and I had project after project. Now when I look back, I can see that I was doing silly thing, but that was the phase I was in and you end up doing all these things (rejecting films).&#8221;</p>
<p>The vivacious actress seems to be experimenting with roles now, but at the same time she plays it safe. &#8221;I still play safe somewhere. I do roles and films within certain parameters. This (&#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217;) was something new and different to me, but I enjoyed it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Juhi and Madhuri Dixit are pitted against each other for the first time in &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217;. When the makers came to Juhi, she was surprised but found it interesting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It (&#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217;) had fiery dialogues. The character is mean, manipulative, little quirky, I had not done something like this before. I was sure people will not believe me as I am not like that character.</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked them to rewrite the script, they changed a few things, like they gave a reason for my character to be this way, but the whole zing of the character went and I felt we had killed the film. So we went with what was written initially,&#8221; said the former Miss India.</p>
<p>Juhi plays a politician in the film and for reference she saw pictures of real life politicians like Sushma Swaraj, Sonia Gandhi, Mamta Banerjee and others to know how they look and followed the film&#8217;s director Soumik Sen.</p>
<p>Her contemporaries like Karisma, Madhuri and others are still in action but she says there is no competition. &#8221;Now there is no such competition as such. I am amazed to see them around now. I worked with Manisha Koirala in &#8216;I AM&#8217; and it was great. I never thought we would meet and be there in the industry even after so many years. I feel something has not changed as they are around even as the rest of the crop of personalities like directors, producers, etc have changed. But few of them are here and I am happy about it,&#8221; Juhi added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997821&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/varunileana480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1998153" alt="Varun Dhawan and Ileana D'Cruz pose together. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/varunileana480.jpg" /></a> Varun Dhawan and Ileana D&#8217;Cruz pose together.
<p>David Dhawan’s much awaited film of the year &#8216;Main Tera Hero&#8217; featuring son Varun Dhawan, Ileana D’cruz and Nargis Fakhri is all set to offer a high octane visual extravaganza delight to its fans.</p>
<p>While, Varun plays the titular role in the film, there was a slight twist in the tale on the sets of the film.</p>
<p>While shooting for one of the sequences of the film, it was actress Ileana D’cruz who averted a major accident .Varun Dhawan could have been seriously injured if Ileana hadn’t been attentive at that moment.</p>
<p>It was a sequence which required Varun to jump on the trampoline to reach Ileana’s Balcony. While shooting for the same, it started drizzling, leaving the trampoline and balcony railings extremely slippery. Ileana stopped the scene midway, to make sure that the trampoline and the railings were cleaned up and dried before their shot could be continued.</p>
<p>“Yes, luckily I could use my presence of mind at that moment. If he had slipped, it would have been a nasty fall and Varun could have hurt himself pretty bad.I am extremely cautious and careful when I am shooting but Varun is more impulsive and just dives into his shot which is great, but he ends up hurting himself”, said Ileana D&#8217;cruz when quizzed about her heroics.</p>
<p>Ileana was quite a Hero that day!</p>
<p>Directed by David Dhawan and produced by Balaji Motion Pictures, Main Tera Hero is all set to hit the screens on 4th April 2014, starring Varun Dhawan, Ileana D’cruz and Nargis Fakhri in the lead roles.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998145&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/madhuri480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997742" alt="Madhuri Dixit is currently promoting 'Gulaab Gang'." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/madhuri480.jpg" /></a> Madhuri Dixit is currently promoting &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217;.
<p>Actress Madhuri Dixit said today that 75 per cent of women in India, including those in Gujarat, are unaware about their empowerment.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old actress said that her role in &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217; creates awareness amongst them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoyed working with Juhi Chawla who is a good artiste. The movie has received a good response from everywhere. The Censor Board and critics have loved the movie,&#8221; she told reporters.</p>
<p>When asked about are her future plans, she said that she would prefer to act if she gets good scripts.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, at present my focus is on this movie after which I will appear in the &#8216;Jhalak Dikhla Jaa&#8217; show on television,&#8221; she said.<br />
The actress evaded a reply to PTI, when she was asked about a recent incident at Bhopal airport, where she was reportedly asked to leave a VIP lounge by an airport official.</p>
<p>She avoided replying to the question, saying, &#8220;I have nothing to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reportedly, Dixit and producer Anubhav Sinha who were recently in Bhopal to promote their forthcoming movie &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217; were asked to leave the VIP lounge in Bhopal airport.</p>
<p>An airport official who had taken them to the VIP lounge requested to get a photograph taken with Dixit, when the two were waiting for their return flight to Mumbai.</p>
<p>Dixit, reportedly refused to pose since she was very tired after the movie&#8217;s promotion. The official got angry and asked the actress to leave the VIP lounge immediately.</p>
<p>Incidentally, local electronic media people including photographers were roughed up by security personnel during her visit to the new state transport bus depot located in the station area of Vadodara city.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997731&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The slavery drama &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; won the Academy Award for best picture on Sunday, making history as the</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lupitaoscars.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1997602" alt="Lupita" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lupitaoscars.jpg?w=450" /></a> &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; is the first movie from a black director to win the film industry&#8217;s highest honor.
<p>first movie from a black director to win the film industry&#8217;s highest honor in 86 years of the Oscars.</p>
<p>British director Steve McQueen&#8217;s unflinching portrayal of pre-Civil War American slavery also won two other Oscars, including best supporting actress for newcomer Lupita Nyong&#8217;o and best adapted screenplay based on the memoir of Solomon Northup, a free man sold into slavery in Louisiana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone deserves not just to survive but to live, this is the most important legacy of Solomon Northup,&#8221; said McQueen in his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>It prevailed over space thriller &#8220;Gravity&#8221; from Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron, which nevertheless racked up the most Oscars of the night with seven, including the best director honor for Cuaron, a first for a Latin American director.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/slavefilm0scars-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1997601" alt="slavefilm0scars-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/slavefilm0scars-1.jpg?w=450&#038;h=344" width="450" height="344" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Gravity,&#8221; starring Sandra Bullock as a stranded astronaut, swept the technical awards like visual effects and cinematography, a reward for its groundbreaking work on conveying space and weightlessness.</p>
<p>In one of the strongest years for film in recent memory, the 6,000-plus voters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences scattered golden Oscar statuettes among the many acclaimed movies in contention.</p>
<p>It was a good night for the scrappy, low-budget film &#8220;Dallas Buyers Club,&#8221; a biopic of an early AIDS activist two decades in the making that won three Oscars, including the two male acting awards.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/angelinaoscasr.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1997600" alt="angelinaoscasr" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/angelinaoscasr.jpg?w=450&#038;h=315" width="450" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>Matthew McConaughey, in a validation of a remarkable career turnaround, won best actor for his portrayal of the homophobe turned AIDS victim turned treatment crusader Ron Woodroof, a role for which he lost 50 pounds (23 kg).</p>
<p>His co-star, Jared Leto, won best supporting actor for his role as Woodroof&#8217;s unlikely business sidekick, the transgender woman Rayon, for which he also slimmed down drastically.</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s Cate Blanchett won the best actress Oscar for her acclaimed role as the socialite unhinged by her husband&#8217;s financial crimes in Woody Allen&#8217;s &#8220;Blue Jasmine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you so much Woody for casting me,&#8221; Blanchett said.</p>
<p>The tale of Nordic princesses, &#8220;Frozen,&#8221; won best animated film, a first for Disney Animation Studios since the category was introduced in 2002.</p>
<p>Comedian and talk show star Ellen DeGeneres returned as Oscar host on Sunday in an appearance many saw as calculated to project a lighter, more affable tone for Hollywood&#8217;s biggest night after the provocative performance of her immediate predecessor, Seth MacFarlane.</p>
<p>In the comedian&#8217;s easy breezy style, DeGeneres mixed with the crowd, taking a star-studded selfie with the likes of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie that broke the record for retweets on Twitter.</p>
<p>The big loser of the night was director David O. Russell&#8217;s 1970s crime caper &#8220;American Hustle,&#8221; which walked away empty-handed despite earning 10 nominations, the same number as &#8220;Gravity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kenyan actress Nyong&#8217;o was one of the big stars of the night, not only for her winning pale blue Prada gown on the red carpet, but for her touching speech.<br />
In accepting the first award of the night for &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; Nyong&#8217;o, 31, paid homage to her character.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is thanks to so much pain in someone else&#8217;s, and so I want to salute the spirit of Patsey, for her guidance,&#8221; a tearful Nyong&#8217;o told the audience.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997598&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Selfies are the in thing! And here&#8217;s a selfie which is all set to break all records of the maximum number of retweets any image has received.</p>
<p>Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, who returned as the host for the host of 86th Academy Awards, tweeted a group selfie with Bradley Cooper Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep and other Hollywood biggies.</p>
<p>Ellen aptly captioned the image, “If only Bradley&#8217;s arm was longer. Best photo ever. #oscars.”</p>
<p>The picture received a whopping 1,575,545 retweets and 747,963 favorites in nearly 2 hours of Ellen&#8217;s posting the picture.</p>
<p>The picture broke a record set by President Barack Obama with the picture of him hugging First Lady Michelle Obama after his re-election in 2012.</p>
<p>Twitter also sent out an apology because all of the retweeting disrupted service for more than 20 minutes after 10 p.m. ET.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>If only Bradley&#8217;s arm was longer. Best photo ever. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23oscars&amp;src=hash">#oscars</a> <a href="http://t.co/C9U5NOtGap">pic.twitter.com/C9U5NOtGap</a></p>

<p>Ellen DeGeneres returned as Oscar host, bringing a deadpan affability, and free pizza, to the Academy Awards show while still poking fun at Hollywood royalty.

<p>Lupita Nyong&#8217;o's best supporting actress win wasn&#8217;t just a major moment for the newcomer — it touched everyone in the Dolby Theatre — both in the audience and backstage.</p>
<p>Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth, who&#8217;d presented the previous award, stayed backstage to watch the category on a monitor. When the clip of Nyong&#8217;o's performance was shown, Hemsworth clapped and Theron said, &#8220;So good.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Nyong&#8217;o's name was called, the stars cheered, as did the other backstage workers.</p>
<p>When a teary-eyed Nyong&#8217;o walked off stage and into the theater hallway, Ellen DeGeneres was waiting to greet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yay, yay, yay!&#8221; DeGeneres said. &#8220;You won an Oscar! And it was such a beautiful speech. Such composure!&#8221;</p>
<p>She made the actress smile by adding: &#8220;And we crashed Twitter with that photo!&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997547&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>With seven Oscars including a history-making best director award for Alfonso Cuaron, the force of &#8220;Gravity&#8221; exerted itself at the 86th annual Academy Awards.</p>
<p>Even with several awards to go, the 3-D space spectacle was assured to be the most honored film at the Dolby Theatre ceremony hosted nimbly by Ellen DeGeneres. The Mexican Cuaron is the first Latino filmmaker to take best director.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a transformative experience,&#8221; said Cuaron, who spent some five years making the film and developing its visual effects. &#8220;For a lot of people, that transformation was wisdom. For me, it was the color of my hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thanked his star, Sanda Bullock, the sole person on screen for much of the lost-in-space drama: &#8220;Sandra, you are &#8216;Gravity.&#8217;&#8221; Bullock lost the best actress award to Cate Blanchett, the star of Woody Allen&#8217;s &#8220;Blue Jasmine.&#8221;</p>
<p>First-time winners Lupita Nyong&#8217;o and Jared Leto took supporting acting honors in a smooth if safe Oscar ceremony Sunday punctuated by politics, pizza and photo-bombing.</p>
<p>Wearing a dress of Nairobi blue, the 31-year-old Nyong&#8217;o, breakout star of the historical drama &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; accepted the award for best supporting actress. In her feature film debut, Nyong&#8217;o made an indelible impression as the tortured slave Patsey.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is thanks to so much pain in someone else&#8217;s, and so I want to salute the spirit of Patsey for her guidance,&#8221; said Nyong&#8217;o. Glowing backstage, she cradled her statuette: &#8220;I&#8217;m so happy to be holding this golden man.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeGeneres&#8217; second stint was a kind of amiable, light-footed correction from last year&#8217;s &#8220;We Saw Your Boob&#8221;-singing host Seth MacFarlane.</p>
<p>After warmly needling stars in a dance-free opening monologue, she circulated freely in the crowd. DeGeneres had pizza delivered, appealing to Harvey Weinstein to pitch in, and gathered stars to snap a selfie she hoped would be a record-setter on Twitter, (1.4 million tweets in an hour and still counting). One participant, Meryl Streep, giddily exclaimed: &#8220;I&#8217;ve never tweeted before!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jared Leto won best supporting actor for his acclaimed, gaunt performance as a theatrical transgender suffering from AIDS in the Texas drama &#8220;Dallas Buyers Club.&#8221; He thanked his mother, his date on the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for teaching me to dream,&#8221; said Leto. Later backstage, he passed around his Oscar to members of the press, urging them to &#8220;fondle&#8221; it. The long-haired actor, who has devoted himself in recent years to his rock band 30 Seconds to Mars, gravely vowed: &#8220;I will revel tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunday&#8217;s Oscars hung on a nail-biter of a finish, with the best picture race believed to be between the historical drama &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; the 3-D space spectacle &#8220;Gravity&#8221; and the con-artist comedy &#8220;American Hustle.&#8221; DeGeneres alluded to the options in her opening monologue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibility number one: &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; wins best picture,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Possibility number two: You&#8217;re all racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though the ceremony lacked a big opening number, it had a steady musical beat to it. To a standing ovation, Bono and U2 performed an acoustic version of &#8220;Ordinary Love,&#8221; their Oscar-nominated song from &#8220;Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,&#8221; a tune penned in tribute to the late South African leader Nelson Mandela. Singing his nominated &#8220;Happy&#8221; from &#8220;Despicable Me 2,&#8221; Pharrell Williams had Streep and Leonardo DiCaprio dancing in the aisles.</p>
<p>Pink was cheered for her rendition of &#8220;Somewhere Over the Rainbow,&#8221; part of a 75th anniversary tribute to &#8220;The Wizard of Oz.&#8221; And Bette Midler sang — what else? — &#8220;Wind Beneath My Wing&#8221; for the in memoriam segment — an especially heartfelt one, considering the deaths of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Harold Ramis, James Gandolfini and others.</p>
<p>Best documentary went to the crowd-pleasing backup singer ode &#8220;20 Feet From Stardom.&#8221; One of its stars, Darlene Love, accepted the award singing the gospel tune &#8220;His Eye Is on the Sparrow&#8221;: &#8220;I sing because I&#8217;m happy/ I sing because I&#8217;m free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s global hit &#8220;Frozen&#8221; won best animated film, marking — somewhat remarkably — the studio&#8217;s first win in the 14 years of the best animated feature category. (Pixar, which Disney owns, has regularly dominated.) With box-office that recently passed $1 billion globally, the film was sure to be the biggest hit to take home an Oscar on Sunday. The film&#8217;s &#8220;Let It Go&#8221; won best original song.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all just trying to make films that touch people,&#8221; said co-director Chris Buck backstage. &#8220;Once in a while, you get lucky.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though the Oscar ceremony is usually a glitzy bubble separate from real-world happenings, international events were immediately referenced. In his acceptance speech, Leto addressed people in Ukraine and Venezuela.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are here and as you struggle to make your dreams happen, to live the impossible, we&#8217;re thinking of you,&#8221; said Leto.</p>
<p>Russian state-owned broadcaster Channel One Russia said it would not broadcast the Oscars live because of the necessity for news coverage of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine&#8217;s Crimea peninsula. It will instead transmit the Oscars early Tuesday morning, local time.</p>
<p>Venezuelan protesters, via social media, urged Oscar winners to bring attention to their plight. Anti-government protests have roiled the country in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Italy&#8217;s &#8220;The Great Beauty&#8221; won the Oscar for best foreign language film. In accepting the award for his rumination on life and Rome&#8217;s decadence, director Paolo Sorrentino thanked his heroes, including Federico Fellini, Martin Scorsese and soccer star Diego Maradona.</p>
<p>In her opening, DeGeneres gently mocked Hollywood&#8217;s insularity, referring to the headlines that have swamped the Los Angeles area lately with a slightly less serious news event.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been raining,&#8221; said DeGeneres. &#8220;We&#8217;re fine. Thank you for your prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>ABC, which is telecasting the ceremony, hopes the drama of the best-picture race will be enough to entice viewers. The show last year drew an audience of 40.3 million, up from 39.3 million the year before when the silent-film ode &#8220;The Artist&#8221; won best picture.</p>
<p>There was a sense of deja vu Saturday. Just as she hit the red carpet, Jennifer Lawrence briefly collapsed in a heap of laughter, just as she tripped ascending the stairs last year to accept best actress for &#8220;Silver Linings Playbook.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you win tonight,&#8221; said DeGeneres, &#8220;I think we should bring you the Oscar.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997537&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth, who&#8217;d presented the previous award, stayed backstage to watch the category on a monitor. When the clip of Nyong&#8217;o's performance was shown, Hemsworth clapped and Theron said, &#8220;So good.&#8221; (Pics: <a title="Oscars 2014: Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lawrence on the red carpet" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/oscars-2014-angelina-jolie-cate-blanchett-jennifer-lawrence/">Oscars 2014 red carpet</a>)</p>
<p>When Nyong&#8217;o's name was called, the stars cheered, as did the other backstage workers. (Read <a title="Oscars 2014: List of winners" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/hollywood/oscars-2014-list-of-winners/">the list of Winners</a>)</p>
<p>When a teary-eyed Nyong&#8217;o walked off stage and into the theatre hallway, Ellen DeGeneres was waiting to greet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yay, yay, yay!&#8221; DeGeneres said. &#8220;You won an Oscar! And it was such a beautiful speech. Such composure!&#8221;</p>
<p>She made the actress smile by adding: &#8220;And we crashed Twitter with that photo!&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997502&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gravitydallas.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1997491" alt="Gravity" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gravitydallas.jpg?w=450" /></a> The first Oscars of the 86th Academy Awards were bestowed to heavy favorites.
<p>First-time winners Lupita Nyong&#8217;o and Jared Leto took supporting acting honors, while the 3-D spectacle &#8220;Gravity&#8221; amassed a force of technical awards in an Oscar ceremony punctuated by politics, pizza and photo-bombing.</p>
<p>Wearing Nairobi blue, the 31-year-old Nyong&#8217;o, breakout star of the historical drama &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; accepted the award for best supporting actress. In her feature film debut, Nyong&#8217;o made an indelible impression as the tortured slave Patsy.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/hollywood/oscars-2014-list-of-winners/">Oscars 2014: List of winners</a></p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is thanks to so much pain in someone else&#8217;s, and so I want to salute the spirit of Patsy for her guidance,&#8221; said Nyong&#8217;o. She also thanked director Steve McQueen: &#8220;I&#8217;m certain that the dead are standing about you and they are watching and they are grateful, and so am I.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two hours into the Dolby Theatre ceremony, hosted nimbly by Ellen DeGeneres, Alfonso Cuaron&#8217;s box-office hit and visual marvel had accrued five Oscars, winning for cinematography, editing, visual effects, sound mixing and sound editing. If the Mexican Cuaron wins best director, as he&#8217;s expected to, he&#8217;ll be the first Latino filmmaker to take the category.</p>
<p>As expected, Leto won for his acclaimed, gaunt performance as a theatrical transgender suffering from AIDS in the Texas drama. He thanked his mother, his date on the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for teaching me to dream,&#8221; said Leto. Later backstage, he passed around his Oscar to members of the press, urging them to &#8220;fondle&#8221; it. The actor, who had devoted himself in recent years to his rock band 30 Seconds to Mars, gravely vowed: &#8220;I will revel tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunday&#8217;s Oscars hung on a nail-biter of a finish, with the best picture race believed to be between the historical drama &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; the 3-D space spectacle &#8220;Gravity&#8221; and the con-artist comedy &#8220;American Hustle.&#8221; DeGeneres alluded to the options in her opening monologue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibility number one: `12 Years a Slave&#8217; wins best picture,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Possibility number two: You&#8217;re all racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her opening went over well in Los Angeles&#8217; Dolby Theatre, which had far more mixed reactions to last year&#8217;s &#8220;We Saw Your Boobs&#8221;-singing host, Seth MacFarlane. She chided Leto (&#8221;Boy, is he pretty&#8221;) and mocked Jennifer Lawrence for falling on her way onto the red carpet, just as she did when she accepted the Oscar last year for &#8220;Silver Linings Playbook.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Lawrence hit the carpet and waved to fans, she collapsed in a heap of laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you win tonight, I think we should bring you the Oscar,&#8221; said DeGeneres to Lawrence, nominated for her performance in &#8220;American Hustle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though the ceremony lacked a big opening number, it had a musical beat to it. To a standing ovation, Bono and U2 performed an acoustic version of &#8220;Ordinary Love,&#8221; their Oscar-nominated song from &#8220;Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,&#8221; a tune penned in tribute to the late South African leader Nelson Mandela. Singing his nominated &#8220;Happy&#8221; from &#8220;Despicable Me 2,&#8221; Pharrell Williams had Meryl Streep and Leonardo DiCaprio dancing in the aisles. Pink was cheered for her rendition of &#8220;Somewhere Over the Rainbow,&#8221; part of a 75th anniversary tribute to &#8220;The Wizard of Oz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Best documentary went to the crowd-pleasing backup singer ode &#8220;20 Feet From Stardom.&#8221; One of its stars, Darlene Love, accepted the award singing the gospel tune &#8220;His Eye Is on the Sparrow&#8221;: &#8220;I sing because I&#8217;m happy/ I sing because I&#8217;m free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Disney&#8217;s global hit &#8220;Frozen&#8221; won best animated film, marking _ somewhat remarkably _ the studio&#8217;s first win in the 14 years of the best animated feature category. (Pixar, which Disney owns, has regularly dominated.) With box-office that recently passed $1 billion globally, the film was sure to be the biggest hit to take home an Oscar on Sunday.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been raining,&#8221; said DeGeneres. &#8220;We&#8217;re fine. Thank you for your prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The talk-show host quickly circulated in the audience, delivering pizza and appealing to Harvey Weinstein to pitch in on the bill. She also crowded in as many stars as she could in hopes of generating the most-tweeted photo ever. Meryl Streep giddily exclaimed: &#8220;I&#8217;ve never tweeted before!&#8221; In less than an hour, the resulting image had been retweeted more than 880,000 times.</p>
<p>Other early winners included &#8220;The Great Gatsby&#8221; for best costume design, and best makeup and hairstyling for the low-budget &#8220;Dallas Buyers Club.&#8221;</p>
<p>ABC, which is telecasting the ceremony, hopes the drama of the best-picture race will be enough to entice viewers. The show last year drew an audience of 40.3 million, up from 39.3 million the year before when the silent-film ode &#8220;The Artist&#8221; won best picture.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997484&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jaredhappy.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1997471" alt="Jared Leto" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jaredhappy.jpg?w=450" /></a> Jared Leto won his Oscar for his role as Rayon, a transgender person dying of AIDS, in &#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217;.
<p>Jared Leto wasn&#8217;t just thinking about himself after winning the best supporting actor Academy Award on Sunday night – his thoughts veered from his mother, the populations of Ukraine and Venezuela and even the reporters who were covering his Oscar glory.</p>
<p>The actor-singer clutched his mother&#8217;s hand as the winners were announced, and when Leto arrived on stage, he used part of his speech to briefly tell his mother&#8217;s story as a single mother and high school dropout who raised her children to be creative and aspire to great things.</p>
<p>&#8220;She somehow she managed to make a better life for herself and her children,&#8221; Leto said in his acceptance speech. &#8220;I just want to say, I love you mom. Thank you for teaching me to dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leto also mentioned those who have died with AIDS and been persecuted for their sexual orientation, as well as the people of Venezuela and Ukraine, whose countries are currently in turmoil.</p>
<p>Leto won his Oscar for his role as Rayon, a transgender person dying of AIDS, in &#8220;Dallas Buyers Club.&#8221; It was his return to acting after a several-year hiatus.</p>
<p>Moments after his win, Leto stepped backstage into a room full of reporters and continued to think of others, repeatedly thanking his publicist and then asking if anyone wanted to check out his Oscar up close. Some people did, and Leto handed it to a woman transcribing interviews. The statuette made the rounds, being handled by several people seated directly in front of the actor-musician.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you have swine flu, please don&#8217;t touch it,&#8221; Leto joked.</p>
<p>He even encouraged reporters to take a &#8220;selfie&#8221; with the statue before an Academy official stepped in and reminded reporters that no photography was allowed backstage. &#8220;You guys want to get media, let the media do what they do!&#8221; Leto protested, to cheers from many in the room.</p>
<p>Asked why Leto felt it was important to feature his mom so prominently in his speech, he replied, &#8220;I thanked my mother because she is everything. She&#8217;s inspired me in ways that I could talk about for days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leto, who also brought his brother and 30 Seconds to Mars bandmate, said he felt it was important to mention Ukraine and Venezuela because of the upheaval in both countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have an opportunity when you stand on the stage _ you can make it about yourself or you can hold up a mirror and shine a light. And that&#8217;s what I chose to do tonight,&#8221; Leto said.</p>
<p>He said his band has a show scheduled in Ukraine in a few weeks and recently played Venezuela, so events in those countries remained in his mind.</p>
<p>While Leto was feeling altruistic, he took time to reflect on his own good fortune and promised reporters that he planned an epic celebration. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be celebrating until the break of dawn,&#8221; Leto joked. &#8220;If they only knew what was going to happen tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>With his Oscar statuette still making the rounds, Leto address how surreal his win still felt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never ever in a million years dreamed that I would be here right now, talking to you. It wasn&#8217;t even a fantasy of mine because it was so far-fetched. I would have never thought that they would give me any prize _ I never won an award for anything I did on screen until I did `Dallas Buyers Club,&#8221;&#8217; Leto said.</p>
<p>Leto left the room, expressing another round of gratitude. &#8220;Thanks for getting my Oscar dirty with your fingerprints,&#8221; Leto said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997469&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;20 Feet from Stardom,&#8221; a documentary that puts the spotlight on backup singers, has won the Oscar for best documentary feature.</p>
<p>The film, directed by Emmy-award winner Morgan Neville, takes a look at the singers who come of age amid the careers of luminaries like Ray Charles, Tina Turner and Stevie Wonder.</p>
<p>Befitting the attention that they normally miss out on, backup singer Darlene Love broke into song before the Dolby Theatre crowd, singing &#8220;I sing because I&#8217;m happy, I sing because I&#8217;m free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neville acknowledged late producer Gil Friesen, the A&amp;M Records executive whose fascination with backup singers at a Leonard Cohen concert inspired the film. Friesen died in December of cancer at age 75.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tonight, I know he&#8217;s celebrating with us,&#8221; Neville said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997462&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ellen.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1997444" alt="Ellen " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ellen.jpg?w=450" /></a> Ellen DeGeneres returned as Oscar host in an appearance many saw as calculated to project a lighter tone for Hollywood&#8217;s biggest night.
<p>Comedian and talk show star Ellen DeGeneres returned as Oscar host in an appearance many saw as calculated to project a lighter, more affable tone for Hollywood&#8217;s biggest night after the provocative performance of her immediate predecessor, Seth MacFarlane.</p>
<p>While veering away from the ribald streak that marked MacFarlane&#8217;s widely-panned stint as emcee last year, DeGeneres showed in her opening monologue she was not above poking fun at some of the film industry&#8217;s biggest names.</p>
<p>She zeroed in early in the show on supporting actress nominee, and last year&#8217;s best actress winner, Jennifer Lawrence, who famously tripped on the stairs on her way to accepting last her Oscar in 2013.</p>
<p>Lawrence, 23, who is nominated for her role in &#8220;American Hustle,&#8221; also stumbled on the red carpet on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you win tonight, I think we should bring you the Oscar,&#8221; DeGeneres dead-panned, as the audience, including Lawrence, erupted in laughter.</p>
<p>Turning to June Squibb, whom she noted was the oldest performer ever nominated for an acting Oscar at age 84, DeGeneres congratulated Squibb for her role in &#8220;Nebraska.&#8221; She then raised her voice to address Squibb as if she were hard of hearing, adding, &#8220;I&#8217;m telling everyone that you were wonderful in &#8216;Nebraska.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She joked that long-haired actor Jared Leto, a candidate for best supporting actor for his role as a transgender woman in &#8220;Dallas Buyers Club,&#8221; was &#8220;the prettiest&#8221; nominee of the evening. Moments later, Leto was declared the night&#8217;s first winner.</p>
<p>LIZA MINNELLI</p>
<p>DeGeneres saluted the attendance of the real-life individuals portrayed in the Oscar-nominated films &#8220;Captain Phillips,&#8221; and &#8220;Philomena.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the edgiest moment, the camera cut to veteran actress and singer Liza Minnelli in the audience, and DeGeneres saluted &#8220;one of the most amazing Liza Minnelli impersonators I have ever seen in my life. Good job, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Minnelli, 67, who is expected to take part on Sunday in a tribute to her mother&#8217;s movie, &#8220;The Wizard of Oz,&#8221; lit up social media site Twitter while on the Oscars red carpet earlier on Sunday, looking shaky, with a blue streak in her hair, and apparently bra-less under her blue silk pants suit.</p>
<p>Seeming to betray her personal opinion for which film most deserved to win best picture, DeGeneres declared that the final outcome of the Oscar race would have two scenarios &#8211; &#8220;Possibility No. 1, &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; wins best picture. Possibility No. 2, you&#8217;re all racists.&#8221;</p>
<p>Making her entrance dressed in a black tuxedo and white ascot, DeGeneres, 56, noted the lengthy interval between her two Academy Awards emcee gigs.<br />
&#8220;I hosted seven years ago, and I&#8217;m so honored and flattered that they had me back so quickly,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>DeGeneres, who made broadcast history in 1997 as the first openly gay lead character on U.S. prime-time television, debuted as an Oscar host in 2007.</p>
<p>The star of her own daytime TV talk show, DeGeneres earned an Emmy nomination for her first Oscar hosting stint, which included several forays in the audience. Some critics complained then that DeGeneres was too playful for the traditional decorum of the Academy Awards.</p>
<p>But DeGeneres showed she was apparently unfazed by such criticism, stepping down from the Oscar stage again on Sunday to hand a faux consolation prize &#8211; a pair of lottery tickets &#8211; to supporting actor nominee Bradley Cooper.</p>
<p>DeGeneres&#8217; second turn as Oscar emcee comes a year after MacFarlane, the creator of the animated sitcom &#8220;Family Guy,&#8221; drew critical groans for a provocative performance that included jokes often aimed at the biggest stars in attendance and a musical tribute to female frontal nudity called &#8220;We Saw Your Boobs.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997443&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Roughly half of Venezuela&#8217;s TV audience was not able to watch supporting actor winner Jared Leto express solidarity with all the &#8220;dreamers&#8221; in Ukraine and Venezuela as he accepted his Oscar.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the private channel Venevision, for the first time in several decades of carrying the Academy Awards, did not broadcast the show Sunday night. (See Pics: <a title="Oscars 2014: Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Jennifer Lawrence" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/oscars-2014-angelina-jolie-cate-blanchett-jennifer-lawrence/">Oscars 2014 red carpet</a>)</p>
<p>It was carried on cable television by the TNT network, but many Venezuelans can&#8217;t afford cable.</p>
<p>Venevision announced via Twitter earlier Sunday that it did not have the rights to broadcast this year&#8217;s Oscars. It offered no additional explanation.

<p>Some Venezuelans mounted a campaign on Twitter urging participants in the Oscar ceremony to speak out in support of anti-government demonstrators.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997419&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amy Adams wore a strapless, dark blue Gucci couture gown and Hollywood&#8217;s &#8220;it&#8221; fashion darling of the year, Lupita Nyong&#8217;o, showed up for the Oscars in a goddess look of ice-blue silk Sunday night.</p>
<p>Nyong&#8217;o, atop the awards season&#8217;s best-dressed lists as she made the rounds for &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; pulled off deep plunges front and back — and pleats top and bottom from Prada. Unafraid on red carpets, the look was full rather than form-fitting and accompanied by one of her favorite dressy headbands.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lupita2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1997408" alt="Lupita" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lupita2.jpg?w=459&#038;h=600"   /></a></p>
<p>Fellow fashionista Jennifer Lawrence was the girl on fire in a bright orange-red strapless from Dior, while Cate Blanchett went for a heavily embellished Armani gown in a light tan, paired with huge opal drop earrings by Chopard. By embellished gown we mean jeweled from top to bottom, a look she said was &#8220;heavy, but I love it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Olivia Wilde, among Hollywood&#8217;s best-dressed pregnant ladies this year, went for a chic black sleeveless Valentino that draped rather than hugged her baby bump. It was a switch from the tight green — but still gorgeous — look she wore at the Golden Globes in January. Fellow pregnant lady Kerry Washington went for pleated as her bump accessory this time around, also not so tight.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/j-o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1997402" alt="j-o" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/j-o.jpg?w=480&#038;h=512" width="480" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>Classic dark blues and blacks were joined by jewel tones, including a bright green Vera Wang for Viola Davis, along with paler looks like Nyong&#8217;o's for Portia de Rossi, who wore an ivory Naeem Khan with a beaded halter.</p>
<p>Idina Menzel, among the evening&#8217;s performers, showed off a diamond collar necklace with her black gown at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles. A few men abandoned black jackets for white ones, including Jared Leto, Matthew McConaughey and Ryan Seacrest.</p>
<p>Nyongo&#8217;s fashion goal, she said, was to wear her fashion, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to feel more present than the garment I&#8217;m wearing,&#8221; she told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Kate Hudson went full-on Hollywood in draped white Versace, while the night&#8217;s more subdued looks included Julia Roberts, in a dark Givenchy with a ruffle at the waist.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kate-julia.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1997404" alt="kate-julia" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kate-julia.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480" width="480" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>Sandra Bullock wowed in a strapless, deep blue Alexander McQueen that showed off draping below the waist and included a short train.</p>
<p>Lady Gaga was also on hand, in a gold strapless gown she wore with a long sash around her neck.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ladygaga480.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1997406" alt="ladygaga480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ladygaga480.jpg?w=442&#038;h=600" width="442" height="600" /></a></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997394&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jaredleto.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1997396" alt="Jared Leto" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jaredleto.jpg?w=450" /></a> Jared Leto won over both critics and audiences with his portrayal of Rayon in the 1980s era AIDS drama.
<p>Jared Leto, the former teen heartthrob who left Hollywood to become a rock star, won the best supporting actor Oscar on Sunday in his return to movies as an HIV positive transgender woman in &#8220;Dallas Buyers Club.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leto, 42, won over both critics and audiences with his portrayal of Rayon in the 1980s era AIDS drama, and was seen as favorite for the supporting actor Oscar. He beat out Bradley Cooper, Barkhad Abdi, Jonah Hill and Michael Fassbender.</p>
<h5><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/hollywood/oscars-2014-list-of-winners/">Oscars 2014: List of winners</a></h5>
<p>The blue-eyed Leto, who rose to fame as a troubled teen in the 1990s TV series &#8220;My So-Called Life,&#8221; has forged a career of complex roles. He played a heroin addict in 2000&#8242;s &#8220;Requiem for a Dream&#8221; and a 118-year-old man in the 2009 independent sci-fi film &#8220;Mr. Nobody.&#8221;</p>
<p>The actor then stepped away from film to focus on being the frontman of alternative rock band 30 Seconds to Mars.</p>
<p>But it was Leto&#8217;s return to film in &#8220;Dallas Buyers Club&#8221; that piqued the interest of audiences, especially as the actor documented a weight loss of 30 to 40 lbs (13-18 kg) to transform himself into HIV-positive character Rayon.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is for the 36 million people out there who have lost the battle to AIDS,&#8221; Leto said as he accepted the Oscar.</p>
<p>&#8220;To those of you who have felt injustice because of who you love and who you are, I stand here with you and for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dallas Buyers Club&#8221; is based on the true story of homophobic drug addict Ron Woodroof, played by Matthew McConaughey, who smuggles much needed but unapproved medication into the United States to distribute to other AIDS patients. He forms an unlikely friendship and alliance with the sweet and tolerant Rayon.</p>
<p>The film earned six Oscar nominations including best actor for McConaughey and best picture.</p>
<p>Leto, who has been touted for his edgy style on the red carpet, has been juggling his music with his duties on the awards circuit where he was won best supporting actor trophies at the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild awards.</p>
<p>The actor took a break from his band&#8217;s world tour to attend the Oscars on Sunday with his mother Constance as his date.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997395&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Of course status-obsessed Hollywood would have an exclusive red carpet, and then an even more exclusive red carpet.</p>
<p>A red velvet rope separated the A-list Oscar red carpet from the B-list one, which was parallel but closer to the fan bleachers. The social rules were as byzantine and strictly enforced as on any studio set. Or in any high school cafeteria.</p>
<p>_ Taking cellphone pictures from the B-list red carpet of the megastars a few feet away: allowed.</p>
<p>_ Shaking hands across the velvet rope and telling a star how much you admire them: allowed, but only so long as the tuxedoed security guards don&#8217;t see.</p>
<p>_ Walking down the lower-ranking red carpet at a leisurely pace: Not allowed, as evidenced by the guards continually muttering, &#8220;Please keep moving.&#8221;</p>
<p>An A-lister masquerading as a B-lister to get down the carpet quickly: Allowed (and taken advantage of by &#8220;Hunger Games&#8221; actor Stanley Tucci).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/oscars.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1997361" alt="oscars" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/oscars.jpg?w=450" /></a> The well-established favorites include Matthew McConaughey, Cate Blanchett, Lupita Nyong&#8217;o and Jared Leto.
<p>After a blustery few days of torrential downpours, Hollywood appears ready for smooth sailing at the 86th Academy Awards. Though lingering showers earlier in the afternoon soaked portions of the red carpet, the sun made a cameo as arrivals began to stream into the Dolby Theatre.</p>
<p>The 86th annual Oscars ceremony gets underway at 8:30 p.m. EST (0130 GMT), but celebrities were already arriving several hours before, including nominees Chiwetel Ejiofor, Amy Adams and Bruce Dern.</p>
<p>Unlike the stormy hosting of Seth MacFarlane last year, this Oscar show with host Ellen DeGeneres has a deliberately safe vibe of cheery song-and-dance.</p>
<p>The nimble and amiable DeGeneres is expected to return the broadcast to more traditional territory. Many of the night&#8217;s biggest categories, too, seem to hold little chance for surprise.</p>
<p>The well-established favorites include Matthew McConaughey, Cate Blanchett, Lupita Nyong&#8217;o and Jared Leto. Each comes into Oscar having won a parade of awards over the last few months, including honors at Saturday&#8217;s Spirit Awards for independent films.</p>
<p>The night&#8217;s biggest question mark won&#8217;t come until the very end. The historical drama &#8220;12 Years a Slave,&#8221; the 3-D space spectacle &#8220;Gravity&#8221; and the con-artist caper &#8220;American Hustle&#8221; are vying for best picture in the night&#8217;s closest contest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gravity&#8221; is expected to lead the ceremony in total awards, cleaning up in technical categories like visual effects and cinematography. Mexican filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron is considered a lock for best director for seamlessly marshalling new digital technology to render the lost-in-space drama. He would be the first Latino to win the category.</p>
<p>While the global hit easily topped the other eight best-picture nominees at the box office, the lower budget, less widely seen &#8220;12 Years a Slave&#8221; is believed to have a narrow edge for the academy&#8217;s top honor _ best picture.</p>
<p>Though voters last year chose entertainment over history lesson (Ben Affleck&#8217;s &#8220;Argo&#8221; over Steven Spielberg&#8217;s &#8220;Lincoln&#8221;), many see Steve McQueen&#8217;s brutal adaptation of Solomon Northup&#8217;s memoir as a landmark film difficult to watch but impossible to overlook.</p>
<p>ABC, which is telecasting the ceremony, hopes the drama of the best-picture race will be enough to entice viewers. The show last year drew an audience of 40.3 million, up from 39.3 million the year before when the silent-film ode &#8220;The Artist&#8221; won best picture.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997360&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>In one of the most competitive Academy Awards races, Steve Mcqueen&#8217;s slavery drama &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; and Alfonso Cuaron&#8217;s stunning space disaster story &#8216;Garvity&#8217; are being seen as the prime claimants to the best picture Oscar gold tonight.</p>
<p>Nine films &#8212; &#8216;American Hustle&#8217;, &#8216;Captain Phillips&#8217;, &#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217;, &#8216;Gravity&#8217;, &#8216;Her&#8217;, Nebraska&#8217;, &#8216;Philomena&#8217;, &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; and &#8216;The Wolf of Wall Street&#8217; &#8212; are nominated for the best picture Oscar but industry experts are putting their bets on &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; for its portrayal of America&#8217;s brutal slavery history.</p>
<p>The film is facing a tough competition from Sandra Bullock-George Clooney starrer outer space drama while David O Russell&#8217;s &#8216;American Hustle&#8217; is being seen as the dark horse of the race which could upset the other two movies.</p>
<p>With 2013 being touted as the best year of cinema in Hollywood since 1939, it is being seen as the most competitive year for the best actor Oscar as well.</p>
<p>So far, Matthew McConaughey, who lost almost 20 kgs of weight to portray AIDS patient Ron Woodroof in &#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217; is being seen as the front-runner but it also being seen as the best chance for Leonardo Di Caorio, who has been nominated for the fifth time, to take home the golden statuette.</p>
<p>These two actors are facing tough competition from Chiwetel Ejiofor from &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; while veteran actor Bruce Dern&#8217;s performance in &#8216;Nebraska&#8217; and Christian Bale&#8217;s role as con man in &#8216;American Hustle&#8217; are equally good.</p>
<p>The best actress race may not be that competitive with Cate Blanchett leading the race for her role in Woody Allen&#8217;s &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217; but previous Oscar winner Sandra Bullock&#8217;s brilliant performance in the 3D film is standing between Blanchett&#8217;s Jasmine and the Oscar statue.</p>
<p>Amy Adams is another strong candidate in the category to take home her first Oscar for &#8216;American Hustle&#8217; while actresses Judi Dench and Meryl Streep too can script an upset in the category tonight for &#8216;Philomena&#8217; and &#8216;August: Osage County&#8217; respectively.<br />
The best director list race currently seems to be divided between Cuaron and McQueen, who also co-produced &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217;.</p>
<p>The Oscar experts believe that McQueen will take the statuette home but not in the director&#8217;s category as Curaon seems to have an edge over him. However, McQueen would be scripting history if he wins the best director trophy as he would be the first black director to win the the Academy Award in that category.</p>
<p>In the best supporting actor category Jonah Hill&#8217;s sharp portrayal of DiCaprio&#8217;s partner in financial drama &#8216;The Wolf of Wall Street&#8217; is giving a stiff competition to Jared Leto&#8217;s unique portrayal of a transgender woman in &#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217;.<br />
Debutante Barkhad Abdi of &#8216;Captain Phillips&#8217; is also fighting it out with veterans Bradley Cooper (&#8216;American Hustle&#8217;) and Michael Fassbender (&#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217;).<br />
Newcomer Lupita Nyong&#8217;o is being touted as the front runner of best supporting actress race with her poignant portrayal of sexually assaulted slave in &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217;. Last year&#8217;s best actress Jennifer Lawrence (&#8216;American Hustle&#8217;) is also competing with Julia Roberts (&#8216;August: Osage County&#8217;) and June Squibb (&#8216;Nebraska&#8217;). Disney&#8217;s 3D film &#8216;Frozen&#8217; is the front runner in the best animated feature film category, which has got other film&#8217;s like &#8216;The Croods&#8217;, &#8216;Ernest &amp; Celestine&#8217;, &#8216;Despicable Me 2&#8242; and &#8216;The Wind Rises&#8217;.</p>
<p>The 86th Academy Awards, being hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, will honour film achievement in 24 categories tonight. The coveted ceremony will also pay tribute to &#8216;The Wizard of Oz&#8217;, which was nominated six times in 1939.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996965&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/satya480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996963" alt="Some of the victims, who came on the show, shared their horror and long fight for justice." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/satya480.jpg" /></a> Some of the victims, who came on the show, shared their horror and long fight for justice.
<p>Superstar Aamir Khan today kicked off the second season of his much-talked about show &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217; by taking up the grave issue of rapes in India.</p>
<p>Sporting a black blazer, the 48-year-old actor began the episode by recalling the horrific December 16 Delhi gangrape case, which shook the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the first season of our show got over, a terrible incident took place, December 16 Delhi gangrape case. The incident shook the nation. It affected people&#8217;s thinking, especially youngsters, who thought it was just enough and took part in protests aiming to bring justice to the victim,&#8221; Aamir said on the show.</p>
<p>After playing a small clipping of the protest and public outrage that took place following the incident, Aamir went on to discuss the legal, medical and judicial apathy that the rape victims and their families face afterwards.</p>
<p>During the two-hour show, the &#8216;Dhoom 3&#8242; star presented several anecdotes of women belonging to all age group, who were raped in different parts of the nation.</p>
<p>Talking about the insensitivity and irresponsible behaviour of the police, hospitals and the judiciary, many victims shared their plight.</p>
<p>The actor urged the nation to support the demand for &#8216;One Stop Rape Crisis Centre&#8217;, which was suggested by Justice Usha Mehra commission&#8217;s recommendation for speeding the justice process.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also urge my viewers to change their perception towards the rape victims, who are looked down upon in the society,&#8221; Aamir said on the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than treating the victims that way, you should do so with the accused. It is criminal, who should be boycotted. This way you will help the victim in her fight for justice,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Some of the victims, who came on the show, shared their horror and long fight for justice.</p>
<p>Aamir also talked about the case of two girls from different backgrounds, who were also raped once, but they started their life again with courage and decided not to hide their identity on the show.</p>
<p>The show also got a thumbs up on social-networking sites with &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217; being the most trended topic among the users.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996961&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gulaab480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996948" alt="'Gulaab Gang' is a commercial potboiler." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gulaab480.jpg" /></a> &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217; is a commercial potboiler.
<p>Producer Anubhav Sinha says his upcoming film &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217; is a commercial potboiler and he does not think of it as a risky proposition.</p>
<p>&#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217; stars two powerful actresses – Madhuri Dixit and Juhi Chawla as the leading ladies of the film.<br />
Anubhav does not feel the film is women-centric.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see it as a women-centric film. I liked the story and found it a commercial potboiler. I was not sceptical to back it as the cost of production was not that big. I did not think it as a risky proposition,&#8221; Anubhav told PTI.</p>
<p>The makers always had Madhuri and Juhi in mind for the film.</p>
<p>Anubhav says bringing the two senior actresses onboard together for the film was not difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not difficult to bring them on board. I was apprehensive how the film would be shot. But we are happy it has exactly turned out the way we had expected,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Considering Madhuri and Juhi were rivals when they were ruling Bollywood, there were reports that initially the two did not get along well.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were no fights or anything of that sort. There was no negativity. We had fun while doing the film,&#8221; Anubhav said.<br />
In the film, Madhuri leads a group of women fighting against the social injustice, while Juhi will be seen in a negative role as a politician, for which she was not too convinced initially.</p>
<p>&#8220;She (Juhi) playing a villain&#8230; A negative role was something unexpected. Juhi first asked us to mellow down certain things. We did it but she realised that there was no point in doing that as that is the main essence of the film,&#8221; the filmmaker said.</p>
<p>Directed by Soumik Sen, &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217; releases on March 7.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996946&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ellen480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996883" alt="The house has been remodelled." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ellen480.jpg" /></a> The house has been remodelled.
<p>Academy Awards host Ellen DeGeneres&#8217; house is reportedly haunted.<br />
The 56-year-old star and her wife Portia Di Rossi bought the Brody House in LA&#8217;s Holmby Hills area for an estimated USD 40 million at the start of the year, reported Radar online.</p>
<p>&#8220;The house has been remodelled, so Ellen thought it would have no trace of the former owner. But she was wrong. Within a few nights of moving in Ellen started hearing random noises including footsteps and doors opening and closing.<br />
&#8220;Then, in the middle of the night she heard a woman&#8217;s faint cry. Ellen was totally freaked out. She hasn&#8217;t had a solid night&#8217;s sleep ever since she moved in,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>The 13,000 square foot Brody house was built for property developer Sidney Brody and his wife Frances in 1951. Sidney passed away in 1981, but it is the spirit of his wife, who died in 2009, that is said to haunt the property and friends have convinced Ellen and Portia to take drastic action to cleanse the property of the spirit.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996880&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Choreographer-turned-filmmaker Farah Khan says the sound of noisy toys of her son is her best alarm to wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old director, who has two daughters and a son, said she does not need any other alarm to get up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need a morning alarm when you have a 6 yr old boy who&#8217;s got a drum set as a birthday present!!! Now to find out who gave this gift!,&#8221; Farah tweeted.</p>
<p>Farah is currently busy with the filming of her Diwali-release &#8216;Happy New Year&#8217;, which reunites Deepika Padukone with her &#8216;Chennai Express&#8217; co-star Shah Rukh Khan.</p>
<p>Other cast of the film includes Abhishek Bachchan, Boman Irani, Vivaan Shah and Sonu Sood among others.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996816&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[How the one sure-shot Oscar winner Frozen, its nominated song Let It Go and its celebrated sisters Anna and Elsa came about.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996526&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Melena Ryzik</strong></p>
<p>The Disney hit Frozen, considered a near-lock to win the best animation Oscar, was not always the story of two feuding but loving sisters.</p>
<p>A major turning point came when Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the husband-and-wife songwriting team who composed the musical numbers, delivered the anthem Let It Go. Performed by Idina Menzel, who voices the older sister Elsa, as a moment of self-acceptance, it’s now being YouTube-parodied by fans everywhere.</p>
<p>But the film was actually a years-long series of small turning points, as the Lopezes, who live and work in Brooklyn, described in an interview. When they were first approached to work on the film, after having worked on Winnie the Pooh, they were enticed by the storyboards. “We saw these pictures of two sisters, and one was throwing snow, and the other was delighted by it, and something about that really resonated with us,” Anderson-Lopez said.</p>
<p>But a director, Chris Buck, told them that “the rest of the story was in flux”, she recalled. “And we understood, after we saw a table read, why this was true. Most of the characters were really unlikable.”</p>
<p>They wrote some songs, but it quickly became apparent that the film wasn’t meant to be a musical. Disney reshuffled the people on the project, bringing in writer Jennifer Lee, who had been working on Wreck-It Ralph. Lee eventually wrote the script and co-directed with Buck. A week after she joined, Anderson-Lopez said, they had a story retreat in California. “That’s when we really had to go into the DNA in the story and say, ‘What kind of story sings?’,” she said. “That involves a big change. Your main character has to feel things so deeply that she will burst into song.”</p>
<p>That character became Anna, the feisty younger sister, voiced by Kristen Bell. “At the time Anna was this perfect, perfect princess,” Anderson-Lopez said. “And Elsa was really just jealous.” To reconfigure Elsa from her villain role, they wrote Let It Go. “When we first pencilled it in,” Lopez said, it was called “Elsa’s song of empowerment.”</p>
<p>But the Lopezes saw the sisters — a Disney first, in terms of lead heroines — in a different way. “I said, ‘You have a chance to make the first really funny Disney princess’,” Anderson-Lopez said. “I’m was so excited about the potential that Anna had to sort of bring in the world of Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, the goofy self-deprecating female heroines that are in our culture.”</p>
<p>For inspiration, they turned to music that wasn’t Disney either. “We listened to a lot of Adele and Katy Perry and Avril Lavigne,” Anderson-Lopez said. And then they took that fateful walk in Prospect Park, where they came up with the song. Anderson-Lopez had already pitched Let It Go as a hook — “it was about letting your past go and also letting your power go”, she said — and as they strolled, they thought about a character whose goals of perfection limited her.</p>
<p>Anderson-Lopez said she was thinking about what it was like to be a female artist “and how you have to stop worrying about what people think of you. We started thinking from an emo kind of place”. Emo is not a quality Disney is known for. But then, sweet Disney numbers are not what Lopez — a Tony winner for the biting musicals Avenue Q and The Book of Mormon — is known for, either.</p>
<p>As Oscar hopefuls, the Lopezes are occupying rarified territory — particularly Lopez, who has already collected an Emmy and a Grammy along with his Tonys, making him on track to be a young EGOT winner. But the couple has not deviated much from their Brooklyn life. “In the middle of all this, we adopted rescue cats that have really bad parasites,” Anderson-Lopez said. “That’s been keeping us real: cleaning the cat vomit off the wall.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996526&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[His first Oscar nomination marks what has been a conscious career shift by once Dazed and Confused McConaughey.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996524&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Melena Ryzik</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>There’s a private thing that Matthew McConaughey likes to do to relax, a sort of call and response with his own body, a chest-thumping, masculine-humming rhythmic trance that he finds centering.</p>
<p>“It works,” he said. “It does get the voice down a little lower.” It was a private thing, anyway, until Leonardo DiCaprio witnessed him doing it on the set of The Wolf of Wall Street and suggested that he do it in character, on screen, in that dark finance-fraud comedy directed by Martin Scorsese. The result is a scene (and trailer) stealer, as DiCaprio’s wide-eyed stockbroker is schooled by McConaughey’s chest thumper, setting the unbridled, anything-goes tone for the film.</p>
<p>He worked for hardly more than a day on The Wolf of Wall Street. But it’s one of several full-throated performances that McConaughey has given over the last few years, since he made the rare decision to stop being a rom-com leading man. That choice, to say no to big box-office paychecks and oversize-trailer perks, wound, eventually, to his Oscar-nominated turn in the indie Dallas Buyers Club. He plays Ron Woodroof, a real-life AIDS patient who became an activist for medical care in the 1980s, when the disease was little understood. Along with the 40-plus pounds he lost for the role, McConaughey’s portrayal of a homophobic rodeo cowboy who outlives his dire prognosis and his outdated attitude has made him the man to beat in the best actor race. The physical transformation (long a harbinger of Oscar gold) underpinned the performance, McConaughey said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know how much weight I needed to lose,” he said. “I thought, probably 30, and I got to 30.” “After he lost 43 pounds, and people became concerned about his health, I told him, ‘You’re crazy man, 30 is enough!’,” the film’s director, Jean-Marc Vallée, said.</p>
<p>“I was becoming a scientist on Ron Woodroof,” McConaughey said, just as Woodroof was, singularly focused on survival, starting a buyers’ club for the treatments that were at the time illegal, and going to court to keep them available.   The story for Dallas Buyers Club had knocked around Hollywood for decades. But the subject, a medical drama that by definition ends with the death of its star, was not always considered palatable. “No one thought it could make money,” said Craig Borten, the screenwriter.</p>
<p>He spent hours interviewing the real Woodroof — who died in 1992, seven years after he was told he had 30 days to live — and had written 50 versions of the script before his writing partner, Melisa Wallack, arrived. They rewrote it yet again, after McConaughey signed on, fixing it more firmly in his voice. “He became the engine that brought the train to the destination,” said Vallée, a French Canadian filmmaker who was hired after McConaughey.</p>
<p>For Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey has already picked up prizes at the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild and other ceremonies, where his acceptance speeches have been a smooth reminder of his career shift — at the Critics’ Choice Awards, he thanked his agent. “All right, all right, all right,” he’s repeated, in a drawl and a half-smile, displaying his Texas-boy charms.<br />
Those words were the first he shot on film, as the quotable stoner Wooderson in Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused more than 20 years ago, and they’ve become a catch phrase of his.</p>
<p>Once perpetually shirtless, and only a few years out from playing a stripper in Magic Mike, McConaughey is now resolutely unsexy, as a character nicknamed the Accountant, on the HBO series True Detective. At 44, he said, he is more gratified with his work now. “I do love feeling like the underdog,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996524&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Leo The Wolf of Wall Street DiCaprio isn’t tearing his hair out worrying though.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996515&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>JESSICA HERNDON</strong></p>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio is poking his head out of a poolside room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. A swarm of media outlets is lined up outside, chatting with Oscar contenders after the offical annual luncheon. Nominated for lead actor for his role as an excess-obsessed stockbroker in The Wolf of Wall Street, 39-year-old actor DiCaprio stands to gain plenty of attention if he is viewed, but goes unseen.</p>
<p>Decadence is what fuelled Wolf, a film that has gained him two Oscar nominations for acting and producing. DiCaprio has been nominated thrice earlier for Academy Awards, starting with a supporting actor nod for playing a teen with autism in the 1993 drama What’s Eating Gilbert Grape. He’s been overlooked each time.</p>
<p>This could be his year. Is he frustrated he hasn’t won? “Here, I’ll show you the card they gave me today (at the luncheon),” he says, setting aside the electronic cigarette he says he puffs to “relieve the stress of life”. He retrieves a small white card he calls “that little football chalk-up” listing his film stats. Leaning in, he points to the portion that reads: five nominations, zero wins. With a heavy chuckle he looks up and says, “Zip!”</p>
<p>He stares at the ground, collecting his thoughts. “Anyone wants to be accepted by their peers, but the truth is every year is unique and everyone is just going to vote for who they think is worthy.”</p>
<p>Nominated for lead actor for The Aviator and Blood Diamond, DiCaprio lost to Jamie Foxx and Forest Whitaker. This year, he’s up against Christian Bale, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Bruce Dern and Matthew McConaughey, who is considered DiCaprio’s biggest threat for his portrayal of a rodeo-loving Texan with HIV in Dallas Buyers Club.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen Leo and McConaughey paired off in any award show,” says Tom O’Neil, editor of the awards prediction site goldderby.com. DiCaprio, whose first big film role was opposite Robert De Niro in 1993’s This Boy’s Life, has starred in a number of films that gained Oscar attention, including two best picture winners: Titanic and The Departed. Gangs of New York, Catch Me if You Can, Revolutionary Road, Inception, Django Unchained and last year’s The Great Gatsby have also earned Academy attention.<br />
“It’s as if the old men in the Academy look at someone like Leo and say, ‘You have the money, the fame, the babes, but here’s one thing you can’t have’,” adds O’Neil. “We’ve seen a history of it. Paul Newman didn’t win until he was past the age of 60.”<br />
Many major Hollywood talents have endured Oscar snubs. Neither Alfred Hitchcock nor Stanley Kubrick ever received directing trophies. At the risk of gaining comparisons to the late actor Peter O’Toole, who was nominated eight times without a win, DiCaprio could go home empty-handed again.</p>
<p>“No matter what film he’s in, you leave the theatre and go, ‘That guy just never misses’,” says DiCaprio’s co-star Jonah Hill, who is nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar. “Watching Leo work on Wolf, I understand how brilliant he is at what he does.”<br />
He’s been particularly dedicated to the Oscar campaign for Wolf — DiCaprio even appeared on Saturday Night Live with Hill. Wolf marks the actor’s fifth collaboration with Martin Scorsese. It’s a project he takes extreme pride in, largely because he was part of its development.</p>
<p>His hunch proved spot-on. Wolf, costing $100 million to make, has earned over $230 million worldwide. “I’ve had the same mentality ever since I got my first movie,” he says. “I got my foot in this door and I am going to continue to jam it in there and grind.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996515&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Singer Miley Cyrus has defended her use of people with short height as backup dancers in her tour.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old &#8216;We Can&#8217;t Stop&#8217; hitmaker said she was accompanied by short-height people on stage for her current Bangerz Tour for fun and not because of their height, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re just like dancing, doing these cute moves and they&#8217;re awesome dancers just on their own. It&#8217;s not me telling them how to be. It&#8217;s really funny how serious people take it. And (people are) like, &#8216;You&#8217;re racist.&#8217; And I&#8217;m like, &#8217;Really?&#8217; We&#8217;re like a bunch of kids dancing around in, like, bear (suits), we don&#8217;t do choreography,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>One of Miley&#8217;s former backup dancers Hollis Jane said she does not blame Miley. &#8221;Little people need to stop being seen, in my opinion, in the media as jokes,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996348&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Singer Rihanna grabbed attention after she was spotted in a revealing black outfit.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old &#8216;Love the way you lie&#8217; hitmaker wore a transparent black fishnet dress for the Balmain fashion show  after party, reported Contactmusic. The singer teamed up her black dress with a short black quilted leather skirt.</p>
<p>Rihanna&#8217;s outfit comes in the wake of some equally raunchy numbers including a bizarre bondage get-up which she shared with her fans earlier this week on Twitter.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996345&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/suniel_shetty480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996343" alt="Suniel Shetty: It's a very mixed kind of feeling for me. On one hand, my daughter Aathiya is getting ready for her film career. On the other hand my father is very unwell." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/suniel_shetty480.jpg" /></a> Suniel Shetty: It&#8217;s a very mixed kind of feeling for me. On one hand, my daughter Aathiya is getting ready for her film career. On the other hand my father is very unwell.
<p>No films, no commitments, not even the captaincy of the CCL. Suniel Shetty has put aside his entire career and priorities for his father&#8217;s sake. To make sure his ailing father is comfortable, Suniel Shetty has converted an entire flank of his home in South Mumbai into an ICU.</p>
<p>At the moment nothing matters more to the worried son than his father&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>Sighs Suniel, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a proper night&#8217;s sleep for three months now. It&#8217;s a very mixed kind of feeling for me. On one hand, my daughter Aathiya is getting ready for her film career. On the other hand my father is very unwell. So the excitement of Aathiya&#8217;s debut is sadly diminished. At the moment we&#8217;re all focusing on looking after my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the reason Suniel Shetty has not been playing the CCL matches. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been able to practice for the matches. So how can I play? In fact I cancelled my flight to Hyderabad on the morning of the game this week. Aftab Shivdasani who is the vice-captain is far more familiar with the one-day format of the game. I do play cricket. But I belong to the old test-match style of cricket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suniel is aghast about the stories that he had an on-field fracas with Aftab. &#8220;How can I &#8216;come to blows&#8217; with anyone, least of all a guy as sweet and gentle as Aftab? It is very embarrassing to read such stories, especially at a time when I am going through a personal crisis. Right now nothing is more important to me than my father&#8217;s health.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suniel is in fact saying no to movie offers. &#8220;There will be many opportunities for work later. The time spent with my father now is much more vital and valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suniel is not the least perturbed about his precious darling daughter&#8217;s shooting schedules outside Mumbai. &#8220;I know she&#8217;s in completely safe hands. Salman Khan&#8217;s production crew is like family to us. They look after both Aathiya and Sooraj like their own children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suniel gives Salman a pat on the back for standing by Sooraj. &#8220;Salman instinctively knew the boy was being victimized. He stood by Sooraj, insisting that he will make &#8216;Hero&#8217; only with Sooraj and Aathiya. I think it requires courage to stand by people in this industry.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996339&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

We had a lot in common. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)
<p><strong>Congrats for being on Karan Johar&#8217;s first x-rated talk-show episode?</strong><br />
Was that what I&#8217;ve done? Well, thank you. I am finally in an x-rated work. Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>Well, the episode has been shifted from the usual 9 pm to a safer to 11 pm?</strong><br />
Well, I&#8217;ve to admit I&#8217;ve never heard of a chat show being postponed to a later slot. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve said anything that sensational&#8230;Oh man, now I am scared. I hope I didn&#8217;t go too far. I hope people laugh about what I say and not take it too seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Why have you called Ranbir Kapoor a &#8216;gossip queen&#8217; on &#8216;Koffee With Karan&#8217;?</strong><br />
Isn&#8217;t it self-explanatory? But when people say a lot of bad things about others I am very uncomfortable. And they smile at those very people they are bitch about.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Madras Cafe&#8217; got you good reviews? Did it get you good roles?</strong><br />
The offers did come in. But at the moment after &#8216;Main Tera Hero&#8217;, I am only doing &#8216;Shaukeen&#8217;. I did receive many compliments for that role.</p>
<p><strong>From &#8216;Rockstar&#8217; to &#8216;Main Tera Hero&#8217;&#8230;What has your journey been like so far?</strong><br />
I&#8217;ve learnt a lot about the ways of Mumbai&#8217;s entertainment industry. But not enough yet. The one thing that I&#8217;ve sadly realized is when people are working with you they are your best friends. Once a film is over the friendship is also over. This is a painful process for someone who thinks friendships for a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>How much at-home do you feel now when you are 3 years old in Bollywood?</strong><br />
Shall I be honest? I am still a fish out of water. I don&#8217;t understand a lot of things here. I am still trying to find my way around this place, trying to &#8216;belong&#8217;. Like I am told that if you are working in Bollywood you have to use accessories like wigs, false eye lashes and lots of make-up. So I do that although I am totally anti-accessory.</p>
<p><strong>You don&#8217;t have to do what everyone does?</strong><br />
You do! If you don&#8217;t everyone will accuse you of being difficult. It&#8217;s very tough to create a balance between what I am comfortable with and what people expect from me. If I have to survive I&#8217;ve to try to be a conformist. But I&#8217;ve to admit there are lots of things I still don&#8217;t understand. What hurts the most is that people here are so friendly when they are working with you and then they become like strangers. For someone like me who is very picky about friends that&#8217;s very painful. But a friend told me. &#8216;You got schooled, not fooled.&#8217; You feel stupid when you are conned by people. But eventually you come out wiser. I never want to get bitter about experiences, no matter how bad.</p>
<p><b>Do you miss your family in Mumbai? </b><br />
I&#8217;ve to tell you, my mother visited me in Mumbai in January for the first time since I came here. She had a great time. She was with me for a couple of days in Mumbai. Then I sent her off on her own journey through North India. Regrettably I couldn&#8217;t spend more time with her because I had to promote my new film. But I am glad she saw how I lived.</p>
<p><b>This was your mother&#8217;s first visit? </b><br />
Yes, though people wrote earlier that Mom visited, and I was living in with Shahid (Laughs).</p>
<p><b>So did you have to hide boyfriends and beer bottles when your mother visited? </b><br />
Not at all. I talk about everything under the sun with my mom. I am a lot like my mom. We&#8217;re very close. I take care of her financially and emotionally. She is my best friend. We talk about drugs, alcohol and sex.</p>
<p><b>I don&#8217;t see you doing drugs. The rest I wouldn&#8217;t know? </b><br />
I am not doing much of anything else either right now except working. So it&#8217;s a depressing life for me.</p>
<p><b>Has your mother seen your films? I hope she didn&#8217;t see &#8216;Phata Poster Nikla Hero&#8217;? </b><br />
She loved &#8216;Madras Cafe&#8217;. And yes, she did see &#8216;Phata Poster&#8217;&#8230; and loved my dancing. She found it cool and entertaining. I enjoyed my dancing in the film.</p>
<p><b>I didn&#8217;t think much of your dancing in &#8216;Phata Poster&#8217;&#8230;? Are you better at the dancing in &#8216;Main Tera Hero&#8217;? </b><br />
You know I am not sure I am. When they give you the movements 40 minutes before they are shot and then you&#8217;ve to learn the steps and then lip-sync you have to be a seasoned dancer to get a hang of it, which I am not. It&#8217;s very difficult for my mind and body to be in sync because I have learnt western dancing. Bollywood dancing is very different.</p>
<p><b>Was &#8216;Main Tera Hero&#8217; a pleasant experience? </b><br />
It was great fun. Most of the time I had a good time. It was like working with my family. Ileana and Varun were very helpful. I pray I get to work with such people every day. Ileana d&#8217;Cruz and I are so similar, she thinks the way I do. We both have a good head on our shoulders, although I am a lot crazier than her.</p>
<div>
<p align="left"><b>Varun is your generation? </b><br />
We hit it off immediately. Varun went to college abroad. We had a lot in common. I will not be politically incorrect. I&#8217;ll say he&#8217;s my most favourite co-star. He&#8217;s a very smart young man. And very caring. I saw how kindly and generously he treats his staff. For me that&#8217;s a sure sign of a good human being. I hope and pray he remains the same even when I am long gone.</p>
<p><b>What do you mean by long gone? </b><br />
We all have to go, right? Oh, I am just being a drama queen. If there was a television camera following me around I&#8217;d make a very entertaining reality show. But seriously, I don&#8217;t hold on to things and people. I&#8217;ve seen so many people&#8217;s dreams and expectations fall apart. Expectations mean disappointment. You&#8217;ve to try my formula for loving. It&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><b>How is your Hindi now? </b><br />
It&#8217;s still in the learning stage. But I dubbed all my own lines in &#8216;Main Tera Hero&#8217;. It was really tough. I needed help in the dubbing theatre to get it right. Everyone helped. But it was difficult. I have a lot of more Hindi to learn. The major obstacle is that people around me all speak English. So how do I become fluent in Hindi? I don&#8217;t think I can be fluent in Hindi. My environment doesn&#8217;t allow me.</p>
<p><b>What other films are you on to? </b><br />
Only &#8216;Shaukeen&#8217;. Other projects are happening. But unless they do I don&#8217;t want to talk about it. There are a lot of negative vibes around. We are starting &#8216;Shaukeen&#8217; in April. No I haven&#8217;t seen the original &#8216;Shaukeen&#8217;. The entire script has been redone. But I am aware of Rati Agnihotri who played my part in the original. Apparently she was wonderful.</p>
<p><b>You are paired with Akshay Kumar? </b><br />
Yes, for the first time. It&#8217;s a nice bouquet of costars from Ranbir to Shahid to John, don&#8217;t you think?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arjun-alia480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996323" alt="Alia Bhatt says shooting '2 States' was a breeze as Arjun Kapoor made her laugh so much. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arjun-alia480.jpg" /></a> Alia Bhatt says shooting &#8217;2 States&#8217; was a breeze as Arjun Kapoor made her laugh so much. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)
<p>From a rather dark and serious drive on a &#8216;Highway&#8217;, Alia Bhatt has now quickly moved on to a much brighter journey via &#8217;2 States&#8217;. The journey has become all the more enjoyable for the petite actress, courtesy presence of Arjun Kapoor who is no more in a &#8216;gunday&#8217; company and has turned all sweet and simple with a great sense of humor to boast.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. Not many know but Arjun&#8217;s sense of humor is really quite interesting. It isn&#8217;t of the usual kind like everyone else. He has a very sarcastic way of cracking a joke and you need to be really alert about when and where he says something. You need to pick it up quick,&#8221; says Alia who spent quite some time with the Kapoor scion during the making of this Sajid Nadiadwala-Karan Johar flick.</p>
<p>Carrying a special place for Arjun in her heart, Alia adds, &#8220;There isn&#8217;t any single anecdote or incident that I can quote around his humorous streak because there are so many of those. I can&#8217;t pick and choose one. All I can say is that right through the film&#8217;s shoot; it was a breeze because he made me laugh so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t much laughter though during the making of her recent release &#8216;Highway&#8217;. However the appreciation that has come her way for the film has more than made up for the lack of on-screen smiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Highway&#8217; was a very difficult film for me. It always had a very special place in my heart though. It wasn&#8217;t a conscious decision for me to pick a de-glam film after &#8216;Student of the Year&#8217;. It just happened, though I am glad it turned out to be my second film,&#8221; says Alia, &#8220;Now with &#8217;2 States&#8217;, there is going to be a lot more laughter ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Arjun&#8217;s company, that has to be the case.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996292&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996310" alt="Our reporter watched the film." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse480.jpg" /></a> Our reporter watched the film.
<p>Shaadi Ke Side Effects is more than just a film with a suggestive acronym. It&#8217;s occasionally witty, based on a relevant topic, and has Vidya Balan and Farhan Akhtar. Unfortunately, it also drags at multiple points, and falls short of being the classic it could&#8217;ve been.</p>
<p>Our reporter watched the film, and got a bunch of celebrity interviews post the screening. Here is the first, unlikely respondent.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_salman-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996299" alt="SKSE_Salman 1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_salman-1.jpg?w=448&#038;h=448" width="448" height="448" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_salman-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1996300" alt="SKSE_Salman 2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_salman-2.jpg?w=600&#038;h=600"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_salman-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1996301" alt="SKSE_Salman 3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_salman-3.jpg?w=600&#038;h=600"   /></a></p>
<p>After Salman, the reporter ran into Salman&#8217;s ex, making him feel as if someone was playing a name of word association with him. Here&#8217;s what Aishwarya had to say:</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_aishwarya-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996303" alt="SKSE_Aishwarya 4" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_aishwarya-4.jpg?w=470&#038;h=450" width="470" height="450" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_aishwarya-5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1996304" alt="SKSE_Aishwarya 5" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_aishwarya-5.jpg?w=600&#038;h=574"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_aishwarya-6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1996305" alt="SKSE_Aishwarya 6" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_aishwarya-6.jpg?w=600&#038;h=574"   /></a></p>
<p>Feeling confused by the multiple different accounts he had heard of SKSE, our reporter decided to go to the deciding authority to deliver an authentic verdict &#8211; Rajinikanth.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_rajini-7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1996306" alt="SKSE_Rajini 7" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_rajini-7.jpg?w=448&#038;h=448" width="448" height="448" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_rajini-8.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1996307" alt="SKSE_Rajini 8" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_rajini-8.jpg?w=600&#038;h=600"   /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_rajini-9.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1996308" alt="SKSE_Rajini 9" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/skse_rajini-9.jpg?w=600&#038;h=600"   /></a></p>
<p>Overall, SKSE falls in the middle of the road. It could have been terrible without the two lead actors, but could also have been so much more.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s another good news for Alia Bhatt, who is already basking in the glory of her last film Highway&#8217;s success. The <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/watch-alia-bhatt-arjun-kapoor-and-their-sweet-love-story-in-2-states/">official trailer of &#8217;2 States&#8217;</a>, featuring her rumoured couple Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt has already crossed one million views on Youtube within a day of its release.</p>
<p>The adaptation of Chetan Bhagat’s novel by the same name has 1,144,065 views with over 10, 000 likes.</p>
<p>This ratio of crossing one million views within a day is one of the highest figures for a Bollywood film’s trailer.</p>
<p>&#8217;2 States’ is the story of Krish, a Punjabi boy, who falls in love with Ananya, a Tamilian Brahmin girl.</p>
<p>Both Krish and Ananya meet and fall in love in college. They then decided to get married and are faced with the task of bridging the gap of the North-South divide between their parents. However, neither set of parents are thrilled with their children’s choice of life partner.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Alia Bhatt and Arjun Kapoor will be seen onscreen together. The will also be seen locking lips and turning up the temperature with steamy lovemaking scenes.</p>
<p>Saif Ali Khan’s former wife, Amrita Singh will be playing Krish’s Punjabi mother while Ronit Roy plays his father. Alia’s mother is played by none other than director and actress Revathi.</p>
<p>Directed by Abhishek Varman, ‘2 States’ is slated to hit screens by April 18.</p>

<p>Singer Kanye West is reportedly writing a movie role for fiancee Kim Kardashian. The 36-year-old &#8216;Stronger&#8217; rapper is teaming up with &#8217;American Psycho&#8217; author Bret Easton Ellis to write a film on his latest album &#8216;Yeezus&#8217; and sources say the reality TV star will &#8220;definitely&#8221; be a part of it, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kanye will not appear in the movie. Kim is definitely going to be in it. The screenplay already features her character,&#8221; an insider said.</p>
<p>The singer who has an eight-month-old daughter with &#8217;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&#8217; star has, however, not decided on how big Kim&#8217;s role is going to be in the film.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re still working on the script, so it&#8217;s unclear at this point if Kim will be a major star of the movie or making a smaller cameo but her role in the movie will be pivotal,&#8221; the insider said.</p>
<p>The singer &#8220;wants to be heavily involved in all aspects of production&#8221; and will dedicate the film to his late mother.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996146&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lady GaGa would not be able to perform in a giant Doritos vending machine at the upcoming SXSW.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old &#8216;Fame&#8217; hitmaker&#8217;s performance was cancelled by the city of Austin, Texas due to &#8220;public safety concerns,&#8221; reported Aceshowbiz. Authorities think the location will not be able to accommodate Gaga&#8217;s fans.</p>

<p>The movie &#8217;2 States&#8217; was earlier offered to Shah Rukh Khan, Ranbir Kapoor as well as Saif Ali Khan before the &#8216;Ishaqzaade&#8217; star, Arjun Kapoor was roped in, Producer Sajid Nadiadwala said here today.</p>
<p>The romatic drama produced by Sajid and Karan Johar is based on Chetan Bhagat&#8217;s 2009 novel by the same name and has<br />
been directed by debutant director Abhishek Varman. &#8221;Look at the journey the film has taken. It started with Saif Ali Khan green lighting the project. Then Shahrukh Khan and later Ranbir. After that, Karan came to me saying let&#8217;s make it with Arjun and I fell off my chair. However, when we started making the movie and I saw the final product, I thought Karan was right in his judgement,&#8221; Sajid said at the trailer launch of &#8217;2 States&#8217;.</p>
<p>Sajid said that he felt proud of the work Arjun Kappor has done for the yet to be released romantic drama. &#8221;I am proud of Arjun, because I have seen him grow. I know his dad (Boney Kapoor) and mom (Mona Kapoor) very well. I am extremely proud of him about the way he has worked in films until now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Arjun will be seen playing the role of a Punjabi boy called Krish Malhotra. &#8221;It is like a dream come true to be part of a film<br />
based on a novel that was liked by one and all. I had first noticed this book on my mother&#8217;s bookshelf. This film came to me after &#8216;Ishaqzaade&#8217; was released. I am excited to do this film and it is very much different from what I have done in my previous films,&#8221; Arjun Kapoor said.</p>
<p>His co-star in the movie, is Alia Bhatt, who plays the role of a Tamil girl called Ananya Swaminathan. &#8221;I play a modern day South Indian girl who doesn&#8217;t have any accent in her day-to-day life. It is different as compared to what Deepika portrayed in &#8216;Chennai Express&#8217;,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996135&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In business journalism circles, Jagdish Khattar, former MD of Maruti Udyog, is known to be aloof and frosty. But he reveals a different persona in his memoirs, Driven, where he comes across as a man who won over people and steered change through friendly interaction and by deploying a bevy of management styles.</p>
<p>Very few have journeyed on so many career paths —  lawyer, IAS officer, an MD in the midst of the hustle and bustle of corporate competition (though a government nominee), and, currently, entrepreneur. In the book Khattar has penned with journalist Suveen Sinha, he begins at the start — as a young and impressionable child in Pakistan’s Dera Ismail Khan. Khattar and his kin were forced to flee during Partition while his father was ordered by the Pakistani government to stay behind to look after the family’s electric supply company. The family is eventually united and is compensated for some of the losses they had suffered in Pakistan by land in Gurgaon. His father —  whom he called Babaji —  along with his uncles start from scratch by entering the civil contract business and setting up a brick kiln in Ballabgarh, near Faridabad.</p>
<p>A student of Delhi Public School, Mathura Road, when it was still in tents, Khattar played a small role in a film called Gandhi Path, which never released. “&#8230;the whole endeavour left a lasting impression on my ten-year-old-mind. You cannot constantly hear and speak about Mahatma Gandhi’s principles without being influenced by them.”</p>
<p>And was it these principles that Khattar clung on to through his various professional avatars over the years and did they cost him his job at Maruti? Perhaps, yes. The book relates instances of Khattar being asked to do the government’s bidding as its nominee to the company, and his refusal to be a walkover. He writes, “I was now summoned often to the ministry and asked to respond to various issues. I was often told that, being a government nominee, I could be removed from the director’s post if I did not do as instructed. My fellow director, K Kumar, received similar messages. Both of us thought of ourselves as neutral and professional, but the others clearly did not… On one occasion, the minister called me to his office&#8230; [The] brief was to scuttle plans that Suzuki had finalized for new models and for the expansion of capacity. These plans were to be placed before the board of directors of Maruti for approval. As a government nominee on the board, I was advised to oppose the proposal.” But Khattar did not. His conscience refused to stymie the future of a company so that the government could retain control over it.</p>
<p>While the Maruti years saw Khattar tackling ticklish union issues, taking on foreign competition by the horns and conducting a successful IPO, in the government, too, he took some strong decisions — which reflect his willingness to embrace entrepreneurship. Readers begin to understand why, during his stint at the Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Commission, he was willing to approve a quick bridge loan to HCL, when its main lender was going to take six months; or how his unconventional steps  managed to turn around the UP Transport Corporation.</p>
<p>After such a long run, he did not want to retire:“I could not see myself playing golf and tending to gardens.” And that’s where the current story of enterprise began, how he sold plots of land and took a loan to give birth to an idea whose time had come — a multi-brand car sales and servicing network called Carnation. His last words in the book are: “Life has turned a full circle: I am now upholding the family tradition of entrepreneurship”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996120&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[A nostalgic chronicle of the Indian rock music scene of the 1960s and ’70s<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996119&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The Shoe by Gordon Legge, a novel about a pop music fan in Scotland in the 1980s, Archie, the central character, remarks: “How could people get so worked up about relatives and cars when there were records? Records cut so much deeper.” The folks lined up outside Shanmukhananda Hall in Bombay for the Simla Beat contest would have agreed. The year was 1971, the beats were steady and revolution was around the corner.</p>
<p>It’s not like the young folk who’d gathered at 10 in the morning were not in tune with the growing pains of a newish republic; there was no way to ignore the socialist regime they lived under, the lack of consumer choices, whether it was soap or the music on the radio. But in the cities and urban pockets of the 1960s and ’70s India, there was a sound so big, a rhythm so strong and heavy, there was no escape from the freedom it offered.</p>
<p>Sidharth Bhatia’s India Psychedelic begins after The Beatles released their first single PS I Love You in 1962. It wasn’t long before Beatlemania made its way to India, copycat bands mushroomed all over, and if the Fab Four weren’t headed to these shores, no problem sir, none at all — The Trojans in Bangalore, The Jets in Bombay, The Cavaliers in Calcutta were more than capable of playing the latest hits, just be prepared to let your hair down. By the time Led Zeppelin, Santana, Jimi Hendrix came to the scene, bands such as The Savages and Atomic Forest were ready and so was the Junior Statesman, India’s answer to New Music Express. They were not only going to make the music they liked, they were going to talk about it too, snappy and in vivid colour.</p>
<p>Bhatia’s nostalgic narrative doesn’t gloss over the personal or financial hardships, the famines and wars. But the urban music scene, mostly made up of middle class young folk, was removed from it all — the sounds were about forming an identity at a time when the world at home and outside was in frenzy. Music was a way out for those who could afford to look away — till there came a time when they couldn’t. But before the bad moon rose, musicians like Biddu, Asha Puthli, Jimmy Dorabjee, Arvid Jayal (whose chord sequences were corrected by Cat Stevens himself) had their moment in the sun.</p>
<p>This isn’t the last word on India’s rock scene of the time, but it possibly is one of the first. What we like about a particular genre of music says more about us than the artistes we are talking about. Our choices are reflective of who we are and sometimes, who we want to be. As somebody who spent his formative years in that period and watched the scene grow, up close and personal, Bhatia is revisiting a simpler time, almost trying to relive the innocence of growing up in young India. The book wouldn’t have been possible without the internet, almost all of the members from different bands in India migrated to the US, Australia, the UK, and Bhatia spent several months locating them across the globe. A handful remain in India and some of them like Nondon Bagchi in Calcutta, Susmit Bose in Delhi, Lou Majaw in Shillong and Vispi Siganporia in Ahmedabad, are still going strong. Cities too, have changed —  Calcutta’s Park Street and King’s Circle in Bombay are no longer what they used to be.</p>
<p>But looking through the sepia-tinted photographs and newspaper cuttings about the scene then brings it all back in a rush, even for those who weren’t around then. Bhatia is telling the story about our beat generation, and there’s nothing left to do but smile and sway.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996119&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Recent books on Delhi explore the multiple contradictory realities of the once and future capital .<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996114&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two authors representing two generations stand back to back, as if ready to pace off the distance for a duel. Malvika Singh looks back on memories of the Delhi that the Raj left behind, a city of gracious bungalows built by migrants for migrants, where prime ministers drove out in an Ambassador like everyone else and their children shared the citizen’s idea of a good time, which was a drive to India Gate for ice cream from a cart. And with one eye on the future that Delhi is eternally grasping at, Rana Dasgupta regards the rattle and hum of the present-day capital with mingled admiration and perplexity. Both their accounts are true to life, though they are mutually exclusive, hinging on the turning point of liberalisation. But entitlement, the word that has always defined Delhi, is loudly absent from both their narratives. They do talk about it, but they sort of talk around it. They paint jujus of the beast but can’t bring themselves to name it.</p>
<p>In the world remembered by Singh, entitlement is a gracious thing. It consists of listening to Abida Parveen at the Old Fort, eating phulkas with a knife and fork, making Monaco biscuit canapes for extraordinarily posh parties. Dasgupta’s Delhi has left such niceties behind. His portrait of the city begins in a farmhouse whose chief produce is financial power. It ends with a night-crawl with a man on the make, a Walter Mitty figure who dreams of hitting the big time but loathes the high life where big-time connections are made. It is the sort of evening which should logically end in a five star coffee shop but is doomed to wash up at a bun-omelette cart.</p>
<p>In between, Dasgupta wanders into resettlement colonies which are garbage dumps for the jetsam of the city, the homes of the call centre workers who are the city’s newest migrants, and the warrens of wholesale markets where personal fortunes of thousands of crores float free in hard cash on informal webs of trust. Unaccounted for, untaxed, undeclared, they give P Chidambaram sleepless nights but their owners rest easy in the knowledge that not a rupee will go astray.</p>
<p>Dasgupta’s Delhi could have turned into yet another exercise in airport lounge normalism, adding to the literature of cities which appear to be grimily, grittily identical until you actually go there. Singh’s Delhi could have turned into yet another ubi sunt ode to a Delhi that senior citizens will miss but no one else knows about. They preserve themselves from the banality of genre by giving play to the multiple, contradictory, simultaneous realities of the city.</p>
<p>Indeed, Singh’s reading could be the last hurrah for a great city that is already a dim memory — the Delhi of Nikhil Chakravarty, Girilal Jain, Patwant Singh, Ajit Bhattacharjea, Amita Malik&#8230; That is the Delhi she came to from cosmopolitan Bombay, a city of open hearts and minds. Then came the bleaker city of Sanjay Gandhi and Jagmohan. And then there was the city of 1984 when darkness fell and faith died. In between, there are extraordinary scenes like that in which the author, her mother, the editor Raj Thapar and her aunt, the historian Romila Thapar, demolish a bottle of Slivovitz to celebrate the imminent accession of Indira Gandhi, the “goongi gudiya” who would become the most successful prime minister ever.</p>
<p>Ironically, it is Dasgupta, at the border between the present and the future, who explores the ubi sunt mode, which is typically associated with the past (Where have all the flowers gone? is a contemporary classic). He explores a city which is changing so rapidly that “no one can visit the Delhi they had come from because it no longer exists.” In fact, growing old in Delhi is a process of self-erasure as geographies, communities and even the words used to describe them fall off the map, and people lose touch with their recent selves because they no longer have the words to connect the dots. With that nod to Heraclitus, who established that you cannot cross the same river twice, Dasgupta dives into a series of encounters with a huge cast of characters, from business tycoons to Lamborghini salesgirls, Nagaland lottery hackers and policemen.</p>
<p>Generally, the two writers are oppositional. Singh finds the faceless, replicable branded cafe an inexplicable development after the India Coffee House, which had character and identity. Dasgupta sees the anonymity of Cafe Coffee Day as a great liberator of the youth. Singh declares the Delhi farmhouse to be an execrable attempt at exclusivity by surgical removal of the world. Dasgupta understands that it was never supposed to be organic, never supposed to raise cabbages. But oddly enough, they both ignore some of the most surprising moments in the life of the city. Where is Rahul Goswami, who sparked off the politics of reservation? Mahendra Singh Tikait, who brought the village to the capital, stinks and all? Or the Kalashnikov, which has stalked Delhi for 35 years like a living thing? In Heraclitean Delhi, it appears, it is all too easy to forget.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996114&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Movie:</strong> NON-STOP<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> Jaume Collet-Serra<br />
<strong>Cast:</strong> Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery, Lupita Nyong’o<br />
**</p>
<p>In his late-age reinvention as an action hero, Neeson picks up from where he left in Serra’s last film Unknown. Here he is a federal air marshal aboard an aircraft, where a passenger is threatening to kill those aboard, one by one, unless $150 million is wired into his/her account. The premise is interesting, and Non-Stop makes some effort to stretch the tension and to establish Bill (Neeson) as an unstable character — till invariably the invariables catch up.</p>
<p>There is only so much action one can pack inside an aircraft — even with made-for-film larger aisles — there are only so many people Bill can haul rather cruelly for questioning, and there are only so many angles you can explore over phone calls and text messages. The 150 people aboard and their back stories could make a better film but Non-Stop is neither interested in it, nor even implies this from its name.</p>
<p>Neeson’s weather-beaten, frowning grimace is complimented by an irritatingly equanimous Moore, a solemn Muslim doctor who is called upon to redeem his faith, an airhostess who is here, there everywhere — unlike the non-existent Lupita (12 Years a Slave) Nyong’o — and a tangent that embarrassingly literally evokes the air marshal’s dead daughter.</p>
<p>And just when you think that the saving grace is that the “terrorist” only wants money, the film throws up more million dollar questions. Just the ones with no answers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995919&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Dallas Buyers Club may not be the authoritative story on the AIDS scare of the 1980s, but it’s as good as any.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995902&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Director:</strong> Jean-Marc Vallée<br />
<strong>Cast:</strong> Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner, Jared Leto<br />
<strong>Rating:</strong> *** 1/2</p>
<p>Matthew McConaughey lost 18 kg for his role of a man dying of AIDS in Dallas Buyers Club. That’s not just a number. The ashen complexion, the red, sunken eyes, the gaunt face and the skeletal body — laid bare to unsparing light — tell the story of a disease that ravaged not just the body but, in the 1980s, left a scared, uncomprehending world looking at something they barely understood.</p>
<p>By the time HIV strikes down Ron Woodroof (McCoanaughey), there is little he hasn’t subjected his body to, from drugs and cigarettes to drinking, and yet the revelation upends the life he has known as a homophobic, expletive-spewing man more prone to backslapping with buddies at strip joints. As the visibly ailing Ron disintegrates, those friends quickly disappear, and he is left alone to figure out how to extend his life beyond the 30 days the doctors give him.</p>
<p>Ron bribes a hospital employee to get himself access to a trial drug, AZT, with known side-effects, and once that option runs out, travels to Mexico. There he meets a de-licensed doctor, who has developed a cocktail of drugs to manage HIV better, and which has AIDS patients streaming to him. Ron is there for three months, before deciding that money can be made of this drug combination back home. The motivation is as much profit as the desire to show the doctors who gave him no chance wrong.</p>
<p>Dallas Buyers Club is about the operation Ron sets up, giving it that name, where he supplies this mix of vitamins, minerals and FDA-unapproved drugs to people lining up around the corner. Doctors oppose him, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is at his heels, and pharmaceutical companies want to bring him down, but Ron presses on, even building up own “research”, as he calls it. He smuggles in drugs in disguises, is not afraid to ask questions when caught, barges in on AIDS support groups seeking clients, and is willing to go to court for his right to access drugs which can help ward off death.</p>
<p>McConaughey lends Ron both the swagger an outlaw hero such as him needs and, because we can’t put the image of the actor as the golden-boy behind us, the sense of the uphill battle he is waging. It is also surprisingly true to the real story of Ron Woodroof, fictional as it may seem at times in the extent to which he goes.</p>
<p>Craig Borten, who interviewed Woodroof days before he eventually died in 1992 (seven years after being diagnosed), wrote the screenplay with Melisa Wallack. Among the liberties they take is introducing the character of a transgender, Rayon (Leto). The rodeo-rider Ron is particular about disassociating himself with anything or anyone gay, but Rayon wins him over as both a friend and business partner by refusing to play the marginalised — either because of the HIV or because of his gender. Leto, equally painstakingly thin, doesn’t just immerse himself in the clothes and the makeup, he evokes Rayon’s life with his eyes. Shorn of its more heroic moments, it’s a difficult role than Ron’s and Leto does it well.</p>
<p>One of the screenplay’s other creations is the sympathetic Dr Saks (Garner), who is also wooed to his side by Ron, and who may, in other times, have had a relationship with him. It’s a character that is disappointingly fake, and the stilted Garner doesn’t help. Her doctor boss is another sore thumb.</p>
<p>That’s where the film, shot in the hand-held shaken camera style, falters a bit, in feeling the need to tick all the boxes in Ron’s life when his incredible story needed few embellishments. It may not be the authoritative story on the AIDS scare of the 1980s, but in all that it encompasses, it’s as good as any.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Movie:</strong> Nebraska<br />
<strong>Director:</strong> Alexander Payne<br />
<strong>Cast:</strong> Bruce Dern, Will Forte, June Squibb, Bob Odenkirk<br />
****</p>
<p>To make a film whose lead actor is whiskery and doddery and just plain old so engrossing is an art. Alexander Payne brings all his craft to bear upon Nebraska, but at no point does he make us aware of it. Which is why the film works so well, in its pristine black and white frames, as it moves and judders and halts and moves again, keeping beautifully in pace with its protagonists’ inner lives.</p>
<p>Nebraska is one of the nine films nominated for the Best Film for the upcoming Oscars and Bruce Dern, who plays the stubborn old man with a soft streak, is up for Best Actor. It is unlikely that it will get any of the biggies it is nominated for, but to me the film’s real victory is in the way it does the most difficult thing in the world: to reveal such life-like characters and their flaws with such unflinching clarity and deep sympathy, without turning it into a pity party.</p>
<p>Woody (Dern) is convinced that he has won a lottery, and nothing his younger son David (Forte) nor his truculent wife Kate (Squibb, also nominated for a Best Supporting Actress) can say will dissuade him. He will walk, if necessary, all the way across the vast American Midwest, to reach Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect his prize. The fact that David gives him a ride makes it a proper road movie: real Americans do not walk, unless they live in NYC. That brings Payne, up for a Best Director, right in his zone. And you can see how he has grown, from his terrific Sideways to this much more rounded, moving road trip, in which he places the old and the young alongside, and gets maximum traction out of it.</p>
<p>Part of the beauty of this film is the slow build-up to nothing and everything. Woody, who likes his liquor, is ageing visibly in front of our eyes, and seems at one point about to lose his faculties. As the car swallows up the miles, we see him coming closer to discover the truth about himself, and his relationships. Kate may come off as permanently derisive, but she is the one for him. And David, who also doesn’t quite know where he is (an estranged wife shows up briefly and shuts the door on him, but is there scope still?) seems to have come to a learning, when he says this about his father: “He just believes stuff people tell him.”</p>
<p>There’s comedy here, in the way Woody’s forgotten family members and friends start cosying up to him in the hope of getting a share of the million dollars. But it never becomes harsh or unforgiving: in Payne’s, and Woody’s worlds, the people are who they are, and they do what they do. There’s a full life as it is being lived, warts, liver-spots, flyaway uncombed untidy hair, and all. And above all, there’s the sense of coming full circle, of finding a purpose.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995900&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dallasm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995816" alt="Dallas Buyers Club may not be the authoritative story on the AIDS scare of the 1980s, but it's as good as any." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dallasm.jpg" /></a> Dallas Buyers Club may not be the authoritative story on the AIDS scare of the 1980s, but it&#8217;s as good as any.
<p><strong>Director:</strong> Jean-Marc Vallée<br />
<strong>Cast:</strong> Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner, Jared Leto<br />
<strong>IE Rating:</strong> *** 1/2</p>
<p>Matthew McConaughey lost 18 kg for his role of a man dying of AIDS in Dallas Buyers Club. That&#8217;s not just a number. The ashen complexion, the red, sunken eyes, the gaunt face and the skeletal body — laid bare to unsparing light — tell the story of a disease that ravaged not just the body but, in the 1980s, left a scared, uncomprehending world looking at something they barely understood.</p>
<p>By the time HIV strikes down Ron Woodroof (McCoanaughey), there is little he hasn&#8217;t subjected his body to, from drugs and cigarettes to drinking, and yet the revelation upends the life he has known as a homophobic, expletive-spewing man more prone to backslapping with buddies at strip joints. As the visibly ailing Ron disintegrates, those friends quickly disappear, and he is left alone to figure out how to extend his life beyond the 30 days the doctors give him.</p>
<p>Ron bribes a hospital employee to get himself access to a trial drug, AZT, with known side-effects, and once that option runs out, travels to Mexico. There he meets a de-licenced doctor, who has developed a cocktail of drugs to manage HIV better, and which has AIDS patients streaming to him. Ron is there for three months, before deciding that money can be made of this drug combination back home. The motivation is as much profit as the desire to show the doctors who gave him no chance wrong.</p>
<p>Dallas Buyers Club is about the operation Ron sets up, giving it that name, where he supplies this mix of vitamins, minerals and FDA-unapproved drugs to people lining up around the corner. Doctors oppose him, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is at his heels, and pharmaceutical companies want to bring him down, but Ron presses on, even building up own “research”, as he calls it. He smuggles in drugs in disguises, is not afraid to ask questions when caught, barges in on AIDS support groups seeking clients, and is willing to go to court for his right to access drugs which can help ward off death.</p>
<p>McConaughey lends Ron both the swagger an outlaw hero such as him needs and, because we can&#8217;t put the image of the actor as the golden-boy behind us, the sense of the uphill battle he is waging. It is also surprisingly true to the real story of Ron Woodroof, fictional as it may seem at times in the extent to which he goes.</p>
<p>Craig Borten, who interviewed Woodroof days before he eventually died in 1992 (seven years after being diagnosed), wrote the screenplay with Melisa Wallack.</p>
<p>Among the liberties they take is introducing the character of a transgender, Rayon (Leto). The rodeo-rider Ron is particular about disassociating himself with anything or anyone gay, but Rayon wins him over as both a friend and business partner by refusing to play the marginalised — either because of the HIV or because of his gender. Leto, equally painstakingly thin, doesn&#8217;t just immerse himself in the clothes and the makeup, he evokes Rayon&#8217;s life with his eyes. Shorn of its more heroic moments, it&#8217;s a difficult role than Ron&#8217;s and Leto does it well.</p>
<p>One of the screenplay&#8217;s other creations is the sympathetic Dr Saks (Garner), who is also wooed to his side by Ron, and who may, in other times, have had a relationship with him. It&#8217;s a character that is disappointingly fake, and the stilted Garner doesn&#8217;t help. Her doctor boss is another sore thumb.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the film, shot in the hand-held shaken camera style, falters a bit, in feeling the need to tick all the boxes in Ron&#8217;s life when his incredible story needed few embellishments. It may not be the authoritative story on the AIDS scare of the 1980s, but in all that it encompassed, it&#8217;s as good as any.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995814&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sooraj_pancholi480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995752" alt="The 'Hero' team has devised some intricate action scenes for Sooraj in the rugged rocky Himalayan terrain." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sooraj_pancholi480.jpg" /></a> The &#8216;Hero&#8217; team has devised some intricate action scenes for Sooraj in the rugged rocky Himalayan terrain.
<p>The crew of Nikhil Advani&#8217;s &#8216;Hero&#8217; left for Manali, Himachal Pradesh, on Thursday to shoot some heavy-duty action sequences with Sooraj Pancholi and a couple of romantic duets with Sooraj and his co-star Athiya Shetty.</p>
<p>The romantic songs to be filmed on the debutant couple would be completely original tunes composed by Sachin- Jigar.</p>
<p>Says a source, &#8220;Initially Nikhil planned to use a remixed version the original romantic duet from Subhash Ghai &#8216;Hero&#8217; -&#8217;Tu mera janu hai tu mera dilbar hai&#8217;. But with music the company Saregama charging through the roof for the original songs, Nikhil Advani has opted to get fresh songs recorded.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new romantic duet that would be shot in Himachal took some time to be composed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nikhil Advani&#8217;s films have always boasted of outstanding songs and music. He asked Sachin-Jigar to compose a romantic duet to rival Laxmikant- Pyarelal&#8217;s &#8216;Tu mera janu hai&#8217; and &#8216;Pyar karne wale&#8217; from the original Hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>The director also plans to shoot intense action sequences in Himachal.</p>
<p>Says the source, &#8220;Sooraj will do bare-backed action scenes shot at a very high altitude. The idea is to make the action sequences top-notch since the word is that Jackie Shroff&#8217;s son Tiger in his debut film &#8216;Hero-Panti&#8217; has done some of the finest stunts ever in a Hindi film. Sooraj&#8217;s forte is drama and emotions. Stunts don&#8217;t come as naturally to him as they do to Tiger. Sooraj has been practicing hard to master the stunts. The &#8216;Hero&#8217; team has devised some intricate action scenes for Sooraj in the rugged rocky Himalayan terrain.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995748&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Photo: Varinder Chawla)
<p>A major group song-and-dance sequence for Anees Bazmee&#8217;s &#8216;Welcome Back&#8217;, scheduled to be shot this week,featuring Anil Kapoor, John Abraham, Shruti Haasan, Nana Patekar and Dimple Kapadia had to be scrapped at the last minute, apparently because the track composed for the shooting was not ready.</p>
<p>Says a source, &#8220;Since the song is to be film on a bevy of A-listers composer Anu Malik, producer Feroz Nadiadwala and director Anees Bazmee wanted the song to be as perfect as it can get, on a par with the other blockbuster numbers like &#8216;Mera Naseeb Mein&#8217; from Manmohan Desai&#8217;s Naseeb and the title song of &#8216;Amar Akbar Anthony&#8217;, or Farah Khan&#8217;s &#8216;Deewangi Deewangi&#8217;in Om Shanti Om.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like they say, aim big, and you have to slog accordingly.</p>
<p>Says Anees, &#8220;We all felt we were not getting that kind of grandeur in the sound that would justify the presence of Anil, John, Nana, Dimple and Shruti in the same frame. So rather than shoot with an under-whelming song we decided to postpone the shooting of the number until March-end when we are sure to get the track that we want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Getting all the busy stars together again in March is easier said than danced. Anil has apparently expressed his inability to spare dates later. Efforts are on to somehow co-ordinate all the stars&#8217; dates in March-end or April.</p>
<p>Sighs Anees, &#8220;Luckily for us we have time. Feroz wants to release &#8216;Welcome Back&#8217; on Christmas day. So even if we shoot the song later during the year there will be no delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Anees leaves with his entire cast for a month-long schedule in Dubai from March 10. &#8221;We are all there, plus Naseeruddin Shah Saab who replaces Feroz Khan also joins us in Dubai this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last time Naseer, Anil and Nana got together in the same film was for Vinod Chopra&#8217;s &#8216;Parinda&#8217;. And that wasn&#8217;t such a happy occasion. Says Anil, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always gotten along well with both Nana and Naseer. They are moody. But I am not.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ab dekhna hai how well Naseer and Nana get along together this time.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995738&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>John Abraham, who has always been at the forefront to help anyone in whatever way possible, has indeed made him a darling of millions in real life. In addition to that, he also supports a lot of social causes, without making much noise about it.</p>
<p>One such cause to which he has now been associated with is called &#8216;Fever Voice Of Change&#8217;, which is an initiative by Fever 104 FM in order to bring about a transformation in our society, as its the call of the hour. Talking about this, he said that his mother does a lot of charity work; mostly in the direction of helping the cancer patients and that he lends his full support to her.</p>
<p>Talking about John, Harshad Jain of Fever said that John is an ultimate youth icon and that they couldn&#8217;t have found a more responsible partner.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995670&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rajinideepika.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1995668" alt="Rajini" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rajinideepika.jpg?w=450" /></a> Rajinikanth&#8217;s daughter and &#8216;Kochadaiiyaan&#8217; director talks about his akward moments while shooting.
<p>Superstar Rajnikanth may have romanced many heroines onscreen with much ease but he did face awkward moments shooting for his daughter Soundarya&#8217;s debut directorial venture &#8216;Kochadaiiyaan,&#8217; the filmmaker revealed today.</p>
<p>&#8220;He felt very awkward during romance scenes with Deepika Padukone (the film&#8217;s heroine) with me saying &#8216;action&#8217; and &#8216;cut&#8217;,&#8221; Soundarya Rajnikanth Ashwin told reporters here announcing a tie-up with mobile maker Karbonn.</p>
<p>While Rajnikanth as &#8220;appa&#8221; (father) was very protective, &#8220;he was very very professional&#8221; as an actor and this was very much evident during the making of the movie, being completely shot on motion-capture technology, she said.</p>
<p>The superstar supported her like most new directors, she said while recalling her experience directing him.</p>
<p>Asked if she would direct her father in another film, she said she would be happy to do so. &#8220;I feel blessed and grateful to direct him. If God is<br />
kind enough, I shall direct another film&#8221; with Rajnikanth, she<br />
said.</p>
<p>The &#8220;high-budget&#8221; film had been missing its earlier release schedule due to the ongoing technical processes in the making of the movie, she said adding the audio launch would be held here on March 9.</p>
<p>She said she will announce the final release date later. Unveiling its assosication with the film unit, Karbonn Mobiles announced the &#8216;Karbonn Kochadiyaan Signature Phone Series,&#8221; which will among others, have a signature of Rajnikanth on the back cover.</p>
<p>It would also offer exclusive &#8216;Kochadaiiyaan&#8217; movie content including the Augmented Reality App, songs, videos and screen-savers to consumers.</p>
<p>Company Chairman Sudhir Hasija said it took six months to create the reality app but declined to quantify the expenditure saying it was part of the ongoing research and development (R&amp;D) work.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995667&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/fast-n-furious480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995615" alt="The action series stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Ludacris, and Tyrese Gibson among others." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/fast-n-furious480.jpg" /></a> The action series stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Ludacris, and Tyrese Gibson among others.
<p>&#8216;Fast and Furious 7&#8242;, which got delayed following the untimely death of Paul Walker, will resume the production in April. The James Wan-directed film&#8217;s crew is expected to resume shooting in April in order to meet the summer 2015 release date, said The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<p>Walker, 40, who played a former FBI agent-turned-criminal Brian O&#8217;Conner in the action film, died with his friend, Roger<br />
Rodas, in a fatal car crash last year. The script was reworked following Walker&#8217;s sudden passing since the movie was still halfway done when the O&#8217;Conner depicter died. Earlier it was reported that Walker&#8217;s character will be retired in the film.</p>
<p>The action series stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Ludacris, and Tyrese Gibson among others.</p>
<p>In the previous six films, Walker played the on-screen sidekick to Diesel&#8217;s character of Dominic Toretto.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995610&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sunnyleone4.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1995612" alt="Sunny Leone" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sunnyleone4.jpg?w=450" /></a> Former adult star turned Bollywood actress is all set to flag off the rickshaw branding campaign for Ragini MMS 2.
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ragini ka naya MMS dekha kya?&#8217;, &#8216;Ragini yahaan baithi thi&#8217;, &#8216;Do mein zyaada mazaa hai&#8217; are some of the tantalizing captions that would be plastered on close to 7000-odd rickshaws in the two cities. Since these vehicles are on the move through the length and breadth of the city, it makes for a continuously engaging campaign,&#8221; informs our source.</p>
<p>Since &#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242; is aiming for a wide section of audience, a teasing campaign like this with Sunny Leone herself getting into an interactive mode is being looked at as a masterstroke by many.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had done this earlier during Ragini MMS back in 2011 and the feedback had been overwhelming. Scores of others aped us subsequently. An auto rickshaw campaign tends to gain good visibility. Sunny enjoys unprecedented popularity among the masses and the Ragini franchise reaches out to the lowest common denominator,&#8221; says Tanuj Garg, CEO &#8211; Balaji Motion Pictures.</p>
<p>However, while that happens, we would first like to see the reactions of Mumbai&#8217;s auto rickshaw drivers who will find themselves with Sunny on Saturday (March 1) morning in Andheri.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995601&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/imtiaz-ali480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995597" alt="Imtiaz Ali on 'highway': It was a huge risk as I was into completely uncharted territory but luckily it paid off. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/imtiaz-ali480.jpg" /></a> Imtiaz Ali on &#8216;highway&#8217;: It was a huge risk as I was into completely uncharted territory but luckily it paid off. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)
<p>Imtiaz Ali says he braced himself for a free fall while working on his experimental road drama &#8217;Highway&#8217; but the director is happy that the risk has paid off.</p>
<p>The film, starring Alia Bhatt and Randeep Hooda, was made on a budget of Rs 18.25 crore. Ali says the film earned Rs 15.50 crore before its release and made Rs 22.38 crore from 800 screens in its first week of release. The director, who turned producer for &#8216;Highway&#8217; with his Window Seat Films, says the project was his attempt to have more creative freedom.</p>
<p>&#8220;With &#8216;Highway&#8217; I was trying to plant a seed. How else do you create an elbow room for yourself? I want to direct what I feel is interesting not what is supposed to be my zone. I don&#8217;t want it to be narrow. It was a huge risk as I was into completely uncharted territory but luckily it paid off,&#8221; Ali told PTI in an interview.</p>
<p>Things started falling into place when Sajid Nadiadwala pitched in by turning a presenter while A R Rahman came on<br />
board for music again after collaborating with Ali on &#8217;Rockstar&#8217;.</p>
<p>Still assailed by doubts, Ali says he promised himself that he will abandon the project midway if the story did not come together as it was an open script. &#8221;I took money from Sajid bhai hoping that I will manage to return it and if I don&#8217;t I will pay him by working. I have always tried to make profitable films because people&#8217;s offices shut down if films fail and I will do everything to avoid that. This is why I wanted &#8216;Highway&#8217; to be my risk alone,&#8221; says Imtiaz.</p>
<p>The journey has not ended for Ali with the release of the film as he has been touring cities and gouging audience response by visiting cinema halls.</p>
<p>&#8220;The audience has responded and connected with the story on an emotional level with both Alia and Randeep&#8217;s characters.<br />
It is very important to have honest feedback and that comes directly from those who have just watched your film. This is<br />
why I have have been travelling even now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ali was trying to make the film for a long time and now that it has released, he says there is a certain vacuum. &#8221;There is always a vacuum at the end of a film. I was trying to make it for so long and I now that I have made it there is a certain kind of emotional gratification that has happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8216;Jab We Met&#8217; director says the lessons he learnt while directing &#8216;Highway&#8217; will impact the course of his future films. His next will have Ranbir Kapoor after &#8216;Rockstar&#8217;. &#8221;I am now zoning towards the other film. I think I will go into it quickly. It is again something that I have been thinking for a while now. It is projection of something that is very personal but it is told in a story telling type of way. I don&#8217;t know how it will turn out,&#8221; says Ali.</p>
<p>The director says he has to begin from zero as the previous versions of the story were lost when his computer crashed.<br />
&#8220;All the other versions have been erased and I have to begin from zero which in a way is good. I will be able to recall what is important while the decorations would be gone. I am glad about it.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995590&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a senior police official, a letter in this regard was received at the two cineplexes in which the sender asks the management not to screen a film produced by Balaji Telefilms &#8220;as it is against Hindu culture&#8221;.</p>
<p>According to reports the film in question is adult film star turned actress Sunny Leone&#8217;s second Bollywood film &#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242;, which is produced by Balaji head Ekta Kapoor, was an instant sensation ever since the film&#8217;s first theatrical trailer. &#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242; has explicit scenes by the former adult film star. The film is slated to release on March 21.</p>
<p>Efforts are being made to identify the sender, police said. (With PTI inputs)</p>

<p>Filmmaker Karan Johar has denied reports of signing Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh for his most talked about project &#8216;Shuddhi&#8217;.</p>
<p>The film initially had Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor Khan in the lead, but later both of them walked out of the project.</p>
<p>There were reports that Ranveer and Deepika might replace Hrithik and Kareena in &#8216;Shuddhi&#8217;.</p>
<p>When asked if Ranveer and Deepika would be doing &#8216;Shuddhi&#8217;, Karan said, &#8220;No they are not finalised.&#8221;</p>
<p>He refused to divulge any further details.</p>
<p>A few days back Karan had announced that &#8216;Shuddhi&#8217; will release in 2015 and the star cast will be finalised soon.</p>
<p>The film got postponed due to Hrithik&#8217;s health. But, later the actor surprised everyone by saying he won&#8217;t be doing &#8216;Shuddhi&#8217;. Kareena too bowed out of the project since it was getting delayed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995479&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>With just two days left for the 86th Academy Awards, we bring you a list of what to expect at this year&#8217;s Oscar night.</p>
<p>1. The 2014 Oscar Awards will be produced by Neil Meron for the second time along with partner Craig Zadan. After Seth MacFarlene hosted last year’s Oscar night, chat-show host Ellen Degeneres is sure to have the Dolby Theatre roaring with laughter at her jokes and antics.</p>
<p>2) This year&#8217;s theme at the Oscars is &#8216;Heroes&#8217;. Special presentations will honor animated heroes, those from real life (such as Nelson Mandela) and popular heroes.</p>

<p>3) Singer Bette Midler will be making her Oscar debut at this year’s Academy Awards. Though the songstress has been nominated for the Oscars before, this will be the first time that Bette will be performing in her five-decade-long career.</p>
<p>4)    The other performances include the four Oscar nominated songs – ‘Happy’, ‘Let It Go’, ‘The Moon Song’ and ‘Ordinary Love’, performed by Pharrell Williams, Idina Menzel, Karen O, and U2. ‘Just Give Me a Reason’ singer, Pink is also said to take to the Oscar stage, however, the nature of her performance is unknown.</p>

<p>5)    There will be a celebration of the 75th anniversary of 1939, the year which is considered the Best Movie Year Ever. A tribute will be paid to the best film of that year, ‘The Wizard of Oz’.</p>
<p>6)    This year, student filmmakers will pass out the statuettes. The college students competed for the honor by submitting their own projects.</p>
<p>7)    The 2014 Oscars will see a number of rising young stars who will take the stage to present awards or introduce film clips. These include Zac Efron, Andrew Garfield, Chris Hemsworth, Anna Kendrick, Channing Tatum and Emma Watson.</p>

<p>8)    There will also be some veteran stars who will present awards including Sidney Poitier who will be marking the 50th anniversary of his Oscar win for ‘Lilies in the Field’, which made him the first black actor to win an Oscar for a leading role. Kim Novak who seldom makes public appearance will also take the stage. Another familiar face will be Bill Murray whose only previous appearance as an Oscar presenter was 10 years ago.</p>
<p>9)    After being snubbed for his previous Oscar nominated performances, Leonardo DiCaprio is predicted to take home the Best Actor Award for ‘Wolf of Wall Street’.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nebraska.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995460" alt="Neberaska" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/nebraska.jpg" /></a> Alexander Payne brings all his craft to bear upon ‘Nebraska’, but at no point does he make us aware of it.
<p>Cast: Bruce Dern, Will Forte, June Squibb, Bob Odenkirk<br />
Director : Alexander Payne<br />
IE Rating: ****</p>
<p>To make a film whose lead actor is whiskery and doddery and just plain old so engrossing is an art. Alexander Payne brings all his craft to bear upon ‘Nebraska’, but at no point does he make us aware of it. Which is why the film works so well, in its pristine black and white frames, as it moves and judders and halts and moves again, keeping beautifully in pace with its protagonists’ inner lives.</p>
<p>‘Nebraska’ is one of the 9 films nominated for the Best Film for the upcoming Oscars and Bruce Dern, who plays the stubborn old man with a soft streak, is up for Best Actor. It is unlikely that it will get any of the biggies it is nominated for, but to me to the film’s real victory is in the way it does the most difficult thing in the world : to reveal such life-like characters and their flaws with such unflinching clarity and deep sympathy without turning it into a pity party.</p>
<p>Woody (Dern) is convinced that he has won a lottery, and nothing his younger son David ( Forte) nor his truculent wife Kate (Squibb, also nominated for a Best Supporting Actress) can say will dissuade him. He will walk, if necessary, all the way across the vast American Midwest, to reach Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect his prize. The fact that David gives him a ride makes it a proper road movie : real Americans do not walk, unless they live in NYC. That brings Payne, up for a Best Director, right in his zone. And you can see how he has grown, from his terrific ‘Sideways’ to this much more rounded, moving road trip, in which he places the old and the young alongside, and gets maximum traction out of it.</p>
<p>Part of the beauty of this film is the slow-build up to nothing and everything. Woody, who likes his liquor, is ageing visibly in front of our eyes, and seems at one point about to lose his faculties. As the car swallows up the miles, we see him coming closer to discover the truth about himself, and his relationships. Kate may come off as permanently derisive, but she is the one for him. And David, who also doesn’t quite know where he is ( an estranged wife shows up briefly and shuts the door on him, but is there scope there still? ), seems to have come to a learning when he says this about his father: “He just believes stuff people tell him.”</p>
<p>There’s comedy here, in the way Woody’s forgotten family members and friends start cosying up to him in the hope of getting a share of the million dollars. But it never becomes harsh or unforgiving : in Payne’s, and Woody’s worlds, the people are who they are, and they do what they do. There’s a full life as it is being lived, warts, liver-spots, flyaway uncombed untidy hair, and all. And above all, there’s the sense of coming full circle, of finding a purpose.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995459&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/arjunalia.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995454" alt="Arjun Alia" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/arjunalia.jpg" /></a> &#8217;2 States&#8217; is an adaptation of Chetan Bhagat’s novel by the same name.
<p>The trailer of ‘2 States’ is finally out and already seems to be a hit. The film is an adaptation of Chetan Bhagat’s novel by the same name.</p>
<p>&#8217;2 States&#8217; is said to tell the tale of Krish, a Punjabi boy, who falls in love with Ananya, a Tamilian Brahmin girl.</p>
<p>Both Krish and Ananya meet and fall in love in college. They then decided to get married and are faced with the task of bridging the gap of the North-South divide between their parents. However, neither set of parents are thrilled with their children’s choice of life partner.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Alia Bhatt and Arjun Kapoor will be seen onscreen together. Not only do the duo lock lips, but also turn up the temperature with some steamy lovemaking scenes.</p>
<p>Saif Ali Khan’s former wife, Amrita Singh will be playing Krish’s Punjabi mother while Ronit Roy plays his father. Alia’s mother is played by none other than director and actress Revathi.</p>
<p>The dialogues between the south and north Indian mothers is also hillarious.</p>
<p>Directed by Abhishek Varman, ‘2 States’ is slated to hit screens by April 18.</p>
<p>Watch the trailer:<br />

		<description><![CDATA[With her second film Highway opening to rave reviews, Alia Bhatt says that the film made her touch upon a plethora of feelings, leaving her emotionally drained. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995382&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/alia4801.jpg"><img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/alia4801.jpg" alt="Alia Bhatt talks about &#039;Highway&#039;" class="size-full wp-image-1992799" /></a> Alia Bhatt talks about &#8216;Highway&#8217;
<p>For all her prim-n-propah demeanour, there’s something endearing about Alia Bhatt — and that’s her childlike glee. She’s perhaps the youngest among the new-gen lot of actors in the Hindi film industry, but definitely one who knows where she is heading to. One of the most sought-after newbies, Alia in true Bhatt style sets her own rules and speaks her mind. The confidence with which she fends off questions that at times can be too intrusive can take you by surprise. That innate maturity is evident when you watch her in <em>Highway</em>, where she tackles some heart-wrenching scenes with utmost ease. It wasn’t all that easy, admits the actress, fessing up to being emotionally drained by the end of the film. In a candid chat-a-thon with <em>Screen</em>, the Bhatt gal gets talking about getting under the skin of her character Veera, the pressure of being an actor and the advice her father, film-maker Mahesh Bhatt gives her. Excerpts:</p>
<p><strong>After the starry debut in Karan Johar’s Student Of The Year(SOTY), you went the extreme end with your second film, Highway. How did that feel to you?</strong></p>
<p>It was actually one of the most exciting experiences for me, because there was travelling in <em>Highway</em>, and the route that we took in the film wasn’t the regular tourist route. We’ve shot in isolated areas. It was exciting because I didn’t know what to expect from a particular place, and the weather conditions would keep changing. We also had to constantly worry about the time, mostly about shooting before the sun set. All of it made the process more spontaneous and thrilling. There were times when we would create dialogues on the set, since the shot would take inspiration from the location, and I enjoyed that the most. One of my favourite shots in the film involves one of these spontaneous moments, when the location was pretty and Imtiaz (Ali, director) said, ‘Let’s just take one shot here’. I enjoyed it because when you get dialogues on the spot, it’s spontaneous and looks real.</p>
<p><strong>Did the film demand a lot from you in terms of getting the character Veera right?</strong></p>
<p>Every role is challenging. Playing Shanaya in <em>SOTY</em> was also challenging as I didn’t know how to walk in heels, so I learnt to be more poised. But <em>Highway</em> was definitely challenging for me, physically, and emotionally. I didn’t really prepare for it. Imtiaz wanted me to be as raw and untouched as possible. I had to be like a blank sheet of paper, ready to be written on, so the blanker the page, the better. The only thing I probably did was to take a few diction classes as I play a Delhi girl, so I had to work on my Hindi. Apart from that, it was physically and emotionally exhausting, I had to push myself a lot, because it was a road trip. But it was all in a good way. You learn a lot when you’re challenged at every step.</p>
<p><strong>The film was an emotional journey. How did you cope with that?</strong></p>
<p>There was a lot of physical exhaustion. I had to run and spend hours in a truck, so my body would hurt, but that only helped in my performance as I didn’t have to pretend I was fine. The film required a body language that had to be battered and bruised. I didn’t have to act. It was more emotionally draining, because (like you saw in the film) Veera experiences a plethora of emotions. And since I’m playing that character, I experienced every emotion that she felt. Bringing those emotions out in the open was difficult as you learn to conceal your emotions and keep everything inside you, when living in a metropolitian city. For those 52 days that we were shooting, my emotions were out there.</p>
<p><strong>So, has working on Highway taught you to express your emotions more freely?</strong></p>
<p>What I’ve learned from Imtiaz as a person, and of course, from this film, is to not be fake. As actors, we always play a character onscreen, and even off-screen, in interviews, or at parties; there’s a certain way in which actors are expected to behave. But I can never do that. And this film, further undid the fakeness out of me.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve shot in six different states for Highway. Which was the most memorable experience?</strong></p>
<p>Every location is special to me for different reasons, except for Delhi as I hurt myself a lot while shooting there. Sambar in Rajasthan was special, because I celebrated my birthday there, and there was a time during the shoot when I was very content with the place I was in. I loved being in Punjab because I got to do things like running in the fields, like Kajol from <em>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</em> but of course, I didn’t look as beautiful as she did in the film. Himachal Pradesh was lovely as I love mountains. At a place called Kaza in HP, we couldn’t find anything to eat at night, and survived on a mixture of Maggi (noodles) and pulao, but that was the best meal I’ve had throughout the shoot. The whole experience of shooting in six different states stays as one long journey.</p>
<p><strong>Since you made a debut in a Karan Johar film, do you seek advice from him when it comes to films?</strong></p>
<p>Karan is the first person I’d probably call up and say that I’ve got this offer and want to talk to you about it. He is my mentor. I do have a three-film deal with Dharma Productions and I am their talent for the next five years, so it seems natural that he’s the person I can fall back on if I need advice on anything.</p>
<p><strong>What role does your father (Mahesh Bhatt) play in your career choices?</strong></p>
<p>My father is not involved in the professional decisions, but he’s involved in the sense that he knows what I’m up to. He keeps a track of it, because films are his interest. When I was in school, he was never interested in my studies, but now he knows where I’m going, what film I am shooting for, because it interests him. Moreover, he keeps advising me on how I should be. In the sense that, he’s told me to keep my head on my shoulders. But the best thing he’s told me is that — ‘All of us have a constant need to be successful, but nothing fails more than success. When you start feeling like you’ve arrived, that’s when you fail.’</p>
<p><strong>Who else do you confide in?</strong></p>
<p>My sister Shaheen is someone I can talk to about anything. If I want some advice, I ask her as she’s not easy to please. Even my father feels very satisfied when Shaheen likes something, he feels his toughest audience is convinced.</p>
<p><strong>Coming to films, tell us about your equation with your co-stars so far, especially Randeep Hooda as he’s unlike any of your co-stars before Highway?</strong></p>
<p>Randeep is a great actor. He had the most difficult character (Mahabir Bhati) to enact, but he did it so well. To be able to express your emotions with a lot of silence is difficult. I’ve learnt a lot from him; it’s always nice to work with actors who you can learn from. That’s why I keep saying I want to work with Ranbir Kapoor, because he’s such a fantastic actor. When you work with good actors, somehow you tend to get better too! Then of course, Varun (Dhawan) and Sid (Malhotra) will always be special, because I did my first film with them. Arjun (Kapoor) also, has a very special place in my life. When we were shooting for <em>2 States</em>, I was in the middle of my shoot for <em>Highway</em>, that’s when he became a very good friend of mine because I could talk to him about what I felt.</p>
<p><strong>How are you coping with stardom, which also includes the paparazzi?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve achieved stardom, and if this is stardom then I’m disappointed (<em>laughs</em>). It’s true that there has been a sudden growth in the paparazzi in the recent past. As for privacy being invaded, it can be invaded only if you let them cross that border. Everybody can draw a line, which I’ve also drawn, and no matter how close someone comes, they cannot cross that border. But, now, there’s a lot of pressure to look good which I don’t like, because I don’t think anybody can look good all the time, especially when you get down from a flight after sleeping for hours. I don’t mind being clicked unless I’m not looking good.</p>
<p><strong>Any plans of working in a film by your father’s production house, considering your mother (Soni Razdan) is a director too?</strong></p>
<p>I feel like there’s a right moment and a right time for a particular script. It’s a big deal for me to work with my father’s production, so it should be done right. And I’m waiting for the right film to come along for that. My mother and me, have had several discussions about doing something together, and I’m sure, God-willing, that will happen soon.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your upcoming projects — 2 States (based on Chetan Bhagat’s book) and Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve finished shooting for 2 States, where I play a South Indian girl. My character is similar to the character in Chetan Bhagat’s book. She’s not been portrayed as a typical South Indian girl with an accent. I am shown speaking Tamil at home in the film, so I had to learn a bit of it. It was fun, even though I didn’t understand what I was speaking. In<em> Humpty Sharma&#8230;</em>, I play a Punjabi girl, and that’s all I can say about it. The shoot is halfway through.<br />

<p>Dino Morea, who is back after completing a six-month acting course with Delhi-based theatre director N. K. Sharma, is now looking out for performance-oriented roles in films. The actor said he is eyeing a very interesting character in Sanjay Gupta’s <em>Mumbai Saga</em> which will take off in May. “I first want Sanjay to take my look test and only if he signs me will I talk about the role. I have made a portfolio with different looks and am approaching producers and directors to show that I am interested in taking on new challenges,” said Morea who was last seen in Gupta’s <em>Acid Factory</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Purab Kohli plays a water diviner in Jal</strong></p>
<p>The first look of Purab Kohli in Girish Malik’s <em>Jal</em> was out recently. The actors plays a water diviner (one who searches for water) in the film which talks about the water problems in Kutch. Kohli’s character Bakka is gifted with a special ability to find water in the desert, and the actor had to don the avatar of a traditional Kutchi man. “The toughest part was getting the body language and accent of people living in Kutch right and learning how to ride a camel. All this required about a week of observing and living with the natives of Kutch. Otherwise, growing my hair and beard was easy, as was wearing a<em> dhoti</em>, as it is one of the most comfortable garments,” said the actor.<br />
Meanwhile, Purab will also surprise all in his upcoming film, <em>Shaadi Ke Side Effects</em>, in which he plays a nerd techie, who is Vidya Balan’s neighbour. “It is a special appearance with two-three scenes. I am this guy who stumbles into Vidya’s life and drives Farhan Akhtar crazy,” informed the actor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/high2671.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995374" alt="Highway" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/high2671.jpg" /></a> Highway
<p>Imtiaz Ali’s <em>Highway</em>, starring Alia Bhatt and Randeep Hooda, may have received rave reviews, but that hasn’t translated into great collections at the box-office. The good thing, however, is that the film is performing well at multiplexes. Despite a modest release of 800 screens, it’s catering well to the niche audience that it was aimed for. Meanwhile, <em>Gunday</em> continues to do well at single screens in its second week, but faces tough competition from <em>Highway</em> at the plexes.</p>
<p><strong>Highway gets lukewarm response</strong></p>
<p>Though <em>Highway</em> started slow on Friday, the business picked up through positive word-of-mouth. It managed to do decent business, considering it only released in 800 screens. Says trade expert Taran Adarsh, “The strategy to have a limited release goes in the film’s favour, as it’s done well in urban centres, while it’s not been up to the mark in mass-dominated circuits.” 75 per cent of the film’s business came from Delhi-NCR-Punjab and Mumbai centres. It managed to garner Rs.13.99 crore in its opening weekend. “The Sunday collections of <em>Highway</em> showed a decent growth. But that’s not enough to slot the film as an earner with as much as Rs.30 crore as its budget,” adds trade expert Vinod Mirani. Yet it’s still early to say if it would recover its cost and make money for the distributors and exhibitors.<br />
Sanjay Dalia, President, Cinemax India Ltd, however, is positive. “The night shows went houseful, and the film continued to maintain footfalls even on Monday. It will sustain because there’s a lot of positive word-of-mouth surrounding it,” he predicts. Meanwhile, other films like <em>Darr @ The Mall</em> and <em>Dee Saturday</em> have failed. “<em>Darr @ The Mall</em> has fared poorly with its day-to-day collections barely touching a crore mark. The film collected Rs.3.2 crore in its opening weekend,” adds Mirani.</p>
<p><strong>Gunday makes the Rs.100 crore cut</strong></p>
<p>After a flying start, <em>Gunday</em> continued to perform well throughout the week, with its first week collections coming up to Rs.82 crore nett. It, however, has already touched the Rs. 100-crore mark worldwide. “<em>Gunday</em> is still doing well at single screens, but is facing the heat from <em>Highway</em> at the plexes,” says Adarsh while Mirani, who believes the male bonding theme worked for the film, says, “<em>Gunday</em> proved again that films on male bonding, friendships don’t usually fail. Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor have consolidated their positions.”<br />
As for Hollywood films, <em>Pompeii 3D</em> and <em>The Monuments Men</em> which released last week failed to create an impact despite the fact that <em>The Monuments Men</em> had actors like George Clooney and Matt Damon in it. According to trade expert Girish Johar, these films did not affect the collections of the Hindi releases.</p>
<p><strong>Great expectations from Shaadi Ke Side Effects</strong></p>
<p>After a lukewarm response to <em>Highway</em>, all eyes are set for <em>Shaadi Ke Side Effects</em>. With actors like Vidya Balan and Farhan Akhtar on board, it’s no surprise that there are a lot of expectation from it. There’s a good buzz surrounding the film so far; the film’s promos too have been appreciated. “The film will take a good opening, considering the heavy promotions and reactions to the trailer. The advantage is that because of its subject, it should work well in both single-screens and multiplexes,” predicts Dalia. Keep watching this space to see if <em>Shaadi Ke Side Effects</em> delivers as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Screen Forecast</strong></p>
<p><em>Our Verdict</em></p>
<p>In <em>Screen</em> dated February 21-27, 2013, we predicted that owing to the unusual pairing of Alia Bhatt-Randeep Hooda, and A.R. Rahman’s music which had gained popularity, <em>Highway</em> would have a decent opening of 65-70 per cent. Though the film had a relatively low opening, that of 40 per cent. We predicted that it will hold well, especially in urban centres, if there’s positive word-of-mouth. We’d also mentioned that in case <em>Highway</em> doesn’t have a universal appeal, it will face stiff competition from <em>Shaadi Ke Side Effects</em>, which even the exhibitors-distributors are gung-ho about.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995371&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Zoya Akhtar’s next after <em>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</em> has been in the news for quite sometime. The director has finally confirmed that her upcoming film has been titled<em> Dil Dhadakne Do</em>. The film stars Anil Kapoor, Farhan Akhtar, Anushka Sharma with Ranveer Singh and Priyanka Chopra playing siblings. When contacted, Zoya confirmed the same and said,”Yes, we have confirmed the title <em>Dil Dhadakne Do</em> for our film. It is about a dysfunctional Punjabi family and will hit the screens on June 5, 2015. At this point, I can’t reveal anything more.” Her brother and actor Farhan also confirmed the film’s title and release date on a microblogging site last weekend. Sources close to the project stated that Akhtar is currently in talks with a few actresses, including Madhuri Dixit &#8211; Nene and Tabu, for a role opposite Kapoor in the film. Scheduled to go on floors in May, it will be shot extensively on a cruise liner in various locations in Europe including Spain and Turkey among others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Xpose to release on May 16</strong></p>
<p>Himesh Reshammiya will return to acting yet again, with <em>The Xpose</em>. Directed by Ananth Narayan Mahadevan, the film is a murder suspense music thriller, set in the late 1960s. Reshammiya has an all-new avatar for it, as he&#8217;s shed oodles of weight. He will play a suspended cop-turned-music superstar in the film, a character apparently inspired by yesteryear actor Raajkumar. The film also stars Yo Yo Honey Singh with Irrfan making a special appearance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apoorva Lakhia denies film on Dawood’s sister, Haseena Parker</strong></p>
<p>Director Apoorva Lakhia has said that he is not making a film on Dawood Ibrahim’s sister Haseena Parker also known as the lady don of Nagpada in Mumbai. “I am not making a film on Haseena. Since I have a penchant for the genre, I was asked by the media, why don’t I make a gangster film on Dawood or his sister. I said I would love to and it was erroneously reported that I was making a film on her,” said Lakhia.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/skse-3.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-1995780" alt="SKSE" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/skse-3.jpg?w=450" /></a> &#8216;Shaadi Ke Side Effects&#8217; is fun, and real, and has some nice laugh-out-loud situations.
<p>Cast: Farhan Akhtar, Vidya Balan, Ram Kapoor, Vir Das,Purab Kohli, Ila Arun, Rati Agnihotri<br />
Director : Saket Chaudhary<br />
IE Rating: ** 1/2</p>
<p>What’s the next step, after &#8216;pyaar’? &#8216;Shaadi’, of course. The side effects of which, experienced warriors of holy matrimony know, can be serious: the lovers who couldn’t keep their hands off each other now find themselves grappling with more flesh they had bargained for – not only has she put on more weight, and he learnt to be diplomatic about it, they have a tiny bawling new life to take care of.</p>
<p>Has baby pooped? What colour and consistency? Burped? Fed? Conversation ranges along these lines. Romance is down to how much diapers cost. And mind-blowing midnight sex? What’s that?</p>
<p>The mantle of the harried married couple is worn by Farhan Akhtar and Vidya Balan, as we see them struggle with their &#8216;shaadi’ and its fall-out. ’Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ begins with a bang, pun completely intended, and we are taken in by Sid and Trisha’s life, so close to what we may have lived through. Or are wading through, as double income-no-kids turns into single income-cranky wife-desperate husband-demanding baby. All she can think of is the offspring. All he can think of, longingly, is the way it used to be—being a ‘boy’ with the boys, swilling beer, lounging on couch with the telly blaring, cheering at the game.</p>
<p>Till the half-way mark, Saket Chaudhary hits things right on the mark. Post-interval, the film is all over the place. Sid’s mentor ( Kapoor) takes him down a dodgy path which involves ‘me time’ carved out of a bunch of white lies. Out comes the tired homily : for a happy marriage, a few untruths are necessary. To stay consistent to this very guy thing, Sid is made to experiment with a change of image. The film, which was moseying along with sure-footed lightness, even if it was from an exclusionary male point of view, starts becoming forced.</p>
<p>Too square, declares the colourful-seeker-of-a-Manali-spliff (Das), who seems to have been bunged into the movie solely to talk up the bro code. What Sid needs is not his &#8216;family&#8217; car and stiff collared shirts but two-wheels and whacky Tees and wheelies. The bikes, and babes, who appear in the mandatory clubby number, and a too-chatty bai (Arun) who arrives to save Trisha from tedious housework, and a schmaltzy patch, make the film confused and contrived.</p>
<p>While the going is good, ‘Shaadi’ is fun, and real, and has some nice laugh-out-loud situations which the leads make the most of. But marriage takes two, and the tango here is only from Sid’s perspective : how about showing us what it could be like from Trisha’s ? So naturally the film belongs more to Farhan, who plays it straight and true, even when he is being asked to do the most improbable stuff. Vidya is competent but limited, which could be down to the way her character was scrunched.</p>
<p>I really liked the climax, though: how about the next one starting from where this one ends?</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995375&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Reality TV star Kim Kardashian says her 8-month-old daughter North has not worn any designer<br />
outfit yet.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old socialite, who welcomed her first child with rapper fiance Kanye West last year, said North likes to move around the house, reported People magazine.</p>
<p>&#8220;North has actually not worn anything designer yet! Kids get dirty. She&#8217;ll spit up. She moves around so much. I saw this one cute dress that was USD 500 and I was like, &#8217;Absolutely not!&#8217; I just want her in little leggings,&#8221; Kim said.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&#8217; star, who is expected to get married this year, earlier revealed that her wedding to West is not going to be as big as people are imagining.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995367&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Beyonce Knowles reportedly splashed 700 pounds at McDonald&#8217;s for a meal which was for her tour crew.</p>
<p>Beyonce, 32, recently decided to make a huge order at the fast food chain after the singer and her crew worked up an appetite following a performance at a concert, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d stopped off on my way home from the theatre to buy a cheeseburger at McDonald&#8217;s. The girl at the till looked a bit shell-shocked. She told me, &#8216;Oh my god, I&#8217;ve just done an order for 700 pounds for Beyonce&#8217;s 11 tour buses,&#8221; Local resident Helen Nugent said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She then went on to tell me, &#8216;I made 50 portions of large fries and 22 boxes of Chicken McNuggets. 22! And 26 Big Macs! There are a lot of dancers on her tour, you&#8217;d think they eat healthily. Mind you, they did order a lot of salad,&#8221; she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995357&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Youngistan</em> is a film based on politics with a love story of a couple. Neha Sharma, who will be seen in the film with Jackky Bhagnani and Kayoze Irani, says, “<em>Youngistan</em> is a refreshing take on politics, and a couple whose life is affected because of politics. It is actually a romantic film with politics as its backdrop.”<br />
Interestingly, Sharma, who till now played the glamorous diva in films like <em>Kyaa Super Kool Hai Hum</em> and <em>Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story</em>, has gone de-glam in <em>Youngistan</em>. In fact, the actress had to put on weight for her part. “My character is like any other regular girl and one which most girls will identify with. Syed Ahmad Afzal (director) had a certain perception of this character, and he didn’t want the girl to look glamorous. So, even the costumes were very ordinary and not expensive,” she says. But when asked the reason why she gained weight, the actress refused to give details stating, “I had to put on weight, but I can’t tell you the reason, because it’s very crucial to the plot of the film,” adds Neha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Title hunt on for Armaan Jain starrer</strong></p>
<p>Choosing a title for your film can turn out to be a tricky business these days. Illuminati Films is treading a cautious path, while trying to zero in on a title of their next film, starring Kareena Kapoor Khan’s cousin, Armaan Jain. Directed by debutant Arif Ali who is film-maker Imtiaz Ali’s brother, the film wrapped up last week. It stars Armaan opposite South actress Deeksha Seth, who also makes her Bollywood debut with this film.</p>

<p>Sunny Deol, who will be seen on the big screen almost after a year, plays a paralysed gangster named Lakhva in director Sanamjit Talwar’s directorial debut,<em> Dishkiyaoon</em>. The actor plays a Haryanvi in the film, whose right hand is completely paralysed, except for his index finger that functions, to pull the trigger of a gun. It is for this reason that the actor will be seen mouthing a dialogue repeatedly in the film that goes, “<em>Haryane se hoon, naam hain</em> Lakhva. <em>Yo haath chaale na, sivai is ungli ke</em>. It <em>ijj</em> poetic.”<br />
Talwar did not hire a teacher to assist Deol with Haryanvi, but took the onus of teaching him the language and nuances. “Sunny sir has never done an out-and-out Haryanvi role and fortunately, my language skills came handy in this case, as I could explain everything to him in detail,” adds Talwar. When asked if Deol’s role in the film is a special appearance, the director rubbished it and cleared the air by stating that Deol is an integral part of the film. Talwar mentioned, “By no yardstick is his character a special appearance. He plays an extremely important character and trust me, he has never done something like this before.”<br />
Produced by ESM and Eros International, <em>Dishkiyaoon</em> is scheduled to release on March 28.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Highway premieres at the Berlin Film Festival</strong></p>

<em>Highway</em>, produced by Ali’s Window Seat Films and presented by Sajid Nadiadwala, was released worldwide by UTV Motion Pictures on February 21.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995208&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Life of Pi</em> star Suraj Sharma will be seen sharing screen space once again with Adil Hussain who played his father in the film. They will be seen together in director Prashant Nair’s (who had earlier made independent films like <em>Delhi In a Day</em> and <em>Max And Helena</em>) film<em> Umrika</em>, the script of which was a part of Sundance Scriptwriters Lab in 2012 . Prateik is also part of the film which is based in rural India.<br />
According to a source, <em>Umrika</em> tries to paint a portrait of a fast changing United States of America in the early 1980s through the eyes of a young boy living in rural India. Hussain, who plays a small but significant part in the film, stated that the film follows the dreams and aspirations of the Indian youth. “It unravels the perceptions of reality for different people. It’s an interesting concept and Prashant has handled the subject really well. The film is almost complete, with just a few portions left, which will be wrapped up by the end of this month,” adds Hussain. The post production work of the film will start soon and sources suggest that the film should hit the screens by late 2014. Since the film is made for a global audience, it will include subtitles in English. The film will also have American actor Tony Revolori, of <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em> fame, playing an important role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monica Dogra’s short film with Kalki Koechlin and Gulshan Devaiah to do the festival rounds</strong></p>
<p>Monica Dogra who shot a short film, <em>Severing Ties</em> with Kalki Koechlin and Gulshan Devaiah said that, the 20 minute film will soon be doing the festival rounds. “The director Ahmed Roy a UK based film-maker wants to showcase his work at the festival. He is yet to decide which festivals,” said Monica, who plays the other woman in Devaiah’s life, while Koechlin plays his wife.<br />
The singer-actress is waiting for the release of her English film <em>Fireflies</em> with Rahul Khanna in which she plays a writer, while Khanna plays a businessman. “Soon I shall be shooting for my film with Naseeruddin and Vivaan which is about 40 per cent complete,” said the singer-actress who recently released her album <em>Re:cover</em> and has also sung a song in<em> Fireflies</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Milap Zaveri’s next is a comedy</strong></p>
<p><em>To be produced by Sanjay Gupta </em></p>
<p>Milap Zaveri, who has written comedies like <em>Heyy Babyy, Housefull, Grand Masti</em> and many others, will start shooting for his second directorial venture<em> Ooh La La</em> in September/October this year. The writer-director, who had earlier directed <em>Jaane Kahan Se Aayi Hai</em>, says that comedy is his forte and most of the comedies that he has written have been successful. “Its titled <em>Ooh La La</em> because that’s the feeling when boys see a beautiful girl. The film is a mad comedy and will star three guys and two girls,” said Zaveri. Sanjay Gupta will produce the film.</p>

<p>Kangana Ranaut’s next titled <em>Revolver Rani</em> will see her in an out-and-out action avatar. This film is all set to hit the screens in April this year. Although the release date is not yet revealed, the actress confirmed that the date will be announced at the trailer and first look launch on February 28 in Mumbai. While talking about her role in the film, Ranaut stated that this has been by far the toughest role that she has ever done.<br />
“I can’t talk much about it. I have to say that this film was extremely challenging. I may have played a chameleon in <em>Krrish 3</em> or a spunky small town girl in <em>Tanu Weds Manu</em>, but the audience will get to see me in a different space in <em>Revolver Rani</em>,” she adds.<br />
Produced by Tigmanshu Dhulia, several portions of this action &#8211; drama were shot in the ravines of Chambal and Ranaut confessed that the entire shooting process was extremely challenging for her. She will be seen opposite Vir Das in the film.</p>

<p><strong>Rohit Shetty to cast Irrfan in Soodhu Kavvum remake?</strong></p>
<p>Rohit Shetty, who has bought the Hindi remake rights of the 2013 Tamil comedy<em> Soodhu Kavvum</em> and will jointly produce it with Shetty Entertainment Pvt. Ltd and Rockline Production/A&amp;P Producers, is reportedly very keen to cast Irrfan in the lead role. &#8220;There were reports that Imran Khan will be doing the role. But, since the part requires a 45 plus character who needs to have an aura of mystique around him. Rohit has Irrfan on his mind&#8221; stated a source.<br />
The film is scheduled to take off in January 2015.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995303&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Right now, I am in the process of finalising the remaining cast, which will include some fantastic dancers,” stated the director who plans to organise a formal press conference in March.

<p>Shah Rukh Khan, who has done close to 25 special appearances in the past, will reportedly be seen doing a cameo in the Jackky Bhagnani and Neha Sharma-starrer <em>Youngistaan</em>. As per the film’s story, the character played by Sharma is shown to be a big fan of Khan and it is her infatuation with the superstar that forces her on-screen beau (played by Bhagnani) to arrange a private meeting with Khan.<br />
When contacted, neither did director Syed Afzal Ahmed confirm this news nor did he deny the fact that a particular scene does require an A-lister. “It is too early to talk about this. If Vashu (Bhagnani, producer) sir gets someone on board for a cameo, then we will work things out,” he stated. When contacted, the producer confirmed that the scene does require a popular star and that he is trying his best to zero in on someone.</p>

<p>By <strong>Farida Khanzada</strong></p>
<p>Director Kalpana Lajmi, who is noted for her women-centric films like <em>Daman</em> and <em>Rudaali</em>, had announced the making of two biopics. One was on the life of actor Priya Rajvansh who was allegedly murdered in 2000 and the other, a biopic on noted film-maker-lyricist-musician-singer and poet Bhupen Hazarika.<br />
While, she was planning to direct and co-produce the Priya Rajvansh biopic with Shanu Mehra, the project, according to Lajmi, “has been kept in abeyance. I had worked on it for three years, since 2009 to 2011, but now, we have to pitch it further and find a sound financier and a willing actor to play the female lead.”<br />
Meanwhile, Lajmi was busy in 2013 to, “complete the writing of the entire raw material of my 40 years of being in a relationship with Hazarika. Mahesh Bhatt has consented to be officially involved with the film. We shall now start work on the screenplay and look for financiers and finalise the actors,” says Lajmi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arjun, Alia reach out to each other on the poster of 2 States</strong></p>
<p>The first look of Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt-starrer <em>2 States</em> was released last week. While the poster of the film, which shows the Punjabi boy Kapoor from North India reaching out to Tamil Brahmin Bhatt from Chennai on a large map of India, was released first, this was followed by a photograph of the two actors posing in their respective looks for the film. The film also has a tagline in the form of ‘One Love’. Directed by Abhishek Verman, the story of the film is based on popular author Chetan Bhagat’s book by the same name. Presented by UTV Motion Pictures, <em>2 States</em> is produced by Sajid Nadiadwala and Karan Johar. It  will hit the screens on April 18.</p>

<p>Director Maneesh Sharma’s first independent production venture under the Yash Raj Films banner, <em>Dum Laga Ke Haisha</em>, will introduce Bhumi Pednekar. The debutante, who was part of YRF’s Casting Division was spotted by Sharma when she would double as an actor to conduct auditions with prospective talent. The film which took off in Haridwar last month has Ayushmann Khurrana playing the male lead.<br />
<em>Dum Laga Ke Haisha</em> is directed by debutant Sharat Katariya and revolves around the life of a small town couple, played by Khurrana and Pednekar. From overcoming his fear of the English language to dealing with an overbearing father, Khurrana discovers that his over-sized and mismatched wife, whom he thought was an impediment in his business and life, will actually lead him to something quite cool.<br />
Currently under production, <em>DLKH</em> is slated for a 2014 release.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aamirkhan7.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995263" alt="Aamir Khan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aamirkhan7.jpg" /></a> Aamir Khan said he is not shying away from politics, but that he was not interested in it.
<p>Bollywood actor Aamir Khan said he is not shying away from politics, but that he was not interested in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not shying away from politics. I am not interested in politics. I am interested in touching people&#8217;s heart,&#8221; he said responding to a query in this regard.</p>
<p>&#8220;People enter politics because they want to serve the country and serve the people. There are many other ways of doing it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actors have a huge role to play. We bring joy to people. we give joy, we bring laughter, colour in their life&#8230;,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Aamir said the responsibility of those in the entertainment industry is to bring grace to society and build its moral fibre. That was the role of a creative person.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel very proud of what I am doing,&#8221; he said at a press meet in connection with the TV show &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217;, the second phase of which will be aired from March 2.</p>
<p>&#8220;In India we are constantly looking at a messiah. Our country will finally change when we believe each one of us is a messiah. That is the central thought of a democracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to look for stregnth from within us in a democracy. I do not believe in looking at anyone else,&#8221; he said when asked who would be a better candidate for the PM&#8217;s post Narendra Modi or Rahul Gandhi.</p>
<p>&#8220;Society changes when society takes a turn,&#8221; he said. Season 2 of the show would be an &#8220;eye opener&#8221; in many ways, he said, adding &#8220;this journey has been exciting. I feel very enriched having met amazing people. I realise there is so much to learn from them&#8230; the kind of heroism I find in people who have no wealth, no political power..&#8221;</p>
<p>On the allegations against Mata Amritanandamayi Mutt levelled by a former devotee in a book, he said he was not aware of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we select topics for our show, no matter what topic we take, people will oppose it. But any kind of pressure&#8230;we will not give in..,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Malayalam actor Mohanlal, brand ambassador of the show in the South, said he had been keen to do a similar show years ago in Malayalam, but it did not take off due to some restrictions from the actors&#8217; association</p>
<p>&#8220;This show has lot of positive energy. It is a very sincere approach to the problems of the common man,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>K Madhavan, Managing Director, Asianet Communications Ltd and Gayatri Yadav, Head Marketing and Communications, STAR India, also spoke.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995261&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sanjaydutt1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995257" alt="Sanjay Dutt" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sanjaydutt1.jpg" /></a> Nana Patekar said he would never work with Sanjay Dutt again.
<p>Notwithstanding the support of Bollywood bigwigs to Sanjay Dutt, Nana Patekar today slammed the extension of parole to the jailed actor, saying he would never work with the convicted star.</p>
<p>The 63-year-old actor said the least he can do is boycott the films that Dutt stars in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not worked with him in 22 years of my career, I will not work with him in future too,&#8221; the actor told a news channel here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Government will do whatever they want. They are saying that it is legal, you can&#8217;t say anything about it. But I will do whatever is in my hands,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Sanjay Dutt, 54, was convicted by the Supreme Court for illegal possession of arms in connection with the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case and was sentenced to six years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>He had earlier served 18 months of jail and had surrendered himself before a Mumbai court on May 18, 2013 to serve the remaining period of his imprisonment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will watch his films and make him a hero and later you say he shouldn&#8217;t get parole. Things don&#8217;t work like that. What can I do? Who will listen to me? People think he is only an actor. I am also a common man but who will consider that,&#8221; Nana Patekar said.</p>
<p>Nana Patekar had spoken out against Dutt even at the time of his sentencing, saying he should not be given a favourable treatment for being an actor.</p>
<p>Sanjay Dutt has drawn flak for getting parole of almost 100 days during his current jail term.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995256&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Palm Springs.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old actor&#8217;s home, which once belonged to the famed 1940&#8242;s singer-actress Dinah Shore, boasts six bedrooms, and seven and a half bath apart from a pool, tennis court and detached gym, reported The E!Online.</p>

<p>&#8216;Almost Famous&#8217; star Kate Hudson and her partner Matt Bellamy are reportedly working on their<br />
relationship, which is apparently on the rocks.</p>
<p>There were rumours that the 34-year-old actress and the &#8217;Muse&#8217; frontman had called off their engagement when Hudson was spotted without her ring, reported E!Online.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are OK. They go through their ups and downs like every other couple. It&#8217;s true that occasionally they don&#8217;t spend as much time together as they would like &#8211; work pulls them apart from time to time. But they are working on strengthening their relationship.,&#8221; a source said.</p>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Oscar-winning filmmaker Woody Allen </span>and wife Soon-Yi continue to step out in public despite his adopted daughter renewing allegations that he sexually abused her when she was just seven.</p>
<p>The pair was spotted at an event honouring Pete Hamill at NYU&#8217;s Kimmel Center for University Life on February 25, reported the New York Post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Allen was heckled earlier this month by an audience member at Lincoln Center, but this time no one bothered him. He only chatted with those at his table, a source said.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217; director apparently attended the event because Hamill&#8217;s brother Brian has been unit photographer on 26 of his films.</p>
<p>Allen, who has been nominated 24 times for the Academy Awards and won four Oscars, is in the race again for writing his critically acclaimed film &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995225&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/the-oscars480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995221" alt="Hollywood Boulevard is already blanketed with red carpet, which is protected with plastic wrap. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/the-oscars480.jpg" /></a> Hollywood Boulevard is already blanketed with red carpet, which is protected with plastic wrap.
<p>The Oscars are usually blessed with standard Southern California weather: sunshine and blue skies. That could be the case again this year, but not until the first major storm to hit Los Angeles this winter gives the area a major dousing.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service predicts heavy rain Thursday night and Friday, with showers Saturday that could continue through Oscar Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re prepared to welcome our guests regardless of the weather,&#8221; said Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences spokeswoman Teni Melidonian, adding that she expects clear skies for the big show.</p>
<p>Hollywood Boulevard is already blanketed with red carpet, which is protected with plastic wrap. The whole arrivals area _ the carpet, fan bleachers, interview stages and photographers&#8217; risers _ is topped with a clear plastic tent that stretches from the intersection of Hollywood and Highland boulevards to the front of the Dolby Theatre.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s standard practice, said Joe Lewis, associate producer of the red carpet pre-show. &#8220;We&#8217;re as prepared as we can be,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His team constructed new rain gutters for the plastic tent this year to help keep the carpet pristine during the storm. &#8220;There&#8217;s no perfect science to rain planning,&#8221; Lewis said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to leak. There&#8217;s going to be rain. We&#8217;re just trying to keep it as dry as possible for show day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if Sunday promises perfect weather, things have to dry out by Saturday night for Lewis&#8217; team to remove the tent. Prep work continues overnight through Sunday morning, he said, with lots of props and gear that need to stay dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a point of no return, and we believe that is somewhere between 5 and 8 p.m. Saturday night. That is every year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Last year was the first year in a couple decades that we never put any tents up at all. We&#8217;re not as fortunate this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drought-stricken California needs the rain, of course, even if Oscar prefers sunshine.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995219&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP Photo)
<p>To the world, she&#8217;s a humanitarian, superstar actress and half of Hollywood&#8217;s most glamorous couple. But to the workers who met Angelina Jolie on Thursday at Oscar rehearsals, she was just &#8216;Angie&#8217;.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old Oscar winner, who was honored with the film academy&#8217;s Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award last year, came to the Dolby Theatre to run through the lines she&#8217;ll say in front of millions on Sunday. Afterward, she hung around chatting to show producers and introduced herself as &#8220;Angie&#8221; to a group of college students serving as trophy carriers this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll help make the night a fun night,&#8221; she said warmly to the star-struck students. One told her, &#8220;You were great out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t fall!&#8221; Jolie replied with a smile, confessing that the silver peep-toe pumps she paired with capri pants and a sweater for the rehearsal are her actual show-day shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;After you&#8217;ve done this a few times, you learn to wear the shoes you&#8217;re going to present in,&#8221; she said. She also learned she needed the teleprompter text to be made a bit larger. &#8220;I used to wear glasses,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Jolie presented an award on stage, and when a rehearsal actor stepped up to claim it, she gave him a hug. &#8220;For this rehearsal only,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am one lucky bastard.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995211&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/vidyafarhan.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995200" alt="Vidya Farhan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/vidyafarhan.jpg" /></a> ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ has set its sail right with the side-splitting and witty trailers and dialogue promos.
<p>Bollywood’s finest actors Farhan Akhtar and Vidya Balan are all set with their upcoming rom com ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’, which releases today.</p>
<p>The film is a sequel to 2008’s hit film ‘Pyaar Ke Side Effects’ which had Mallika Sherawat and Rahul Bose in the lead roles.</p>
<p>Pritish Nandy and Ekta Kapoor’s ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ is expected to be a laugh riot much like its predecessor and has already got a thumbs up from B-towners like Divya Dutta, Javed Akhtar, Shabana Azmi, among others.</p>
<p>The film has set its sail right with the side-splitting and witty trailers and dialogue promos. If Rahul Bose and Mallika Sherawat could tickle your funny bone that hard, imagine what will Vidya Balan and Farhan Akhtar do. While the first film was about falling in love, the sequel takes the relationship a step forward.</p>
<p>The film’s music too is on every party’s playlist. Farhan and Vidya have done their bit to pull the crowd to the theatres with their hilarious promotions citing the various side effects of marriage.</p>
<p>Last week’s release, ‘Highway’ has been fairly successful, but with the fresh theme and promising cast ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ is likely to have a decent go at the Box Office.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ is touted to be Vidya Balan’s big release in two years, she had last tasted success with ‘Kahaani’ in 2012.</p>
<p>In 2013, Vidya Balan was seen in ‘Ghanchchakar’ which bombed at BO. If ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’ is a success, then this will be Farahan Akhtar’s hattrick at the BO after ‘Bhaag Milkha Bhaag’ (2013) and ‘Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara’ (2011).</p>
<p>The film also stars Ram Kapoor, Vir Das, Gautami Kapoor, Purab Kohli and Rati Agnihotri in pivotal roles.</p>
<p>Watch this space for Shubhra Gupta’s review of ‘Shaadi Ke Side Effects’.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995199&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[A beauty queen who aspires to be a singing sensation, Ruhi Singh took the Bollywood route to make a mark in entertainment, and landed a lead role in Bombay Talkies’ Chahe Koi Mujhe 
Junglee Kahe<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993595&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ruhi267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993636" alt="WAITING IN THE WINGS: Ruhi Singh" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ruhi267.jpg" /></a> WAITING IN THE WINGS: Ruhi Singh
<p><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Launch vehicle</span></strong></p>
<p>In <em>Chahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe</em>, I will be seen playing a spoiled brat named Riya. She hails from a rich family and has enjoyed all the perks in life. She runs away from home in search of true love, and meets someone who changes her life forever. It was fun playing Riya as I personally believe that my character and I are very much alike.</p>
<p><strong>Casting coup</strong></p>
<p>Even after being a finalist at the Ponds Femina Miss India contest in 2011, I never thought of becoming an actor. In fact, I actually wanted to become a singer. But it looks like life had other plans for me. I happen to accompany a friend of mine for an audition. When we reached the place for audition, I decided to give it a shot too. I did not expect anything to come out of it, but one day, I get a call to tell me I got selected. Somewhere, I think it was the lack of pressure or zero expectations that actually helped me out.</p>
<p><strong>Stepping stone</strong></p>
<p>Unlike other newcomers, I had never planned a career. In fact, I don’t plan anything in my life because I believe that everything falls into place automatically. As I said earlier, I wanted to be an international singing sensation. I was born in Jaipur and completed my education there itself. I have always been an achiever all my life, may it be sports or adventure or studies. But deep down, there was always this dream of seeing the world and experiencing it to the fullest. I guess that’s why acting happened to me and I am loving it like I have never loved anything before.</p>
<p><strong>First shot</strong></p>
<p>I was damn nervous! Bombay Talkies is a legendary production house with a glorious past. I developed cold feet when I got to know about the magnitude of this project and being selected for their 103rd film only when I went for my first shot. It went well as the cast and crew members made me feel very comfortable. We became friends on the very first day.</p>
<p><strong>Stumbling blocks</strong></p>
<p>We had rigorous workshops before the film went on the floor. Also, we used to rehearse all our parts thoroughly before every scene. As far as I remember, there were no hurdles as such. I just feel fortunate that my sailing has been so smooth.</p>
<p><strong>The takeaway</strong></p>
<p>As an actor, <em>Chahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe</em> has been the best possible experience for me. An actor’s job is so tedious that he or she has to learn to take it easy during difficult times and when required, give it your best shot. It has also taught me to handle the pressure of being an actor and playing an important role as the lead.</p>
<p><strong>Role model</strong></p>
<p>I look up to my parents, because they have always stood by me for everything. I always tell people that dad is my 4am friend. He is someone I can always depend on. He is the one who gave me the confidence to enter this industry.</p>
<p><strong>Future projects</strong></p>
<p>I am going through a few scripts that have come my way. These scripts can potentially take me to a different level. So I am just waiting for the right time to make the official announcements. Keeping my fingers crossed for it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Through the tale of Henrietta Lacks, whose cells are the workhorses of cancer research, theatre artiste Adura Onashile in her solo piece talks about medical ethics, equality and ownership of DNA<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993756&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hela267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993759" alt="A scene from HeLa;  (below) Adura Onashile" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hela267.jpg" /></a> A scene from HeLa
<p>Minutes before Adura Onashile’s solo act<em> HeLa</em>, as the visitors entered Sitara Studio in Mumbai’s Lower Parel, on February 15, they found the actor scribbling something, which looked like codes, on a board. Just before the third bell rang, she struck them out, barring one that read ‘HeLa’. In the field of cancer research, too, something similar had happened. Until Henrietta Lacks’s (known as HeLa) case, the cells of a number of cancer patients were not of much help. At The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, USA, in 1951, without seeking her permission, they had extracted her cells and her family never knew about it. These cells became the raw material for some of the most important scientific discoveries of the past 100 years.<br />
More than 60 years since Lacks passed away, Onashile puts the spotlight on her with the award-winning British play, <em>HeLa</em>, that premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival last year. Though the play is minimalistic in nature, Onashile narrates the story of <em>HeLa</em> using physical theatre, video projections and music. Onashile talks about discovering this true story and the process of dramatising it. Excerpts:</p>
<p><strong>What drew you to the story of Henrietta Lacks? When you worked on it, did you think it would start a debate?</strong></p>
<p>I read <em>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</em> by Rebecca Skloot (its rights are with Oprah Winfrey and to be made into a movie by HBO) and it was the first time I came across the story. I was amazed that I had never heard of this woman whose cells had contributed so much to science. We made the show because I thought there might be other people who hadn’t heard of her too. Our hope was to tell as balanced a story as possible and if this sparked a debate then that was an added bonus.</p>
<p><strong>How challenging was it to dramatise her story and condense it into an one-hour performance?</strong></p>
<p>This show was made over two years, so there was time to present a work-in-progress, get feedback and go through a process of editing the script. The beauty of writing the script meant that over this period, I could continually make changes to the script even while we were performing. This meant that the script got tighter and tighter. There was a lot of material to share in a limited time frame and finding the right pace for the show as a whole became really important. Graham Eatough, the director, and I have worked closely through this process. There is a great deal of scientific material in the show and it was important to get the science behind it across without being too technical about it. This was potentially the hardest part of writing this script.</p>
<p><strong>Did your writing make it easier for you to internalise Henrietta’s story?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the more research you do on someone, the longer you spend finding out about them and inhabiting them. This means that you get a good grounding on the character. However, Graham and I wanted to create a show where although she is the central character, we never actually hear her voice. She is talked about by the narrator, her daughter, her family and a doctor who treated her. We wanted to find a way to instill her absence from public consciousness in the audience’s mind, because this is one of the saddest aspects of the story.</p>
<p><strong>Are you dabbling with projects other than HeLa?</strong></p>
<p>The international tour of <em>HeLa</em> is the main focus of this year but I will be developing a couple of other projects in the meantime. <em>HeLa</em> was the first piece I have written for theatre and because it’s a true story, I had to rely on archives and documentary material. This gives the script a particular style. I’m keen to explore other styles of writing, so that’s my next challenge.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[It’s a significant win after 25 years since  the Chinese film Red Sorghum won the Golden Bear in  1988<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994594&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bai267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994596" alt="A  still from Bai Ri Yan Huo (Black Coal, Thin Ice) " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bai267.jpg" /></a> A still from Bai Ri Yan Huo (Black Coal, Thin Ice)
<p>Asian films were big winners at the recently concluded Berlin International Film Festival, led by gritty Chinese thriller Bai Ri Yan Huo (Black Coal, Thin Ice) about an overweight detective pursuing a serial killer which took the top Golden Bear prize.<br />
Liao Fan, who said he put on 20 kg (44 lb) and drank more alcohol to play the role of detective Zhang Zili, was named Best Actor. “Chinese films are accepted more and more,” Diao Yinan, director of the winning film, told reporters.<br />
“It seems every time we take them abroad, there is a greater enthusiasm for Chinese cinema. We hadn’t expected that, but film is global nowadays.” Asked about censorship in China, Diao said: “Of course, there is censorship, I believe that exists around the whole world, doesn’t it? When it comes to Chinese censorship, I think the fact we are here in Berlin shows our censors are becoming more open, although there are difficulties.”<br />
Haru Kuroki, who won Best Actress for her portrayal of a housemaid in Tokyo before and during World War Two in the Japanese film Chiisai Ouchi (The Little House), said she wanted to leap for joy but wearing a kimono made it difficult.<br />
American Richard Linklater was named Best Director for his coming-of-age film Boyhood, which uses the same child actors over a 12-year span, while Wes Anderson’s Grand Budapest Hotel, the festival opener set in a fictional central European country, took the Silver Bear grand jury prize.<br />
Asked if he was disappointed, Linklater, whose film was popular with Berlin audiences, said: “With this, film-making, you are working for yourself to realise your own visions, you are not thinking about prizes.” The Ethiopian film Difret, based on a real case of bride abduction in Ethiopia and backed by actress Angelina Jolie, took the audience award.<br />
“I’d expected the Chinese films to do really well and Black Coal, Thin Ice is very good,” said Scott Roxborough, Berlin bureau chief for the Hollywood Reporter. He noted that Berlin had given the Golden Bear to the Chinese film Red Sorghum in 1988, and said Black Coal, Thin Ice was ‘film noir’ in the style of Quentin Tarantino and other Hollywood directors, and not in the mould of traditional Chinese kung fu films or period dramas.</p>
<p><strong>Move over Hollywood</strong></p>
<p>“We are seeing Chinese cinema becoming more cinematically adept, not so overtly political. Chinese film-makers are more confident, more open to the world,” Roxborough said. “China is the second biggest box-office in the world, one day it will take over from America, so people expect more stories of all kinds.”<br />
Set in northern China, Black Coal, Thin Ice pits Liao’s detective, who at one point loses his badge after a shootout in a beauty parlour, against a killer who disposes of dismembered feet in skates, an eye in a bowl of noodles, and other body parts in coal trucks.<br />
Although the opening scene is set in a hot summer, the rest unfolds five years later, almost entirely in winter. Director Diao, who won awards for Night Train in 2007, said he had ignored advice that “Cold films don’t sell”. He said he wanted to portray the warmth of emotions beneath to help people “feel less alone with our dark side”.<br />
The Berlin festival, officially called the Berlinale, is one of the oldest and most prestigious film showcases in the world. The festival showed more than 400 films overall, including a series of movies on cooking and food and an unfinished documentary by veteran filmmaker Martin Scorsese about the political and literary journal The New York Review of Books.</p>

<p><strong>Jimmy Fallon’s Tonight Show debut draws 11.3 million viewers</strong></p>
<p>Jimmy Fallon’s debut as the host of NBC’s Tonight Show drew 11.3 million viewers, network NBC said on Tuesday, making it the second most-watched episode of the late-night talk show in the past five years. Fallon’s premiere on NBC’s flagship late-night programme failed to top the farewell episodes of Jay Leno on February 6 and in 2009, but eclipsed the audience that tuned in to watch Conan O’Brien begin his short, ill-fated stint as host.</p>
<p>Fallon, 39, welcomed actor Will Smith and Irish band U2 as his first official guests, and the show also featured appearances from the likes of comedian Tina Fey, actresses Lindsay Lohan and Sarah Jessica Parker, and former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.<br />
Actor Robert De Niro, boxer Mike Tyson, pop star Lady Gaga and Comedy Central rival Stephen Colbert also welcomed Fallon to the show, which returned to its roots in New York after more than 40 years in Burbank, California.<br />
O’Brien’s first episode as Tonight Show host drew 9.2 million, but his ratings quickly dropped off and Leno was reinstalled as host eight months later. Fallon’s ascendance to one of the most visible and long-running roles in U.S. television marked Comcast Corp-owned NBC’s second attempt to transition the Tonight Show to the younger, under-50 demographic most coveted by advertisers while keeping its grip atop the ratings.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994594&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>My favourite channels are infotainment channels like History TV 18 and Nat Geo. Sometimes I also enjoy watching travel shows. I love watching <em>Big Bang Theory</em> on Star World, <em>Highway On My Plate</em> and <em>Twist Of Fate</em>. I am not a mainstream GEC watcher at all. I also love watching <em>Ancient Aliens</em> on History TV 18. And yes, whenever I get a chance I love catching up on English movies on television.<br />

The singer talks to Screen about his latest collaboration, the music industry and more<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994557&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kumar267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994560" alt="Kumar Sanu" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kumar267.jpg" /></a> Kumar Sanu
<p><strong>How did you conceptualise the idea of a tribute to Kishore Kumar?</strong></p>
<p>I came to industry as a follower of Kishore<em>da</em> and I still have a lot to learn from his singing. Before I began my career as a playback singer, I used to sing his songs in hotels. Almas Noor (princess of Malaysia) connected to me via email and informed that she is a big fan of Kishore<em>da</em> and my work, which was very humbling. Ultimately, we spoke to each other through a few coordinators in Mumbai and discussed an album collaboration. Both of us liked the plan and then, I met her in Malaysia, where we zeroed in on twelve songs, including <em>Jaane jaan, Kya yehi pyar he, Tu tu hai wahi</em> among others. The old melodies are recreated in a contemporary way by Jatin Sharma. What can be a better tribute than this?</p>
<p><strong>Being a veteran in the industry, what do you have to say about Noor’s singing abilities?</strong></p>
<p>She has a good voice and sings melodiously. Despite the fact that she doesn’t know Hindi, she went through rigorous training and several hours of rehearsals to get everything right. We also did quite a few rehearsal sessions together. I was treated extremely well in Malaysia, and although there were a few problems during the video shoot due to the laws, we shot our parts separately.</p>
<p><strong>Your last full duet was in Rowdy Rathore. Why don’t we get to hear more of your songs these days?</strong></p>
<p>I think my fans hear my voice through different mediums everyday (<em>laughs</em>). Well, I have tasted the peak of success in my career and right now, I am at a level where I don’t feel I can go any further. Having said that, I end up doing several shows, live concerts across the world even today. So in a way, I have become more busy then earlier times. Also, the music industry has changed a lot. The identity of a singer is completely lost and there is zero voice registration. Each song is popular only for a limited phase, then some other track takes over and music lovers have to surf the internet or television to get details of the artist who has worked on it. I personally believe, that the music industry is going through a very sad phase. The only ray of hope is the fact that the audience is becoming more conscious of the kind of musical genres they prefer and hence, good melodies are making a comeback.</p>
<p><strong>Several singers look up to you for inspiration, but who has been your role model in the industry?</strong></p>
<p>Kishore Kumar is my god and even today, I try to get that kind of perfection in my voice. I confess that during my early days, I used to try emulating his voice. Whenever the industry required a voice on the lines of Kishore<em>da</em>’s, I was roped in. Be it for Amitabh Bachchan in <em>Jaadugar</em> or <em>Insaniyat</em>. It was only in 1990 with the release of <em>Aashiqui</em> that people recognised my voice as that of Kumar Sanu.</p>
<p><strong>What is your take on the current crop of musicians and singers?</strong></p>
<p>They are extremely talented, hard working and full of zest. It’s a pity that their full potential is not used. Also, I think it is high time the music composers balance their sounds with a good mix of dance and soothing numbers. You cannot have an album full of big bang sounds and vulgar lyrics. Among the current lot, I love the music composed by Ajay &#8211; Atul and Amit Trivedi.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any actor from the new generation you would like to lend your voice to?</strong></p>
<p>I’ll choose Ranbir Kapoor, because I have fond memories of the songs that I have sung for his father, Rishi Kapoor. Rishi was one of the few actors who did complete justice to my voice, and now when I look at Ranbir, he comes across as one of the most intense actor of this generation, I think it will be great to lend my voice to him.</p>
<p><strong>What about your future projects?</strong></p>
<p>I have finished recording for Neil Nitin Mukesh’s upcoming film, <em>Dusshera</em>. There are quite a few Bollywood projects also lined up. Otherwise, live shows continue to keep me busy.</p>

<p>The cast and crew of the Marathi play <em>Bandish</em>, had gathered for rehearsals at the Bharat Natya Mandir in Pune, 10 days prior to their final performance. Sitting in the audience chair and looking at the set — high-end furniture, gossamer curtains, a bookshelf on the left, a bar on the right, ultra-modern kitchen and chic lights — one gets the hint that the play will have a contemporary tone. The stage is buzzing with activity. As the actors discuss their scenes, dialogues and dance moves, director Mohit Takalkar calls out: “Come on everybody, take your positions. We’re starting.” Almost instantly, the group breaks away.<br />
The lights are switched off and as if on cue, there is pin-drop silence in the auditorium. With soothing words from an Urdu poem —<em> Dasht-e-tanhayi mein, ai jaan-e-jahaan, larzaan hain</em> — sung in the voice of Iqbal Bano, the play begins. What follows is a 100-minute uninterrupted theatrical journey to a story that “binds” you to the chair till its end. The play <em>Bandish</em>, which literally means “that which binds”, does complete justice to its title in more ways than one. Produced by Aasakta Kalmanch, written by Rajeev Naik and directed by Takalkar, the play was staged in Pune as part of the Annual Vinod Doshi Memorial Theatre Festival that was held from February 24 to 28.<br />
“I wanted to stage it last year too, when Rajeev (Naik) first narrated the story. However, I was clear that I wanted to cast Kiran Yadnyopavit to play the lead role of Professor Nikhil. Since he was busy with other projects, I couldn’t go ahead with our production. This time, everything fell in place,” says Takalkar.<br />
The director states that since the original play was very long, he and Naik had several sittings to discuss which scenes needed to be deleted, merged or improvised. “The play’s structure is like a <em>bandish</em> or composition in music, which has interwoven long and short <em>tanas</em>. Initially, there are three to four long scenes, followed by some short scenes integrated beautifully,” he explains.<br />
Similar to a musical <em>bandish</em> that has five elements, the play has five characters — Professor Nikhil, Tanvi, Yodhan, Sulabha and Janaki — who belong to different generations, genders, professions, attitudes and ideals. “People generally look for consistency in characters, but the characters of <em>Bandish</em> are quite inconsistent. They get depressed but they desire; they are possessive but they also give, they think but they also feel,” says Takalkar, who has been associated with Aasakta Kalamanch for over a decade now. Some of the plays he has directed include <em>Uney Purey Shehar Ek, Gajab Kahaani, Necropolis, Anandbhog Mall, Bed Ke Neeche Rehne Wali</em> and <em>Poornaviram</em>.<br />
Categorising the play in a particular genre, he says, is a bit tricky. Though initially it seems serious and realistic, after a point, it goes beyond. The crux lies in the concept of time — remembering, forgetting, nostalgia, past, future, and the present, and a basic obsession with “memory”. So there is Professor Nikhil who doesn’t remember his past; he is fighting with the present and is scared of the future. The younger characters, Yodhan and Janaki, on the other hand, are futuristic. And the women — Tanvi and Sulabha — are living in their present. The roles of Yodhan, Janaki, Tanvi and Sulabha are essayed by actors Abhay Mahajan, Sayalee Phatak, Devika Daftardar and Gauri Lagoo respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Music:</strong> Amit Trivedi</p>
<p><strong>Lyrics:</strong> T-Series</p>
<p>Not all good things get the hype that they deserve. The soundtrack of <em>Queen</em> is facing a similar problem. After giving us a delightful album like <em>Lootera</em> last year, composer Amit Trivedi is back to impress us with seven well composed songs, while the eighth is composed by regional musician Rupesh Kumar Ram; the lyrics are penned by Anvita Dutt. The album opens with the Punjabi flavoured <em>London Thumakda</em>, a foot-tapping number with Labh Janjua’s delightful voice making a comeback. The dance number has a beautiful mélange of fusion tunes, with both the use of <em>dhol</em> and hip-hop beats making an impact. Sisters Sonu and Neha Kakkar do justice to their parts. Trivedi comes in as the singer for <em>Badra Bahaar</em>, a contemporary track with an earthy feel, thanks to the lyrics and excellent use of the sitar. For those who love fusion music, this is should be your pick. The upbeat <em>O gujariya</em> comes next, where Trivedi manages to create an interesting mix of beats. Shefali Alvares and Nikhil D’Souza’s unique voice packs a punch. This one is sure to rock the discotheques.<br />
Trivedi ropes in Arijit Singh for a sweet and peppy romantic number, which sounds straight out of an album like <em>Barfi!</em> or even Trivedi’s own <em>Kai Po Che.</em> It’s a decent track and Singh has sung it well. Trivedi comes back as the singer for <em>Jugni</em>. But before you assume that this is going to be the typical melody with Punjabi lyrics, that has been a part of other songs with the same title, you are mistaken. With a theme of liberation, <em>Jugni</em> stands out, especially because of the good use of rock elements and Trivedi’s fabulous rendition.<br />
Nandini Srikar’s <em>Harjaiyaan</em> comes like a breath of fresh air. Trivedi has experimented with folksy tunes and blended it well with the sounds of trumpets, sticks and <em>dhol</em>. The singer has rendered the track in a fantastic way, especially in the portions where the word ‘<em>Harjaiyaan</em>’ touches a high pitch, making it one of the highlights of this album.<br />
Mohan Kanan’s rendition of the soft <em>Kinare</em> is just perfect. Despite the heavy lyrics with hidden messages, Kanan sings this track with utmost ease. Again, Trivedi blends in the sound of trumpets and sitar very well. Composer Ram’s short piece <em>Raanjha</em> depends heavily on the vocals, with a simple, flat melody playing in the background. The track leaves you with a haunting effect and Raghu Nath’s lyrics are well penned.<br />
Instead of creating stand out songs, the music of <em>Queen</em> comes as an excellent package. The melodies take time to grow on you, but they are definitely worth it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mrx267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993674" alt="Emraan Hashmi  gets ready to don the  evil look as Vikram Bhatt  looks on" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mrx267.jpg" /></a> Emraan Hashmi gets ready to don the evil look as Vikram Bhatt looks on
<p>The shooting of Vikram Bhatt’s<em> Mr X</em> took off in Mumbai last week and producer-writer Mahesh Bhatt posted one look of lead actor Emraan Hashmi in the film! ‘The Desire for power &amp; the ability to thwart evil &amp; to right all wrongs led to such icons as <em>SUPERMAN</em> &amp; also <em>MR X</em>.’ is what Bhatt had tweeted along with the picture.<br />
“This is not Emraan’s look and is just a moment in the film. Hashmi who plays a cop in <em>Mr X</em> will also be turning invisible in parts of the film,” said Shagufta Rafique, the dialogue writer of the film.<br />
Rafique also clarified that the film has nothing to do with the 1957 Ashok Kumar starrer, <em>Mr X</em> which was directed by Mahesh Bhatt’s father, Nanabhai Bhatt. “Except for the title and the fact that the protagonist turns invisible there are no similarities between the films. The subject is in the Batman and Spider Man zone and is about how good wins over evil,” she said.<br />
<em>Mr X</em> which has Amyra Dastur as the leading lady will be shot in a start-to-finish schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Woman talk</strong></p>
<p><em>“Supriya Pathak and Tanvi Azmi are a riot when together,” says Vidya Balan about shooting for Bobby Jasoos</em></p>
<p>Vidya Balan who plays the the title role in<em> Bobby Jasoos</em> chuckled as she recalled shooting for the film in Hyderabad with Supriya Pathak, Zarina Wahab, Tanvi Azmi, Benaf Dadachanji, and actor-producer Dia Mirza. “I have not worked with so many women in a long time. We all got along very well and would huddle up together most of the time and chat away, while the male cast comprising Ali Fazal, Arjan Bajwa and Kiran Kumar would wonder what we were so engrossed in. It reminded me of my Parineeta days when the team was full of women. I must mention that<br />
Tanvi, who I thought was this intellectual actor, in reality is so different. She laughs more than anyone else and continues till the tears come rolling<br />
down! In fact, she and Supriya Pathak are a riot when together,” chirped the actress.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/tulsi267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994547" alt="Tulsi Kumar" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/tulsi267.jpg" /></a> Tulsi Kumar
<p>Singer Tulsi Kumar, who had earlier worked on solo albums and singles, has collaborated with singer Palash Sen&#8217;s band Euphoria for a single. The romantic song, which happens to be her first collaboration, is titled <em>Is it you?</em> and has been composed by Sen himself. “I have worked with Palash for a film called <em>Kukku Mathur Ki Jhand Ho Gayi</em> and it was there that I first heard some of his new compositions. He told me that he needs a female singer for a peppy romantic number and since the song is a duet, he asked if I was interested in working on this project. I really liked the song, so I immediately said yes. We recently finished recording for the number and trust me, it has turned out really well,” stated Kumar. Interestingly, the singer also waived off her fee for this track, since she was excited to work on this project and didn&#8217;t think much about the payment. This also happens to be the first track that Kumar will be singing for Universal Music. She mentioned that a music video for the song is on the cards and will be shot very soon. Kumar quipped, “If all goes well, the song should be out by the end of March.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Jane Dias turns singer for her next</strong></p>
<p>Actor Sarah Jane Dias, who will be seen in films like <em>O Teri and Happy New Year</em>, is taking singing lessons these days, for a reason. Sources close to the actor suggest that she will be lending her voice for a few tracks in an upcoming film. When contacted, Dias confirmed this but refused to divulge details about the film or its title. Interestingly, sources also informed that she is undergoing rigorous training for both singing and contemporary dance since a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Main Tera Hero/ </em><strong>Not impressive</strong><em><strong><br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>These days, most Hindi film albums seem to be incomplete without a club number.<em> Drama queen, Sunny sunny, Dhat tere ki</em> among others were just a few recent additions to this genre. The first song of Varun Dhawan&#8217;s upcoming film Main Tera Hero, Besharmi ki height, has joined the bandwagon and it turns out to be a melange of all popular club tracks that we have heard in the past. The opening piece itself will remind you of<em> Subah hone na de</em> and then, several &#8216;been there, heard that&#8217; tunes follow. Sajid–Wajid&#8217;s composition has zero novelty factor and the lyrics penned by Kumaar sound dated (it can&#8217;t get cheesier than &#8216;<em>ek tu, ek main aur ho dim dim yeh light</em>&#8216;). Benny Dayal and Shalmali Kholgade do a decent job as usual, but their duet sounds straight out of <em>Phata Poster Nikhla Hero</em>&#8216;s <em>Hey Mr dj</em>. Skip this below average song and listen to your other favourite club tracks instead.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[With several awards already in their kitty and a dream run at film festivals, director Nagraj Manjule and co - producer Vivek Kajaria are now taking their film Fandry a notch above with a pan India release<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994719&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/fandry267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994723" alt="A still from Fandry" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/fandry267.jpg" /></a> A still from Fandry
<p><strong>Did you expect such a phenomenal response, especially from the critics and media, for your film Fandry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vivek Kajaria:</strong> I believed that <em>Fandry</em> has very strong content which reflects the way our society functions. The critics and media are always very supportive if the content of the film is strong and practical. After being awarded the FIPRESCI India &#8211; Best Indian Film 2013 and The 2nd Best International Film (grand Jury Award) at MAMI (Mumbai), I gained some serious confidence that yes, <em>Fandry</em> has the strength to be accepted by a wider audience. At the Pune International Film Festival, we got goosebumps when we saw the entire audience giving us a standing ovation till the end credits rolled out. The same happened at the Mumbai Film Festival and BFI London. We were thrilled when Shyam Benegalji, who had seen the film in its initial stages, walked up to us and said, “It’s a very powerful film.” Although appreciation has been coming in from everywhere, we are still going all out to reach a wider audience.<br />
Nagraj Manjule: I wasn’t expecting such a phenomenal response, but deep down somewhere, I had the confidence that this film will certainly strike a chord with the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Kajaria, what was going on in your mind when you decided to back the film? Was there any particular element of the film that stood out for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>VK:</strong> <em>Fandry</em> forces people to think about “us” as human beings and depict the wrongs in the society. It is very difficult for me to choose one element, because it was the entire script that struck me and since that very moment, I got pulled into it. Both Nilesh Navlakha (producer) and I believed in the script, which was first presented by Nagraj’s friend and immediately said yes. Our previous films like <em>Shala</em> (produced by Navlakha) and <em>Anumati</em> (presented by Navlakha and Kajaria) also had a powerful content and with <em>Fandry</em>, we thought of presenting a powerful way to bring about a change, even if it is a very small one.</p>
<p><strong>Where was the film shot? Did you face difficulties, especially with location hunting or permissions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NM:</strong> We wanted a location that looked real, with dry and humid weather conditions, barren land and mountains in the background. I went location hunting for a few months across Maharashtra, before zeroing in on Akolner village, near Ahmednagar. The film was shot over 26 days during summer, but we faced a few weather issues and the schedule got pushed due to untimely rain. So, we had to opt for another schedule of six days. Fortunately, we didn’t face any issues as the Gram Panchayat of Akolner and the villagers were very supportive and granted our team all the necessary permissions without any hassle.<br />
<strong>VK:</strong> A couple of important scenes were also filmed in the Ahmednagar district during the second schedule. The authorities were extremely co &#8211; operative.</p>
<p><strong>How did you zero in on the actors, since the ensemble cast has earned a lot of critical acclaim?</strong></p>
<p><strong>NM:</strong> I was invited as a chief guest in a village, where Somnath Avghade who plays the lead in the film, was a part of the musical group. He played the <em>Halgi</em> (Maharashtrian folk percussion) for the troupe and the moment I saw him, I knew he was my Jabya. Although Kishore Kadam is a known name in the industry, we see him as Kachru on screen and sympathise with the kind of work he is forced to do for a living. For me, the right selection of actors is important. The actor must look the part and not appear as a celebrity on screen.</p>
<p><strong>The film highlights young love in a casual manner. There are several other films which have the same elements. Do you think the Marathi film industry is more open to such topics than it was a decade back?</strong></p>
<p><strong>VK:</strong> Love is just one of the elements, as the film revolves around the entire society, culture and humans at large. But yes, love is a strong emotional point in <em>Fandry</em>. The Marathi film industry has an amazing young lot of film-makers who are actually trying to put up the reality in a strong manner in front of the audience. Now, in this process, they have also opened up to various topics and young love is one of them. I see this industry growing every single day in terms of content-oriented and power-packed films.</p>
<p><strong>How are you planning to take Fandry on the National platform? What are the promotional strategies?</strong><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>VK:</strong> Zee Entertainment and Essel Vision have joined hands with us for the marketing, publicity and distribution of <em>Fandry</em> in theatres across India. We released the film on February 14 in 170 screens which was increased to around 270 in the second week. The film was released with subtitles everywhere so that even non-Marathi speaking audience can go and watch the film.<br />
With the consent of Zee and the help of PVR Director’s Rare, we will release <em>Fandry</em> in cities like Kolkata, Bangalore, Delhi, Indore, Chennai among others on February 28. I hope this initiative will help us in reaching out to more people and will also boost the power of regional films on a national platform.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Rajeev Khandelwal is brimming with facts and knowledge when it comes to travelling. His penchant for adventure leads him to tread on a path less travelled upon. Even if it means roughing it in the wild terrains. In a candid chat with Screen, the television actor turned film star gives a glimpse of his avatar as a traveller<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994804&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

<p><strong>Q. 1 What do you enjoy the most about travelling ?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the journey, which I enjoy the most. It&#8217;s about reaching the destination, in the best possible and exciting manner. For instance, one could just fly to Leh, but the real fun is when you actually drive to Leh from Chandigarh, or from Srinagar. It&#8217;s not just exploring the place, but meeting different kinds of people, getting a glimpse of their lifestyle and being with nature, all by yourself. For me, travelling has been more about self-discovery.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 2 So, you like to take the route less travelled?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. For example, if I have to drive from Srinagar to Leh, you can take the regular highway, but there&#8217;s another route via Batalik Sector, which I discovered recently; it is very close to the Pakistan border. People do not take that route, because it&#8217;s longer, isolated and scary. But I enjoyed taking that route. I like exploring places that people generally avoid, but I make sure that I am well-equipped for the trip.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 3 Who do you usually travel with?</strong></p>
<p>Mostly alone. I just take my car, and drive off . Besides, I sometimes go camping with my college friends, and of course, my wife Manjhiri and her friends.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 4 When was the first time you made a solo trip?</strong></p>
<p>I think it was the trip to Jim Corbett, for which I bought a car, Tata 207, which is a pick-up vehicle. It has a cabin in the front, and an open space outside, and meant for such travel trips. It was in 2006, a time when my character was pretty popular on television, so I wanted to break-free. I was smitten by the idea of travelling. It was an exciting journey as I met a lot of people, made friends and spotted a tiger. It was my first full-fledged independent trip, when I didn&#8217;t have to depend on my father for pocket money or anything.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 5 Which has been your most memorable trip?</strong></p>
<p>It would be the trip that I took with my college friends, a few years back. We met in Delhi and went by the same Tata 207 pick-up truck. On a whim, we decided to climb a mountain, without having the right kind of equipment, and got lost somewhere in between. It took us six hours to climb down. It was a nine-day trip, and we camped out. I fell in love with a lot of Ladakhi girls. They would recognise me and I would ask them out the next day (<em>laughs</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Q. 6 Do you agree, that travelling helps you gain lot of knowledge?</strong></p>
<p>You accumulate a lot of knowledge about places and people when you travel. Though I&#8217;ve never tried to seek knowledge consciously, travel does add to your personality subtly. You become more wordly-wise and experienced, but that&#8217;s not why I travel. Travelling helps me to just get comfortable in every situation, because as an actor also, you’re thrown into different situations and you have to adapt to it.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 7 What else has travelling taught you?</strong></p>
<p>There are times when you pick up references for yourself as an actor, and are not able to recollect the source of it. The other takeaways from travelling is that it keeps you grounded. There are people who don&#8217;t know you, and that&#8217;s when you meet reality in the closest form. I&#8217;m always playing Rajeev Khandelwal when I&#8217;m in Mumbai, but at these places, you stand in the queue and do normal things. It&#8217;s important for us to feel that we&#8217;re not special; we&#8217;re as ordinary as everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 8 So, travelling is more than just a hobby?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, of course, it adds so much to my personality. Which is why, for me, it&#8217;s all about roughing it out, surviving difficult situations. Moreover, I think the way a person travels reflects his/her attitude towards life. I think that reflects my attitude because if I co-relate that to my career, I feel this is how I&#8217;ve actually followed my career as well. I don&#8217;t like going the usual route.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 9 Do you also like experimenting with the cuisines of various areas as you travel?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m experimental, but most times, I don&#8217;t enjoy the cuisines. If you go to the remotest part of Himalayas, the kind of food that they eat is not very palatable. For example, the guys in Ladakh eat a lot of &#8216;<em>thupka</em>&#8216;, it&#8217;s made of noodles, and a lot of other things. When I go for camping, I carry a lot of eatables, raw materials, and am always well-equipped, if I have to survive for a day!</p>
<p><strong>Q. 10 Which are your favourite travel destinations?</strong></p>
<p>My all-time favourite is Himachal and Leh-Ladakh. Then there&#8217;s also Uttaranchal. Arunachal Pradesh is outstanding. Manipur-Nagaland is beautiful too. And, Kashmir— I know it like the back of my hand, because I&#8217;ve driven through almost all the lanes of the place. Abroad, I travel, when I&#8217;m shooting. I&#8217;ve been to Europe, Middle-East, etc. But, I like travelling in India, because you know this belongs to you, it&#8217;s your own place, your own people, you don&#8217;t have to show your passport. If given a choice, I&#8217;d want to travel the whole world, but first I want to cover all of India. I want to cover the south. So, that&#8217;s next on the agenda.</p>

<p>Bindass’ new show, <em>Halla Bol</em>, is about those gutsy women who fight and raise their voice against the injustice meted out to them. The show is inspired by true events, and celebrates eight different stories of women who fought back and emerged victorious. <em>Halla Bol</em> also questions the prejudices and taboos existing in society and inspires the youth to break free from these gender myths. With Kangana Ranaut becoming the first youth icon of the show, the first episode aims to inspire women to fight against injustice.<br />
Ranaut is known for her women-oriented characters in films like <em>Fashion, Tanu Weds Manu, Rajjo</em>, and the forthcoming <em>Queen</em>. It’ll be interesting to watch her inspire other women too. The show will premiere on February 28, and will have Karan Tacker as the host.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ashish Kapoor to enter Saraswatichandra</strong></p>
<p>Just when you thought all will be well in Kumud (Jennifer Winget) and Saras’ (Gautam Rode) paradise what with the couple tying the knot, here’s a twist in the tale. Monica Bedi has entered the show again, to cause problems in their lives. Besides, now there’s a new entry in the form of Ashish Kapoor who shall play Kabir. Kapoor will be instrumental in causing problems in Kumud and Saras’ lives, and will sport a very stylish avatar. Kapoor was last seen in Sony’s show <em>Love Marriage Ya Arranged Marriage</em>. Talking about being a part of <em>Saraswatichandra</em>, he says, “I wouldn’t want to give out much on my role. All I’d say is I’ll be there in the show to shake things up in Saras and Kumud’s life.” The buzz is, that Kabir’s character will not only create suspicion and fear in both the families, but will also open up the Pandora’s box, exposing several hidden truths.</p>

<p>One film old Daisy Shah is in the news for wrong reasons. Apparently an FIR has been registered against the <em>Jai Ho</em> heroine and 18 others at Kanpur’s Kannauj police by Satyendra Singh, a small-time Bhojpuri actor from Mainpuri district, accusing them for conspiring to kill him in December 2013. He alleged that he was thrown out of the film he was to do with Daisy as she wanted to work with a renowned actor. He also alleged that they deliberately rammed a SUV into his car on December 27.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Premier visitors</strong></p>
<p>Shah Rukh Khan had a visitor on the sets of his film <em>Happy New Year</em> in RK Studios, in the form of former president of Mexico Vicente Fox. The actor even posed for a photograph with Fox, his wife Martha and current Mexican Ambassador to India Jamie Nualart. The meeting took place on February 11, wherein they discussed everything about India — its films, its culture and people, as well as about Mexico and the importance of education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nitin Raikwar hospitalised</strong></p>
<p>Nitin Raikwar, who wrote blockbuster songs like <em>Aati kya Khandala, Apun bola, Kambakhi Ishq, Khallas</em>, has been hospitalised and is in the ICU. He’ll undergo a delicate brain operation at Mumbai’s Kokilaben Hospital. He was experiencing disorientation and severe headaches for the past few days. On check-up, it was diagnosed as a subdural haematoma of the brain of unknown origin. This was disclosed by Dr. Nitin Gupta, a friend of Raikwar in a press statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A slap in the face</strong></p>
<p>A small-time actor Geetika Tyagi has posted a video on YouTube titled <em>Subhash Kapoor’s True Face</em>, and even alleged in her tweets that she was assaulted by Kapoor more than a year ago. The 31-minute video shows Kapoor and his wife pleading with and trying to pacify a sobbing Tyagi, who slapped Kapoor across his face. Recorded by Tyagi without the Kapoors’ knowledge, the video went viral and has had nearly 40,000 hits.</p>

<p>Film actors are now going beyond reality shows and making their presence felt on fiction shows on television. To promote their upcoming film <em>Youngistan</em>, Jackie Bhagnani and Neha Sharma shall be seen on Sony’s <em>Jee Le Zara</em>, which stars Sangeeta Ghosh (Saanchi) and Ruslaan Mumtaz (Dhruv). In fact, one hears that a full episode shall be dedicated to <em>Youngistan</em>. How the story will incorporate the <em>Youngistan</em> actors remains a matter of speculation. While, the newly-weds Dhruv and Saanchi are lost in their love for each other, much to the chagrin of certain family members, Saanchi is putting in her best efforts to adjust to Dhruv’s family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Negative twist in Ekk Nayi Pehchan</strong></p>
<p>Just as Sakshi (Krystle D’Souza) is helping and motivating her mother-in-law Sharda (Poonam Dhillon), new characters will be introduced in the show that will prove to be the proverbial stumbling blocks. With the introduction of <em>Dadi bua</em>, an extremely orthodox woman with rigid views, the story is poised to take an interesting turn. Actress Kavita Vaid has been roped in to play the role, and she makes her displeasure apparent at the idea of Sharda taking a formal education. Apart from this, a fresh face Gauri will share screen space with Vaid, playing <em>Dadi bua</em>’s daughter-in-law, Bhagwanti. Talking about this character, Vaid says, “My character <em>Dadi bua</em> is quite unique for me. My entry in the show will lead to conflicts between the younger and older generations.” Meanwhile, Sharda is also counselling Sakshi to win over her husband. With <em>Dadi bua</em>’s entry, the show will have a slightly negative twist.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994464&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[It’s been a while since one saw Karan Tacker on television after Ek Hazaron Mein Meri Behna Hai wrapped up last year. The TV heartthrob is all set to return in a new avatar — as a host of Halla Bol, a woman-oriented show on Bindass. The actor reveals the reason that made him take on a show that focusses women issues<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994381&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

<p><strong>What made you take on the offer to host Halla Bol?</strong></p>
<p><em> Halla Bol</em> is a show with a cause, and that’s definitely the prime reason that attracted me to it. It is about women, who fight back. I remember discussing the heinous gangrape incident in Delhi with my father, and feeling miserable about women being helpless in a democratic country like ours. So, when I was told about <em>Halla Bol</em>, I was very excited as it’s nice to see women fight back, and not see them being made to feel helpless or guilty and victimised. I don’t think we have seen anything like this show on television so far.</p>
<p><strong>When a show highlights the problems that women face, it is also essential that the host be sensitive while dealing with it. How has that been for you?</strong></p>
<p>We have a fantastic team from the channel, which puts in a lot of efforts in writing a script; we all sit down together, and discuss it before shooting. There are certain norms that need to be followed. We can’t hurt anybody’s sentiments. We have to be politically correct, and yet make a point, and appeal to women, men, the society and the government (for that matter) to do their bit to live in harmony. Even if we feel very passionate about raising the issue, we have to be correct about it.</p>
<p><strong>What are the thoughts that go on in your head as a man hosting a woman-oriented show?</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to have a man hosting the show that is about women, because we’re talking about women as victims, and making an appeal to men as well. Why do women have to think ten times before venturing out at night, when men can easily roam about freely any where? Women should also enjoy the same right and freedom. So, it’s an appeal to men that it’s high time they stop looking at women as an object of desire. Instead, it’s every man’s moral responsibility to protect every woman, not just women in the house. I’m honoured that the channel approached me to do it. When you have a television face attached to it, it’s natural that it brings more eyeballs to the show. I would be glad if I could bring in some audience, so there’s more awareness. On the personal front, I also support a lot of charities like ‘Save The Girl Child’. I’m an out-an-out feminist. I respect women a lot, and I truly believe that men exist because of women. I come from a household where I have 11 cousin sisters, which is why I feel strongly about the subject and am emotionally attached to the show.</p>
<p><strong>How is hosting different from acting on television?</strong></p>
<p>I love hosting. When you play a character for a very long time, your identity gets lost somewhere. Hosting gives you an edge as an actor and really brings out your real personality. It lets the audience know what kind of a person you are and how you think.</p>
<p><strong>Now that you’ve discovered the joys of hosting, will that overshadow acting?</strong></p>
<p>I really enjoy acting, it will be my topmost priority. A lot goes into the making of a character. When I hear a narration, I go back home and write down certain aspects of the character that I am going to play and try to understand the lifestyle of the person. That’s always been a habit with me. It’s a fun exercise and not always about looking pretty on-screen.</p>
<p><strong>So what’s next on the cards?</strong></p>
<p>As far as fiction is concerned, if I hear something exciting, I would love to do it. But, I’m not liking anything these days. In my earlier shows, all my characters were different from the other. Doing similar roles is not creatively exciting, so I’m not doing anything for the moment. Actors are emotional people, so as and when I find something exciting, I’ll do it. Besides, these days channels are coming up with new-age concepts, and moving away from the <em>saas-bahu</em> dramas. It’s a good sign as the audience need to see shows that reflect their reality, the changing pattern of relationships in today’s world etc. So, hoping something exciting comes my way soon.</p>

<p><strong>Host and chef:</strong> Gurdip Punjj</p>
<p>Zee Khana Khazana, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday,<br />
1 pm &amp; 9 pm</p>
<p>Are you a foodie, who’s quite a disaster in the kitchen? Then here’s your chance to get the basics right with Zee Khana Khazana’s<em> ABC &#8211; All ‘Bout Cooking</em>.<br />
Hosted by television actress, Gurdip Punjj, who’s now made a place for herself as a celebrity chef on Zee Khana Khazana, <em>ABC</em> is her second food show after <em>Bachha Party</em>. It’s interesting how she really goes down to the basics with her choice of ingredients and recipes.<br />
Each episode takes on an ingredient and rustles up three recipes around it. It’s not surprising that the show begins with Mr Congeniality of vegetables — Potato. A vegetable that has an impeccable track record as a team player as well as on its own. Punjj makes a good first impression in the choice of her three recipes that she rustles up around this versatile vegetable — Mashed Potato, Aloo Poha Tikki and Aloo Shimla Mirch. The brownie points go for the choice of the first and last dish, which are the basic must-knows for all aspiring chefs. The Aloo Poha Tikki gives that touch of novelty, but somehow the use of maida, instead of corn flour or rice flour as a binding agent is jarring. ‘Aren’t we supposed be health conscious too?’ is the question that keeps cropping in one’s mind.<br />
Punjj impresses even more with the second episode, which centres around the most friendly and smooth pate among food items. No, it’s not Agatha Christie’s egg-head Poirot, but the egg itself. The television actress turned celeb chef knows her cooking alright, and her choice of ingredients for teaching basics of cooking confirms it. Like potato, egg is versatile and creates magic — on its own or as a team player. Besides, it’s also a source of vitamins. Punjj’s selection of three recipes for this ingredient is also impressive — Egg Mayo, Poached Egg and Scrambled Egg. Making Poached Egg is almost like an art abroad, for an Indian chef to actually broach the topic is commendable. Punjj scores majorly on the selection of Poached Egg, which is again a must-learn for any aspiring chef. Honestly, the Scrambled Egg could have been better. Somehow, I just couldn’t help but think of the Parsis, who rustle up exquisite dishes with the egg, including a basic thing as Scrambled Egg. One of the most fascinating things they do is whisk the egg with ghee in it, and then scramble it in a heated pan. The result: soft and fluffy scramble that you can lightly season with black pepper. Simple!<br />
But then we have to return to Punjj, who hits the right note with her show and easy cooking. Just wish, she’d stop using that Bachha Party tone. Aspiring cooks watching your show are not exactly attending kindergarten classes, you know. Not even if they were prodigy cooks.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Want to cook? <em>ABC</em> is a good place to begin with.</p>

<p>The Lego Movie, an animated film that depicts a world based on the colourful toy blocks, collected $48.8 million to top box-office charts for a second week, finishing far ahead of romantic comedy About Last Night, which had ticket sales of $27 million on a U.S. holiday weekend that kicked off on Valentine’s Day.<br />
RoboCop, a remake of the 1987 science fiction film about a part-man, part-cyborg crime fighter, was third with sales of $21.5 million from Friday to Sunday in the domestic market that includes the U.S. and Canada theatres, according to studio reports. Monday marked the federal Presidents Day holiday.<br />
The romantic drama Endless Love, one of three remakes of 1980s-era films opening in theatres, was fifth with $13.4 million, behind Monuments Men, the story of a World War II unit that retrieves stolen art which stars George Clooney and Matt Damon and which earned $15 million in its second week, according to Rentrak.<br />
The tracking firm said it was the third-best Presidents Day result of all time, with about $177 million expected from Friday to Sunday. Hollywood’s box-office is running about 11.5 per cent above last year’s numbers, it said.<br />
The animated Lego movie has earned nearly $130 million since opening on February 7. Featuring the voices of Will Arnett and Elizabeth Banks, it portrays a world under attack by the evil Lord Business who wants to destroy the Lego universe by gluing it together. The heroes include Batman, a pirate and an astronaut, all made out of the classic children’s interlocking blocks.<br />
About Last Night, a remake of the 1986 film that starred Rob Lowe and Demi Moore as young lovers, stars Kevin Hart and Regina Hall and was made for a relatively modest $12 million.<br />
Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Sony Pictures, which released the film, said the comedy “knocked it out of the park,” and was playing well to couples as well as groups of friends during the Valentine’s Day and U.S. holiday weekend.<br />
RoboCop, which cost about $100 million to make, was performing especially well in international markets, Bruer said, and was on track to take in about $30 million domestically since its opening.<br />
Endless Love is a remake of a 1981 film starring Brooke Shields which was a modest hit, but saw its theme song by Diana Ross and Lionel Richie become a No. 1 hit, scoring Academy Award, Golden Globe and Grammy nominations.</p>

<p><strong>Juno actress Ellen Page comes out as gay</strong></p>
<p>Actress Ellen Page, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role in Juno, came out as a lesbian recently at a Las Vegas conference for gay teens. “I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission,” the 26-year-old actress said in a speech that drew roaring support from an audience at the Time to Thrive conference sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign.<br />
“I’m here today because I am gay. And because &#8230; maybe I can make a difference,” she said. “To help others have an easier and more hopeful time. Regardless, for me, I feel a personal obligation and a social responsibility.” Page, who in 2007 played a pregnant teen in Juno, has also starred in Inception, To Rome with Love and X-Men: The Last Stand. Page is also working on Freeheld, a drama about a terminally ill police detective fighting to assign her retirement benefits to a lesbian lover. Page said in her speech that she suffered for years because she was scared to be public about her sexuality. “My spirit suffered, my mental health suffered and my relationships suffered,” she said. “And I’m standing here today, with all of you, on the other side of all that pain.”<br />
The Human Rights Campaign, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group that posted her speech on its website, congratulated Page for completing the “deeply personal and arduous journey” of coming out.</p>

<p>Instead of opting for a press conference to announce the film, Shilpa Shetty Kundra began the promotions of her debut production venture starring Harman Baweja and debutante Ayesha Khanna starrer<em> Dishkiyaoon</em> with a song launch event organised in Mumbai. The first look of the peppy dance number <em>Tu mere type ka nahi hai</em>, which is picturised on Kundra and Baweja, was revealed at the event. On demand from the audience, both the actors took center stage and danced on the track twice. When asked about her experience of dancing on the number, Kundra couldn’t stop praising Baweja’s dancing skills and kept stating that she was extremely nervous to perform with him. “It was too much pressure. I was emotionally blackmailed into doing this song, especially by Sanamjit (director). I was left with no choice and had to say yes. It’s different from the usual dance numbers that you get to see these days,” mentioned Kundra. After being quizzed about his preparations for the number, Baweja said that he can never match up to the actress’ level of performance and confessed that he was extremely nervous.<br />
Composed by White Noise productions with vocals by Kunal Ganjawalla and wife Gayatri, the song is shot on a Moulin Rouge inspired set and has a Broadway feel to it, complete with Hollywood style cinema halls and stalls in the background. The lyrics penned by Mayur Puri is a mix of Hindi and English, with words like ‘scope’ rhyming with ‘dope’ frequently. The <em>Dishkiyaoon</em> album will feature five songs by multiple composers, which includes Sneha Khanwalkar, White Noise Productions and debut music director Palash Muchhal, who happens to be all of eighteen. Interestingly, actor Prashant Narayanan will also turn composer with a song in the film. The lyrics of all the songs are penned by director Sanamjit Talwar.</p>

<p><strong>Melody queen awarded</strong></p>
<p>Bharat Ratna and melody queen of India, singer Lata Mangeshkar was conferred with the First Sathkalaratna Puraskar – 2014, instituted by Sathkalapeetam Payyanur, Kannur, Kerala, at the hands of Swamy Krishnananda Bharathy. For someone who is not new to awards, Mangeshkar was humbled and touched by the gesture and thanked everyone present at the event for bestowing the award upon her. The event, held in Mumbai, turned out to be a great meet for two musical maestros as Padma Vibhushan Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia was also present. Both Mangeshkar and Chaurasia spent quality time talking about music and enquired about each other’s health. Bharathy mentioned that since Mangeshkar is the one and only melody queen of India, it was natural to gift the award to her.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994490&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>From the inventors of the pneumatic car flipper to the software developers who replaced clay modeling with digital sculpture, dozens of behind-the-scenes cinematic innovators turned out recently to receive recognition from the film industry.<br />
Two weeks before the Oscars, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences handed out its Scientific and Technical Achievement Awards for the visual effects behind groundbreaking films such as Avatar, Life of Pi and Gravity. While the Academy Awards on March 2 will reward films released in 2013, the yearly scientific and technical awards honour contributions to film-making for innovations that developed over years and even decades.<br />
This year, the Academy gave certificates or plaques to 52 individuals for 19 scientific and technical achievements, and two golden Oscar statuettes as well a s a medal of commendation. Joshua Pines, who got his award for color correction technology, called it “the Winter Olympics for geeks”.<br />
One of the first awards of the night went to the men behind the pneumatic car flipper used in films including Independence Day and Total Recall. As films moved off movie sets and into real places such as downtown Los Angeles, they had to develop a method to safely and reliably launch cars. “We had to know exactly where cars were going to land when we launched them,” said prize winner John Frazier.<br />
Awards were also given for the flying camera that can be programmed to whizz through a house with exact precision and for the Helicam miniature helicopter camera system.<br />
Hosted by actors Michael B. Jordan and Kristen Bell, star of mystery drama Veronica Mars, the ceremony saw many awards for digital filmmaking software, such as deep compositing, which allows image layering and gives depth to the final film.<br />
Another winner, Eric Veach, earned a scientific and engineering award for his research years ago that has helped transform computer graphics lighting used in films including Gravity. Veach said he was amazed that “some people had read my thesis and are using it to make movies”.<br />
Technology innovators from Dreamworks Animation, Pixar Animation Studios, Walt Disney Co and Warner Bros also won awards, and most everyone thanked their spouses for putting up with incredibly long working days.<br />
One of the golden Oscar statuettes went to visual effects supervisor and director of photography Peter Anderson, a 3-D expert, for his technological contributions to the industry. “Without the science, what would the art be? And without the art, what would the science be?” he said.<br />
The other statuette went to a collective of &#8220;all those who built and operated film laboratories, for over a century of service to the motion picture industry&#8221;.<br />
In a room full of digital supremos, the nod to the tradition of making movies on film was received with cheers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scorsese says NY Review film meant as guide to young</strong></p>
<p>Director and producer Martin Scorsese says he hopes his documentary to mark the 50th anniversary of the New York Review of Books will point young people in the right direction for getting reliable information in an age of data overload. Scorsese and co-director David Tedeschi screened what they said was a nearly finished version of the as-yet-untitled documentary at the Berlin international film festival. They said it should be ready for release in March. Best known for box-office hits like Raging Bull and The Wolf of Wall Street, Scorsese said he had been a faithful reader of the review.<br />
Since it was launched during the 1963 New York newspaper strike, the influential publication has published authors and critics ranging from Norman Mailer, Gore Vidal and Joan Didion to Ian Buruma and Zoe Heller. Scorsese said the review’s editor and co-founder Robert Silvers — who attended the screening — had asked him to make the film, and that he had agreed in part because he wanted to guide young people to sources of information he deemed trustworthy.<br />
“Particularly in this age of the glut of information and the data that’s around, how do they select, how do they choose what to believe in as a value?” the director said. “They have no idea of how fragile the freedom is, none, you see. And so this is an attempt in a way to maybe point them in a direction.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Though APPSolute Games LLC’s first 3D cross platform multiplayer Fright Fight  comes with a catch, this fun and innovative freemium game is a must buy<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993803&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/fright267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993805" alt="Fright Fight" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/fright267.jpg" /></a> Fright Fight
<p>For game lovers who always wanted to slug it out on their mobile devices or tablets, the launch of <em>Fright Fight</em> is surely a blessing in disguise.<br />
The game, developed by APPSolute Games LLC, is the first of its kind 3D cross platform multiplayer (which allows players on different gaming platforms to play with each other). Although the multiplayer brawler bears an uncanny resemblance to Nintendo’s popular Super Smash Bros. series, <em>Fright Fight</em> is unique in its own league. With a simplified combat system, the game offers a decent overall experience without the need of a controller. It’s true that you may not be able to pull off extravagant combos, but gamers will certainly enjoy thrashing up the baddies in some really interesting online showdowns.<br />
<em>Fright Fight</em> has an interesting mix of horror and fantasy as its theme. To start off, the player can choose any one from the four available characters, which include Khan-The Werewolf, Carmilla -The Vampire, Grim-The Reaper and Hugo-The Yeti. All these characters possess different skills and traits. While Khan is a good scout, Hugo can turn into a classic tank. The RPG system of the game includes a unique skill tree for each character. Here, the gamers can choose a style and game tactics for the character of their choice. In addition to the character skill trees, it also includes purchasable items like weapons, armour, rings and amulets among others, which can be bought using game coins or real money.<br />
Once you are set, the gamer can start playing against other players online. To fight, you will need basic combinations of swipes and tabs to use your character’s skills and fight it out against the competitor, in a short two-minute match. The main objective is to end the round by draining your competitor’s health with back-to-back attacks or knocking them off the stage. The most exciting part is the fact that the arena does not restrict you to just a one-on-one challenge, as you can fight against three more friends or even strangers from across the world, all during the same match.<br />
Each character in the game comes with a rage meter, which allows you to dash, block, and pull off an ultimate attack. Extra techniques like these are interesting, as it provides you with different ways to surprise your competitor at crucial moments. Keep an eye out for a variety of elements that spring up during a match, as they can help restore your character’s health or give it temporary power ups.<br />
The graphics are decent and the controls work well. But hold on! Freemium games always have a catch hidden somewhere. Although you are guided through a tutorial in the beginning (where you can play as werewolf), the gamer needs to think wisely before locking the final character, since every other additional character after that will cost $3.99 or 24,000 in game coins. Like most games, there are several in-app purchases and boosters which you can buy.<br />
With a simple combat system, decent graphics, fun game play and a freemium model, <em>Fright Fight</em> does make for a good buy. But if you are someone who wants variety or fast progress, then be ready to shell out lots of cash.</p>

<p>By <strong>Anushree Bhattacharyya</strong></p>
<p>She is known for her bubbly and lively attitude and he is popular for being on the constant lookout for an adventure. No, this is not the usual college girl and guy story, rather it is about the beverage brand Pepsi and youth television channel MTV who in a first-of-its-kind alliance have joined hands to launch a 24-hour Indie pop channel—Pepsi MTV Indies—that will go live by the end of this month.<br />
The first branded channel in the country, Pepsi MTV Indies promises to be different with the focus on promoting independent music, films, art and culture. While 20 per cent of the content will be custom made by the channel, 50 per cent will be music albums and the rest will be licensed from Indie artists. It also plans to shift a few of its shows from the flagship channel to the new one, except its popular show Coke Studio which due to sponsorship issues will be telecast on MTV. An interactive website and mobile application has also been introduced for digital lovers.<br />
In a conversation,<strong> Aditya Swamy</strong>, business head, MTV India and <strong>Homi Battiwalla</strong>, senior director, marketing (colas, juices and hydration), PepsiCo India Region, talk about bringing the two youth brands together to launch a new channel. Edited excerpts:</p>
<p><strong>What brought Pepsi and MTV together to launch Pepsi MTV Indies?</strong><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Swamy:</strong> Indian music is going through a revolution with people now looking out for new forms of music and musicians. The new channel represents independent artists in India, be it in the field of music or other activities such as graffiti, etc. The idea is to get along with these artists and co-create a new kind of content. This content will be created and made available in many languages—Hindi, English, Malayalam, Oriya, etc. Also, with digitisation, pay television is the way forward. This new channel which is a pay channel is a high-definition (HD) channel which will be available across the country soon.</p>
<p><strong>Battiwalla:</strong> India has three passion points—cricket, cinema and music. While our association with the Indian Premier League (IPL) provides a strong link to the game of cricket, for a while we have been trying to find out what is the kind of music that we can tap into. Pepsi, globally has a strong association with music and we wanted to create a similar bond in India. Going by our new philosophy, as per which ‘Pepsi taps into restless youth’, which was launched last year, together with MTV we decided to tap into new forms of music, art and culture. Also, Pepsi as a brand has a huge presence across the country right from college campuses to offices, etc., and this initiative allows the brand to stay active all around the year.</p>
<p><strong>How does the deal benefit both the parties—Pepsi and MTV?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Battiwalla:</strong> The deal with MTV goes beyond bringing money to the table to playing an active role. For instance, we mutually selected the genre in which we would like to launch the channel in addition to finalising the target group (TG). In fact, together we decided to empower a college band every month. We select one band, groom it and then shoot a video and put it on the channel. Also, we will be participating in various college festivals where we will take the Pepsi MTV Indies stage, which will thus give an opportunity to new talent to showcase their skills. This is a balanced deal which ensures good return on investments.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Swamy:</strong> This deal gives us a huge opportunity to engage with the youth, our core target audience in a new and better manner. Rather than trying to build up an audience base for the new channel, the partnership with Pepsi will give instant access to youth as brand Pepsi is present across the country. Then the brand also has a presence in sport through the IPL, so we will have access to those people as well. Apart from this, on Facebook, brand Pepsi has about 20 million followers and MTV too has 20 million followers, which in total makes 40 million people, to whom we will have direct reach.</p>
<p><strong>The launch of the new channel coincides with the launch of Pepsi’s new logo which has been launched earlier in many international markets. Why did it take so long for Pepsi to implement the new logo in India?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Battiwalla:</strong> Pepsi at an international level has been working on a new visual identity. While the new look has been implemented in some countries, in India the new look has been introduced now. One of the reasons is that India is the first country to get its very own colour of blue. The colour blue that we own now and use in branding was created for India. Secondly, the transformation to the new look has been gradual. We took the first step last year, when we adopted the new international positioning, and changed our positioning to ‘Oh yes abhi’. The new look will be implemented gradually and will be seen during World Cup T20 and the IPL.</p>
<p><strong>With the new deal what happens to ‘Coke Studio@MTV’?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swamy:</strong> Coke Studio remains where it was—that is, it will be telecast on MTV, the parent channel. While for Coke Studio the idea was to create new music by bringing together well-known musicians and singers under one roof, in the new channel the focus will be to give a chance to new faces and promote them.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of content can be expected from the new channel?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swamy:</strong> Apart from promoting independent music, the channel will have various other elements. We will not get into regular episodic format; rather we will play around with the duration of the content. One of our popular shows, Sound Trippin, will be telecast on both the channels and another—MTV Roots—will be rebranded as Indie and will be shifted to the new channel.<br />
Another segment the channel will telecast is Punk–Indiepedia, which will explain words that are known to the Indie community. Next, Open Files will be a show about album art, while Busking will showcase known popular artists who will play five songs on the streets of India. Among these artists are Raghu Dixit, Indus Creed, Shaa’ir and Func, who will stand on a regular street location and play five songs, and we will release one album in a month.<br />
Additionally, instead of regular video jockeys (VJ), we will have stand-up comedians as hosts. Another segment will feature unusual work in the world of independent art such as street art, skateboarding, biking, etc. We are also trying to rope in various bands that can contribute to the content and hence spread the independent art culture. We are partnering with balconyTV (a bunch of artists playing from the balconies), Live from the console, Blue Frog, Indie Earth (for independent films), music labels from OML to Universal. The core idea is to expose people to different art forms.</p>
<p><strong>In addition to Pepsi bringing in the money, how else do you plan to monetise the channel?</strong><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Swamy:</strong> The channel has four pillars – web, mobile, television and live events and we plan to utilise all the verticals. We have a stable business model right from the start with multiple revenue streams that we would be exploring, including advertising, subscription as it is a pay channel, live events and gigs, international distribution, consumer products and licensing, amongst others. In addition to this, we are also on the lookout for platinum partners—that is, a few key brands that we would like to partner and which would like to advertise on the new channel. We are<br />
looking to partner brands that target the youth. For example, mobile handset brands or telecom service providers, lifestyle brands, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What about the digital part of the business. How do you plan to leverage that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Swamy:</strong> The website is responsive currently and has many elements in it. For example, it allows one to create his or her own playlist of songs. Then it has a big calender about events, which allows one to keep track of college fests and various gigs.<br />
On the mobile front, a unique Indie music discovery app has been created which is accessible across all Android and iOS platforms. Concerts and festivals are a key part of the Pepsi MTV Indies footprint. Flagship channel MTV’s website has about 10 million visitors per month. Until the Indies’ website reaches that level of traffic, we are not thinking of monetising it. A website has to have a strong number of followers/visitors for it to be monetised. And once the new website crosses this target, then we will be able to monetise it in many ways. For example, through pay per view, licensing on content, downloads from websites, etc.</p>
<p><strong>How does Pepsi plan to leverage the channel for IPL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Battiwalla:</strong> There are many ways of utilising the association for IPL. We can take up many filler activities during the break as every stadium has a seating capacity of 20,000-45,000 people.<br />
Then there is also the option of creating a fan park as the tourney has a huge fan following. We will weigh in various options, both in-stadia and out of stadium.</p>

<p>The fifth edition of the reality show, <em>Khatron Ke Khiladi (KKK)</em> has already taken off in Cape Town, South Africa. Rohit Shetty, who will host the show kick-started the shoot for <em>KKK</em> along with the contestants a few days ago. What will make the show stand apart from its earlier seasons is that Shetty, in keeping with his style of film-making that includes humour combined with high-octane stunts, aims to provide a bit of reprieve with his brand of humour in this otherwise adrenaline-filled show. He aims to dispel the nervousness of the contestants before they take the plunge and perform dare-devil stunts. Shetty says, “While I’m excited about action, I can’t keep myself away from adding a touch of humour. Even as the script was narrated to me, I improvised on it. While the contestants have to always be vigilant, these happy moments, shall make the<em> KKK</em> experience memorable for all of us.” The show is expected to go on air by March or April.</p>

<p><strong>Tinu Verma to enter Mahabharat as Jarasandha</strong></p>
<p><em>While Joy Mathur will play Shishupal</em></p>
<p>Stunt master-cum-actor Tinu Verma is set to enter Siddharth Kumar Tiwary’s <em>Mahabharat.</em> He has been cast for the role of Jarasandha. According to mythology, king of Magadha, Brihadratha was unable to sire children. Frustrated, he retreats into a forest and serves sage Chandakaushika. Pleased with his devotion, the sage gives him a fruit which if eaten by his wife will bless him with a child. The king cuts the fruit into two and gives each portion to his two wives. The wives become pregnant and give birth to two halves of a human body. Disgusted with the sight, the bodies are thrown in the forest. A demoness called Jara finds the bodies and holds it in her palms and miraculously, they take shape of a human body. So, despite Bheem slaying Jarasandha twice, he remains unaffected as he has the ability to conjoin himself. Lord Krishna advises Bheem to tear Jarasandha’s body and throw both the parts in opposite directions.<br />
Meanwhile, actor Joy Mathur shall be seen as Shishupal, who is a distant cousin of Lord Krishna. Krishna had promised Shishupal’s mother to forgive 100 mistakes of her son, but when Shishupal commits 101st mistake, Krishna slays him.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994391&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif wrapped up the third schedule of <em>Bang Bang</em> in Shimla and Manali last week, where Roshan has shot some never-before tried action sequences. The stunts are designed by world renowned stunt designer and director, Andy Armstrong who is involved in some of the most complex, dangerous and complex stunts and action sequences in blockbusters like <em>Spider- Man 2</em>. Commenting on reports that Roshan will use a body double for his stunts in the film, the spokesperson for Fox Star Studios, who is producing the film, said that doubles were arranged for Hrithik keeping in mind his recent brain surgery.<br />
“Hrithik, who has always done his own stunts wanted to shoot the scenes himself. The body doubles, however, will be available on sets all the time. We cannot talk about the nature of the stunts as that would give away the story. They are, however, designed in an unique and an untried way,” he said. The fourth schedule of the film will be in Delhi after which a foreign location is planned.<em> Bang Bang</em> is directed by Siddharth Anand and will release on October 2. To ensure that the film sticks to its release date, it is also simultaneously being edited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sonakshi Sinha in Tevar</strong></p>
<p>Sonakshi Sinha recently shot for a song, <em>Radha nachegi</em>, for <em>Tevar</em>. The high on energy number will see the actress doing some twirls and swirls in a stunning<em> lehnga choli</em>. Choreographed by Remo D’Souza, the song was shot on a set created near a lake in Maheshwar, Indore.<em> Tevar</em> is the Hindi remake of the 2003 Telugu hit<em> Okkadu</em> and is directed by debutant ad film-maker-turned director Amit Sharma. Arjun Kapoor who is the male lead plays a <em>kabbadi</em> player in the film and Manoj Bajpayee is also part of the project. The film is presently being shot in Mathura.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993705&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/randeep480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996266" alt="Randeep Hooda is an intense actor." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/randeep480.jpg" /></a> Randeep Hooda is an intense actor.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call Randeep Hooda an intense actor, and he retorts, “I’d like to use the word involved, rather than intense. I get involved with every character I play.” You can’t help but believe that, because the serious, angst-ridden characters that Hooda is known for, are far from the funny, charming man that he is. He jokes around and is anything but politically correct.<br /> Hooda is happy to have done a film like <em>Highway</em>, which gave him a chance to work on the nuances of his character. “I enjoy roles that require me to prepare, because it gives me the feeling that you’re doing something worthwhile. Challenges are a must, because if it’s easy, then you’re not doing a good job,” he says. In the Imtiaz Ali film, the actor plays a toughie, sporting the colloquial dialect of the Gujjar community. “The way I look in the film was a task. I stopped shaving, stopped washing my hair. I used to make the ‘Om’ tattoo myself, and also tattoo my name on my arm. To maintain a consistent look throughout was difficult. Moreover, I had to get the accent right. There’s this community called Gujjar who are found mostly in areas like Haryana or Rajasthan, so I had to speak their dialect and modify my tone. Initially, it was very essential to bring out the contrast between our characters, who belong to two different worlds—that of the haves and the have nots— in order to make it believable. Although, this is not the leitmotif of the story, still, we had to vividly portray these two worlds.” explains Hooda about his character, Mahabir Bhati. As the duo do not interact with each other, initially in the film, just to add authenticity to their scenes together, Hooda refrained from talking with Bhatt for 20-25 days while shooting. He started talking to her only when their characters start interacting in the film.<br /> While the actor is slowly plodding ahead, choosing his films with care, he remains unaffected with the success and failure of his past films. “I’ve always approached my characters with a lot of honesty. I think as an actor you’re considered successful only if you associate with the right kind of people. For instance, if an independent producer is making a film, it doesn’t have good distribution, there’s no promotion, so obviously nobody will watch the film. That’s what was happening with my career. But that changed after I did <em>Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai</em> because my association was bigger in terms of working with Balaji Motion Pictures or Ajay Devgn. This, however, does not mean that I’ve not worked hard in my other projects,” clarifies Hooda.<br /> Acknowledging a lean phase in his career when despite his sincerity and hard work, the actor did not have any films on hand. Undeterred by failure, he changed tracks and dabbled with theatre, a medium with which he was associated with since the beginning of his career. An active member of Naseeruddin Shah’s Motley Group, Hooda had adapted Lee Blessing’s <em>A Walk In The Woods</em> that was directed by Ratna Pathak Shah. “I began experimenting with my career a tad too early, which I shouldn’t have. There was a time when I didn’t have work in films, so I did theatre. The best role that I enacted on stage was the character called Lucky in the play <em>Waiting for Godot</em>, with Naseeruddin Shah, and Akarsh Khurrana. The character doesn’t speak, and when he does, he doesn’t stop. I don’t think I can ever beat that role.”<br /> Playing myriad characters, Hooda makes a conscious attempt not be typecast in a particular mold. “I did a film like <em>Bombay Talkies</em>, playing the role of an bi-sexual man in the Karan Johar directed segment, <em>Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh</em> even as I was playing macho characters in my other projects. I’m at a point in my career where I am being offered intense roles and not the routine song and dance stuff. I need to find the courage to refuse to play run-of-the-mill characters, even if offered by a big banner.”<br /> While some may say that Hooda is an under-rated actor, he begs to differ. “I think it’ll be pompous to say, that I’m an under-rated actor, but I’m glad I’m not being slotted in the over-rated category. Being over-rated is something which would be hard to digest,” he smiles. His choice of films reflect his thoughts as an actor, yet, it comes as a surprise when he says that more than the audience, it’s the film-makers he wants to appeal to. “The ability to pick the roles which keep the film-makers interested in me, is most important, because actors aren’t given work from an audience poll. Once a film-maker casts you, it’s only then that the audience sees you. So, the idea is to keep yourself interesting enough for the film-makers to cast you,” he says.<br /> Although, he has an impressive line up of films this year with <em>Ungli, Main Aur Charles Shobhraj</em> and <em>Kick</em>,he doesn’t consider this as the best phase of his career. Ask him about his role in the Salman Khan starrer<em> Kick</em> and he says, “I like to talk about my films only when I have to, and that is at the time of release. But I’ve begun shooting for it, and it’s a great role,” he signs off on an enigmatic note.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994833&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/shafi267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993733" alt="Shafi Sopori (centre) with his band members" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/shafi267.jpg" /></a> Shafi Sopori (centre) with his band members
<p>Did you know that in the midst of the late 17th and early 18th century, many places in Kashmir were renamed? For instance, Varhamullah became Baramulla, Padampore was changed to Pampore and Suyapur became Sopore or Sopori. Though Sopori, a small place in Baramulla district in Jammu and Kashmir, is popularly known as “apple town”, it is slowly getting recognised for another speciality. Jhankaar is a group of musicians from this area, who sing age-old Kashmiri and sufi songs accompanied by instruments that are popular in the region such as tumbaknaari, rabab, gada and santoor. “Years ago, when people used to work in the farms or jungles in the Kashmir region, someone would just start humming random tunes, combining various words; others would start repeating the words. Another creative person in the group, would add a new stanza. Like this, along with the work, the tunes would get improvised and a song would be born without much efforts. With time, various creative minds gave a new face to those very songs with new rhythms and lyrics, and the folk songs gained popularity; our music group performs such songs,” says Mohammad Shafi Sopori, a musician from Kashmir, who founded Jhankaar. The group was in Pune to attend and perform at the three-day 8th Kashmir Festival called Heritage of Kashmir. Organised by Sarhad, Pune, and Arihant Education Foundation, the festival was held from February 1 to 3.<br />
Taking us back to the days, which introduced him to folk music of Kashmir, the 35-year-old Sopori says, “Mausiki (music) interested me from the time I was about eight or nine. Since our small town didn’t offer many avenues, I took training under Professor Das Mahammad Khan and Ghulam Rasul, in Srinagar. This was also the time I got inclined towards Sufi music. Our performance also includes songs by famous Sufi poets such as Mehzoor Sahab and Ghulam Rasool Mee.” In his town where he was born and brought up, Sopori found like-minded people and formed the group Jhankaar about 12-years-ago. While others in the group play various music instruments, he is the lead singer.<br />
Some of the songs that the group presents are Bumroo bumroo, Rind posh maal and Roz roz boz mein zaar madno, among others. “Bumroo bumroo and Rind posh maal are old folk songs of Kashmir but gained popularity throughout the nation when they were used in the film Mission Kashmir (2000),” says Sopori, adding that prior to presenting any folk song, he gives a brief background of the song to the audience. “Rind posh maal is generally sung by Kashmiris, especially women, to welcome spring,” he elaborates. In the past, the group has performed in cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad.<br />
But it isn’t that the Jhankar musicians have confined themselves to sufi and Kashmiri folk songs. In order to reach out to a wider audience, the group has not just fused other elements in their performances but also embraced modern instruments such as the guitar and keyboards. “For example, I added a few Punjabi lines to the song Roz roz in our presentation some years ago. Similarly, I have added Marathi lyrics to Yaad kar vad, a Kashmiri song, for our Pune show. Popular songs such as Dama dam mast kalandar is a regular feature in our song-list,” explains Sopori, adding that fusion is good for folk music as it gives it a new face, reach and platform.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993728&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Madhuri Dixit Nene is happy that her father Shankar R. Dixit was in his homeland in his last days. The actress, who moved to Denver post her marriage to Dr Shriram Nene, had taken her parents along with her as she did not want to leave them alone in India. Recently while talking about her father, she said, “My father lived with me in Denver and when I took the decision to move to India, my parents were the happiest. I am glad that he died a happy man, in his home and in his land.” Madhuri’s father was 91 when he passed away last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mean streak</strong></p>
<p>The bubbly Juhi Chawla is playing a negative character, for the first time in her career in <em>Gulaab Gang</em>. When asked if she has ever been mean to anyone, the actress had to really think a lot before she answered,<br />
“I am sure we’ve all been mean to the people who love us the most. I have sometimes been mean to those closest to me.”<br />
That’s the closest confession one could get from Juhi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Spot on</strong></p>
<p>Pooja Bhatt is a trendsetter of sorts when it comes to identifying beautiful locations. The actress turned film-maker, who’s known to follow her heart, has her sights set on Bali. She wants to do a recce of the place as she wants to base her upcoming films in this beautiful city. “You can say that I am a trendsetter when it comes to introducing new locations in films. I was the first to shoot in Sri Lanka for <em>Paap</em> and now I am sure Bali could also have others flocking to it, if I portray it in my films,” she chuckled.</p>

<p>Ekta Kapoor’s new show <em>Kumkum Bhagya</em> is set to replace<em> Pavitra Rishta</em>. <em>Kumkum Bhagya</em> is a story of two sisters, Bani and Bulbul whose personalities are like chalk and cheese, yet they are always supportive of each other. It’s loosely based on Jane Austen’s classic,<em> Sense and Sensibility</em>. While Sriti Jha will play Bani in the show, Mrunal Thakur has been roped in to play Bulbul. Thakur was earlier seen in shows like <em>Mujhse Kuch Kehti Hai&#8230;Yeh Khamoshiyaan</em>, and <em>Arjun</em> on Star Plus. The story is about how Bulbul dreams of being the next big singing sensation, but is actually a madcap struggler. About being finalised for the role, Thakur says, “This is the first time that I will be working with Ekta madam and I am glad to finally have my dream come true. The role of Bulbul is quite different from all the other roles that I have played on screen so far, and for an actor, it is an honour to be offered varied roles with each successive project. I hope the show turns out to be a huge success.”</p>

<p><strong>Dhoom 3 kid Siddharth Nigam in Maha Kumbh</strong></p>
<p>Siddharth Nigam, the impressive kid in<em> Dhoom 3</em>, will now be seen in a serial on Life OK. Titled <em>Maha Kumbh</em>, the serial will replace the slot which is presently dominated by<em> Mahadev</em> after it ends. It will take off in May.<br />
Based on <em>Maha Kumbh</em> mela, Siddharth will play the role of Rudra, a child who gets lost in the <em>Maha Kumbh</em> and how a <em>sadhu</em> takes him under his aegis. He will feature in seven episodes after which his character matures. The serial is being produced and directed by Arvind Babbar, whose <em>Saraswatichandra</em>, is presently on air.<br />
A 15-day shoot of <em>Maha Kumbh</em> was held in Allahabad featuring Siddharth, after which the venue will shift to Benaras from March.<br />
Siddharth, an eighth standard student of the Khelgaon Public School, in Allahabad begins shooting from March 3, and if required, he plans to shoot in Benaras, which is just two hours drive from Allahabad.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994483&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Screen traces the origin of the date drama <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994818&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/date267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994821" alt="Representational Pic" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/date267.jpg" /></a> Representational Pic
<p>If one were to give a number to the releases churned out by Bollywood, one of the most prolific film industry in the world, then it would approximately be around 350 Hindi films. Add to it, another 120 Hollywood films that release in India. With regional films also on the rise, the box-office is super busy with approximately 600 films releasing every year. A number too huge to find a release in the limited 52-week-a-year box-office calendar. Little wonder that we have two-three films releasing every week.<br />
However, the film face-offs really become a huge deal when there are two big-ticket films in the line of box-office firing. For instance, there have been a slew of reports speculating on Akshay Kumar starrer <em>Holiday</em> clashing with Ajay Devgn’s <em>Action Jackson</em> at the box-office. While it’s a given that two mega-budget films clashing would eat into each other’s business, there’s not much that can be done to avoid the clash as the ‘right dates’ for most films with higher stakes are very few. But when things get too frazzled about biggies clashing at the box-office, the industry often loves to cite the case of two films — <em>Gadar: Ek Prem Katha</em> and <em>Lagaan</em> — doing phenomenally well at the box-office despite releasing on the same day, same place, same time.<br />
Most believe that at the end of the day, it’s the content that matters. “Too much has been invested in big films, so the stakes go up. Besides, a holiday release ensures more returns, so everyone wants to encash it. But, there have been films which have managed to open well, despite a non-holiday release, and it’s because the content was good. That’s what matters in the end,” concurs Girish Johar, Head, Distribution and Acquisition, Sahara Motion Pictures.<br />
Inconsequential as it may seem, zeroing in on a film’s date is no cake-walk in today’s competitive times. A lot of factors are looked into, when finalising a release date, and more often than not, everyone wants to avoid a clash. However, the problem is worsened as there’s no regulatory body. Not even IMPPA (Indian Motion Pictures Producers’ Association) can play mediator when it comes to finalising a film’s release date. It’s absolutely the producer’s prerogative to do that. Add to it, the competition from regional films. Exhibitor-distributor Akshaye Rathi explains, “When <em>Bol Bachchan</em> released in July 2012, S.S. Rajamouli’s <em>Eega</em>, which was released as <em>Makkhi</em> in Hindi, and <em>Jatt And Juliet</em> had also released at the same time. <em>Eega</em> and <em>Jatt and Juliet</em>, did better than <em>Bol Bachchan</em> in Andhra Pradesh and Punjab respectively.” But, more often than not, clashes are inevitable. So, here’s taking a detailed look at how exhibitors and distributors view different months of the year for a film’s release, and the clashes that can be expected this year:</p>
<p><strong>CALENDAR OF CLASHES</strong></p>
<p><strong>JANUARY</strong></p>
<p><em>A dull month and a big holiday</em></p>
<p>Once considered a jinx, the first month of the year is now considered a dull month to release a film, the exception being Republic Day: January 26. It’s a time when the North belt is under a ‘cold weather’ spell from December end, and since it’s a big market, producers avoid releasing a film around that time. On an average, 30 per cent of a film’s revenue come from the North, and if the film has a strong northen flavour, then the percentage can increase even more. Besides January 26 being a national holiday, it is also a time when the cold wave has subsided considerably. For instance, <em>Race 2</em> released on the Republic Day weekend last year, and did well too. <em>Agneepath</em>, which released in 2012, proved to be the biggest hit for Dharma Productions, until <em>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</em> came along. Given the trend, most films that released in January haven’t done well, but the jinx came undone in the recent past when<em> No One Killed Jessica</em> (2011), which released in the first week of the first month of the year, was a hit. This year, Salman Khan starrer <em>Jai Ho</em> released on January 24 and managed to do decent business.<br />
<strong>Big film of the month:</strong> <em>Jai Ho</em> starring Salman Khan made a business of Rs.104.9 crore at the end of Week 3.</p>
<p><strong>FEBRUARY</strong></p>
<p><em>Good time for small, high content films</em></p>
<p>February is an average month for films, with most office-goers gearing up for the closure of financial year. It’s also a pre-exam period. However, last year, films like <em>Kai Po Che</em> and <em>ABCD- Any Body Can Dance</em> which released in February proved to be hits. Given the pattern, it’s been observed that small films prefer a release in the first half of the year as big films dominate the second half. It’s also the month of Valentine’s, which is seen as a great period for romcoms. <em>Ekk Main Aur Ekk Tu</em>, which released on February 10, 2012, almost closer to Valentine’s Day, and did well. This year, the big-ticket film<em> Gunday</em> too release on V-Day, and managed to clock a good amount of Rs 43.93 crore in its opening weekend.<br />
<strong>Big film(s) of the month:</strong> <em>Gunday</em> starring Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor made Rs.43.93 crore business in its opening weekend . All eyes are now on <em>Shaadi Ke Side Effects</em> starring Farhan Akhtar opposite Vidya Balan for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>MARCH</strong></p>
<p><em>The exam fever</em></p>
<p>March being the closing of the financial year is a hectic month for those working in the finance sector. Moreover, exams take over the schools and colleges, thus cutting down on the young audience. Says Mayank Shroff of Cinepolis, “February and March are usually busy months for office-goers, since the business year end is nearing. But this year, we’ve had films like <em>Hasee Toh Phasee</em> and<em> Gunday</em> do well. Even March has quite a few releases like <em>Gulaab Gang, Total Siyappa, Bewakoofiyaan</em>, among others.” There have been cases when films releasing in March have done well — like <em>Kahaani</em>, which released on March 9, 2012, turned out to be one of the biggest hits of that year. Saif Ali Khan-Ileana D’Cruz starrer <em>Happy Ending</em> is also expected to release in March end.<br />
<strong>Big film of the month:</strong> <em>Gulaab Gang</em> stars one-time rivals Madhuri Dixit Nene and Juhi Chawla together in a film for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>APRIL</strong></p>
<p><em>The month of Indian Premiere League</em></p>
<p>The Indian Premiere League (IPL) used to be considered a big threat for movies initially, however that’s changing as films are now doing well during the period. The biggest example being <em>Vicky Donor</em> which struck gold at the box-office in April 2012 despite it featuring rank newcomers. Rathi has a different take on this as he says, “ I remember <em>Biwi No. 1</em> came right in the middle of the Cricket World Cup in 1999, but it still became a huge hit. And it’s all because of women audience, an underrated factor. Having said that, it’s natural that big-ticket films avoid releasing their films during IPL as it ends up with atleast 15-20 per cent dent in the business.” <em>Bhootnaath Returns , Kochadaiyaan, Main Tera Hero</em> and <em>2 States</em> will release in this month.<br />
<strong>Big film (s) of the month:</strong> <em>Bhootnath Returns</em> starring Amitabh Bachchan will clash with Rajinikanth’s <em>Kochadaiyaan</em> on April 11.</p>
<p><strong>MAY</strong></p>
<p><em>The IPL mania continues</em></p>
<p>It is a time when the IPL fever is at its peak , forcing film-makers to avoid a film release at that time. “Usually the semi-final and final matches are held on a weekend, so film-makers avoid releasing films during the IPL weekend. This year though <em>The Amazing Spiderman 2</em> is slated to release in May in India,” adds Shroff. As soon as the IPL comes to an end, a line-up of big films get set to release. For instance, <em>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</em> released on May 31 last year, which was the immediate weekend after IPL wrapped, and was a big hit. This year, it’ll be YRF’s <em>Daawat-E-Ishq</em> starring Parineeti Chopra and Aditya Roy Kapur .<br />
<strong>Big film of the month :</strong> Yash Raj Films’<em> Daawat-E-Ishq</em>, directed by Habib Faisal, has Parineeti Chopra and Aditya Roy Kapur for the first time together.</p>
<p><strong>JUNE</strong></p>
<p><em>New term begins in school and colleges </em></p>
<p>June is generally seen as a good month to release films, especially in the first week of June as schools and colleges are still on vacation period. Akshay Kumar-Sonakshi Sinha starrer <em>Rowdy Rathore</em>, which released on June 1, 2012, raked in the <em>moolah</em> at the box-office. According to Shyam Shroff, director, Shringar Films, “Months immediately after schools and college re-open are considered a good time for releasing films.” The Rs.100 crore-grosser, R<em>aanjhanaa</em> released in this period, last year. This year, two big-ticket films are set to clash at the box-office on June 6 — <em>Action Jackson</em> and <em>Holiday</em>, starring Ajay Devgn and Akshay Kumar respectively. Other films to release in June are <em>Humshakals, Villain, Creature 3D</em> among others.<br />
<strong>Big film (s) of the month :</strong> Akshay Kumar’s <em>Holiday</em> to clash with Ajay Devgn’s <em>Action Jackson</em>. Common to both films is its heroine — Sonakshi Sinha.</p>
<p><strong>JULY</strong></p>
<p><em>A hassle-free month</em></p>
<p>With schools and colleges being back on track, and monsoons setting in, July is a very good month for film releases as seen by its track record in the past. Though the month is not high on festivals, people are relatively free around this time, and have a disposable income to spend on movies. Films like <em>Singham, Bol Bachchan</em> and <em>Cocktail</em>, which released in July, are a testament to that. In fact, in July 2012, <em>Bol Bachchan</em> and <em>Cocktail</em> released in consecutive weeks, and yet both the films did well. In all probability, July 27 is the date being blocked for Salman Khan starrer <em>Kick</em> this year, which happens to be Eid, falling on a Sunday. Priyanka Chopra starrer <em>Mary Kom</em> and <em>Mardaani</em> starring Rani Mukerji can also be expected to release in July, this year.<br />
<strong>Big film of the month :</strong> <em>Kick</em> starring Salman Khan is expected to release on Eid this year, which falls on July 27, which is a Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>AUGUST</strong></p>
<p><em>The onset of festival season</em></p>
<p>It’s a month which kickstarts the festival season in India, with Ganesh Chaturthi, Independence Day and Raksha Bandhan. August is full of holidays, which attractive enough to lure the film industry to release movies. In 2012, Independence Day and Eid fell on the same day of August 15, which made a blockbuster out of Salman Khan starrer <em>Ek Tha Tiger</em>. Last year, August had back-to-back releases in the form of <em>Chennai Express</em>, which came on Eid, <em>Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai Dobara</em> (August 15), followed by<em> Madras Cafe</em> and <em>Satyagraha</em> in the consecutive weeks. This year,<em> Ek Tha Tiger</em> director Kabir Khan returns with <em>Phantom</em> starring Katrina Kaif and Saif Ali Khan in August.<em> Singham 2</em> is also set to release on Independence Day this year.<br />
<strong>Big film(s) of the month :</strong> Kabir Khan’s <em>Phantom</em> with Saif Ali Khan and Katrina Kaif and Rohit Shetty’s <em>Singham 2</em> with Ajay Devgn.</p>
<p><strong>SEPTEMBER</strong></p>
<p><em>A month of risky business</em></p>
<p>With Ganesh Chaturthi festivity continuing in September, people are too busy to go and see films. However, a good film never goes unnoticed as was evident last year with <em>The Lunchbox</em>. It released on September 20 and did really well, despite being a small, niche film. <em>Shuddh Desi Romance</em> and G<em>rand Masti</em>, which released on September 6 and 13, 2013 respectively, managed to do a good business, with other releases like <em>Phata Poster Nikla Hero</em> doing average. This year will see the release of Ranveer Singh-Govinda-Parineeti Chopra and Ali Zafar starrer<em> Kill Dil</em> on September 5, while Anushka Sharma’s <em>NH10</em> may release on September 12.<br />
<strong>Big film of the month :</strong><em> Kill Dil</em> starring Govinda, Ranveer Singh, Parineeti Chopra and Ali Zafar is the big-ticket film of the month; it will have Zafar sporting an action avatar for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>OCTOBER</strong></p>
<p><em> Pre-Diwali lull</em></p>
<p>Though October 2, also known as Gandhi Jayanti, is considered a good date to release a film, considering it’s a national holiday, last year’s release <em>Besharam</em> proved to be a box-office dud. This year, Hrithik Roshan starrer <em>Bang Bang</em> is slated to release on October 2. “I’m talking pure economics, that during the pre Diwali period, an average movie-goer doesn’t have much disposable income. A huge chunk of the income goes into Diwali shopping or painting the house, etc. That’s the logic behind big-ticket movies releasing on Diwali, and not before Diwali. Last year Besharam got that one-day advantage, but then the collections went down, so entering the pre-Diwali period is slightly dicey,” explains Rathi.<br />
<strong>Big film of the month :</strong> Hrithik Roshan takes over the pre-Diwali space with B<em>ang Bang</em> this year; it will have Katrina Kaif opposite him.</p>
<p><strong>NOVEMBER</strong></p>
<p><em>Diwali advantage</em></p>
<p>Film-makers and actors usually fight for a Diwali slot, and have managed to do well in most cases. In 2012, <em>Jab Tak Hai Jaan</em> and<em> Son Of Sardar</em> released together, and despite the clash, both the films managed more than a Rs..100-crore business. “That’s the advantage of the festive period, especially since it’s a time when most people get their bonuses during Diwali. So, usually, the New Year day collections of films is humungous. The collections of <em>Krrish 3</em> were maximum on the New Year day, last Diwali,” adds Rathi. This year, Farah Khan’s multistarrer<em> Happy New Year</em> is slated for a Diwali release.<br />
<strong>Big film of the month :</strong> Farah Khan’s multistarrer <em>Happy New Year</em> with Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Deepika Padukone, Sonu Sood, Boman Irani and Vivaan Shah.</p>
<p><strong>DECEMBER</strong></p>
<p><em>Christmas vacation</em></p>
<p>This year,<em> Bombay Velvet</em> and <em>P.K.</em> may clash together on December 25. <em>Welcome Back</em> was also to release on the same date, but the film may now get pushed to January 26, 2015. The Christmas vacation period is a time when even office-goers are on extended leave. It’s a great time at the movies. Films like<em> 3 Idiots</em>, and last year’s release <em>Dhoom 3</em> are best examples of it. Interestingly, <em>Welcome</em> and <em>Taare Zameen Par</em> also released together on December 21 in 2007, and both the films ended up doing well.<br />
Big film(s) of the month : Anurag Kashyap’s <em>Bombay Velvet</em> starring Ranbir Kapoor-Anushka Sharma is set to clash with Raju Hirani’s <em>P.K</em>. starring Aamir Khan on December 25.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-booking for 2015!</strong></p>
<p>In a new trend of sorts, production houses are now announcing release dates of their films well in advance in order to avoid clashes at the box-office. It involves mainly big films.<br />
For instance, Karan Johar’s <em>Shuddhi</em> will release on December 25, 2015 even though the cast of the film is yet to be announced, after Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor are no longer a part of it. Salman Khan’s film with Sooraj Barjatya is slated to release in Diwali 2015, the shooting of which is yet to begin. In all probability, it’ll be Sonam Kapoor opposite Khan, but the official announcement is still to be made. Zoya Aktar’s film starring Farhan Akhtar, Ranveer Singh, Priyanka Chopra and Anushka Sharma has been blocked for a June 5, 2015 release, while Ranbir Kapoor-Katrina Kaif starrer<em> Jagga Jasoos</em> will release on May 29, 2015. Shah Rukh Khan and Farhan Akhtar’s <em>Raees</em> is set to release on Eid 2015.<br />
Will these announcements help to avoid clashes at the box-offices? Says Rathi, “You may announce the release date, but what if it’s not ready for release at that time. Like, <em>P.K</em>. which was slated to release on June 6 earlier has now been pushed to December, and will clash with <em>Bombay Velvet</em>.”<br />
Shyam Shroff suggests an even more gloomy picture. “It’s a war of the mighty. One says Diwali is mine, second one says Eid is mine, third one says Christmas is mine. It’s like a ‘<em>Aa dekhen zara, kis mein hai kitna dum</em>!’ If more than one big movie is announced during a particular week, well wishers step in and compromise. I feel things could just get murkier in the days to come,” he concludes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994818&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dishkiyaoon267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993660" alt="Sunny Deol flexes his muscles in  a duel with Harman Baweja" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dishkiyaoon267.jpg" /></a> Sunny Deol flexes his muscles in a duel with Harman Baweja
<p>The cast and crew of Shilpa Shetty Kundra’s debut production venture, <em>Dishkiyaoon</em>, sure had a gala time during the making of the film; especially when Sunny Deol was present on the sets. A pivotal scene in the film required the lead actor Harman Baweja to arm wrestle with Deol and make it look like the two are engaged in a duel, to prove their superiority in the gangster world. The scene was shot in a Mumbai studio and with Deol around, the entire cast and crew was excited to see how the scene pans out.<br />
“Everyone knows how strong Sunny<em> bhai</em> is, and while shooting for an arm wrestling sequence, Harman became extremely nervous. He was a little scared to face Sunny <em>bhai</em> and kept asking if he had understood the scene correctly,” stated director Sanamjit Talwar. Baweja, who was a little sceptical about the scene, felt there was no way he could perfect the shot. He quipped, “While filming this particular portion, Sanam kept telling us ‘<em>Yaar, yeh</em> arm wrestling real<em> nahi lag rahi hain. Thoda aur emotion daalo. Real mein karo isko</em>.’ I didn’t say a word during the scene, but after that, I quietly walked up to him and asked, ‘Sanam, are you mad? How can I even try to arm wrestle with him for real? <em>Bhai, woh shot nahi rahega, balki mera haath sach mein kataak ho jayega</em>. Let’s keep it to acting only.” Fortunately, Deol made Baweja feel comfortable and the scene was shot exactly the way Talwar wanted it to be. “Once their comfort level was set, they wrestled it out for real and everybody on the sets began clapping,” adds Talwar. He also mentioned that after the shot was okayed, everyone on the set wanted to arm wrestle with Deol, who sportingly took up the challenge. Although several cast and crew members felt they could beat the actor, everyone failed and Deol ultimately won the challenge. “<em>Bhai ke dhai kilo ke haath ke saamne</em> everyone looked pale,” says Baweja.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dancing hands</strong></p>
<p><em>Shooting Sunny Leone on a bed of hands in Ragini MMS 2 was a tricky shot</em></p>
<p>Sunny Leone lying on a bed of hands which touched and felt her in the song <em>Baby doll</em>, in <em>Ragini MMS 2</em> was the trickiest shot to execute for choreographers Gaiti and Uma.<br />
The song was picturised with 12 female dancers who had to squat inside a box, not being able to see anything and not knowing where their hands were going. “It was shot from a top angle and these girls were kept in an elevated box. There were holes in the box from where they could stick their hands out, but it was covered and they could only hear us and not see anything. The shot was barely a few seconds long, but it took us four hours to get it right,” informs Gaiti.<br />
<em>Ragini MMS</em>, produced by Balaji Motion Pictures and directed by Bhushan Patel releases on March 21.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993650&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[With film stories travelling to different parts of India and beyond, tackling the question of ethnic stereotypes and cultural conflicts is a natural progression<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994855&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/total267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994868" alt="CULTURE CAPER:  Poster of film Total Siyapaa " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/total267.jpg" /></a> CULTURE CAPER: Poster of film Total Siyapaa
<p>Imtiaz Ali’s film,<em> Highway</em>, shot across six states — namely Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh is also an attempt to co-opt the life and culture of these states in its narrative. <em>Kai Po Che</em> did some of that for the city of Ahmedabad, where the story was set in. Uttar Pradesh, especially the ravines of Chambal, have been making a comeback of sorts too in the stories of outlaws and bandits, while our cities especially Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Varanasi and Lucknow are gaining ground once again, often as well-defined characters that influence the storytelling.<br />
This yen for setting stories in lands far and near is resurfacing now, be it the badlands of Wasseypur, decadent <em>havelis</em> in Uttar Pradesh or any other. In a welcome change of sorts, geography, is no longer history in Bollywood films.<br />
Hindi movies for a while now have carried with them a sense of wanderlust. Whether it was exploring the romantic seduction of<em> An Evening In Paris</em>, the charm of the chinars in the vale of Kashmir, the lush verdant hills in Kerala, song shoots in far-flung icy Antarctica, it would be safe to say that Hindi films have been there and done that.<br />
It’s but a natural corollary that with all the crossing over in our movies, not to mention people from different parts of the country and even outside of it coming in, the topic of biases and ethnic stereotyping is being brought out in the open. Ethnic bias, as anyone who has lived away from their place of birth, is fairly common around the world in general and India in particular. Why, the most recent incident that showed the ugly side of such prejudice when a young student from Arunachal Pradesh was beaten to death by locals in a Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar. They got into an altercation and then a bout ofl violence, when he protested against them making fun of his attire and hairstyle, resulting in a tragic death. This is an emerging reality that has not been talked about too much.<br />
Quite a few Hindi films have touched upon gender and communal issues; homophobia is coming out of the closet and given the scenario around us, fortunately issues of ethnic identity and stereotyping are coming to the fore too.<br />
Tackling the subject of cultural differences albeit in a lighter vein are two films namely <em>2 States</em> and<em> Total Siyapaa</em> that will soon be in our neighbourhood theatres. While the former touches upon prejudices that North Indians and South Indians bear towards each other, the latter is a romcom with similar biases that Indians and Pakistanis hold. Apparently, love triumphs in the end and in the process these steadfast opinions do too.<br />
Humour, as they say, is often the best way to make a serious point. Hopefully the two films mentioned above will go some distance in sensitising people against regional/ethnic chauvinism and do their bit in narrowing the gaps.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Director Ali Abbas Zafar has taken an age-old formula of a masala entertainer for Gunday and tweaked it with new-age elements complete with ripped shirts and glistening, muscular torsos on display. And it worked!<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994781&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ali2671.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994785" alt="Ali Abbas Zafar" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ali2671.jpg" /></a> Ali Abbas Zafar
<p><strong>Gunday has done phenomenal business of Rs.64 crore in its first week. Did the collections meet your expectations and are you confident of crossing the Rs.100 crore mark?</strong></p>
<p>I am very happy that the audience is liking the film. In fact, it is doing phenomenally well in territories like Punjab, Rajasthan, Central Province and Central India. It received a good response overseas as well, and is doing exceptionally good business in the UAE. The first day collections of Rs. 16.15 crore were above our expectations. As of now the film is a hit, but I hope it crosses the Rs. 100 crore mark and becomes a super-hit.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of response is it getting from the industry?</strong></p>
<p>Senior people from the industry like Amitabh Bachchan, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Rakesh Roshan, Abbas-Mustan have called or messaged me to say that they have loved the film. What touched me was when Salim Khan called and said ‘<em>Is film mein hamari khushboo hai</em>’. <em>Gunday</em> is only my second film and to be praised by industry veterans is a big high for me.<br />
The youth also have taken to it in a big way. They are intrigued by the way I have taken a mainstream masala film, yet have used a different style of film-making to make it relatable. Also they are awed by the chemistry between the three protagonists. People also enjoyed the fight fight between Bikram and Bala where they rip their shirts and display glistening bodies. Though some did ask me if we were sponsored by an oil company!</p>
<p><strong>Irrfan as ACP Satyajit Sarkar is the one who adds the sparkle and attitude to the film. It was surprising to see his name as ‘special appearance’ in the credit.</strong></p>
<p>Ranveer’s character, Bikram and Arjun’s character, Bala were very strong on paper. And we needed an equally powerful personality in Satyajit Sarkar to balance them out. So just when Bala and Bikram’s antics had reached a peak, Satyajit makes an entry, and this makes the audience sit up and wonder what will happen next. Irrfan’s personality and one-liners are overpowering, and both Bikram and Bala look real because of him.<br />
Answering your question, Irrfan is a very senior actor who has carved a niche for himself and plays the lead in mainstream cinema, but in my film, the title <em>Gunday</em> belonged to Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor. If the film was not titled <em>Gunday</em>, maybe we would not have credited him with a special appearance.</p>
<p><strong>What one did miss in the film was a little bit of detailing in the first half, on how these two urchins grew up to become these cool dudes who ruled Kolkata.</strong></p>
<p><em>Gunday</em> is inherently a drama, and the idea was to make the first half light and fun. Our aim was to make the audience fall in love with Bikram and Bala, before they go on a dramatic journey. That’s the reason we showed them dancing together, wearing heart shapes on their pyjamas positioned over their bums, flirting and falling in love with the beautiful Priyanka Chopra etc. in the first half. It was more important to establish the way they looked and behaved and how passionately mad they were about each other.</p>
<p><strong>The ending, though ambiguous wrapped up on a beautiful note, and one wonders if you have left it open to make Gunday 2? Also, as the Bengal film industry is up in arms against the dubbed version of the film, will you release it there?</strong></p>
<p>Though the audience could guess what happens to Bikram and Bala, I wanted to sign off on a cheerful note showing them together as always and with smiling faces. So yes, you can never tell, I could make <em>Gunday 2</em>. As of now I am taking a break and will then start working on my next which will once again be mainstream, commercial cinema.<br />
As for the Bengal release, no we are not releasing the dubbed version of <em>Gunday</em> there.<br />

<p>The doors open and the waiting crowds converge through the narrow door into the auditorium. There’s no waiting thence. The fog machines blow copious amounts of smoke on the stage, making its ambit mimic a sauna bath. Two men in retro white tennis clothing, wielding wooden racquets, exchange shots over an imaginary net to nu-disco tunes being played by a comrade, dressed in the same uniform, on the keyboard.<br />
The “players” are engrossed in their game. This was just a build-up to the next 67 minutes of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell — a contemporary, experimental, dance-routine or live art performance, choreographed and conceptualised by Ben J Riepe from Germany and Navtej S Johar from Delhi. It was staged at the Film and Television Institute of India recently.<br />
It will be futile trying to summarise the act because it is a purely subjective experience. In its course, certain themes become evident, which pervade the general structure of the act played out by six performers and a live musician. For one, it definitely questions the scope or definition of reality. Other themes made evident are sexuality, belonging and alienation. But these themes too aren’t rigid and could have meta-interpretations. The act is effectually open-ended and must be revisited.<br />
“It has no script,” says Riepe, adding, “It was developed from improvisation, ideas and the process. The material matured as we modelled it further with the performers, who reshaped and contextualised it.” The artistes share that the act doesn’t have a defined point of view, reiterating that the point of the routine is to help the audience make what they please of what they are experiencing.<br />
“We have nothing to say,” says Riepe. “This is just something we were working on and we wanted to share with the audience,” he adds. While the entire act employs very few spoken words, those uttered underline the themes mentioned in the beginning. So, there is a certain degree of objectivity associated with this piece of art, which seeks to serve as a runway for the flights of fancy.<br />
“We are definitely not taking any stands,” says Johar, adding, “Reality, being in the moment, eroticism, and the body — these are the undercurrents of the piece; but we are not making any statements.”<br />
The artistes says that the viewer must allow the artwork to grow on them. “One might form an opinion while or right after viewing the work, but usually after a couple of weeks, one ends up deconstructing a preliminary notion, thereby arriving at newer revelations,” says Riepe. Adds Johar, “It is also about how much one registers and how deeply he or she has been impacted by the imagery — which could happen after one viewing or subsequent ones. It is a matter of choice there too, whether one wants to stay with a raw impression or layer it through subsequent spectating.”</p>

<p>Tamil superstar Rajinikanth’s multi-lingual film Kochadaiiyaan will release worldwide on April 11, announced the film’s producers in Chennai recently. Shot using Photorealistic Peformance Capture technology, earlier used in Hollywood superhit Avataar, the film is an ‘epic dramatisation’ of good versus evil, producer Eros International Media Ltd said in a statement.<br />
The film will be the superstar’s first venture after his recovery from a reported kidney ailment and is directed by his daughter Soundarya Rajinikanth Ashwin. The star cast includes Deepika Padukone, Shobana, R. Sharath Kumar, Aadhi and many others. A.R. Rahman has scored the music. “For the first time, a full length feature has been made using Peformance Capture technology in India and I truly hope this creates a whole alternate film avenue apart from live action films in our country,” said Soundarya.<br />
The film will release in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Marathi, Bhojpuri, Bengali and Punjabi in India and overseas in more than 6000 screens, informs Sunil Lulla, MD, Eros International Media Ltd. “We are releasing an English version internationally as well,” he added.</p>

<p><strong>Ban on Khairlanjichya Mathyavar</strong></p>
<p><em>The only survivor of the massacre not happy with the film </em></p>
<p>By <strong>Screen Correspondent</strong></p>
<p>Barely a few days of its release and the Marathi film <em>Khairlanjichya Mathyavar</em> faces controversy.<br />
Bhaiyalal Bhotmange, the only survivor of the Khairlanji massacre, is not happy with the way he and his family have been portrayed in the film. He decided to file a petition at the Nagpur High Court for a stay order on the film after attending its special screening in Mumbai recently. Thus the film has been banned for screening in Nagpur.<br />
A group of people brutally assaulted the members of Bhaiyalal Bhotmange’s family in on September 29, 2006. His wife Surekha, teenage daughter Priyanka and two grown-up sons Sudhir and Rohan were all paraded naked in the village. Both the women were gang-raped by a mob and Bhaiyalal’s wife and children were then hacked to death. Bhaiyalal ran for his life and was the lone survivor of the incident.</p>

<p>By <strong>Anushree Bhattacharyya</strong></p>
<p>From time to time English movie channels have showcased various popular movies in their effort to increase their viewership. Christened as ‘premieres’ such movies have always played a major role in creating the right amount of noise about the channel apart from attracting eyeballs. And now Sony Pix, the English movie channel from the stable of Multi Screen Media (MSM) has taken the concept of premiere to the next level with the launch of Premiere Pixathon. Under this new initiative, Sony Pix will premier four movies— <em>The Expendables 2, After Earth, Dark Tide</em> and <em>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</em> back to back on February 16. “We relaunched the channel with a new proposition, ‘Stay Amazed’ in October last year. Pixathon allows us to stay true to the new proposition as the four movies are different. Also, the move helps us in establishing our credentials amongst viewers apart from providing a glimpse of our library of movies. Secondly, the English movie business today has about six to seven players, each trying a different approach to remain in the top of the mind of viewers,” said Saurabh Yagnik, executive vice president and business head, Sony Pix.<br />
In India, broadcasters use the term premiere from time to time depending on the kind of movie that is being showcased. For instance, there is a ‘channel premiere’ which essentially means that the movie may have been screened on other channels but is a premiere on that channel, then there is an ‘Indian TV premiere’ which is more promising as it is premiering first time on ‘Indian pay TV’. Next, there is a ‘world premiere’ which is first time on all the international feeds of that channel, and lastly, there is the category of movies that haven’t been released in India theatrically (mostly because they were not perceived to be big revenue generators) that are called ‘first time ever in India’.<br />
While this is the first time that the channel will premiere four movies back to back, it had earlier showcased popular franchisees such as <em>Mission Impossible, Shrek, Spider-Man</em>, etc., back-to-back on a particular day. “Such marathon telecast gives more scope to package and market content as typically on such days the ratings double compared to a regular day. The reason why such an initiative leads to eyeballs is a viewer may not make an appointment to watch a standalone premiere as she knows that she can catch up the movie later. But when she knows that on one single day she will get to see four to five of her favourite movies, she ensures that she gets to watch them,” added Yagnik.<br />
Interestingly, a premiere is scheduled for telecast either during the weekend or on national holidays. Sony Pix too is set to premier all the four movies on a Sunday. According to Shruti Bajpai, former country manager, HBO Asia, who speaks in the capacity of an industry observor, said the big ticket premieres are either on a Sunday afternoon, or a Saturday afternoon repeated on the following Sunday or on a public holiday. Also, prime time does not necessarily mean only post 9 p.m., it can also mean the afternoon slot on holidays. “Sometimes channels like to experiment, they slot the same movie back-to-back hoping to attract different audiences that tune in at different times,” she added.<br />
Jehil Thakkar, partner, head, media and entertainment, KPMG calls the initiative a smart move by the channel. “Given the number of English movie channels, the spike in viewership is only expected through differentiated content. This initiative will not only help in increasing viewership, it will only increase awareness about the brand Sony Pix and the library the channel,” he added. Premiers also aid in raking the much needed moolah to run the business. Apart from roping in a presenting sponsor, a channel also is able to get associate sponsors on board. “We have so far got ITC Engage deodorant brands as the presenting sponsor and are in talks with several other brands,” added Yagnik.<br />
On an average day, an English movie channel commands an advertising rate of Rs.5000-10,000 depending on the popularity of the movies. In case of premieres, most of the air time is sold through sponsorships where the channel can earn as much as Rs.50 lakh from the presenting sponsor and Rs.30-20 lakh from associate sponsors.<br />
As per a senior media planner, the channel has scheduled the movies very smartly. While the day starts with a very popular franchisee movie —<em>The Expendables</em>, during the day viewers will get to watch not-so-popular movies and again during the prime time slot at night, Sony Pix will air <em>The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo</em>, another popular movie. This placement allows them to sell the space for advertisements apart from getting sponsors.<br />
Apart from being promoted on the network’s other channels, Sony Pix’s Premiere Pixathon will be promoted in multiplexes and through the launch of a digital campaign.</p>

<p>By <strong>Farida Khanzada</strong></p>
<p>In 2010, actress Padmini Kolhapure had announced her debut production venture <em>Lathi</em> under her banner Star Talash. Starring Sachin Khedekar as a school teacher, Master Desai, the film was stalled after director Sanjay Surkar passed away.<br />
There were speculations of Tejaswini Kolhapure playing a pivotal role in the film. Her elder sister, however, clarifies, “Tejaswini is not a part of the film any longer. Earlier, there was a guest appearance slotted for her in the film. But certain changes were made to the storyline after Mr Surkar passed away, where the character which was to be played by Tejaswini did not fit in the story line.”<br />
The film, a socially relevant drama that charts the journey of a school teacher, who devotes his entire life imparting knowledge to children, only to realise that what they had imbibed was completely different. Directed by Mahesh Aney, the film is now complete. According to Kolhapure the first copy of the film is due to release anytime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marathi film Killa bags award at Berlin film festival</strong></p>
<p>The Marathi film <em>Killa</em> bagged the Crystal Bear Award for the Best Feature Film at the Berlin Film Festival, a first for an Indian film. The film, which premiered recently at the Berlinale, also got the Special Mention from the International Jury of KPlus.<br />
<em>Killa</em> is the third Marathi film to be selected in Berlinale in its entire history and it is the first Indian feature film to win this much coveted award.<br />
Produced by Madhukar R. Musle, Ajay G. Rai, Alan McAlex under the banner, Jar Pictures and presented by M.R. Filmworks, the film was a part of NFDC Film Bazaar’s Work-in-Progress (WIP) Lab in 2013. The film stars Amruta Subhash, Archit Deodhar, Parth Bhalerao and Shrikant Yadav.<br />
<em>Killa</em> deals with the universal conflict of migration and how it impacts the lives of people, especially children. The story revolves around a young boy Chinu, who finds it difficult to adjust to his new surroundings where he has migrated to, after his father’s death.<em> Killa</em> is slated for India release this May.</p>

<p><strong>Shaadi Ke Side Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> Saket Chowdhary</p>
<p><strong>Producer:</strong> Rangita Nandy, Pritish Nandy, Ekta Kapoor</p>
<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Farhan Akhtar, Vidya Balan, Ram Kapoor and Vir Das</p>
<p><strong>Release Date:</strong> February 28</p>
<p>The two main characters, Sid and Trisha, make a comeback in the sequel, with Sid (Farhan Akhtar) now as the husband and Trisha (Vidya Balan) as the wife. Sid has overcome his fear of marriage, while Trisha is finally coping with the post marriage routine. But it is time for them to address to the impossible task of coping with each other’s fantasies, dreams and realities. Will they succeed?</p>
<p><strong>Screen Forecast</strong></p>
<p>The film, <em>Shaadi Ke Side Effects</em> looks promising, alright. With post marriage challenges as the premise for this romance and Vidya Balan and Farhan Akhtar as the lead pair, our interest is already piqued.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If one were to look back, then the upcoming film <em>Total Siyapaa</em> (which I am part of) with its Indo-Pak theme is not new as several films have been made on it in the past. But there is a difference. Most of these films had a serious touch to it, and were based on issues like the line of control (LOC) tension, partition, Kargil war among others highlighted in them. But at the end of it, we must realise that both these countries were born out of a single country. There is a lot of love and warmth between several people from both the sides of the border.<br />
The bitterness only arises due to cross border terrorism and the topic of Kashmir, which they have been asking for. For us as a nation, Kashmir is not easy to just give away because major rivers flow from this state, which provides water to a host of other states in the country. But otherwise, it has not always been about the competitiveness and violence that we get to see in most films. If you see some films like<em> Tere Bin Laden, War Chhod Naa Yaar</em> and our <em>Total Siyapaa</em>, it is the element of humour that makes it different. I have always believed and wished that we, as two countries, could learn to laugh at ourselves more often. If you take everything that comes your way so seriously, then there will only be conflicts. In fact, if politicians of the two countries learn to laugh at themselves over a cup of tea, it could be even better (laughs).<br />
Light-hearted films are only an extension of things that go on between them, and is a reflection of today’s reality. Just like the films on the Indo-Pak was a reflection of the reality then — of the bitterness that ensued because of fundamental problems, cross border terrorism among others. That is one reason why it later extended to every other part of life, including films and even cricket. In fact, even the films which have pitted the two countries through the medium of cricket, was nothing less than a war. Now that is taken from real life as it was a real phenomenon, because whenever the two countries play against each other, baaki saare matches boring lagte the. More than competition, it is like a raging war.<br />
Speaking from my personal experience, the <em>aam junta</em> in both the countries are extremely sweet and share a wonderful relationship. My mother, Daljit Kaur, was originally from West Pakistan and I am a Jat Sikh, so in a way, <em>main toh aadhi Pakistan se hi aati hoon na</em>. My mother had spent her early years that side and it was only post Partition that she had to come to India here. Like most people, the family had to leave all their land and was allotted a space in India. She had several friends in Pakistan, whom she had kept in touch with. During the filming of <em>Khamosh Pani</em>, I even got a chance to meet them. I never felt that I was interacting with people from some other country. <em>Aaj bhi logon ki rishtedaari hain aur bas log chehre dekhne ko tadap jaate hain</em> because they don’t get a visa.<br />
<em>Total Siyapaa</em> is a gem of a little comedy that has the same warmth and explores the adorable madness that ensues when the two families (that of an Indian girl and a Pakistani boy) meet one night. The fact that film-makers today are making light-hearted films with the India vs Pakistan topic shows that one can be irreverent about things. It also proves that the nation is growing and maturing with time.<br />
As an actor and someone who has seen both the sides of this story, I can only feel happy about this progress.</p>

<p>Although Bipasha Basu confessed her love for beau Harman Baweja on Twitter and even re-tweeted a few messages on love tips and advice, the actor took a good fifteen minutes at an event on the same day to admit that he is dating the Bengali diva. Several journalists kept asking Baweja to confirm his relationship status, but the actor just didn’t budge, while stating that such things are extremely personal. But the media persons persisted and kept asking him the same question repeatedly, adding that Basu had already made things public. Baweja simply stood there, blushing and smiling like a boy who was truly, madly and deeply in love. No matter how much he tried to avoid the question, Baweja ultimately agreed and said, “Bipasha has been very generous with her words and yes, we are dating each other. She is being modest by saying that I am a better person. But, we all know who is the best.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Culinary queen</strong></p>
<p>At the launch of the new Magnum ice cream, Kareena Kapoor Khan, who is the newly-appointed brand ambassador of the ice-cream, was asked if she cooks for her hubby Saif Ali Khan. The beautiful actress retorted cheekily with “<em>Main apne haathon se banati nahin hoon, par apne haathon se khilati zaroor hoon</em>!” Even as everyone burst into peals of laughter, the actress went on to say that she is a good cook. “The sign of a good cook is making good <em>dal</em> and I make it very well! My mom (Babita) and sister (Karisma Kapoor) tell me that I make excellent <em>dal</em>,” she chirped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bullet impact</strong></p>
<p>Shilpa Shetty Kundra was on cloud nine during the promotions of her first production venture, <em>Dishkiyaoon</em>. Although the actress was at her vivacious best, one could see her getting misty eyed while talking about her new venture. “Trust me, turning producer is no easy task. Working as an actor was, hands down, so much easier. I was just telling someone that <em>kisiko punish karna ho toh producer bana do</em>. But after looking at the final product, I can say that at least film <em>toh aachi lag rahi hain na</em>,” she quipped. One couldn’t help but notice an interesting bullet pendant that she has been sporting for quite sometime now. Shetty adds, “I have been wearing this ever since we started shooting for the film. It has the <em>Dishkiyaoon</em> effect.” Now that is one producer who is taking film promotions to a whole new level, isn’t it?</p>

<p><strong>Direction:</strong> Birsa Dasgupta</p>
<p><strong>Story, script and dialogue:</strong> Debaloy Bhattacharya</p>
<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Paoli Dam, Jojo, Parambrata Chatterjee, Supriyo Samaddar, Mir, Tanima Sen, Indraneil Sengupta, Paran Bandopadhyay, Kanchan Mullick, Supriyo Dutta, Sudeshna Roy, Abhijit Guha.</p>
<p>By <strong>Shoma A. Chatterji</strong></p>
<p>‘Adult’ films are a rarity in Bengali cinema. <em>Obhishopto Nighty</em> (The Accursed Nighty) is an exception. Debaloy Bhattacharya’s story takes us on a wild ride through the libido of women who wear one particular nighty and become horny at once, taking a roll in the hay with the first man they meet, only to shed copious tears later and getting rid of the nighty at once. Sounds crazy? The film looks crazy too because as it journeys through a pretty housewife who sleeps with the milkman after wearing the nighty and performs <em>pooja</em> to avenge her sin. The next woman is her aged mother-in-law who seduces her grandson’s shocked music teacher only to join her daughter-in-law in the<em> pooja</em> room. And so the nighty, the protagonist of the film, wanders across from one woman to another.<br />
The ‘curse’ is traced back to a beautiful bar singer (Paoli Dam) way back in 1985 who took her own life after being jilted by her so-called lover (Indraneil Sengupta). Her spirit moves around in the nighty, his gift to her. The climax of the film is a scream promising a sequel but this time focussed on a ‘<em>pyjama</em>.’<br />
To avoid attacks on lack of logic, credibility and content, the intelligent Birsa Dasgupta frames this story within a censor board sitting on the screening of the absurd film-within-the-film <em>Obhishopto Nighty</em>. The colourful members of the censor board form a sub-plot that is as hilarious than the main story. The script handles the eight segments without creating confusion. But one wishes it had done away with a couple of segments to make for a tighter script. The segment on the Rabindra Sangeet exponent (Laboni Sarkar) and her aversion to even being touched by her henpecked husband (Bhaskar Banerjee) because she considers herself married to Tagore, is the best. The final shots inside a car as Tanushree and Parambrato make love on the backseat with the nighty resting on the dashboard are hilarious.<br />
Birsa has made his actors perform in an exaggerated, stylised manner similar to old theatrical acting. Every actor fulfills the demands of this crazy script. The members of the Censor Board talk normally but wear imaginary halos round their heads. The fire minister (Supriyo Dutta) trembles at the very mention of the word ‘fire’ while the psychiatrist (Abhijit Guha) has a psychological explanation for everything. The music is low key. Bodhaditya Banerjee’s editing is a bit cluttered but that is because of the cluttered script. The ‘gay’ take by Debaloy Bhattacharya on the late Rituparno Ghosh is in extremely bad taste and pulls the film down by a few notches.<br />
<em>Obhishopto Nighty</em> is hilariously entertaining only till the fun lasts. You can forget the film as you walk out of the theatre.</p>

<p><strong>Sau. Shashi Deodhar (Marathi)/Interesting psycho thriller</strong></p>
<p><strong>Producers:</strong> Shilpa Shirodkar Ranjit, Aparesh Ranjit, Krishna Shetty and Neeta Shetty</p>
<p><strong>Writer-Director:</strong> Amol Shetge</p>
<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Ajinkya Deo, Tushar Dalvi, and Sai Tamhankar</p>
<p>By<strong> Sunil Nandgaonkar</strong></p>
<p><em>Sau. Shashi Deodhar</em> takes the audience on a journey in search of the identity of a young married woman, Shubhada. In her journey, Shubhada tries, unknowingly, to solve a mystery, with the help of some unknown people. It’s an interesting psychological thriller where director Amol Shetge presents a rare yet colourful take of one’s dreams bringing in a touch of truthfulness and harsh realities together .<br />
While walking in the rain one evening, Shubhada meets with an accident. Ajinkya Vartak, the owner of the car that hits her, takes her to hospital. After treatment Shubhada recovers but loses her memory. Thus starts Shubhada’s journey to find her dear ones. Vartak takes on the onus to help her find her identity. This leads to shocking incidents and Vartak, a psychiatrist, learns that she is a patient with split personality.<br />
The role of Shubhada is very well played by Sai Tamhankar. Having essayed glamorous and bold roles in earlier films, here she plays the role of a middle class married woman. She thus breaks all moulds to carve a niche for herself with this excellent performance. Ajinkya Deo as Ajinkya Vartak and other members of the supporting cast along with lovable songs creates an impact on viewers. Writer-director Shetge succeeds in surprising the audience and yet bring enjoyment through the film.<br />
Who is Shashi Deodhar? Is Shubhada Shashi’s wife or is she married to someone else? This suspense comes to the fore after the interval and it is the surprise element that makes the film what it is.</p>

<p>By <strong>Shoma A. Chatterji</strong></p>
<p>When <em>Gunday</em> was shot extensively in West Bengal and later when the Hindi film starring Priyanka Chopra, Ranveer Singh and Arjun Kapoor was dubbed in Bangla, little did anyone know that the release of the film would be mired in controversy. In Kolkata, the release of Yash Raj Film’s <em>Gunday</em> simultaneously in Hindi and its dubbed Bangla version has raised the hackles of the entire Bengal film industry. The uproar has led to the Bengal film fraternity urging its local industry not to screen any dubbed film in the theatres henceforth.<br />
The<em> Gunday</em> dubbing uproar is preceded by almost the entire Kannada film industry coming together in January this year to participate in a <em>bandh</em> and a rally protesting against other language films to be dubbed into Kannada. The protest had strong political backing with former Deputy Chief Minister R Ashok saying, “At present, Kannada cinemas run successfully in 10 to 12 districts of Karnataka. If cinemas dubbed from other languages are screened, this number will reduce. Lakhs of people depend on cinema for a living and if dubbing comes into play, their lives will become miserable.” This seems to be the grouse of Bengali films too as dubbing a film from one language to another poses questions of economics as well as cultural identity. While, on the one hand, a free and democratic society should have no issues with dubbing of films from one Indian language to another, on the other, if a Hindi film is dubbed in a regional language alongside its original Hindi version, this has a negative impact on the regional cinema of the state concerned. It would also tend unwittingly to either distort or misrepresent or mutate the specific cultural elements of the home culture of that given region.<br />
However, when contacted, Ali Abbas Zafar, director of <em>Gunday</em> stated, “The film hasn&#8217;t released in West Bengal and we are not releasing it either.”<br />
Prosenjit Chatterjee, the superstar of Bengali film industry for 30 years now says, “This is not a personal agenda against any producer from Bollywood. We have high regard for legendary producers like the late Yash Chopra<em>ji</em>. But the Bengali film industry right now is reaching out in different ways by broadening the contours of its reach and context and the Bengali audience is being pulled back into the theatres again. At this juncture, the simultaneous release of a Bollywood film in Hindi and Bengali would create a fragile ambience adversely impacting on Bengali cinema. We will not back any Bengali artiste from the Bengali film industry who participates in such dubbing ventures now and in the future,” he said adding that the industry would like to see Hindi films running parallel to films made by Bengali by the local film industry and urged everyone concerned not to screen any dubbed film in theatres or run dubbed serials on television any more.<br />
Arun Mehta, who distributed <em>Krrish 3</em> and <em>Chennai Express</em> in West Bengal, said that the protest of the Bengali industry is rooted in the fear that the release of films dubbed into Bengali would narrow the financial and box-office prospects of their films. “It would occupy most of theatres in the state, blocking the release of Bengali films,” he said. While talking to PTI, actor Parambrata Chatterjee of <em>Kahaani</em> fame said, “We are not issuing any threat to anybody. But the local industry has its stake. This is our united stand and we mean it,” and actor-director and producer Arindam Sil assured that as line producer of<em> Gunday</em> and many other Hindi films he could vouchsafe that no artiste from Tollygunj did the Bengali voice-over for the film from Bengal.<br />
Film-maker Aniket Chatterjee, known for his distinct genre of satire cloaked in humour films like<em> Chhoye Chhuti, Bye Bye Bangkok, Goday Gondogol</em> and <em>Mahapurush O Kapurush</em>, marks a note of dissent. “In principle, I am totally against the dubbing of other language films in Bengali. Also I do not understand the hoo-haa because commercially, all dubbed films have failed miserably. Even the Bengali dubbed version of <em>Gunday</em> has hardly had any takings at the box office. However, the Bengali film industry right now is full of Bengali films copyrighted from Southern and even Punjabi hits. Actors from South and Bollywood are acting in Bengali films with their voices dubbed in Bengali by others.”<br />
Producer Srikant Mohta of Shree Venkatesh films said to PTI, “At a time when Tollywood films are attracting a good audience response due to content and quality we have to work for saving this limited market.”<br />
Leading actors from Bengali cinema including Jeet, Dev, Payel Sarkar, Haranath Chakraborty, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, Srijit Mukherji, Raj Chakraborty, Mahendra Soni, Shrikant Mohta, Ashok Dhanuka, Nispal Singh, Sudeshna Roy and several technicians gathered at the Bharat Lakshmi Studio to protest against the ‘disaster’. It, however, remains to be seen what the industry decides in the coming days.</p>

<p>The film is based on the 10 hour miniseries called <em>The Bible</em>, and will feature selections of the miniseries as well as deleted scenes, which were not featured during the telecast.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/12years2671.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994568" alt="A still from 12 Years a Slave" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/12years2671.jpg" /></a> A still from 12 Years a Slave
<p>The harrowing drama 12 Years a Slave won the Best Film Award at Britain’s top movie honours, cementing its status as favourite for the Oscars next month, but it was the space thriller Gravity that claimed the biggest trophy haul. 12 Years a Slave, by British director Steve McQueen with Hollywood’s Brad Pitt as a producer, had been tipped as the night’s major winner and also won Best Actor for Chiwetel Ejiofor as a man tricked and sold into slavery in the pre-Civil War United States. But Gravity, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, took home six prizes from its 11 nominations, including the Best Director prize for Mexican Alfonso Cuaron and the awards for Cinematography and Outstanding British Film. McQueen, 44, said it was horrifying that 21 million people were still living in slavery around the world now.<br />
“I hope that, 150 years from now, our ambivalence will not allow another film-maker to make this film,” he told the ceremony at London’s Royal Opera House. McQueen, a video artist as well as a director, previously won kudos for his 2008 film Hunger, about an IRA hunger strike in Northern Ireland, and won Britain’s top visual art award, the Turner Prize, in 1999 for a video based on a Buster Keaton film. Pitt, whose partner Angelina Jolie accompanied him to the ceremony, dressed like him in a tuxedo, said he was proud of the film, based on the real story of Solomon Northup.<br />
“It is a story that says we are all the same, and our freedom and dignity is everything, and that is what we are fighting for,” Pitt told a news conference. The Hollywood power couple were among a list of stars, who descended on London for the British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), which come two weeks before the Academy Awards and are widely seen as indicators of Oscar success. On the red carpet ahead of the ceremony, the most watched film awards outside the United States, stars including Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks and Britons Judi Dench and Emma Thompson mingled with fans.</p>
<p><strong>Award for Mirren</strong></p>
<p>Britain’s Prince William arrived last, chatting to the crowd gathered outside the theatre on a cold, dry evening before heading inside to present an Academy Fellowship for outstanding contribution to film to the British actress Helen Mirren. Mirren, 68, won an Oscar for playing his grandmother Queen Elizabeth in the 2006 film The Queen. Bookmakers had expected 12 Years a Slave to be the big winner ahead of Gravity, American Hustle, the Somali pirate thriller Captain Phillips and the British drama Philomena, starring Judi Dench as an Irish woman hunting for the son she had given up for adoption.<br />
The Best Actress award went to Australian Cate Blanchett for playing a riches-to-rags socialite in Woody Allen’s tragicomedy Blue Jasmine. She beat Dench, Amy Adams from American Hustle, Emma Thompson in Saving Mr. Banks and Bullock in Gravity. Blanchett, 44, dedicated her award to the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died of an apparent drugs overdose two weeks ago. Barkhad Abdi was named Best Supporting Actor for his role in Captain Phillips and the award for Best Supporting Actress went to Jennifer Lawrence in American Hustle, a con-artist caper set in the 1970s.<br />
The Italian movie, The Great Beauty won the award for Film Not in the English Language, while the documentary prize went to The Act of Killing by Joshua Oppenheimer.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The Bengali film industry is up in arms against the dubbed version of Bollywood film Gunday<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994976&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Shoma A Chatterji</strong></em></p>
<p>When Gunday was shot extensively in West Bengal and later when the film was dubbed into Bengali, nobody suspected the release would be mired in controversy. The Bengali film industry is protesting the dubbed Bengali version of the film and it is urging theatres not to screen it anymore.</p>
<p>The Gunday dubbing uproar is preceded by almost the entire Kannada film industry coming together in January this year to participate in a bandh and a rally protesting against other language films to be dubbed into Kannada. The protest had strong political backing with former Deputy Chief Minister R Ashok saying, “At present, Kannada cinemas run successfully in 10 to 12 districts of Karnataka. If cinemas dubbed from other languages are screened, this number will reduce. Lakhs of people depend on cinema for a living and if dubbing comes into play, their lives will become miserable.” This seems to be the grouse of Bengali films too as dubbing a film from one language to another poses questions of economics as well as cultural identity. While, on the one hand, a free and democratic society should have no issues with dubbing of films from one Indian language to another, on the other, if a Hindi film is dubbed in a regional language alongside its original Hindi version, this has a negative impact on the regional cinema of the state concerned. However, Ali Abbas Zafar, director of Gunday says, “The film hasn’t released in West Bengal and we are not releasing it either.”</p>
<p>Bengali film actor Prosenjit Chatterjee, says, “This is not a personal agenda against any producer from Bollywood. We have high regard for legendary producers like the late Yash Chopraji. But the simultaneous release of a Bollywood film in Hindi and Bengali would adversely impact Bengali cinema. We will not back any artiste from the Bengali film industry who participates in such dubbing ventures now and in the future.”</p>
<p>Arun Mehta, who distributed Krrish 3 and Chennai Express in West Bengal, said that the protest of the Bengali industry is rooted in the fear that the release of films dubbed into Bengali would narrow the financial and box-office prospects of their films. “It would occupy most of theatres in the state, blocking the release of Bengali films,” he said.</p>
<p>Filmmaker Aniket Chatterjee, who is known for his distinct genre of satire cloaked-in-humour films such as Chhoye Chhuti, Bye Bye Bangkok, Goday Gondogol and Mahapurush O Kapurush does not support the trend of dubbing films into regional languages. “In principle, I am totally against the dubbing of other language films into Bengali. But commercially also, all dubbed films have failed miserably. Even the Bengali dubbed version of Gunday has hardly any takers at the box office.”</p>
<p>Leading actors from Bengali cinema including Jeet, Dev, Payel Sarkar, Haranath Chakraborty, Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury, Srijit Mukherji, Raj Chakraborty, Mahendra Soni, Shrikant Mohta, Ashok Dhanuka, Nispal Singh, Sudeshna Roy and several other technicians gathered at the Bharat Lakshmi Studio to protest against the “disaster”. However, it remains to be seen what the industry decides in the coming days.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994976&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/play7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994963" alt="Play" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/play7.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you remain charged all the time considering you have three back-to-back releases — Shaadi Ke Side Effects, Ragini MMS 2, Main Tera Hero — and TV shows?</strong><br />
I don’t charge myself at all. In fact I try to disconnect as much as I can by meeting friends or exercising. But the thing with me is that there is no middle path — either everything happens simultaneously or nothing. So either I’ll have three films releasing at one go or not have a release for eight months.</p>
<p><strong>For someone who’s not married but must have got at least 100 characters married on television, what according to you are the side effects of marriage?</strong><br />
(Laughs) Personally I have zero experience but from what I’ve seen, the biggest side effect of marriage is that men are indeed from Mars and women from Venus. Clashes are bound to happen because one person in the equation has more testosterone and the other more estrogen. Men are good at logic, women better at multitasking, men like to solve an issue while women like to discuss the issue. Men and women are clinically so different that whenever they are in proximity, they will end up having a sparkling relationship. Sometimes marriage can feel like a chewing gum — you can neither throw it nor swallow it. You might be irritated by your spouse but you can’t walk away so easily. All this is so interesting and it’s fun to explore it in a film. In the last few years, marriage has lost its typicality. It is now between two equals staying together.</p>
<p><strong>Vidya Balan and Farhan Akhtar make for an atypical screen pair. How did that come about?</strong><br />
Credit for that must go to the Nandys (producers Pritish and Rangita Nandy) who cast them as husband and wife in the film. It’s because of this unusual pairing of Vidya and Farhan that I wanted to buy the film. I was very sure that this pair will sparkle because they are so different as people — Farhan is controlled and restrained, yet very witty whereas Vidya is flirtatious<br />
and uninhibited.</p>
<p><strong>Vidya and you share a strong connection, right from Hum Paanch to The Dirty Picture. Tell us about </strong><br />
<strong>your friendship.</strong><br />
I just love Vidya. She is the one person in the industry I feel I can lean on. I share an unabashed, fun and open connect with her primarily because we started our careers together. She has a wicked sense of humour.<br />
When she married Sid (Siddharth Roy Kapur), I told her, “Chal&#8230; you landed up with a Kapoor, only.” I wouldn’t have made The Dirty Picture without her. She’s a wonderful and brave actor but I like Vidya, the human being more. She watches my back and she knows I have hers.</p>
<p><strong>Your creative credentials are undeniable. But what happens when you work with someone like Farhan Akhtar, who, while being a writer-director is also a strong creative force. How do you navigate that?</strong><br />
I allied with Farhan because of his creative sensibilities and abilities. I know that when Farhan makes a creative suggestion then he must have a valid point and I must listen to him because I also know that Farhan wouldn’t have agreed to do the film if he didn’t see creative merit in it. I like to give that creative space to the people I work with. Sure if I felt something was amiss, I voiced my opinion, but the ultimate decision always rests with the team. There will be landmines when you work with different entities but once you take a decision then you honour it and try and be on the same page as much as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Your film Lootera was critically feted but the award season has more or less ignored it. What do you feel about that?</strong><br />
I wasn’t surprised. I was expecting it because I know that award season is exactly that — a season. It comes and goes and serves its purpose, which is to get TRPs for a channel. I’m not taking away the credibility of award shows but I don’t take them seriously. I try and not put too many eggs in the output box. Lootera might not have done well commercially but it will always remain a badge for me. I use it as my trump card. Whenever someone says, “Oh, you are making a horror sex film Ragini MMS 2 with Sunny Leone”, I say “Lootera”. When they say, “Oh, the women on television shows are so regressive”, I say “Lootera”. So you see, Lootera is my perfect one word answer to all the naysayers.</p>
<p><strong>Every magazine that does a Power List declares you as the Most Powerful Woman. What does power mean to you?</strong><br />
I don’t think I’m powerful. I don’t know which TV show or film will click so how can I be powerful? I don’t know how to protect my heart, my family or myself so how can I be powerful? Nobody is really powerful. People just perceive you as powerful.</p>
<p><strong>But do people say ‘no’ to you?</strong><br />
Oh yes. And it’s always those who you don’t want to hear a ‘no’ from.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your biggest critic?</strong><br />
My best friend Tanusri Dasgupta. She’s also the creative director in our company. She reads out the riot act to me, sends me memos and reads out my memoirs also.</p>
<p><strong>You have given innumerable breaks to aspiring actors in television and now in films too, you are backing young actors like Sidharth Malhotra (The Villain) and Varun Dhawan (Main Tera Hero). How do you spot talent?</strong><br />
I gamble on people. You can give me a pint of passion over a bazooka of talent any day. Talent without passion is boring but passion without talent is endearing. I just spot passion. Varun and Siddharth are touted to be the next big things. They already have a fan following and my nieces love them. It’s good to see young actors in films. I must add here that Farhan is the youngest of the lot. I’ve known him for 20 years — when as kids we both joined an ad agency and were flunkies together — but he hasn’t changed.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love more — films or television?</strong><br />
Films are my affair but TV is my shaadi and like someone just said to me, shaadi is something that once you are in it, you just can’t get out of it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994960&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Lyricist: Anvita Dutt, Habib Faisal 
Rating:**<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994983&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Be Kind, Rewind</strong></p>
<p>After giving us Jag Changa, one of the best albums of 2013, indi-pop musician Raghu Dixit turns composer with the Ayushmann Khurrana and Sonam Kapoor-starrer Bewakoofiyaan, his second film. In some ways, this one works more than Dixit&#8217;s first outing, Mujhse Fraandship Karoge, but as a solo album, it falls short on a number of grounds, rising only occasionally.</p>
<p>Gulchharey opens with a synth line, which sounds as though it is slightly inspired by Koi kahe from Dil Chahta Hai. But that&#8217;s just about it. The track never soars like Koi&#8230; despite wonderfully high-pitched Benny Dayal and despite colloquial and therefore interesting lyrics by Anvita Dutt.</p>
<p>Just when the disappointment is ready to set in, there comes Khamakhaan, a fine song. It&#8217;s here&#8217;s that one sees some delightful Raghu Dixit touches. Sung by Neeti Mohan and Ayushmann Khurrana, this one is owned by Mohan from the moment she breathes into it in the beginning without any instruments. She gets every pronunciation (we spot the nuqta almost 20 times she sings the word Khamakhaa), every intonation and cadence right besides working her voice wonderfully. An absolute delight. Khurrana as support is alright but Mohan is the star here. Besides a lovely guitar interlude towards the closing moments, very western style flute pieces in between give the track a jazz and a &#8217;90s feel.</p>
<p>The title song Bewakoofiyaan has been sung by Dixit, whose voice stands out, infused with lots of character and an electric guitar. He makes this one sound funny, fresh and fantastic. It&#8217;s also the effortlessness in his voice that takes you into the world where life is fun. Rumaani sa is just an ordinary track aimed at an attempt to be commercially successful. Mohit Chauhan and Shreya Ghoshal are not able to do much with the composition. Ghoshal does try a few falsettos, which begin to sound nice in the later part of the song.</p>
<p>Aye jagda by Vishal Dadlani has a wonderful bluegrass sound and arrangements with a banjo make it an alright listening session. But despite Dadlani&#8217;s lovely voice, the song fails to stick. O heeriye is another disappointment. However, Rochak Kohli and Khurrana&#8217;s former collaborations have been wonderful with mostly cascading guitars. Whenever indipop is introduced into the mainstream, the results can be interesting. But Bewakoofiyaan proves that only in parts and puts Dixit on the Bollywood map, which gives us hope for future.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994983&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/play9.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994973" alt="Play" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/play9.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you conceptualise the idea of a tribute to Kishore Kumar?</strong><br />I entered the industry as a follower of Kishoreda (Kumar) and I still have a lot to learn from his singing. Before I began my career as a playback singer, I used to sing his songs in hotels. Almas Noor (princess of Malaysia) emailed me that she is a big fan of Kishoreda and my work. Then we discussed an album collaboration. Both of us liked the plan and then, I met her in Malaysia, where we zeroed in on 12 songs, including Jaane jaan, Kya yehi pyar he and Tu tu hai wahi, among others. The old melodies have been recreated with a contemporary touch by Jatin Sharma.</p>
<p><strong>Being a veteran in this field, what do  you have to say about Noor’s  singing abilities?</strong><br />She has a good voice. Despite the fact that she doesn’t know Hindi, she went through rigorous training and several hours of rehearsals to get everything right. We also did quite a few rehearsal sessions together. I was treated extremely well in Malaysia, and although there were a few problems during the video shoot due to the laws, we shot our parts separately.</p>
<p><strong>Your last full duet was in Rowdy Rathore. Why don’t we hear more of you  these days?</strong><br />I think my fans hear my voice through different mediums everyday. I have tasted the peak of success in my career and now, I am at a level where I don’t feel I can go any further. Having said that, I end up doing several shows and live concerts across the world, even today. So in a way I am more busy. Nowadays, the identity of a singer is completely lost and there is zero voice registration. Each song is popular only for a limited phase, then some other track takes over and music lovers have to surf the internet or television to get details of the artiste who has worked on it. I personally believe, that the music industry is going through a very sad phase. The only ray of hope is the fact that the audience is becoming more conscious of the kind of musical genres they prefer and hence, good melodies are making a comeback.</p>
<p><strong>Several singers look up to you for inspiration, but who has been your role model in the industry?</strong><br />Kishore Kumar is my god and I try to get that kind of perfection in my voice. I confess that during my early days, I tried emulating his voice. Whenever the industry required a voice on the lines of Kishoreda’s, I was roped in. Be it for Amitabh Bachchan in Jaadugar or Insaniyat. It was only in 1990 with the release of Aashiqui that people recognised my voice as that of Kumar Sanu’s.</p>
<p><strong>What is your take on the current crop of musicians and singers?</strong><br />They are extremely talented, hard working and full of zest. It’s a pity that their potential is not used to capacity. Also, I think it is high time the music composers balance their sounds with a good mix of dance and soothing numbers. You cannot have an album full of big bang sounds and vulgar lyrics. Among the current lot, I love the music composed by Ajay-Atul and Amit Trivedi.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any actor from the new generation you would like to lend your voice to?</strong><br />I’ll choose Ranbir Kapoor, because I have fond memories of the songs that I have sung for his father, Rishi Kapoor. Rishi was one of the few actors who did justice to my voice, and now when I look at Ranbir, he comes across as one of the most intense actors of this generation. I think it will be great to lend my voice to him.</p>
<p><strong>What about your future projects?</strong><br />I have finished recording for Neil Nitin Mukesh’s upcoming film, Dusshera. There are quite a few Bollywood projects also lined up. Otherwise, live shows continue to keep me busy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994969&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was not very attracted to the idea of making anything for television. So when I got a call for this serial on Doordarshan, which was fundamentally about social messages, it got me thinking. I took it up as a challenge. I saw some stunning work done in South America and South Africa, even in Japan, where they used the language of soap opera for sending out important messages. But when they do that they never forget that primarily the show is for entertainment. This show could be my last television serial because I don’t see myself directing serials day in and day out. It’s not just a serial, it’s much more than that. Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon is a very important show in terms of gender issues, women empowerment, sex determination, sex selection, early marriage, early and repeated pregnancies and domestic violence in Indian society. The story revolves around the inspiring journey of Sneha Mathur, a doctor working in Mumbai. She represents the young Indian woman of today who thrives on challenges. As the story progresses, Sneha returns to her village and find herself embroiled in a series of family dramas. Sneha’s sense of family responsibility, along with her ability to respond to challenges around her, makes her a role model for many young women who face similar realities. The serial will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you think.</p>
<p>For me it’s not just a serial, it is a part of an important vision and initiative taken up by Population Foundation of India, which is trying to bring about a change in the mindset of masses about women. We are primarily targeting small towns and that is the reason we chose to broadcast this show on Doordarshan. Television is different from theatre but I am bringing in my experience and values from theatres on this show. We are different from other serials dealing with the similar kind of issues as we are solely guided by values and principles and not by commerce. When I watch Indian TV shows, I get furious. They are agonisingly regressive and mediorce. Women are projected as dimwitted, scheming, helpless or plain silly. I asked myself how many recent films and serials have been made where the birth of a girl child is celebrated.</p>
<p>One needs to challenge regressive social ideas and once the gender issue is addressed, once there is a sense of equal partnership, then eventually, domestic violence will come down. There is a need to put more focus on maternal healthcare. So while we are engaged in health programmes, there are other social issues, which require attention. Television is the medium for that, I would not say the same for cinema. Interestingly, after the first television serial, Hum Log, which carried a social message, we forgot to develop the idea further.</p>
<p>The myth that social engagement cannot be entertaining and popular needs to be challenged. I think that will change if you make the shows well. The problem sometimes is that you have good intentions, but fall short of talent. You have to realise that when you are making something for a cause, it does not matter whether it is issue-based or pure entertainment. The quality has to be top class and very engaging.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994967&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/play8.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994966" alt="Mithoon " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/play8.jpg" /></a> Mithoon
<p>The  nameplate on the door bears the family name “Sharma”, but composer Mithoon prefers to be addressed only by his first name. And as you enter his studio flat at suburban Mumbai’s Yari Road, the first thing that strikes you is the number of Jesus Christ portraits that adorn the walls, cabinets and cupboards. These are the springs that feed the composer’s creativity. Even Tum hi ho, the song from Aashiqui 2, which swept the music charts and awards in the last one year, was inspired from these portraits. “I came up with the hookline of Tum hi ho in my head right after finishing prayers,” he says, while talking about his career defining song.</p>
<p>After quick success and adulation for his original and soulful compositions for films such as Onir’s Bas Ek Pal (2006), Anwar (2007), The Train (2007) and Lamhaa (2010), Mithoon went through a phase of deep professional crisis. “I was told that my music is monotonous. The phone calls became fewer and industry people started ignoring me,” he says. That’s when his new-found faith resuscitated him. “Jesus is like a role model to me. I don’t believe in rituals and I don’t intend to convert either, but I see the larger message behind Christianity,” says the 29-year old musician.</p>
<p>For those familiar with his earlier music, be it the sublime Madno from Lamhaa or the mystical Anwar, Mithoon’s deep spiritual connection is not all that surprising. Although he avoids the labelling, Mithoon agrees that his music always reflected this side of him. “I avoid glitter, anything ornamental or plastic in my music. I try to keep it clutter-free, which, spiritually speaking, is like the Sufi way of life, detaching oneself from the clutter of the world,” he says.</p>
<p>It has also brought about a change in how he looks at work. “Earlier, I was trying too hard to chase success. I was becoming mechanical,” he says, adding, “Now I am not that ambitious professionally. I don’t think long term and take films as they come. Sometimes I tell my office staff that, ‘we might just stop working suddenly one day’,” he laughs, adding,” But I do want to achieve something spiritually.”</p>
<p>As the son of famous Bollywood arranger Naresh Sharma, Mithoon started his musical journey when his father told him to take up the arrangement of the song Woh lamhe woh baatein from Zeher (2005). The song became a rage, soon to be followed by Aadat from another from Bhatt stable, Kalyug (2005); their successes also heralding the arrival of “Sufi-rock” in Hindi film music. Mithoon could have easily gone his father’s way, carving out a career in music arrangement, but he decided, “no more recreation and production. I have a lot to tell myself.” As he did famously in his album-stealing single Dil sambhal ja zara from Murder 2 (2011). His next lot of films include Creature, Traffic, Onir’s remake of Hamlet, a film with Rajshri Productions, Bhaag Johnny, Hate Story 2 and The Villain.</p>
<p>A fan of composer Madan Mohan’s “ability to convert moods and emotions into songs”, Mithoon gives music based on a simple philosophy. “It should come in the purest way possible of how I am feeling. It’s a meditative, internal thing, and I try to avoid as much external influences, like a groove I may have heard,” he says. He has sometimes been criticised about excessive use of piano, guitar and pads, to which he says, “I get up and breathe the same air everytime. What’s the problem with monotony?”</p>
<p>Trained in jazz piano from a young age, Mithoon always composes on the piano. His artistry with the instrument is evident when he plays it, and displays an array of moods, switching effortlessly from one harmony to the other, while playing the Aashiqui 2 tune. “This is bright, this is a little brighter, and this, is a little melancholic,” he says with gentle and light touches of the piano keys. “It’s like a pen in my hand and I am writing a story.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994964&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/play10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1994981" alt="Play" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/play10.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>You told the same story of Highway on TV 15 years ago. What was left unsaid that you wanted to say again?</strong><br />
The story just didn’t leave me. This was the only Rishtey (episodic Zee TV show) that I did. Somehow I’ve never been able to tell a story in 45 minutes. Some yearning was there to tell this story in a better way because I understood it much better.</p>
<p><strong>What do you make of the polarised response that the film is getting?</strong><br />
It’s not as polarised as Rockstar, which really divided people between love and hate. The response to this is emotional.</p>
<p><strong>There’s been a lot of discussion about the relationship between Veera and Mahabir. Are they lovers? She mothers him, he watches out for her as a father would. In your head what relationship do they share?</strong><br />
I’m anyway intrigued about relationships. There are some lovers who are more friends, while some husband-wives are more like siblings. In my head, Veera and Mahabir are victims. They have both lost out on their childhood and they unite on a level of empathy. I don’t see them as lovers. If people want to define love as getting married and having children then it’s not a love story, but if love is about giving comfort and affection to each other then it is a love story. In my head, Veera wants freedom and she feels Mahabir is a part of her journey and he will get her that freedom.</p>
<p><strong>This is something in all your films — the women that you write always want to be free but why is it that they attain that freedom through a man? Heer did that with Jordan in Rockstar and in Highway Veera does the same with Mahabir.</strong><br />
Rockstar’s Heer was really sorted and wanted to have as much fun as she could before she got married. In Veera’s case, the man (Mahabir) is actually a tool for her to be out there on the highway but as the journey goes on, he makes himself redundant by dying. In a way, his death sets her free.</p>
<p><strong>The big emotional moment — when Veera reveals her big secret to Mahabir — came out of the blue. Didn’t you want to prepare the audience for this moment?</strong><br />
She just needed to say it. She was pressured by the fact that she didn’t run away when she had the chance. It was her necessity. She didn’t think it through so she just blurted it out.</p>
<p><strong>There’s some criticism about Veera’s reaction to her kidnapping. She seemed to accept it quite easily.</strong><br />
What option did she have? She was beaten up, she ran, she cried, she had her catharsis, she came back. In a way she feels free that she’s rid of the curse of making a choice, yet she asserts herself. There is no rulebook of how people should behave.</p>
<p><strong>In all your films, marriage is a trigger to life altering realisations. Why?</strong><br />
Marriage is difficult because it comes with too many impositions. It’s synthetic, unnatural and difficult. Marriage sets off a new journey inside you. I don’t have a stand on marriage. When I’m writing these stories, I’m also wondering.</p>
<p><strong>You give a defining statement to your women characters — Socha Na Tha’s Aditi said, “Tum itna bhav de kyun rahe ho”, Jab We Met’s Geet said, “Main apni favourite hoon,” to Veera’s “Main jaisi bhi hoon&#8230; aap mein se ek nahin hoon.” How do you think up your women characters?</strong><br />
I come from a conservative set-up in Jamshedpur and Patna where women were always kept at a distance. Since I don’t have a sister, I’ve always been fascinated by women, found them to be enchantingly smart, very sorted, yet at the same time they had a subservient status in society. A woman has to work harder to survive in our society and be happy. Sometimes she even needs to be mean and manipulative in order to protect her happiness, which has always fascinated me and that’s why I like thinking of women characters perhaps a bit more than my male characters.</p>
<p><strong>Which woman character you think will go old with you?</strong><br />
Veera is the most unique character I’ve thought of. She’s younger and unresolved and look at where this girl reaches. She is kidnapped but she dominates Mahabir throughout. It’s her personal victory. On the level of intellect she is similar to Rockstar’s Jordan. He’s also a character that remained unresolved that’s why he’ll always be endearing. I still don’t know Jordan fully. I just hope he never comes back in any of my other scripts because he messed with my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Which two characters that you have written, would you invite for dinner?</strong><br />
It has to be two girls. Socha Na Tha’s Aditi and Highway’s Veera. Aditi had some charm whereas Veera is still in my system.</p>
<p><strong>Your critics say you make the same movie all the time. Agree?</strong><br />
I’m not here to make a filmography. I try not to have an ownership on my films. Actually I don’t think about myself. There’s a certain sense of myself that I want to get into with each film. My film is my canvas to sprawl out, meet people and have fun. Telling a story is my experiment to find myself. When I was in class nine, I had to direct a Teacher’s Day skit. With Highway I wanted to see if I could do that skit again. And tell the story simply. That’s how AR Rahman works. He works without a safety net. If he fails, he fails.</p>
<p><strong>Every film teaches a filmmaker something about himself, what did Highway teach you?</strong><br />
That I don’t need to be so well-behaved. It’s more refreshing to be real rather than tameezdaar (well-behaved)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994979&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kangana Ranaut’s next, titled Revolver Rani, will see her in an action avatar. This film is set to hit the screens in April this year. Although the release date is not yet out, the actor confirmed that the date will be announced at the first look launch tomorrow, in Mumbai. While talking about her role in the film, Ranaut stated that this has by far been the toughest role she has ever done. “I can’t talk much about it. I have to say that this film was extremely challenging. I may have played a chameleon in Krrish 3 or a spunky small town girl in Tanu Weds Manu, but the audience will get to see me in a different space in Revolver Rani,” she adds. Produced by Tigmanshu Dhulia, several portions of this action-drama were shot in the ravines of Chambal. She will be seen opposite actor-comedian Vir Das in the film.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994974&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8216;Raunaq&#8217; is a unique collaboration between the legendary musician and the Central minister, who wrote all the songs for the album.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a great pleasure to be here for this launch. The songs are nice. I think Kapil sir is amazing and Rahman is average,&#8221; Salman said with a chuckle.<br />
The album has more than seven songs and are sung by best of artists in the industry including Lata Mangeshkar and Shreya Ghoshal among others.<br />
Speaking at the launch, Salman said there is one thing common between him and Rahman, which is &#8216;Jai Ho&#8217;, the title of his latest release.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/daler.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994841" alt="Da;ler Mehendi" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/daler.jpg" /></a> Daler Mehndi said, “I feel ashamed to hear Hindi songs nowadays whose lyrics are full of slangs.”
<p>Bhangra King Daler Mehndi says he is too expensive for playback singing in Bollywood as he will never sing for free.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want Rs 5 lakh, a business class ticket and lots of other things. Other singers do it for free. I cannot do that. I work hard for my singing and cannot do it for free,&#8221; Mehndi said</p>
<p>The 46-year-old Punjabi pop sensation has sung for &#8216;Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, &#8216;Rang de Basanti&#8217;, &#8216;Singh is Kinng&#8217;, &#8216;Action Replayy&#8217; and several other Bollywood movies.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I feel there is any need to lend my voice for playback, I will. But if I think I&#8217;m being used I won&#8217;t go for it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mehndi is a passionate sufi singer and has also taken an initiative to nurture more talents in this genre of music. &#8220;We are likely to come up with &#8216;Sufi Sultana&#8217;, an initiative through which we are planning to audition children from 13 years of age across the country who are good at sufi songs and promote them worldwide. I want to promote sufi music globally,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Tunak Tunak Tun&#8217; hitmaker, who is the brother of singer Mika, says he feels ashamed to hear songs which are laced with vulgarity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel ashamed to hear Hindi songs nowadays whose lyrics are full of slangs. Such songs are degrading our culture. What will our children learn from them? They should be banned,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Not a regular judge on reality show, Mehndi says such shows do not promote young talent as singers in such shows come and vanish without tasting success.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to bring singers from the remotest corners of the country and give them opportunity to launch their music. Not like reality shows where they come and go,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the past, Mehndi has been responsible for launching talents like Ghazal maestro Hussain Buksh, UK Bhangra Icon Safri Boys and comedy king Raju Shrivastav through his home label DRecords.</p>
<p>After he composed and sang an election campaign song for the Congress party, there were speculations that he is going to join politics but Mehndi says he has no such plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not in any mood to join politics. I am ready to sing but I&#8217;m certainly not in election mood,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994840&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hollywood superstar George Clooney will reportedly officiate the wedding of celebrity couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.</p>
<p>The couple, who are parents to Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox, and Vivienne, are apparently planning to get hitched this year, reported Daily Star.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was Brad&#8217;s idea to have George involved but he was shocked when he actually agreed. Now he&#8217;s started calling him the Reverend George Clooney. He is taking it all very seriously and has already had discussions about what kind of service they&#8217;d like,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>&#8220;George has made it clear he&#8217;s dead against marriage for himself but he can&#8217;t wait to help his friends tie the knot,&#8221; the source added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994807&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sarakhan.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994775" alt="Sara Khan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sarakhan.jpg" /></a> Television actor Sara Khan will be making her Bollywood debut in &#8216;Total Siyappa&#8217;.
<p>Television actor Sara Khan, who will be making her Bollywood debut in &#8216;Total Siyappa&#8217;, says she is not looking for a career in Bollywood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be in the rat-race. I want to take things as they come. Also, I&#8217;m a psychologist and I am mostly busy with it. I do lot of work with NGOs and I am not looking for a Bollywood career,&#8221; Sara told PTI.</p>
<p>Sara, who played the lead in TV serial &#8216;Dhoondh Legi Manzil Humein&#8217;, said she rejected the movie offer first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initially, I was not very keen on this. I rejected the offer. But when I met E Niwas (the director) he narrated the entire story, then I found my character very interesting,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Talking about her role in the movie, Sara said, &#8220;The name of my character is Jiya. She is a very very fun-loving girl, high on life, takes life as it comes and does not care about the norms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The movie stars Yami Gautum, singer-actor Ali Zafar, veteran actor Anupam Kher and his wife Kirron Kher who will be appearing together for the first time in a movie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Working with Kirron ji was amazing. So with Yami and Ali. They were brilliant. Me and Yami especially got along with each other very well,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Total Siyappa&#8217; is a rom-com directed by E Nivas and written by Neeraj Pandey of &#8216;A Wednesday&#8217; and &#8216;Special 26&#8242;. The movie is slated to release on Mar 7.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994758&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lisa.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994737" alt="Lisa Kudrow" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lisa.jpg" /></a> Lisa Kudrow has lost a USD 1.6 million lawsuit against her former manager Scott Howard.
<p>&#8216;Friends&#8217; star Lisa Kudrow has lost a USD 1.6 million lawsuit against her former manager, Scott Howard.</p>
<p>A jury at a LA Superior Court ruled against the 50-year-old actress yesterday and asked her to pay Howard USD 1.6 million after Kudrow was found liable for the breach of contract, reported Ace Showbiz.</p>
<p>Howard and Kudrow parted ways in 2007 after 16 years of partnership. In 2008, Howard filed the lawsuit, claiming that Kudrow stopped paying him.</p>
<p>According to Howard, he and the actress had an oral agreement in which he&#8217;s owed five per cent of her earnings made from works she gained while they were working together.</p>
<p>&#8220;The jury&#8217;s verdict is merely one step in the legal process. This case ultimately will be resolved at the appellate level,&#8221; Kudrow&#8217;s attorney Gerard Sauer said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ms Kudrow has faith in the judicial system, and she believes that the eventual outcome of this contractual dispute will be in her favour,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994736&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pop star Beyonce Knowles gave a birthday girl an unforgettable gift by singing &#8216;Happy Birthday&#8217; in the middle of her recent Birmingham concert.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Drunk in Love&#8217; hitmaker stopped her show so that she could wish the lucky fan, Shehnaz Khan, who turned 22 that day, reported Ace Showbiz.</p>
<p>Khan filmed the moment and shared it on YouTube. In the nearly-two-minute clip, Beyone can be seen ordering her backing dancers to stop performing after spotting Khan standing in the front row while wearing a badge saying it&#8217;s her birthday.</p>
<p>The star approaches the girl and asks her name before singing &#8216;Happy Birthday&#8217;. After finishing the song, Beyonce returns to the stage and continues the show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Incredible, when is that ever going to happen again! I was wearing a birthday badge, which she noticed early on in the show and she kind of nodded in acknowledgement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe she stopped the show for me. I was leaning over the barrier holding her hand and not realising the camera was recording, everyone around me was going crazy!&#8221; Khan said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994727&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 40-year-old actor said he had to put on some pounds to portray an overweight conman Irving Rosenfeld in the film, reported Daily Express.</p>
<p>&#8220;At one point I said enough already. He lost three inches of height, and even got a herniated disc.

<p>Actress-Model Payal Rohatgi took to Twitter to announce her engagement to long time beau and wrestler Sangram Sanjeet.</p>
<p>Payal tweeted, “Today on this auspicious day of #Mahashivratri I Am #engaged to my jaan @Sangram_Sanjeet . Thank you Lord Shiva for your blessings always.”</p>
<p>The engagement ceremony took place early on Thursday (February 27).</p>
<p>The couple met on the sets of reality show Survivor India in 2011, and since then have been in a committed relationship.</p>
<p>In 2008, Payal Rohatgi, who participated in the second season of controversial celebrity game show Bigg Boss, was romantically linked with fellow inmate, Rahul Mahajan. However, the couple broke up later, with Payal citing abuse and physical assault as the main reasons of their split. There were also reports of Payal dating South African cricketer, Herschelle Gibbs in 2010.</p>
<p>Sangram&#8217;s latest television stint was in &#8216;Bigg Boss 7&#8242;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994704&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bollywood has, over the past one hundred years, gathered many weird and wonderful titles. Our first reaction, of course, was to laugh at them. But we then realized that, much like Nostradamus, there’s more to them that meets the eye. Here are the funniest ways in which crazy Bollywood film titles from the past see themselves coming true in 2014.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sonam4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994529" alt="Sonam Kapoor has an important role in 'Dolly Ki Doli'." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sonam4801.jpg" /></a> Sonam Kapoor has an important role in &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217;.
<p>When Sonam Kapoor was roped in for Raanjhanaa, one of the pre-conditions set by director Aanand L. Rai was for her to attend certain acting workshops with theater actors. Now for her next film for which she begins shooting soon, Dolly Ki Doli, it would be back to the grind for the actress who saw some good critical acclaim coming her way for her performance in Raanjhanaa.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Sonam would be attending an elaborate acting workshop for Dolly Ki Doli,&#8221; informs a source, &#8220;In fact she would be joined by the principle cast of the film that includes Pulkit Samrat, Rajkumarr Rao and Varun Sharma (of Fukrey fame). First time director Abhishek Dogra has planned this schedule for his lead cast so that all is well in order before they arrive on the sets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film, which is set in North, would be shot across multiple locations in and around Delhi. Most importantly for Sonam, who has a central role in the film, it was all the more imperative that she adapts to the various culture, lingo, tone and theme of the cities where she would be stepping her feet in.</p>
<p>Meanwhile her co-star Pulkit, who follows the approach of method acting, is happy that he would be able to get his act right much in advance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I basically believe in rehearsing for three takes for a shot before going on the sets. That saves a lot of time for the crew when you have done your research as an actor. Such workshops help then,&#8221; he says, &#8220;Moreover, I and Sonam are working together for the first time. It is going to be very exciting to be sharing the screen space with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Rajkumarr, an accomplished actor himself, this workshop would only bring him closer to the world of hardcore commercial setting.</p>
<p>For producer Arbaaz Khan, who is stepping out of the comfort zone of Dabangg, it is going to be an altogether different and unexplored world in Dolly Ki Doli.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we have planned workshops for the film,&#8221; says Arbaaz, &#8220;In fact we begin with joint readings and then move on to the workshop. Once we start shooting during March/April, it is going to be a non-stop schedule across different cities. Whatever adaptation to the script and the plot had to be done, it has to be now.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994526&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>After creating quite a furore at the Bigg Boss house, Ajaz Khan is busy whipping up a storm in Cape Town for Fear Factor with both his off and on camera hi-jinks.</p>
<p>While his presence on the show riled Kushal Tandon and Gauhar Khan enough to send them scampering back to India, Ajaz&#8217;s stunts for the show seem to have impressed the yesteryears&#8217; super stunt-man Mudhu Balwant Shetty&#8217;s son Rohit Shetty enough to offer him a major role in his next film Ajay Devgn- Kareena Kapoor starrer Singham 2.</p>
<p>Says a source from Cape Town, &#8220;Rohit Shetty has made the announcement of casting Ajaz on camera. Rohit was impressed not only by Ajaz&#8217;s stunts on camera he also found him entertaining and funny off camera. On an impulse Shetty offered Khan a role.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried to congratulate Ajaz. But he quickly begged off any comment. Apparently the channel Colors has placed a blanket ban on all media interaction with the Fear Factor contestants after the Kushal- Gauhar- Ajaz tamasha in Cape Town.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994514&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rakul Preet who made her big screen debut earlier this year with Yaariyan was detained at the Delhi airport. Apparently the actress was travelling to Mumbai and while going through the security check at the Delhi airport, a suspicious metallic object was found in her bag. On scrutiny the said object turned out to be a bullet, owing to which she was asked to step aside. Rakul was later detained for carrying a bullet in her bag by the CISF and was questioned for hours about the bullet.</p>
<p>Later on closer examination, the 8mm bullet that is not available in India turned out to be a dummy that was used on sets of Rakul&#8217;s south film shoot eight months earlier. Post this discovery Rakul was released by the police.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994503&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aliashabana_480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994496" alt="Shabana Azmi congratulated Alia Bhatt." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aliashabana_480.jpg" /></a> Shabana Azmi congratulated Alia Bhatt.
<p>Immediately after seeing her performance in Imtiaz Ali&#8217;s Highway Shabana Azmi rushed to the Bhatts&#8217; residence to congratulate the parents and their daughter for the extraordinary performance.</p>
<p>The 5-times National award winning actress, acknowledged by many cineastes as among India&#8217;s finest talent ever, sees Alia as the true inheritor of her talent. Interestingly Alia&#8217;s father Mahesh Bhatt has compared Alia&#8217;s performance in Highway to Shabana&#8217;s sterling career-defining performance in Arth.</p>
<p>Shabana who won a National award for her performance in Arth, agrees with Mahesh Bhatt&#8217;s assessment.</p>
<p>Opines Shabana, &#8220;Javed and I went straight to Alia&#8217;s house after watching Highway. We were both profoundly moved by her performance. I am so very proud of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shabana takes no offence to Alia&#8217;s father comparing his 2-film old daughter to the high-priestess of histrionics. &#8220;Mahesh doesn&#8217;t say this lightly and he doesn&#8217;t say it because Alia is his daughter. He compares Alia&#8217;s performance to mine because he genuinely believes that the girl has achieved an exceptional level of performing prowess so early in her career. And Mahesh is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shabana feels Alia has got where Shabana did in Arth in no time at all. &#8220;Alia&#8217;s achievement is all the more laudable because I did Arth after 9 years of facing the camera. Alia has done it in her second film. That&#8217;s amazing! Alia took me completely by surprise. She possesses both vulnerability and insouciance.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact Alia&#8217;s protective step-sister Pooja Bhatt is planning a film with her baby-sister.</p>
<p>Says Pooja, &#8220;If Student Of The Year launched Alia as a young star, Highway has launched her as an actor. I am so soooo proud of her and I shall remain ever-grateful to Imtiaz.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994473&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Australian actor Sam Worthington has been arraigned in New York on counts including misdemeanor assault for allegedly punching a photographer, who also was charged in their encounter.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old &#8220;Avatar&#8221; star was ordered today to stay away from photographer Sheng Li for six months. Worthington was released on his own recognizance.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Worthington punched the photographer in the face in a scuffle Sunday in Manhattan&#8217;s Greenwich Village.</p>
<p>They say he told officers he was protecting his girlfriend. Defense lawyer Stacey Richman told the judge photographers have relentlessly followed Worthington. Earlier, the actor had no comment when he entered Manhattan Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Li was arrested on reckless endangerment, assault and harassment charges. His lawyer says Li shouldn&#8217;t have been arrested.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994392&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bollywood actress Madhuri Dixit said that she had not thought about joining politics.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not thought about it.

<p>Madhuri, who plays the role of &#8216;Rajjo&#8217; in the movie, has been shown slapping and hitting men.</p>
<p>However, Madhuri said that in her real life she has never slapped anyone.</p>

<p>Aamir Khan has rubbished reports of threat to his life in the wake of sensitives issues taken up by him during the first season of his television show &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217;.</p>
<p>After Aamir touched upon sensitive topics like female foeticide, medical malpractices and honour killing in &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217;, he had apparently received several threats to stop highlighting such cases.</p>
<p>There were reports that Aamir had ordered a bullet proof car as some of the episodes of &#8216;Satyamev Jayate 2&#8242; may throw light on governance and issues related to Lok Sabha elections 2014.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not got any threats. I don&#8217;t fear&#8230; threats. Do not go with the rumours. There is no threat to me,&#8221; the actor said.</p>
<p>The show anchored by Aamir, 48, will be aired on television from March 2.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think ourselves as communicators, our responsibility is to talk about an issue, present the data and talk about the law. I want people to join&#8230; engage in the movement and stand for the right things. Personally, I would like to endorse women empowerment,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994006&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aamir4802.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994002" alt="&quot;I want to be away from politics,&quot; said Aamir Khan." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aamir4802.jpg" /></a> &#8220;I want to be away from politics,&#8221; said Aamir Khan.
<p>Aamir Khan said here today that he doesn&#8217;t support any political party and would not align with any of them at an event related to his TV show &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be away from politics. I want to align with issues that are important. I support a thought and not a party. I want to support an issue irrespective of any political party. I would not wish to align with any party,&#8221; Aamir told PTI.</p>
<p>Aamir claimed that he cried during the show, while talking about a touching incident of forgiveness.<br />
&#8220;I felt I cried too much on the show. I am an emotional person. I cry when I hear heartbreaking stories. There are times when I cried and the channel people cut that part as 15 minutes of crying is too much, since there are other important issues to talk about,&#8221; he said.<br />
Aamir said that he visited Gaya in Bihar yesterday to announce the second season of the &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217; TV show, from the very spot where one Dashrath Manjhi broke a mountain and made a road for villagers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an inspiration to all the people who wish to do something. I salute his courage and determination,&#8221; Aamir said.<br />
The second season of the show has a new feature where people may vote for their opinions on any issue which they wish to follow.<br />
&#8220;We have introduced a vote for change campaign where people can vote and give their opinion on any issue. We plan to give these (poll) details to the government,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It has also been decided to air the second season of the show in three slots, so that people could absorb the issue, he said.<br />
Incidentally, Aamir is also one among the many people who sang the title track of &#8216;Satyamev Jayate 2&#8242;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993995&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bollywood beauty Priyanka Chopra is on a buying spree. The starlet, who was recently spotted flaunting her new Rolls Royce at an awards show, is now a proud owner of a hot pink Harley Davidson bike.</p>
<p>The pretty lady posted the picture of her mean machine on Instagram:</p>
<p><iframe src="//instagram.com/p/k3c3sOJs52/embed/" height="710" width="612" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><br />
The American motorcycle manufacturer, Harley Davidson was founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, during the first decade of the 20th century. It was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression. Harley-Davidson also survived a period of poor quality control and competition from Japanese manufacturers.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Gunday&#8217; starlet, who is known for her &#8216;going out of the way&#8217; attitude already owns a Porsche Cayenne, a Mercedes Benz E Class, a BMW 7 series and a Rolls Royce.</p>
<p>Priyanka Chopra is currently shooting for her upcoming biopic &#8216;Mary Kom&#8217;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993986&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/yami-ali480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993960" alt="Produced by Neeraj Pandey, 'Total Siyappa' tells the tale of  an Indian girl in love with a Pakistani boy." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/yami-ali480.jpg" /></a> Produced by Neeraj Pandey, &#8216;Total Siyappa&#8217; tells the tale of an Indian girl in love with a Pakistani boy.
<p>Pakistani actor Ali Zafar and ‘Vicky Donor’ actress Yami Gautam spoke about their upcoming release, ‘Total Sipyappa’, which is a funny take on Indo-Pakistan relations, at the Screen Preview.</p>
<p>‘Total Siyappa’ directed by E. Nivas, who had earlier directed films like ‘Shool’ and ‘My Name is Anthony Gonsalves’ was initially titled &#8216;Aman Ki Asha&#8217;. Produced by Neeraj Pandey, director of ‘A Wednesday’ and ‘Special 26’, the film tells the tale of  an Indian girl in love with a Pakistani boy.</p>
<p>Post her first film, ‘Vicky Donor’, Yami Gautam took her time to sign up for her next project. On being asked about how ‘Total Siyappa’ came to be, the actress says, “Neeraj was the first person I met. I loved ‘A Wednesday’ and was really excited. I read the script on a flight in one go and absolutely loved it.”</p>
<p>“It should have come across as a serious film, but the story is more about the day that Asha takes Aman home to meet her parents,” says Ali Zafar who plays the male lead.</p>
<p>Ali said that both he and Yami had infact watched ‘Total Siyappa’ the night before. “We just watched the movie last night for the first time. And it’s a different take on Indo-Pak relations. It takes you to a different place, you forget everything and you’re just with those characters. You forget all boundaries and in the end you realize that we’re all the same,” said the actor.</p>
<p>Talking about her preparation to play Asha, Yami said it was very different from ‘Vicky Donor’. “In ‘Vicky Donor’, I wasn’t a part of the humour. But here in ‘Total Siyappa’, I’m very much a part of the madness and the chaos.”</p>
<p>Though Ali has mostly worked in comic roles, the actor doesn’t accept that comedy is his forte. “&#8217;Kill Dill&#8217; is very different. It is more action oriented. And I don’t want to keep doing only comedy. I want to expand and become a versatile actor. But for comedy I do tend to have a natural flair. I don’t have to try too hard to be funny,” he said.</p>
<p>When asked whether he faces any stereotypical prejudices being a Pakistani in India, Ali says, “People gather their thoughts from what they see and hear. There’s television, press and now there’s social media, but there is no direct source of communication between people from the two countries.”</p>
<p>Questioned on whether Yami has changed any kind of misconception that she had about Pakistanis after working with Ali, the actress replied, “I think the women there are very beautiful.” To which a laughing Ali was quick to respond, “After meeting me you thought the women of Pakistan are very beautiful?” “No no…Even the men,” she said laughingly.</p>
<p>But on a more serious note, “I met some of Ali’s friends in London. And even in Bangkok, there were so many fans. And I asked them, ‘where are you from? And they said Pakistan. I would never have guessed but I did not see any differences,” said Yami.</p>
<p>When asked about people taking offense to the jokes in the film, Yami replied, “I think you can’t make everyone happy. You may upset people. I’m a Brahmin and so many people say you’re snooty and head-high like Brahmins. But I think I’m pretty cool&#8230;I take it in good spirit,” she said.</p>
<p>Like any Indo-Pak conversation, the topic of cricket soon came up. “Yami said she had a crush on Shahid Afridi,” said Ali. “Yes, I was very young then and I used to love to watch him bowl. His hair would fly…and I remember the colour as well…it was brown,” blushed Yami.</p>
<p>The duo also crooned a number from their film together, ‘Palat Meri Jaan’. On being complemented for her voice and when asked why she hasn’t sang in the film, Yami said, “The good singing is a result of having co-starred with two singers. But I’m not really a singer or anywhere close to Ali’s level. I like to sing for myself.”</p>
<p>Ali on the other hand says he doesn’t have any immediate plans of launching a music album. “There isn’t much scope for independent singers and albums because of the commercial aspect of songs in films. So there isn’t much exposure for anything independent unless you pump crores of rupees into it, which is said considering the talent. But as soon as I see a space for something independent, I will release an album.”</p>
<p>Veteran actor Anupam Kher and his wife Kirron Kher will be playing Asha’s parents. This is the first time that the veteran actor couple will be seen onscreen together.</p>
<p>‘Total Siyappa’ will hit screens on March 7.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993826&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aliaarjun.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993904" alt="Alia Bhatt Arjun" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aliaarjun.jpg" /></a> Alia Bhatt sent Twitter invites of her &#8216;engagement&#8217; with co-star and rumoured beau Arjun Kapoor.
<p>In a new publicity gimmick by team of &#8217;2 States&#8217;, Bollywood actress Alia Bhatt sent Twitter invites of her &#8216;engagement&#8217; with co-star and rumoured beau Arjun Kapoor.</p>
<p>In an unusual promotion gimmick, Alia and Arjun will launch their first trailer on February 28 with an engagement ceremony. The actress tweeted, “I&#8217;m getting engageddddddd !!! ;)”</p>
<p>The fun-filled invite has named social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube as the &#8216;venue&#8217; of the &#8216;engagement&#8217; ceremony. And has also asked for &#8216;shagan&#8217; in form of film tickets!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I&#8217;m getting engageddddddd !!! ;) <a href="http://t.co/Kwa0RHVlyq">pic.twitter.com/Kwa0RHVlyq</a></p>
<p>— Alia Bhatt (@aliaa08) <a href="https://twitter.com/aliaa08/statuses/438613269821939712">February 26, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bollywood is setting a new trend at every step with its innovative publicity stunts. Earlier this year Salman Khan &#8216;pseudo&#8217; promoted &#8216;Jai Ho&#8217; vis-a-vis his appearances with leading Indian politician like Narendra Modi at the kite flying event.</p>
<p>Actress Vidya Balan also promoted her film &#8216;Kahaani&#8217; with a pregnant belly. And now Karan Johar and team have taken B-town promotions to a new level altogether.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are reports that Alia Bhatt is indeed dating her &#8217;2 States&#8217; co-star Arjun Kapoor. Alia had also said that Arjun holds a special place in her life.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993903&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sid480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993896" alt="Newcomer Sidharth Malhotra says he wants to be appreciated for his work than his looks." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sid480.jpg" /></a> Newcomer Sidharth Malhotra says he wants to be appreciated for his work than his looks.
<p>Newcomer Sidharth Malhotra says he wants to be appreciated for his work than his looks.</p>
<p>Sidharth made a successful acting debut with Karan Johar&#8217;s &#8216;Student of the year&#8217;. His next film, the recently released &#8216;Hasee Toh Phasee&#8217;, was also a hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am just a newcomer and at this juncture. I am craving for appreciation of my acting skills than looks and the numbers (collection) a film achieves at the box office). It is important to be accepted by the audience,&#8221; Sidharth told PTI.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not aiming to do a film that will give lot of money&#8230; I am not thinking about the business angle of a film. I am happy that in &#8216;Hasee Toh Phasee&#8217; people got convinced with my character and went beyond my looks and what I was wearing,&#8221; he said.<br />
On the view of some people that in &#8216;Hasee Toh Phasee&#8217;, the lead actress Parineeti Chopra outshone him with her performance, Sidharth says, &#8220;A film is a team effort&#8230;. It is not that only she was there in the film alone. Everybody worked towards the film. I am happy her work was also liked by people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The romantic comedy was produced by Johar and Anurag Kashyap&#8217;s Phantom. Released on February 7, the film directed by debutant director Vinil Mathew and has reportedly earned over Rs 30 crore.</p>
<p>On the day of the release, Sidharth was quite nervous as it was his first solo hero film.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important to have something interesting in romantic-comedy as this space is tapped several times on screen. For us luckily, the story clicked with the audience. Even the characters that we played were accepted,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Sidharth would be seen next in Mohit Suri&#8217;s &#8216;The Villian&#8217;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993892&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[In the new song from 'Queen' Kangana closely resembles the Tanu of her previous film.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993884&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kanganaqueen.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993886" alt="Kangana Queen" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kanganaqueen.jpg" /></a> In the new song from &#8216;Queen&#8217; Kangana closely resembles the Tanu of her previous film.
<p>Bollywood stylista Kanagana Ranaut is making headlines for her upcoming film &#8216;Queen&#8217;. But the new track – &#8216;Hungama&#8217; – released by the makers of the film, shows the film as yet another &#8216;Tanu Weds Manu&#8217;.</p>
<p>Considered to be Kangana Ranaut&#8217;s one of the best performances till date, &#8216;Queen&#8217; too sees Kangana as the uninhibited small town girl trying to find her lives meaning.</p>
<p>However, the slight twist in Kangana&#8217;s &#8216;Queen&#8217; saga is the fact that she goes on her honeymoon alone after being dumped at the altar to find a new self. This one too seems to be borrowed from &#8216;Sex and The City&#8217; film.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/4gtc5P5KZxA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>In the new song &#8216;Hungama Ho Gaya&#8217; remix, Kangana is flirtatious, funny and drunk. She closely resembles the Tanu of her previous film.</p>
<p>However, all said and done Kangana Ranaut&#8217;s &#8216;Queen&#8217; indeed looks promising. As Kangana puts up a great show in the song and the promos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kangana, who is otherwise in news for her dressing sense, has gone de-glam to fit the title role!</p>
<p>The film&#8217;s music is given by Amit Trivedi of &#8216;Lootera&#8217; fame. The film also stars Lisa Haydon and Rajkumar Rao in lead roles and is slated to release on March 7.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993884&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/highway4802.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989953" alt="Highway had released in approximately 700 screens." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/highway4802.jpg" /></a> Highway had released in approximately 700 screens.
<p>&#8216;Rockstar&#8217; director Imtiaz Ali&#8217;s &#8216;out of the box&#8217; film &#8216;Highway&#8217; has done a decent business of Rs 18.23 crore till now. One movie old Alia Bhatt and Randeep Hooda starrer &#8216;Highway&#8217; earned Rs 3.42 crore on its release day, Friday and Rs 10.57 crore over the weekend. It managed to collect Rs 2.24 crore on Monday.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/highway-review-alia-bhatt-has-walked-past-her-babydoll-cosmetic-debut-in-student-of-the-year/">Read &#8216;Highway&#8217; review</a></p>
<p>Film critic and trade analyst Taran Adarsh tweeted &#8216;Highway&#8217;s business in India, “#Highway Fri 3.42 cr, Sat 4.82 cr, Sun 5.75 cr, Mon 2.24 cr, Tue 2 cr. Total: ₹ 18.23 cr nett. India biz only.”. The slightly off-beat film &#8216;Highway&#8217; fared not too badly through the weekend and on Monday.</p>
<p>The film had released in approximately 700 screens.<br />
Alia Bhatt was appreciated for her work in the film by everyone in the film industry, including her father Mahesh Bhatt and noted lyricist Javed Akhtar, who had compared her with Nargis and Meena Kumari.<br />
“Milestones -Nargis in Mother India Meena kumari in saheb bibi.. Nutan in BANDANI Shabana in Arth and now Alia Bhatt in Highway,” said Javed Akhtar.</p>
<p>Indian Express reviewer Shubhra Gupta said, “this is perhaps the most picturesque road movie I have seen coming out of Bollywood, but the story struggles with its twin threads and uneven tone. ‘Highway’ is a patchy ride, with the occasional high spot.”<br />
“Alia Bhatt has walked past her babydoll cosmetic debut in ‘Student Of The Year’ for a demanding role. Her Veera is effortlessly fresh-faced, absurdly young, scrubbed and vulnerable. But the sense of terror and dread that would make the character credible is never fully present,” Shubhra said about Alia.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993883&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Soha Ali Khan still cannot figure out why she opted to make her debut with 2004 film &#8216;Dil Maange More&#8217;, which had three actresses in the lead.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old actress, who was new to Bollywood at that time, said it was a terrible decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I chose to make my debut with &#8216;Dil Maange More&#8217;. The film had three leading ladies – me, Tulip Joshi and Ayesha Takia – opposite Shahid Kapoor. I was fresh to Bollywood at that time because I had just come back from England and had no clue about hero-heroine dynamics in India,&#8221; Soha said here while discussing the portrayal of women in cinema and TV at an event.</p>
<p>Soha said she took the film because she found her character progressive because she dumps her boyfriend over her career.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was asked a character out of three, I chose Neha because she is ambitious. At an young age of 21 she chooses her career over boyfriend. It was again a wrong decision taken by me because in Hindi films, actresses keep their partner over any other thing,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>But the &#8216;War Chod Na Yaar&#8217; actress is happy that cinema has changed over the period and she gets to play strong characters.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993869&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sidharth_malhotra480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993731" alt="Sidharth Malhotra: I am in touch with reality. I would be kicked out long back if I weren't." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sidharth_malhotra480.jpg" /></a> Sidharth Malhotra: I am in touch with reality. I would be kicked out long back if I weren&#8217;t.
<p>&#8216;Hasee Toh Phasee&#8217; actor Sidharth Malhotra talks about his recently released flick, his mentor and his dreams.</p>
<p><b>So, instead of asking you how are you feeling after a thunderous response to &#8216;Hasee Toh Phasee&#8217;, let me ask &#8211; Are you happy with your bank balance?</b></p>
<p><b></b>(Laughs) I am pretty happy with the way my money is in the banks. But you&#8217;ll have to ask my manager as she is answering most of my calls for work. I can&#8217;t complain. Second film is important and it was very positive. For me it was getting beyond that &#8216;good looking boy&#8217; thing. Audiences had the impression that most male models can&#8217;t act but I am here to prove them wrong and I have with &#8216;Hasee Toh Phasee&#8217;.</p>
<p><b>Has the feedback been different compared to your first movie?</b><br />
Yes it has been different. People who I don&#8217;t even know have been pleasantly surprised by seeing me far more comfortable, at ease and far more relaxed. The &#8216;Kukkad&#8217; image has gone for a toss (laughs). They didn&#8217;t expect this. They observe the minutest of the nuances. It&#8217;s an amazing feeling.</p>
<p><b>And your first solo release too.</b><br />
Oh yes! It was, wasn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s a big relief when someone can tolerate you for two and a half hours, holding the scene on your own, delivering dialogues, etc. There is an audience who can see me for two hours plus and I am content. It&#8217;s the choices that I make from here on that will really matter.</p>
<p><b>Your contemporaries, one of them being Ranbir Kapoor, are making different choices of movies. Will you be treading the same path as well?</b><br />
If I were given the option I&#8217;d love to. But I haven&#8217;t reached that point in my professional life that I can approach top directors to cast me in their movies. I can only choose from what I get. I am lucky that films like &#8216;Hasee Toh Phasee&#8217; and &#8216;The Villain&#8217; came this early in my career. This year will surprise people even further. I don&#8217;t think I need to look what I looked in &#8216;Student of the Year&#8217;. Hats off to Ranbir for doing &#8216;Barfi&#8217; with no dialogues at all. No young actor would&#8217;ve agreed to do that I&#8217;m sure. Even &#8216;Rocket Singh&#8217;. To play a Sardarji throughout the film with beard was a shocker. He was lucky to have scripts like that. I am struggling to get content like that. Once you become monotonous, you becoming boring as an actor.</p>
<p><b>Do you approach your mentor Karan Johar for vital decisions regarding your movies?</b><br />
If I call him, he&#8217;s always available to give his inputs unbiased. But even with &#8216;Hasee Toh Phasee&#8217; he told me to read the script first and then asked for my opinion. He wants me, Varun and Alia to make our own mistakes. He hasn&#8217;t forced us for anything. When I wasn&#8217;t comfortable doing a Dharma Productions movie offered to me. He respected my decision for not doing it.</p>
<p><b>Doesn&#8217;t Adah Sharma come across as a girl who is beyond the stereotypical?</b><br />
You guessed it right (laughs). How do you know that? Adah was cool and super fun. I remember the first few workshops that we did together and Parineeti and I found out that she has a great knack of crying without putting glycerin and that too from one eye. It freaked us out. It was an emotional scene and we were reading our lines with our director. She&#8217;s amazing with tears and is superbly gifted. She used it really well in the wedding portion of the film. She loves pets too and her wacky purses, one of them I think she gifted to Parineeti.</p>
<p><b>Actors dream of a big debut and even bigger movies. You&#8217;ve achieved that bit but are you ever afraid of failure at this given point?</b><br />
First let me do more work to be afraid of. I don&#8217;t have anything to hold back to the thought of &#8216;I&#8217;ve done some dozen movies&#8217;. I am still renting out places in Mumbai. That&#8217;s my fear. I want my own pad (laughs). I hang out with friends and that&#8217;s when I see no sense of fear. It&#8217;s called freedom.</p>
<p><b>Are you in touch with reality or you live in your own bubble as an actor?</b><br />
Of course I am in touch with reality. I would be kicked out long back if I weren&#8217;t. There is Twitter, Facebook, etc. I cannot pretend or fake anything. We are playing different characters every time and audience should never compare our on screen persona with our off screen personality. When I was assisting on films, Shah Rukh Khan was one of the most down to earth men I had ever met on set. He didn&#8217;t make an entry from a chopper with a suit on like he does on screen.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993726&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dishkiyaaon480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993716" alt="Sanamit Talawar had initially envisioned 'Dishkiyaoon' as a 15 minutes short film. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dishkiyaaon480.jpg" /></a> Sanamjit Talwar had initially envisioned &#8216;Dishkiyaoon&#8217; as a 15 minutes short film.
<p>&#8216;Dishkiyaoon&#8217;, it was for a paltry sum of Rs. 5000. And no, it wasn&#8217;t Harman Baweja who was given this royal treatment. Instead, it was the very talented Prashant Narayanan who was roped in for this sum and brought on board for an all important part of Mota Tony.</p>
<p>Remembers Sanamjit Talwar, debutant writer-director of the film, &#8220;That was back then in 2011 when I had first envisioned &#8216;Dishkiyaoon&#8217; as a 15 minutes short film. I needed an actor for this part of Mota Tony, which was quite prominent even in the short film. Since Prashant is a friend, I could just tell him that he had to be in my film. However, I didn&#8217;t have any money on me then but really wanted to shoot the film. Poor guy, he agreed and just said ki &#8216;Yaar, kuch toh paisa de kyunki even I don&#8217;t have money&#8217;. I said that &#8216;Chal, mere paas 5000 bucks hai so you keep this. That was the first signing amount for my film.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Prashant on board, he went along hunting for an actor to play the lead role of Vicky Kartoos. Harman Baweja gave his nod of approval, though insisting that Sanamjit make a full length feature film instead. Everything fell in place and rest, as they say, is history, what with Shilpa Shetty, Raj Kundra and Sunil Lulla coming on board.</p>
<p>&#8220;However Prashant place was intact in the film. His part too was further fleshed out in added detail to go with a two hour feature film,&#8221; says Sanamjit, &#8220;So now; Mota Tony&#8217;s part is all the more &#8216;mota&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the money part, there were a few more zeroes added to Rs. 5000 now. &#8220;Of course I let him keep that 5000 with him,&#8221; winks Sanamjit, &#8220;That&#8217;s my gratitude to him for being the first on my film.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were other interesting casting decisions made in the process of putting together this action-drama-thriller that has a gangster backdrop to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like for example this part of &#8216;Rocky Chu$ia&#8217; is quite interesting too. I was facing some difficulty in getting just the right actor for the part. This is where my producer Shilpa Shetty suggested that I try out Anand Tiwari. To begin with I was shocked as he came across as someone so different from my imagination. Mujhe pehle laga nahi that woh character lag paayega. However, the way he has performed is so fabulous that today I feel no one else could have done it so brilliantly,&#8221; says Sanamjit about the youngster who was fabulous as one of the three leads in last year&#8217;s &#8216;Go Goa Gone&#8217;.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this was one of the only casting suggestion by Shilpa as right from Prashant to the main lead Harman Baweja, the actors were Sanamjit&#8217;s choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;There couldn&#8217;t have been a more hassle free set up as Shilpa just gave me a free hand,&#8221; says Sanamjit fondly, &#8220;She never asked me about the whys and the hows. She has been a fantastic producer.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993713&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Troubled star Justin Bieber shared &#8216;Broken&#8217;, which is his first song since his January arrest in Miami Beach.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old singer, who was arrested in January for driving under the influence and drag racing, recently tweeted a link to &#8216;Broken&#8217;, said the Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<p>The song, which features rapper Blake Kelly, has lyrics like &#8220;they&#8217;re persistent, trying to break me down / I cannot be broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>The track comes weeks after the 19-year-old singer was arrested in Miami Beach on January 23, when police who suspected he was drag racing stopped him. Bieber has pleaded not guilty to charges of DUI.</p>
<p>Though a March 3 trial had been scheduled.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993686&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/riyamoonmoon.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993692" alt="Moon Moon Riya" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/riyamoonmoon.jpg" /></a> Moon Moon Sen and Riya Sen are playing out their mother-daughter relationship on screen for the first time.
<p>Moon Moon Sen and Riya Sen are playing out their mother-daughter relationship on screen for the first time.</p>
<p>Both are excited to see how the idea shapes up in the film &#8220;Kolkata Calling&#8221;, which is a collage of three stories set in the 70s and 80s, directed by Mainak Bhowmik.</p>
<p>Moon Moon said that Mainak was persistent that they did the scenes together.</p>
<p>&#8220;We two feature in one of the three stories and Raima appears in another story. So you might dub it as a film where all three of us are part of it. She said that she had earlier done ad shoots with Riya and a telefilm with Raima.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, this is the first time we have fully fleshed out characters. Maybe I am not exactly happy with my role, but the youth will identify with the subject,&#8221; Moon Moon said.</p>
<p>She said she would like to do new challenging roles, provided the young group of directors want her.</p>
<p>Riya, who had earned critical acclaim for her role in Rituparno Ghosh&#8217;s &#8216;Noukadubi&#8217;, said, &#8220;Maa has three scenes in the film and they are intense ones. Scene-wise the figure may be small but each frame is detailed and embedded with the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riya said the Sen women didn&#8217;t think about doing a film together, but since it is Mainak&#8217;s story, they agreed because he treated women&#8217;s issues and relationships very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we understand each other, Maa wishes to be around whenever I shoot for a film,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Riya&#8217;s role in the latest film of Srijit Mukherjee &#8216;Jaatiswar&#8217; also won praise from critics. &#8220;I enjoy the new innings in Bengali films. Happy to see how different subjects and portrayals of characters are being appreciated and I hope we will also be applauded as mother-daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Riya said that &#8216;Kolkata Calling&#8217; was not entirely a retro film. &#8220;It is a mixture where there are contemporary references and I play a 22-year old.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993689&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/anubhavsinha.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993682" alt="Anubhav SRK" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/anubhavsinha.jpg" /></a> Anubhav Sinha is gearing up to direct a film soon which will either be a love story, political drama.
<p>Filmmaker Anubhav Sinha is gearing up to direct a film soon which will either be a love story, political drama or a thriller.</p>
<p>Sinha, who had last directed Shah Rukh Khan starrer &#8216;Ra.One&#8217;, is ready with three scripts and he is likely to start work on one by this year end.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have three scripts ready, one is a love story, other is a political film and the last one is a thriller. I am yet to take a call which I would like to direct first. Hopefully by the end of this year I would direct a film,&#8221; Sinha told PTI.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had taken break from direction for two years or so as I wanted to focus on my production company and the films that we are producing. Now the two years are ending and I am ready to direct again,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Except from the script, nothing else is finalised including casting. There were reports that Sinha and Shah Rukh might team up for the sequel of &#8216;Ra.One&#8217;, but the filmmaker says nothing is decided yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would love to work with Shah Rukh again. We (SRK and me) keep talking about it (sequel of &#8216;Ra.One&#8217;) but nothing concrete is happening. We need to have an exciting idea for it,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8216;Ra.One&#8217; (2011), a science fiction superhero film directed by Sinha, had Shah Rukh, Arjun Rampal, Kareena Kapoor and others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sinha is quite excited about the release of Madhuri Dixit-Juhi Chawla starrer &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217;. The film, produced by Sinha under his banner Benaras Media Works, releases on March 7.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993672&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Superstar Amitabh Bachchan is back as the friendly ghost in ‘Bhoothnath Returns’. The first trailer of the horror comedy-drama flick looks promising and is sure going to be a hit among the kids.</p>
<p>The trailer gives us a glimpse of the friendly ghost ‘Bhoothnath’ who does his best to frighten children. This time around, the trailer of the film, which is a sequel to ‘Bhoothnath’, reveals that the ghost is on a mission – to contest the elections and win against the corrupt politician played by none other than Boman Irani.</p>
<p>With the help of his little friend played by child actor Parth Bhalerao, Bhoothnath goes about his election campaign, doing his best to win over the people, even though they can’t see him.</p>
<p>The film promises to be a fun-filled laughter riot of mayhem and mischief. Directed by Nitesh Tiwari, ‘Bhoothnath Returns’ is slated to hit theatres on April 11.</p>
<p>Shah Rukh Khan, who was seen in the prequel, will also be making a cameo in ‘Bhoothnath Returns’ along with Ranbir Kapoor.</p>
<p>Boman Irani shared the trailer on Twitter, saying, “The Bhoothnath Returns trailer is out! Hope you like it Mr Bachchan is a colossus of energy &amp; young Parth is a delight.”</p>

<p>Bollywood actors Salman Khan and Suniel Shetty inaugurated a boating club at Gangapur Dam premises in the presence of Maharashtra Public Works Department Minister Chhagan Bhujbal and his son Sameer Bhujbal who is an NCP MP, as well as state water resources minister Suniel Tatkare.</p>
<p>However, nature lovers from Nashik and other parts of the state have opposed the project, since Gangpur Dam, which is also the main source of water for Nashik city is likely to get polluted due to the boating club, and also disturb the migration of various species of birds, local nature club sources said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993497&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/amitabhranbir.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993490" alt="Amitabh Ranbir" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/amitabhranbir.jpg" /></a> Ranbir Kapoor will be seen making a special appearance in Amitabh Bachchan-starrer &#8216;Bhootnath Returns&#8217;.
<p>Megastar Amitabh Bachchan said Ranbir Kapoor is more popular than him and wishes to work with the actor, even if it is for a brief role.</p>
<p>Ranbir Kapoor will be seen making a special appearance in Amitabh Bachchan-starrer &#8216;Bhootnath Returns&#8217;.</p>
<p>Ranbir Kapoor has already shot for his cameo in the supernatural-comedy film. He will be seen playing himself, as actor Ranbir Kapoor, in the film.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ranbirbigb.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993493" alt="ranbirbigb" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ranbirbigb.jpg" /></a> Ranbir Kapoor on the sets of Amitabh Bachchan&#8217;s &#8216;Bhootnath Returns&#8217;.
<p>&#8220;I dont have a scene or a shot with him. I hope we can work together some day in a film. I would be ok doing even a small role in his film. He is very popular &#8230;than me,&#8221; Amitabh Bachchan told reporters here at the trailer launch of Bhootnath Returns.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is always great to work with younger actors&#8230;one learns a lot from them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Apparently, Ranbir Kapoor makes his entry at an important point and his character is somewhat crucial to the flow of the film.</p>
<p>Shah Rukh Khan, who played the role of Aditya Sharma child Banku&#8217;s father in Bhootnath, will be seen reprising his role in the sequel. He too has a cameo in the film and his character will be a continuation to the one that he played in Bhootnath (2008).</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan plays the role of a friendly ghost in the movie. &#8220;In the first part my character goes to heaven and then he comes back to earth and how he meets this child called Akhrot is what the story is about,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan will shake a leg with composer-singer Honey Singh in a rap song for the film, which is yet to be shot. The event saw Big B playing card tricks and showing some magic to the media.</p>
<p>&#8216;Bhootnath Returns&#8217; is a sequel to 2008 horror-comedy &#8216;Bhootnath&#8217;, which is being directed by Nitesh Tiwari and produced by T-Series &amp; BR Films.</p>
<p>Bhoothnath Returns is scheduled to release on April 11 and stars Big B, Boman Irani and Marathi actress Usha Jadhav in the lead.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993489&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sharmilasoha.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993486" alt="Sharmila Soha" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sharmilasoha.jpg" /></a> “Women should be portrayed intelligently in today&#8217;s time,&#8221; Sharmila said.
<p>ctress Sharmila Tagore said that content on the small screen is still stereotypical about women as they are mostly shown in kitchen dynamics.</p>
<p>Sharmila, 69, said that none of the female protagonist on the small-screen shows are working irrespective of their modern settings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Content of TV is stereotypical. Their shows still revolve around son preference and kitchen dynamics. No women go for work. There is a complete absence of working women from TV. Today, every women is doing job and managing her family too. Women should be portrayed intelligently in today&#8217;s time,&#8221; Sharmila said here.</p>
<p>Sharmila and her actress daughter Soha Ali Khan were in the city to lend support to veteran playwright Feroz Abbas Khan for his new TV show &#8216;Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon&#8217;, to be telecast on Doordarshan from March 8.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have watched the two episodes of the show and I am impressed with it. So, I decided to support the show. I can see a lot of research done by Feroz, who is my good friend. I have seen all his work right from &#8216;Tumhari Amrita&#8217;&#8230; Feroz has always been very committed towards his craft,&#8221; Sharmila said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon&#8217;, conceived by the Population Foundation of India (PFI), will address practices such as sex selection, early marriage, early and repeated pregnancies and domestic violence in Indian society.</p>
<p>Soha said that male actors too should lend their weight behind women-centric shows because they can create much difference in a patriarchal society.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will also tell bhai (Saif Ali Khan) and Kareena (Kapoor) to support shows like this because I feel a male voice brings much change in our patriarchal society. I<br />
personally believe that I have been a privileged girl child. I had the liberty to choose my career and partner,&#8221; Soha said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon&#8217; is based on the concept of popular South African TV series &#8216;Soul City&#8217;. The series mirrors the real-life stories of social and development challenges faced by poor communities everywhere in the country.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993482&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Director Sohail Khan will be back as judge on &#8216;Comedy Circus&#8217;, replacing his actor-filmmaker brother Arbaaz Khan.</p>
<p>Sohail, 43, who was originally judging &#8216;Comedy Circus&#8217;, had opted out of the show as he was set to direct Salman Khan starrer &#8216;Jai Ho&#8217;, which released in January this<br />
year. Arbaaz had then replaced his brother as the judge on the show.</p>
<p>Now, Arbaaz is taking a break for his upcoming home production film &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217;, starring Sonam Kapoor.</p>
<p>Sohail, who was originally judging the show, will take over, sources said. &#8216;Comedy Circus&#8217; is a reality-based comedy show which brings television actors to perform with professional comedian partners.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993021&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Film actor Aamir Khan laid a wreath and paid rich tribute to the statue of &#8216;mountain man&#8217; Dasrath Manjhi at his Gehlaur village in Muhra block of Gaya, in Bihar.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/aamir-khan-visits-dasrath-manjhis-family-ahead-of-satyamev-jayate-2/">In Pics: Aamir Khan visits Dasrath Manjhi’s family ahead of ‘Satyamev Jayate 2′</a></p>
<p>Manjhi was a poor landless labourer, who created a road 360 feet long and 30 feet wide single-handedly with 22 years of labour from 1960 to 1982 to give his village easy access.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/what-to-expect-from-aamir-khans-satyamev-jayate-2/">Also Read: What to expect from Aamir Khan’s ‘Satyamev Jayate 2′</a></p>
<p>&#8220;This man is a life story of love and known world over for his commitment toward his wife,&#8221; said the Bollywood actor, who will start season two of his popular TV show &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217; on March 2 with Manjhi&#8217;s tale.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aamir-12.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993020" alt="aamir-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/aamir-12.jpg" /></a> Aamir met Manjhi&#8217;s family and promised that his team would visit them in the next three days to offer assistance. (PTI)
<p>&#8220;I salute his courage and determination,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making a road through difficult terrain after cutting rocks for nearly two decades reflects his determination, love and commitment toward his wife,&#8221; the actor said.</p>
<p>Manjhi, who died seven years ago, gave villagers easier access to Atri block with hospital facilities.</p>
<p>Aamir Khan, 48, who has given hits like &#8217;3 Idiots&#8217;, &#8216;Tare Zameen Par&#8217; and &#8216;Lagaan&#8217;, met Manjhi&#8217;s family and promised that his team would visit them in the next three days to offer assistance.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993016&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Few Minutes of Yoga&#8230; Keeps the Sxiness alive!”
<p>Model-turned-actress Poonam Pandey, who became famous rather in famous post her decision to strip if India won the world cup, certainly knows how to remain in news.</p>
<p>The actress, whose website was hacked recently, has drawn inspiration from Hollywood celebrity Kim Kardashian and posted a few explicit selfies on her Twitter handle.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Nasha&#8217; actress posted topless photos of her, saying, “Early Morning. .. Few Minutes of Yoga&#8230; Keeps the Sxiness alive!”</p>
<p>The wannabe actress, further &#8216;demanded&#8217; 500 or 1000 tweets to post new photos.</p>
<p>Poonam Pandey tweeted, “Want More Pix? &#8230;. Will Post More after I See 10000 RETWEETS for all this Pix I Twitted earlier”</p>
<p>However, here again Poonam Pandey&#8217;s &#8216;charm&#8217; failed to yield the desired results. Her raunchy images managed to get a mere 200 shares.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993002&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lilette Dubey and Richard Gere are shooting romantic scenes together in Rajasthan for &#8216;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel 2&#8242;.</p>
<p>Richard Gere is eager to learn more about Bollywood. According to a source from the unit, he has even asked for a Bollywood-styled romantic song to be incorporated in the screen romance with his co-star Lilette Dubey.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes sense to have a romantic number filmed on them. Lilette plays a very attractive middle-aged Indian who runs a run-down hotel where Gere descends as a guest. Romance blossoms between the two. They are now thinking of incorporating an old romantic Hindi song to accentuate their togetherness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gere enjoys Indian food and with Lilette&#8217;s help he is becoming familiar with the local Rajasthani dishes.</p>
<p>Says a member of the crew, &#8220;Richard loves the local cuisine. But he is wary of the spices and mirchi. Lilette and her two daughters Neha and Ira helped him pick the dishes with the minimum masala. The three ladies have also taken Gere sightseeing in Udaipur.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lilette Dubey is all praise for her co-star. &#8220;My scenes with Richard are coming out well. He&#8217;s warm and friendly with everyone including my daughters. When my girls came to visit me here in Udaipur, Richard was so charming.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992989&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/2states480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992984" alt="Alia was asked to play her part as normally as the real-life Mrs. Bhagat." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/2states480.jpg" /></a> Alia was asked to play her part as normally as the real-life Mrs. Bhagat.
<p>South Indian protagonists in Hindi films, right down to Deepika Padukone in Chennai Express have followed Mehmood&#8217;s role model in Padosan.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about to change.</p>
<p>Even as her performance in Highway gets her raves, Alia Bhatt is all set to wow critics and fans with her performance as a Tamilian wife in Sajid Nadiadwala and Karan Johar&#8217;s first joint production 2 States.</p>
<p>Apparently, the role of the young Tamilian wife is based on writer Chetan Bhagat&#8217;s own wife. Alia was asked to play her part as normally as the real-life Mrs. Bhagat.</p>
<p>Shedding light on the triumph that awaits Alia around the corner, producer Sajid Nadiadwala says, &#8220;Alia has played the first non-caricatural South Indian character in our films. Normally when we show South Indians in our films they have thick accent, and if it&#8217;s a woman from the South she will have gajra in her hair and will go &#8216;Aiyo&#8217; every five minutes. Alia does none of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two-film old actress was told to play the character without the props of broad character traits.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do I explain this? Alia is Tamilian and she even talks in Tamil. But she behaves like a normal city wife,&#8221; says Sajid.</p>
<p>Apparently Alia was asked to strictly not do a Deepika Padukone kind of &#8216;bokwas&#8217; accent from Chennai Express.</p>
<p>Alia admits it was difficult to not lapse into caricature while doing a South Indian character. &#8220;I was not allowed to be culture-specific in 2 States in my body-language or my accent. Yes, I am a Tamilian in 2 States. But I don&#8217;t make a show of my regional roots. It is tough because when you are not resorting to speech and behaviourial props, you have no handy tools to give personality to your character.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992981&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/soorajpancholi1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992897" alt="Sooraj pancholi" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/soorajpancholi1.jpg" /></a> Sooraj pancoli is shooting for Nikhil Advani&#8217;s &#8216;Hero&#8217; with Suniel Shetty&#8217;s daughter Aathiya.
<p>Unlike Sunil Shetty who made it a point to be present for his lovely daughter Aathiya&#8217;s first day of shooting, Aathiya&#8217;s co-star Sooraj Pancholi preferred to do it alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want my parents there. And my father (actor Aditya Pancholi) didn&#8217;t want to be there to see me start shooting. He thought I&#8217;d get self-conscious if he came to watch me. But I had my own reasons for not wanting my parents to see me give my first shot. I want them to watch me in the complete film, not while shooting it. I want to make them proud and happy,&#8221; says Sooraj.</p>
<p>Surprisingly there was no nervousness on the first day&#8217;s shooting.</p>
<p>Says Sooraj, &#8220;We shot at Kala Ghoda. All the butterflies in my stomach disappeared when my director Nikhil Advani said, &#8216;Action&#8217;. It was as if I had come home. All my anxieties vanished.&#8221;</p>
<p>Advani started the shooting of Hero with one of the toughest sequences in the film featuring Aathiya, Sooraj and the four theatre actors who play his buddies. The unit now moves to Manali where Sooraj would shoot some heavy-duty action sequences.</p>
<p>He says shooting has swept away all the pain he went through when in a shocking turn of events, Sooraj&#8217;s girlfriend Jiah Khan committed suicide. &#8220;Preparing for the shooting of Hero and now actually facing the camera has been therapeutic for me. I feel motivated, almost born-again. My experiences in the past year have been too painful to even share with my parents. I feel pain is something one has to cope with and come to terms with by oneself.&#8221;</p>
<p>A month in jail has made Sooraj a stronger person. &#8220;All my life I was a loner. At age 14 I left my parent&#8217;s home to stay with my grandparents. And when they passed away I lived on my own. I still do. I only have my two dogs for company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sooraj&#8217;s director Nikhil Advani says the experience of being thrown into jail has added a substantial emotional quotient to the young actor&#8217;s character. In the film Sooraj&#8217;s character goes to jail. And Nikhil would be tapping into Sooraj&#8217;s experiences to lend a sense of lived-in authenticity to the character&#8217;s experiences.</p>
<p>Sooraj seems surprisingly okay with the idea of applying his painful experiences to his role. &#8220;I will not only use my experiences I can also provide helpful suggestions on what life is like in there. Imprisonment especially when you know you are innocent is a life-changing experience. I was forced to re-examine my entire life and priorities. Today I know exactly who matter to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sooraj confesses to being a big fan of his mother Zarina Wahab&#8217;s work. &#8220;I especially like her in Chit Chor and Gharonda. She is a fantastic actress and an even better mother. She has kept our family together over all these years.&#8217;</p>
<p>Though he lives away from them Sooraj is now closer to his family than ever before. &#8220;The crisis that I went through has brought us closer together than before. I am closer to my sister now. I have lunch with her almost every day. And we talk a lot more. As for friends, I am not much into socializing. I&#8217;ve just one friend Karan Joshi who is not part of the film industry. All through the experiences that I went through he stood by me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sooraj says he doesn&#8217;t think about the nightmarish experiences any more. &#8220;I&#8217;ve not forgotten what I have gone through. I never will. No one can forget this kind of experience. But I&#8217;ve put it all in the back of my mind. My entire focus is on building a career, on Hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pondering over his life Sooraj feels there is no scope for another relationship after Jiah for a very long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a day passes by when I don&#8217;t think about her,&#8221; Sooraj says softly.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992884&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/alia4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992799" alt=" Javed Akhtar compared the 'Highway' actress Alia Bhatt with yesteryears talented beauties." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/alia4801.jpg" /></a> Javed Akhtar compared the &#8216;Highway&#8217; actress Alia Bhatt with yesteryears talented beauties.
<p>Bollywood actress Preity Zinta is all praises for Alia Bhatt for her role of Veera in Imtiaz Ali&#8217;s &#8216;Highway&#8217;.</p>
<p>Alia Bhatt had played the role of young Preity Zinta in her father Mahesh Bhatt&#8217;s &#8216;Sangharsh&#8217;.</p>
<p>Preity Zinta took to twitter to shower praises on the cast and crew of film, “Must watch #Highway 4 @RandeepHooda &amp; @aliaa08 spectacular performances ! Definitely Imtiaz&#8217;s best &amp; most honest film. Don&#8217;t miss it Folks !”</p>
<p>Preity Zinta also added, “I still remember seeing @aliaa08 as a little cutie on the Sets of Sangharsh playing mini me. This one will be the Brightest star 4 ever :-)”</p>
<p>Joining the club, poet, lyricist and scriptwriter Javed Akhtar compared Alia Bhatt with yesteryears talented beauties like Nargis in &#8216;Mother India&#8217;, Shabana Azmi in &#8216;Arth&#8217; and so on.<br />
Javed Akhtar tweeted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Milestones -Nargis in Mother India Meena kumari in saheb bibi.. Nutan in BANDANI Shabana in Arth and now Alia Bhatt in Highway.</p>
<p>— Javed Akhtar (@Javedakhtarjadu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Javedakhtarjadu/statuses/436905754247692288">February 21, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Javed Akhtar&#8217;s actress wife Shabana Azmi also took to Twitter to praise the new shining star Alia Bhatt and said Alia is a mix of vulnerability and insouciance.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Alia Bhatt is such a mix of vulnerability n insouciance she tears at your heart in Highway. Randeep not a false note.Imtiaz Ali take a bow</p>
<p>— Azmi Shabana (@AzmiShabana) <a href="https://twitter.com/AzmiShabana/statuses/436902276293492737">February 21, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The road drama film which released on February 21, has made a slow start at the Box Office, but has received good reviews for the critics. Alia Bhatt has specially prooved her mettle as the young Veera, who finds freedom in bondage after being kidnapped by an uncouth Mahavir Bhatti (Randeep Hooda).</p>
<p>The Indian Express reviewer Shubhra Gupta said, “Alia Bhatt has walked past her babydoll cosmetic debut in ‘Student Of The Year’ for a demanding role. Her Veera is effortlessly fresh-faced, absurdly young, scrubbed and vulnerable.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992795&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Actress Lupita Nyong&#8217;o has denied dating rumours with fellow Oscar nominee Jared Leto.</p>
<p>The &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; star, who is garnering much praise for her work in film, jokingly said on &#8216;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&#8217; that Miley Cyrus was the reason behind their break up, reported Radar online.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re actually in tabloids as well, which means you&#8217;ve really made it cause there&#8217;s rumours that you and Jared Leto are together,&#8221; DeGeneres joked. &#8221;Ah, but I thought Miley Cyrus broke us up,&#8221; Nyong&#8217;o responded, laughing. &#8220;That was the last thing I heard,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Reports about Nyongo&#8217;s supposed relationship with the &#8217;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217; star were thwarted when rumours began to surface that Leto was actually hooking up with Cyrus.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy because when I read these rumours, I mean, they&#8217;re so detailed that even I start to question if they&#8217;re true or not,&#8221; Nyong&#8217;o told the host.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992648&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kanye West wants to collaborate with James Blake, who he considers his favorite artist, for<br />
the follow-up of his 2013 album Yeezus.</p>
<p>The London rapper revealed that West, 36, had approached him and expressed his desire to make music together, reported Ace Showbiz. &#8221;I have been in contact with him,&#8221; Blake said.</p>
<p>The London-based singer/producer, however, wanted to collaborate with West if they could sit and work together in the same studio.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, the way that I like to work is bare bones and personal. I think because Kanye&#8217;s such an accomplished producer, if I was to work with him, then I think we could do something together, and just together, you know?&#8221; Blake said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992614&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/leonardo4801.jpg" /></a> Leondaro DiCaprio said director Martin Scorsese was sure that Daniel Day-Lewis would perfectly fit for the role in &#8216;Gangs of New York&#8217;. (Reuters)
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio has revealed that he spent weeks trying to persuade Daniel Day-Lewis to take the role of a vicious thug in &#8216;Gangs of New York&#8217; (GON).</p>
<p>The 39-year-old actor said that he had to convince Day-Lewis to come out of retirement for the film because director Martin Scorsese was sure that he would perfectly fit for the role, Daily Express reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to his brownstone (house) and sort of knocked on the door and he opened the door&#8230; He goes, &#8216;Shall we walk?&#8217; And I go, &#8216;OK&#8217;. We started walking through Central Park and he didn&#8217;t say anything to me for the first couple of minutes, so I said, &#8216;Alright, I&#8217;m not gonna say anything to him either&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we kind of walked in silence for about 10 minutes through Central Park&#8230; We sat down and we started talking about acting. I immediately asked him, I said, &#8216;Look, there&#8217;s a role of a gangster in turn-of-the-century New York, who&#8217;s a butcher, who carries butcher knives with a top hat and a moustache in a Martin Scorsese movie. Who in their right mind wouldn&#8217;t do this?,&#8217;&#8221; DiCaprio said.</p>
<p>Day-Lewis was not convinced and it took a dinner date with DiCaprio and his friend Tobey Maguire to eventually win him round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We went out to dinner&#8230; and it was actually Tobey who said to him, &#8216;Y&#8217;know, when somebody has a talent like yours, it&#8217;s almost their responsibility to do it, to get back in the<br />
saddle&#8217;. I think he slightly disagreed with him at first, but eventually, thank God, he said yes.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992596&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8216;Jimmy&#8217; star Mimoh says his father Mithun Chakraborty was a style-changer and no one can copy him.</p>
<p>&#8220;None can copy dad. He has his own trademark style and whatever he had done that became a style statement for the youth,&#8221; Mimoh, a.k.a Mahaakshay, told PTI after walking the ramp for the first time.</p>
<p>Sharing his debut ramp experience, he said, &#8220;I was nervous and trying to remain calm. But I must say acting before the camera is tougher than walking the ramp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Acting is a tough job as you have to captivate the audience for two hours. On ramp, it&#8217;s like gone in 60 seconds,&#8221; said Mimoh, who was the show-stopper in Manoviraj Khosla&#8217;s show themed on urban youth and celebrations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fashion for me is confidence, as long as you carry it off well,&#8221; the Rocky actor said on the sidelines of the &#8216;Kingfisher Ultra Bengal Fashion Week&#8217;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992591&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kanganaranaut1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992588" alt="Kangana Ranaut" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kanganaranaut1.jpg" /></a> Kangana Ranaut has said that two of her films &#8216;Ungli&#8217; and &#8216;I Love NY&#8217; have been canned.
<p>Actress Kangana Ranaut has said that two of her films &#8216;Ungli&#8217; and &#8216;I Love NY&#8217; have been canned but she is not disappointed about it.</p>
<p>&#8216;I Love New Year&#8217;, a romantic-comedy directed by Radhika Rao and Vinay Sapru, stars Sunny Deol and Kangana. The film was initially to be released in February last year, then it got pushed to April, to September and later December the same year, but did not hit the screens.</p>
<p>The exact reason for the delay was not known, but it was reportedly shelved due to the poor response to its trailer and not so good outcome of Sunny&#8217;s last few films at the box office.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/kangana-ranaut-takes-queen-to-indias-got-talent/">Photos: Kangana Ranaut takes ‘Queen’ to ‘India’s Got Talent’</a></p>
<p>Her another project, Karan Johar&#8217;s home production &#8216;Ungli&#8217;, starring Emraan Hashmi, Sanjay Dutt, Neha Dhupia, Randeep Hooda and others and directed by Rensil D&#8217;Silva, was earlier expected to release in 2013.</p>
<p>Though earlier Karan Johar had tweeted that &#8216;Ungli&#8217; will release on May 23 this year, Kangana says the film has been canned.</p>
<p>When asked about both her impending films, Kangana says, &#8220;It is canned right? I think it&#8217;s (the films) canned.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked if she feels disappointed, she said, &#8220;Why would I be frustrated, I have got my pay cheque. I am safe and hence there is no reason for to be disappointed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her other forthcoming projects are &#8216;Queen&#8217;, which will release on March 7, and Tigmanshu Dhulia&#8217;s film &#8216;Revolver Rani&#8217;, scheduled to release this year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992584&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/samavatar.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992233" alt="Sam" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/samavatar.jpg" /></a> Sam Worthington has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a photographer.
<p>Actor Sam Worthington, best known for playing the lead in 2009 blockbuster &#8216;Avatar&#8217;, has been arrested for allegedly assaulting a photographer.</p>
<p>According to the New York City Police Department detective Kellyann Ort, Worthington, 37, had allegedly punched the photographer Sheng Li in the face following an altercation between them yesterday at 5.30 pm at a bar in Greenwich Village here.</p>
<p>The altercation broke out after Li allegedly kicked the actor&#8217;s 26-year-old female companion in the leg.</p>
<p>According to NYPD Lieutenant John Grimpel, who spoke to news.com.au., Worthington, who has been charged with assault, was released on a desk appearance ticket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Sam Worthington was arrested tonight and charged with assault. He was released on a desk ticket with return to appear in court on February 26,&#8221; Grimpel said.</p>
<p>Ort said that Li, a 37-year-old photographer who lives in Manhattan, has also been held for arraignment.</p>
<p>No one was hospitalised following the incident. It is said that Worthington&#8217;s female companion was his model girlfriend Lara Bingle.</p>
<p>The actor, who had recently sparked wedding rumours with Bingle, apparently yelled at Li during the altercation by saying &#8220;You kicked my wife&#8221;.</p>
<p>In addition to &#8216;Avatar&#8217;, Worthington has also acted in &#8216;Terminator Salvation&#8217; (2009), &#8216;Clash of the Titans&#8217; (2010) and &#8216;Man on a Ledge&#8217; (2012).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992231&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/yamigautam2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992218" alt="Yami Gautam" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/yamigautam2.jpg" /></a> Yami Gautam said, “I have always done work to which my heart says yes.”
<p>Actress Yami Gautam, who made a successful debut in Hindi film industry with &#8216;Vicky Donor&#8217;, says she is cautious while choosing projects but not scared.</p>
<p>Yami made her Bollywood debut with John Abraham&#8217;s home production &#8216;Vicky Donor&#8217;, directed by Shoojit Sircar.</p>
<p>After a successful film, actors usually go on a signing spree but that was not the case with Yami.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/ali-yami-busy-with-filmi-events/">Check out: Ali, Yami busy with filmi events</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I have always done work to which my heart says yes. If a film is a huge hit, you do think properly before choosing your next projects. I am not from a film family or a Mumbai girl. The probability of getting a second chance is low and so one has to be more careful. That doesn&#8217;t mean I am scared,&#8221; Yami told PTI in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done work that has appealed my heart, and &#8216;Total Siyappa&#8217; is something I really liked. There were lots of offers that came my way, but I don&#8217;t like to talk about films that I have said no to, it is unprofessional,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Yami took a while to sign her second film &#8216;Total Siyappa&#8217;, produced by Neeraj Pandey of &#8216;A Wednesday&#8217; fame.<br />
&#8220;This film (&#8216;Total Siyappa&#8217;) has lot of shades. I am glad Neeraj Pandey thought of me. It is a quirky one day story&#8230; It is different and interesting. The film has lot of shades &#8211; being funny, emotional, angry, etc. It is a challenge to put it together,&#8221; Yami said, adding that for them it was serious stuff, but for audience it is a light-hearted film.</p>
<p>&#8216;Total Siyappa&#8217;, releasing on March 7, is romantic comedy directed by Eshvar Niwas and written by Pandey. It stars Pakistani singer-actor Ali Zafar, Yami, veteran actor Anupam Kher and his real life wife Kiron Kher. The couple is appearing together for the first time in a movie.</p>
<p>There were reports that Yami might do a film with John Abraham&#8217;s production house and Shoojit Sircar but the actress denied it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always said working with them will be a privilege. I owe my success to them, they gave me my first break. They are like my mentors. There is no project with them as of now,&#8221; she said.<br />
&#8220;We are definitely in touch, especially Shoojit sir. I know he is there for me whenever I need his suggestion or help,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Yami thinks the journey for outsiders has now become a little easy in the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;In today&#8217;s time after seeing the success of &#8216;Vicky Donor&#8217;, it is possible to get into the industry. What is more challenging is how to sustain&#8230; And for that you need to be sure of what you do,&#8221; she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992216&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The body of a week-old baby was recovered from the bungalow of actor Mohnish Behl at Parsik Hill in Kharegaon, Thane on Saturday (February 22). The news came as a shock to actor Mohnish Behl when he was informed that the body of a two day old infant was found in the swimming pool of his farmhouse.</p>
<p>The place which is also Mohnish&#8217;s ancestral home is vacant for a while now since the actor and his wife don&#8217;t visit it.</p>
<p>After the incident, Mohnish Behl who earlier did not want to sell the bungalow owing to his childhood memories, is now planning to sell the bunglow. The actor not only expressed his grief but has also requested people to change their attitude towards girl children.</p>
<p>An FIR was lodged against an unknown person and the police are currently investigating the matter. It was also reported that the body, which was first found by the watchman- caretaker of the farmhouse, has been identified as a girl child through post mortem.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992143&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hollywood star Nicolas Cage is set to become a grandfather for the first time as his son Weston Cage and his wife Danielle are expecting a baby boy.</p>
<p>The couple, who are ecstatic about having a baby, said Nicolas, 50, was euphoric after hearing the news, reported In Touch Weekly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a boy. Big boy, weighs a lot. I&#8217;m so excited! This wasn&#8217;t necessarily planned, but it is completely welcomed. We&#8217;re so happy to be giving birth eventually,&#8221; Danielle said.</p>
<p>Weston revealed that when he and his wife told Nicolas, the news he was &#8220;ecstatic.&#8221; &#8221;His reaction was one of pure joy and bliss. Family is very important to us. My father and I actually speak everyday and Danielle and I texted him the ultrasound photograph which was actually confirmation of what we thought,&#8221; Weston said.</p>

<p>Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, who has been shooting constantly for various films, is apparently planning to take a year-long hiatus from Hollywood.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old actress has been shooting for many of her films like &#8216;The Hunger Games&#8217; series and &#8216;X-Men&#8217; franchise without taking any break, reported Daily Mirror.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s going to have a long break for a year where she won&#8217;t do anything. It&#8217;s been non-stop for her and she deserves a rest,&#8221; said Producer Harvey Weinstein, who worked with Lawrence in &#8216;Silver Linings Playbook&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jennifer is too nice and will do people favours and agrees to do a movie like &#8216;American Hustle&#8217; when she could have had a rest. She signed on to do &#8216;Hunger Games&#8217; when she was young and wouldn&#8217;t have realised how much it would dominate her life. But she&#8217;s a professional and always will be,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992051&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Actress Katie Holmes is reportedly signing up Suri for acting lesson as her daughter is keen to follow in the footsteps of her celebrity parents.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old actress, who welcomed Suri, seven, with former husband Tom Cruise in 2006, was said to be initially indecisive about letting her daughter take up showbiz, reported Daily Mirror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Katie is wary of Suri stepping any further into the crazy showbiz world than she is already. But if that&#8217;s her daughter&#8217;s dream she doesn&#8217;t want to stand in her way,&#8221; a source said.</p>

<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">Former South African President </span><span style="color:#000000;">Nelson Mandela&#8217;s daughters Zindziwa and Zenani have been </span><span style="color:#000000;">invited to the 86th Academy Awards, where song &#8216;Ordinary Love&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000;">from &#8216;Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom&#8217; will be performed.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">The Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences invited the </span><span style="color:#000000;">late anti-apartheid hero&#8217;s daughters to catch U2&#8242;s performance </span><span style="color:#000000;">of the Oscar-nominated song during the ceremony, reported </span><span style="color:#000000;">Deadline.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;This is especially meaningful to us because of how much </span><span style="color:#000000;">our father loved watching movies. This song was inspired by </span><span style="color:#000000;">the beautiful letters that my father and mother exchanged </span><span style="color:#000000;">while he was imprisoned at Robben Island,&#8221; the gilrs said in a </span><span style="color:#000000;">statement.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">The award show is slated to take place on March 2. </span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992027&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

It is effortless and yet it makes you laugh.

It is effortless and yet it makes you laugh. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;line-height:1.5em;">With his straight-faced jokes </span><span style="color:#000000;">Farhan Akhtar found an easy bakra (scapegoat) in me, says </span><span style="color:#000000;">Vidya Balan, his co-star in the upcoming film &#8216;Shaadi Ke Side </span><span style="color:#000000;">Effects&#8217;.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I love to laugh and Farhan loves to make people laugh so </span><span style="color:#000000;">the &#8216;funda&#8217; was very clear. He found an easy &#8216;bakra&#8217; in me. I </span><span style="color:#000000;">enjoyed his sense of humour. He has a very sharp mind. I have </span><span style="color:#000000;">seen the film and I am glad that we got together for this one </span><span style="color:#000000;">where the comedy is very true to real life,&#8221; Vidya told PTI in </span><span style="color:#000000;">an interview.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">Having been a fan of Farhan&#8217;s earlier films like &#8216;Luck By </span><span style="color:#000000;">Chance&#8217; and &#8216;Zindagi Milegi Naa Dobaara&#8217;, Vidya says they were </span><span style="color:#000000;">well-matched in the Saket Chaudhary-directed comedy, a genre </span><span style="color:#000000;">which is relatively new for both the actors.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Farhan is one of those actors who are subtle even in </span><span style="color:#000000;">comedy. It is effortless and yet it makes you laugh. He is </span><span style="color:#000000;">supremely talented</span><span style="color:#000000;"> in a multi-dimensional way.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Acting is about reacting. This film would have suffered </span><span style="color:#000000;">if any of us was out of tune but we were well-matched in it. </span><span style="color:#000000;">We were completely tuned into each other which is great as an </span><span style="color:#000000;">actor. We complimented</span><span style="color:#000000;"> each other.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">The 36-year-old actress, who got married to UTV CEO </span><span style="color:#000000;">Siddharth Roy Kapur in 2012, signed up the film a few months </span><span style="color:#000000;">after the marriage but she does not believe her marriage life </span><span style="color:#000000;">influenced the character she is playing in the film.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I have played a married woman in many films. My first </span><span style="color:#000000;">film was called &#8216;Parineeta- the married woman&#8217;. I don&#8217;t know </span><span style="color:#000000;">whether I brought in my personal experiences into the film as </span><span style="color:#000000;">it did not require that. Most love relationships are quite </span><span style="color:#000000;">similar in many ways. Situations may differ but men and women </span><span style="color:#000000;">tend to react in similar ways,&#8221; says Vidya.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">After &#8216;Ghanchakkar&#8217; it is second comedy for Vidya, who is </span><span style="color:#000000;">often credited for bringing strong women roles in vogue in </span><span style="color:#000000;">Bollywood with films like &#8216;The Dirty Picture&#8217; and &#8216;Kahaani&#8217;.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">Vidya, however, says her role in &#8216;Shaadi Ke Side Effects&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000;">is quite different</span><span style="color:#000000;"> from the loud, obnoxious and sartorially </span><span style="color:#000000;">challenged woman she played in &#8216;Ghanchakkar&#8217;.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;My character in this film is a regular working woman in </span><span style="color:#000000;">a urban, two income household. It is very relatable because </span><span style="color:#000000;">you have people around you who are like that. I did not have </span><span style="color:#000000;">to prepare much for this film because we know so much about </span><span style="color:#000000;">marriage and relationship from everyone around you. This was a </span><span style="color:#000000;">familiar territory.&#8221;</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">The trailer has been a hit with dialogues becoming </span><span style="color:#000000;">popular and Vidya gives the entire</span><span style="color:#000000;"> credit to film&#8217;s director </span><span style="color:#000000;">and the other two scriptwriters &#8211;Zeenat Lakhani and Arshad </span><span style="color:#000000;">Sayed.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;There were two men and one woman to write the dialogues. </span><span style="color:#000000;">But we must agree that one woman is equal to two men,&#8221; Vidya </span><span style="color:#000000;">joked, adding, that the scriptwriters beautifully captured the </span><span style="color:#000000;">man-woman perspective in the film.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I think Saket has done a study or has been a detective </span><span style="color:#000000;">who has gone into other people&#8217;s houses. He has been present </span><span style="color:#000000;">at every argument</span><span style="color:#000000;"> that a couple had,&#8221; she said.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="color:#000000;">The film, a sequel to Saket&#8217;s 2006 film &#8216;Pyaar Ke Side </span><span style="color:#000000;">Effects&#8217;, is slated to release on February 28.</span></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992020&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/srkaryan.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992055" alt="SrK Aryan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/srkaryan.jpg" /></a> Shah Rukh Khan had earlier revealed that he preferred to send Aryan abroad to study, as he wanted to keep him out of the media glare.
<p dir="ltr">Doting dad Shah Rukh Khan was recently busy holidaying with his son Aryan in London.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SRK, who injured himself on the sets of his new movie&#8217;s sets, took to Twitter to share how proud he was of his eldest son.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dropped son for school. I feel so proud of him that I feel proud of me. Song on radio u gonna miss me when I am gone,” tweeted the star with a picture of himself sporting a funky pair of blue shades.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shah Rukh, who is also a father to 13-year-old Suhana and baby AbRam, is known to be extremely protective of his children. He had earlier revealed that he preferred to send Aryan abroad to study, as he wanted to keep him out of the media glare.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Aryan Khan is enrolled at the Seven Oaks School, situated close to Central London, which is believed to be a popular choice for celebrities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The actor also said it was fun being a teenager with no worries at all.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He wrote:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Mega pool session with the boys. It&#8217;s fun to be madly teenaged. No Wuckin&#8217; Forries. Will miss my son &amp; his friends. Hate when holidays end.</p>
<p>— SHAH RUKH KHAN (@iamsrk) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamsrk/statuses/437347669950726144">February 22, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Though the actor’s children, Suhana and Aryan prefer to stay away from the limelight, their father can’t stop himself from proudly posting about them and referring to them in tweets and posts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SRK is currently busy shooting for &#8216;Happy New Year opposite&#8217; along with Abhishek Bachchan, Deepika Padukone, Sonu Sood, Boman Irani and Vivaan Shah.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992015&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
