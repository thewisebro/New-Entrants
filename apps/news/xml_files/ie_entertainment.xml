<p><em></em><strong>Ping Pong Diplomacy: Games Nations  Play</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nicholas Griffin</strong><br />
Simon &amp; Schuster<br />
336 pages<br />
Rs 599</p>
<p><strong>By :Alka Acharya</strong></p>
<p>This one’s a thriller — rather, it has all the elements of a thriller. And the coin that Nicholas Griffin spins is that of the Cold War, with an interplay of sport and global geopolitics on the one side, and espionage on the other. It may be instructive to recall the late 1960s and 1970s — full of double/triple agents, defections, spy wars, expelling of diplomat spies, assassinations, and yet it was business as usual. Sports entered the arena as a powerful symbol of the ideological struggle between two power blocs. While there were high-profile sporting victories, sporting boycotts became powerful weapons to achieve diplomatic and domestic objectives.</p>
<p>The People’s Republic of China had sought membership of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) from 1952, but were kept out by tight western control of the international sport architecture. In 1958, China also withdrew from 11 international sports federations, inaugurating an era of long exclusion from the Olympic movement. George Orwell had summed it pithily: “Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play… it is war minus the shooting.” L’affaire Snowden has only furthered our awareness of state-sponsored espionage.</p>
<p>Griffin’s book, mirroring the western view in many ways, gives us a slice of history, which establishes how central sports and<br />
espionage were to the Cold War and how both were instrumental in bringing about one of the major geopolitical shifts after the Second World War.</p>
<p>It is a complex plot made simple, skilfully told in 52 chapters, each a crisp, focussed vignette. There are many fascinating side plots, sub-stories and mini-narratives — elements that have been told in bits and pieces in innumerable earlier accounts. For the most part, there are very few real surprises in this tale of the ping-pong teams paving the way for US president Richard Nixon’s visit to China in 1972.</p>
<p>Widespread coverage and many interviews have detailed the “chance encounter” between the American “hippie” member of the team, Glenn Cowan, and the Chinese team during the 1971 Nagoya World Championships; the invitation extended by Chinese player Zhuang Zedong to the American team, and the American diplomat in Tokyo whose close reading of the 1970 Annual Report on Foreign Relations presented to US Congress paid off — athletic exchanges were “permissible”. The American team posing for photographs on the Great Wall, the conversation between Premier Zhou Enlai and Cowan, Kissinger’s secret visit to Beijing, and the return visit of the Chinese team to the US followed, as is fairly well known. Griffin fills this large tapestry with a wealth of detail.</p>
<p>The crucial role of the London-based spy Ivor Montagu had hitherto not been part of the popular narrative. Griffin opens his book by tracing the history of table tennis (which was virtually extinct by the turn of the 20th century and ridiculed as “whiff-whaff”) and shows how the son of an ethnic-Jewish British Baron attempted to restore a serious status to the game, codified its rules and established the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) in 1926. Driven by Stalinist sympathies and dedication to the Communist movement, Ivor Montagu also supplied the Soviet Union with crucial intelligence about British espionage strategies, weaponry and code-breaking.</p>
<p>Montagu was never arrested even though MI5 had enough knowledge of his spying. The reason his focus shifted to the game was<br />
“political.” Ping-pong “could move quietly under the borders and boundaries created by the Communist and capitalist worlds”. At 22, he became the president of the ITTF, a post he was to occupy for the next four decades.</p>
<p>He first visited China on the National Day celebrations on October 1, 1952. Griffin discusses Ivor’s dilemma about the Taiwan question — which was to exercise Nixon and Kissinger later —  but it is a very thin account. Montagu won the Lenin Peace Prize in May 1959 after which he diverted his energies to “taking the game to China” and “taking China to the world”. His shift from Stalinist (Soviet) to Maoist loyalties is not adequately explained, considering that by 1959-60, the Sino-Soviet dissonances were well underway. But after 1966, when he stepped down from the post of president of ITTF, Ivor Montagu starts to fade away – his hour on the world stage is over. Griffin refers to him less and less. In fact, it was Montagu’s successor who suggested that China should invite some teams after the Nagoya Championships.</p>
<p>Griffin’s USP lies in bringing all the bits and pieces together, putting in only as much of the big politics as would give one a sense that world-changing events were unfolding, and throwing in the spicy bits which are getting huge traction lately – the horrors of the famine deaths following the Great Leap Forward in China. And both the informed and general reader can delight in yet another endorsement of the fact that historical truth is stranger than fiction. His attempts to delve into the history and the domestic background, however, do not come across as authoritative. It would also be a huge mistake to see this as a grand narrative, moving with all the ponderous logic of history to a pre-determined conclusion.</p>
<p>Griffin is spot on when he says “there was something cultural about many of the Chinese attempts to communicate with the Americans”. Even though he avers that Montagu changed the game for the state, not the individual, he captures the quirky personas of the players in short, vivid snapshots and leaves us with a more powerful sense of their individuality —  Cowan and his penniless, drug-ridden end, in particular. There is understandable oversimplification of the Cultural Revolution — ideological issues would be an unnecessary distraction in a thriller format. But, more crucially, Griffin should have taken some instruction in how Chinese names are written — he has cited them the other way around.</p>
<p>One ends with a possible counterfactual: were it not for ping-pong diplomacy, would the great rapprochement still have taken place? Griffin thinks not and goes on to say that all this pushed the Soviet Union into strategic errors, which led to its downfall! But this is browning it overly. Reportedly, when Mao directly ordered the Chinese teams to proceed to Nagoya, much had gone before — Nixon and Kissinger (unknown to the US State Department) had been sending clear signals through all manner of intermediaries, and it was only a matter of time before we would witness what Nixon described as the week that changed the world.</p>

<p><strong>How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</strong>:<strong> Cubicle Wisdom</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Adams</strong><br />
Penguin<br />
248 pages<br />
Rs 550</p>
<p><strong>D Shivakumar</strong></p>
<p>This is a wonderful book from the creator of Dilbert. I expected a fun, tongue-in-cheek book from Scott Adams. Surprise! This is anything but a comic book. It is about Adams’s career and the mistakes he made before stumbling upon the calling of “a professional simplifier”, an expression he uses to describe a comic-strip creator.</p>
<p>Adams tried his hand at many things before he launched Dilbert. He tried to be an entrepreneur many times over. He worked for a phone company, he attempted a version of YouTube years before YouTube took off, he tried his hand at selling groceries direct to home, and he experimented with a keypad for phones. He then sent a comic strip to Playboy and the New Yorker, because they paid the most. Both magazines rejected him, but he succeeded with Dilbert. This is a book that’s honest, self-critical, humble and offers a point on traditional markers of corporate careers like passion, luck and success.</p>
<p>Adams argues that successful people are not goal-oriented but are system builders. A system is something you do on a regular basis, which increases the odds of happiness in the long term. A lot of people look good on paper but do not achieve success because they do not sacrifice something. Successful people don’t wish for success, they decide to pursue it and, in the bargain, pay a price for their success. Successful people give back more than they consume to society.</p>
<p>Adams classifies people into three groups — the selfish, the stupid and those who are a burden on others. Attitude affects everything you do in the quest for success and happiness. A positive attitude is an important tool. Exercise, food and sleep are the mantras to elevate attitude and raise energy. Energy is a far better predictor of success than passion. Passion is a double-edged sword since it blinds the person and prevents him or her from seeing reality. Energy allows you to give your best. It paves the way for positive thoughts. Adams opines that successful people have a high ratio of happy thoughts to disturbing thoughts. Negative thoughts lead to negative words, actions and results. Success, in turn, feeds energy, something you need to be good at a number of things. Successful people know that every new skill they acquire doubles their odds of finding success.</p>
<p>Successful people also use persuasive phrases like, ‘Would you mind?’, ‘I just wanted to clarify’, ‘Is there anything you can do for me?’, ‘Thank you’ and ‘This is just between you and me’.</p>
<p>Patterns of success include lack of fear, the right education and exercise. So, how does one start on the path to success? For Adams, it is about affirmations.</p>
<p>Affirmations are simply the practice of repeating to yourself what you want to achieve while imagining the outcome you want. It is good to write down the affirmation, “I want to be a CEO”, and pin it in your room, to remind yourself every day. Affirmations work because optimists tend to notice opportunities that pessimists miss.</p>
<p>When you practice affirmations and then succeed, it feels like lady luck has smiled on you. At one level, that’s true. The biggest component of luck is timing.</p>
<p>When the timing is off, no amount of hard work or talent matters. When Dilbert appeared, corporate America was downsizing and Dilbert was seen as the hapless worker whom companies were laying off. This created a connect far stronger than advertising or publicity. A few years later, The Wall Street Journal asked Adams for a guest editorial about the workplace. This piece was titled ‘The Dilbert Principle’ and was appreciated by readers. It turned into a book and speech requests followed.</p>
<p>Adams is careful to warn us that nothing in this book should be taken as advice. Happiness is the only useful goal in life, he argues, and your own happiness depends on being good to others. He has brought happiness to millions with Dilbert and it’s not a surprise that this axiom works for him. This book is about failing and winning. See failure as a friend. Failure is the raw material for success. Invite failure home, learn from it, and pick its pocket. And you are on your way to success.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/god.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015700" alt="A God in Every Stone yokes together events separated by decades through their cumulative impact on individuals affected by them." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/god.jpg" /></a> A God in Every Stone yokes together events separated by decades through their cumulative impact on individuals affected by them.
<p><strong>A God in Every Stone: In an Antique Land</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kamila Shamsie</strong><br />
Bloomsbury<br />
310 pages<br />
Rs 499</p>
<p><strong>Sanjay Sipahimalani</strong></p>
<p>At one point in Kamila Shamsie’s new novel, A God in Every Stone, a character writes to another to say: “All these stories which happened where we live, on our piece of earth — how can you stay immune to them?” Bringing such stories to light to examine history’s long shadow is what the novel sets out to do, as indeed was the case with her earlier Burnt Shadows. That novel encompassed events from the Hiroshima bombing to India’s Partition to 9/11; similarly, A God in Every Stone yokes together events separated by decades through their cumulative impact on individuals affected by them.</p>
<p>Given the emphasis on history, it’s apt that the work of a man known as that discipline’s father plays a large role here. In his Histories, Herodotus mentions Scylax, an intrepid Greek explorer who is supposed to have followed the course of the Indus down to the sea. Scylax’s exploits, in particular, and archaeology, in general, hold a special fascination for Vivian Rose Spencer, a young, impressionable Englishwoman who, when the novel opens in 1914, is on an archaeological dig in present-day Turkey. Shamsie’s counterpoint to Vivian is Qayyum Gul, a Pathan from Peshawar who is among the first soldiers of the Indian Army to arrive in France, subsequently being injured at the ill-starred Battle of Ypres.</p>
<p>Vivian and Qayyum, as yet unknown to each other, return to their families in London and Peshawar respectively, and other characters are brought in, notably Qayyum’s younger brother, Najeeb. When Vivian turns up in Peshawar in quest of a lost artefact of Scylax, she finds echoes of Kipling everywhere; she also discovers and nurtures Najeeb’s own budding interest in archaeology, playfully nicknaming him “the Herodotus of Peshawar”. The stage is almost set for the novel to advance towards the other event that it brackets: the infamous confrontation between British troops and non-violent protestors at Peshawar’s Qissa Khwani Bazaar — or Storyteller’s Street — in 1930.</p>
<p>Shamsie doesn’t let the weight of history get in the way of depicting her characters’ inner lives, rendering them as interesting and absorbing. Her prose is fluid and sensorial, especially when it comes to depicting the sights and sounds of Peshawar, without tipping over into the florid (as with compatriot Nadeem Aslam).</p>
<p>However, given the framework of interactions between characters from different worlds, the action, at times, does largely depend on coincidence. Such are the treacherous currents of an intricate plot, and novelists often have to work hard to keep their characters afloat. (Again, Burnt Shadows had a similar reliance on happenstance, a cheeky acknowledgement of which can be found in the words of one character in that novel to another: “Both times you’ve entered my home it’s been nuclear-related. Once was acceptable; twice just seems like lazy plotting.”) While that may be an acceptable and not lazy strategy, it turns out that Shamsie also introduces new characters with defining and almost phantasmagorical roles very late in the narrative, and this does come across as over-egging the pudding.</p>
<p>Another way of reading the novel would be to see it as a series of choreographed exchanges between counterparts. In its pages, there are journeys to the West and expeditions to the East; World War I engagements and Peshawar riots; a chaotic, walled city and its orderly cantonment; Western notions of history and local legends that fill the air in the Street of Storytellers; an embittered Pathan soldier and a naïve Englishwoman both seeking means of fulfillment; Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan’s non-violent protests and brutal colonial retribution; and the rose-scented intensity of attar contrasted with the mellow fruitfulness of autumn. Such a pas de deux of opposites is everywhere, and it is skillfully done. It is this, along with Shamsie’s empathetic view of characters caught in history’s undertow, that are the defining and often pleasing features of A God in Every Stone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gangsofghost.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015470" alt="Gangs of ghost" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gangsofghost.jpg" /></a> The trouble with this gang of ghosts is that it is all on the surface, and all so dreary.
<p>Director : Satish Kaushik<br />
Cast: Sharman Joshi, Parambrata Chattopadhyay, Anupam Kher, Mahie Gill, Asrani, Saurabh Shukla, Yashpal Sharma<br />
IE Rating: * 1/2</p>
<p>A remake, even if it is official, is sometimes lost in translation. ‘Bhooter Bhabhishyat’ in Bangla, directed by Anik Dutta, was original and fresh. Satish Kaushik makes of it a pastiche which is neither here nor there : not ghastly, or ghostly, enough to be interred, nor good enough to be praised, just a thing that limps along.</p>
<p>Parambrata, reprising his role from the original as an ad filmmaker, shows up at a mansion which is a ‘bhooton ka basera’. Sharman Joshi plays a writer who has a story full of ghosts, and who is dying to make a film of it. The two chat up a gaggle of ghosts—a yesteryear heroine overdoing the nasal twang, a Sikh Army man, a buck-toothed zamindar, a British overlord, a Jat rock musician, a loverlorn girl in a mini-skirt, and so on.</p>
<p>These ‘bhoots’ rub up against each other in a medley which includes all manner of heard-before film industry insider jokes, a couple of item numbers, a super-rich builder, his dead wife, and a lecture on the ills of urbanization : when greedy land-grabbers ruin peoples’ dwellings, they become ghosts, and finally even they have no place left to hang up their shingles.</p>
<p>The trouble with this gang of ghosts is that it is all on the surface, and all so dreary. The loud decibel is used to hide the listless pace and gags : the idea of a `Spookbook’ instead of `Facebook’ could have gone somewhere, but Kaushik makes little of the occasional smart possibilities of the script, opting instead for tired laughs. A ghost that farts? Why not?</p>
<p>The stinging satirical tone of the original was its hook. This ‘Bhootiyapanti’, as it is called in the film, keeps looking for one.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015464&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rihanna.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015460" alt="Rihanna" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rihanna.jpg" /></a> Gounis filed a response to Rihanna&#8217;s lawsuit, in which she claims he left her virtually bankrupt in 2009.
<p>Rihanna&#8217;s ex-accountant Peter Gounis has claimed that the R&amp;B star spent her money on shopping and extravagant parties, which gave her financial troubles.</p>
<p>Gounis filed a response to the singer&#8217;s lawsuit, in which she claims he left her virtually bankrupt with USD 9 million in debt in 2009, reported New York Post online.</p>
<p>In the court papers filed on Gounis&#8217; behalf, he has insisted that he was only hired to record and manage her accounts and not to give her advice about spending.</p>
<p>In the documents Gounis claims that Rihanna&#8217;s choices, which included expensive costumes and sets for her 2010 &#8216;Last Girl on Earth&#8217; tour was what caused her money troubles.</p>
<p>He also said Rihanna dropped out of an expensive tour to shoot her movie. &#8220;The tour was very expensive in that acts, scenes and equipment were purchased and used to make it an impact tour. The tour did not make as much money as projected. Gounis, however&#8230; did not leave the tour to go act in a movie, Rihanna did,&#8221; said a document filed in Manhattan Federal Court.</p>
<p>The accountant has apparently asked the judge to dismiss the case.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015459&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/muppetsmostwanted.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015443" alt="Muppets Most Wanted" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/muppetsmostwanted.jpg" /></a> Muppets Most Wanted have never really been out of business or out of sight.
<p>Director: James Bobin<br />
Cats: Steve Whitmire, Eric Jacobson, Matt Vogel; Starring Ricky Gervais, Ty Burrell, Tina Fey<br />
IE Rating **</p>
<p>Muppets Most Wanted acknowledges the baggage it bears in a sequence at the beginning, which highlights how these characters created by Jim Henson and adopted by Disney have never really been out of business or out of sight. That they still carry a lot of weight is evident from the line of stars who appear in the film, some even to just hang at the edge of the frame.</p>
<p>This film by the same director as 2011&#8242;s The Muppets and voiced by the same group who have been doing it for years falls between too stools. Conscious it can&#8217;t be too aware of its place in Hollywood history but not stepping very far away from it either, it struggles through a clunky plot that stretches from Siberia to Dublin, with a very vast desert thrown in, and loses breath long before it calls it a day. When it pauses, it is only to break into a song, some of them quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>The sequences in Siberia&#8217;s Gulag are the funniest, for the simple reason that Fey as its strict commander, Nadya, and its hardened criminals including Ray Liotta and, briefly, Tom Hiddleston, don&#8217;t have to try too hard to infuse humour in those dire circumstances.</p>
<p>Gervais as the bad guy who has partnered with Constantine (Vogel) to replace Kermit (Whitmire) and to use the Muppets as a front while they chart out an elaborate theft of the crown jewels of Britain takes himself too seriously, and is far too menacing to have around those lovable characters. Vogel sketches out &#8220;the world&#8217;s most dangerous frog&#8221; better, particularly because of his insidious deviousness.</p>
<p>None of the other characters makes a mark, with Ms Piggy (Jacobson) cutting a particularly sorry figure given that marriage to a reluctant Kermit appears to be her sole agenda for this film.</p>
<p>Burrell is a French Interpol detective who smells something fishy in the break-ins happening in the wake of the Muppets, who are on a world tour. The film takes liberal potshots at Europe&#8217;s laid-back work culture, and Burrell doesn&#8217;t just tap into his inner Clouseau, he milks it to accented death.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015441&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

I think when they&#8217;re done right, they&#8217;re incredibly exciting and fun and cool. (Reuters)
<p>&#8216;Harry Potter&#8217; star Daniel Radcliffe says he wants to expand his experience as an actor by starring in a big screen musical.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old actor, who has previously led the cast of Broadway musical &#8216;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&#8217;, wants to take his singing talents to the movie theatre, reported Entertainment Weekly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would love to do a big film musical. I think when they&#8217;re done right, they&#8217;re incredibly exciting and fun and cool,&#8221; Radcliffe said.</p>
<p>The actor said he is tempted to do such musical films which have unique plots. &#8221;Everyone thinks of the ones that come to mind immediately, like Grease and things like that, but what was that slightly bizarre but wonderful John Turturro film? &#8217;Romance &amp; Cigarettes&#8217;. It&#8217;s a bizarre musical, and I love weird, interesting, different stuff like that&#8221;, he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015305&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kurtcobain.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015316" alt="Kurt Cobain" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kurtcobain.jpg" /></a> Kurt Cobain&#8217;s death case will not be re-opened but the police is planning to release new photos.
<p>Nirvana lead vocalist Kurt Cobain&#8217;s death case will not be re-opened but the police is planning to release new photos of the crime scene.</p>
<p>The singer was found dead at the age of 27 on April 8, 1994 at his house on Lake Washington Boulevard, three days after he actually died. Police had ruled it as suicide at that time, reported Washington Post.</p>
<p>Ahead of Cobain&#8217;s 20th death anniversary next month, rumours began to swirl that his death case was being re-opened after it was reported that a Seattle police detective recently took another look at the case file.</p>
<p>However, Detective Renee Witt, who is a spokeswoman of the police quashed re-opening reports.</p>
<p>She said the detective had just found some old and undeveloped film, which provided better-quality photos of images already out there.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we have not reopened the Kurt Cobain case. No change, no developments, no new leads,&#8221; Witt said adding that any report suggesting it was reopened are &#8220;very very incorrect.&#8221;</p>
<p>Witt said police planned to release some of the new photographs on its blog and would answer questions on the anniversary of Cobain&#8217;s death which happens on April 5.</p>
<p>The released photos would not include images of Cobain&#8217;s dead body. Cobain&#8217;s body was discovered at his Lake Washington home by an electrician on April 8, 1994. It is believed that the singer had shot himself dead around four days earlier.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015315&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8216;Thor&#8217; star Chris Hemsworth and wife Elsa Pataky have reportedly welcomed twins.</p>
<p>Pataky, 37, who already has a daughter India Rose with Hemsworth, 30, apparently gave birth to her twins at the Cedars Sinai Medical Center in LA, reported TMZ.</p>
<p>The security at the hospital was ultra-high, and two security guards were also standing outside her room.</p>
<p>The couple announced in November that they were expecting their second child, but the news that the pair were set to welcome twins began public in January.</p>
<p>Chris and Elsa were married in 2010.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015309&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rolling Stones star Mick Jagger has returned to LA for making the arrangements for the funeral of his late girlfriend L&#8217;Wren Scott.</p>
<p>The 70-year-old rock legend flew back from Perth, Australia yesterday to join his family in mourning and make the necessary arrangements, reported Us magazine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mick has arrived in LA, where he is with his daughter Karis and her family who live there, Lizzie and Georgia May.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kirrongul-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015266" alt="Gul Kirron" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kirrongul-480.jpg" /></a> After wishing each other luck in elections, the ladies have been taking digs at each other on Twitter.
<p>An unpleasant Twitter war has broken out between Chandigarh&#8217;s celebrity contestants – Gul Panag of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Kirron Kher of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
<p>After wishing each other luck in elections, the ladies have been taking digs at each other on the social networking site.</p>
<p>It all began with Gul, who was not too pleased when the BJP publicised one of her tweets praising Narendra Modi, which said, “When it is between the fire &amp; the frying pan- when you’ve been roasted long enough in the former- might as well try the latter??No? #NaMo4PM”. The actress shared the tweet titling it trip down memory lane.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gulnamotweet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2015264" alt="gulnamotweet" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gulnamotweet.jpg?w=460&#038;h=349" width="460" height="349" /></a></p>
<p>In the meantime Kirron Kher made her Twitter debut. Husband Anupam Kher welcomed her, “Finally Kirron ji has decided to be on twitter. So friends! Send her your love, warmth &amp; best wishes at @KirronKherBJP :)”</p>
<p>Gul further launched a direct attack on the senior actress saying, “Doubt if I&#8217;ll have the energy to run around like this and serve my people, when I&#8217;m 60. I guess that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s normally a retirement age.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Doubt if I&#8217;ll have the energy to run around like this and serve my people, when I&#8217;m 60.I guess that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s normally a retirement age.</p>
<p>— Gul Panag (@GulPanag) <a href="https://twitter.com/GulPanag/statuses/446077707458060288">March 19, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>To which Kirron replied, “My father is 101 years old and still happening. He said,&#8221; Good Luck Puttar. You have Always been winner.&#8221; For me Life starts at 60.”</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gul-kirron-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2015263" alt="gul-kirron-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gul-kirron-1.jpg?w=460&#038;h=180" width="460" height="180" /></a></p>
<p>This tweet was in fact retweeted later by Gul herself.</p>
<p>However, Kirron took the tweet-war further with, “I may not be a marathon runner but I know Slow and Steady wins the race. I love the Josh in our Karyakartas.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong class="size-full wp-image-2015502"></strong></p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone-21.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015569" alt="Sunny Leone" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone-21.jpg" /></a> Sunny Leone fits her part like her tight sheaths, and makes &#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242; Bollywood’s first unabashed adult sex-horror flick.
<p><strong class="size-full wp-image-2015502">Movie Review: Ragini MMS 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Star Cast: Sunny Leone, Pravin Dabas, Karan Mehra, Sandhya Mridul, Divya Dutta </strong></p>
<p><strong>Director: Bhushan Patel</strong></p>
<p>A film unit goes off to a deserted house in the middle of a forest for a shoot. Because this is a sequel to &#8216;Ragini MMS&#8217;, we are already primed for what is about to happen: a vengeful spirit will get after the humans, and scare us witless in the process.</p>
<p>The original film boasted a dirty weekend between a horny fellow and his nervous-but-willing girlfriend. That one got the &#8216;dirty&#8217; bit right, but slid off on the scary aspect, being more tell than show. The sequel goes much further in the down-and-dirty aspect, because it has a perfect lead to deliver on its promises. The lusciously curved Sunny Leone fits her part like her tight sheaths, and makes &#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242; Bollywood’s first unabashed adult sex-horror flick, begging the Ramsay Bros pardon.</p>
<p>Ms Leone, who is called Sunny in the movie (just in case  there is any confusion, either for her or us) has been hired by a director (Pravin Dabas) who wants to make a film on the Ragini case. We are treated to a lingering exhibition of Sunny’s pneumatic wares, and lest we think she is all bod, no brains, the dialogue-writer gives her such lines as this &#8212; Director: is it hot or is it you? Sunny: err, global warming?</p>
<p>Right, got that. After which, there is the haunted house, and the &#8216;chudail&#8217;, and Sunny and her endless array of baby-doll night-wear, and the members of the cast who rattle about the place, waiting for their turn. There&#8217;s Sandhya Mridul, acting so well against type as the hair-brained wannabe who knows that she has to ‘compro’ to get somewhere. Karan Mehra, the TV star who has a great line about TV actors (this being an Ekta Kapoor production, there must have been a great deal of chortling when these ‘inner joke’ dialogues were dreamt up). And Divya Dutta playing the mandatory ‘psychiatrist’ with a book of ‘mantras’ at hand to chase evil spirits away.</p>
<p>Despite its harum-scarum script and barely-there logic (why would the senior crew members stay in a haunted house and the bit part-actors in a comfy hotel, for example), I quite enjoyed ‘Ragini MMS 2’ in the portions when Sunny Leone is in full stride. She is totally comfortable in her acres of bare skin, and is surprisingly not that much of a slouch when it comes to acting her part. Heaving and moaning, sure, that’s expected. But she can carry a scene: maybe not &#8216;porn se Rituparno&#8217;  just yet (another example of the dialogue that fits the tone of this film like another kind of sheath), but not half bad.</p>
<p>Where it falters is in the lack of novelty in the scenes that feature the spirit, and its bloody trail: there are a couple of scenes that send a shiver down your spine, but then it all becomes familiar. A little more attention to that, and to the storyline, and this will become a solid franchise.</p>
<p>So when is part 3 coming?</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015237&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sanjaydutt.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1981636" alt="Sanjay Dutt" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sanjaydutt.jpg" /></a> Sanjay Dutt had applied for the third parole saying he wanted to take care of his wife Maanyata, who had undergone surgery earlier.
<p>Bollywood superstar Sanjay Dutt&#8217;s parole will end today (March 21). Sanjay Dutt was released from Pune&#8217;s Yerwada jail on one-month parole on December 21 last year on the grounds of his wife Maanyata&#8217;s illness. The parole was later extended by a month, till February 21, 2014 and then again till March 21. (Read: <a title="Prisoners on parole will have to serve additional term: Patil" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/prisonerson-parole-will-have-to-serve-additional-term-patil/" target="_blank">Prisoners on parole will have to serve additional term: Patil</a>)</p>
<p>Sanjay Dutt had applied for the third parole saying he wanted to take care of his wife Maanyata, who had undergone surgery earlier. According to reports, Maanyata has a tumour in the liver.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old actor is serving the remaining 42 months of his sentence for illegal possession of arms in a case related to the 1993 serial blasts, in which over 250 people were killed and several hundred wounded.</p>
<p>In early 2013, the Supreme Court upheld his conviction and awarded five-year prison term. He has already served 18 months of his jail term. The actor was shifted to Pune’s Yerwada Central Jail in May last year, nearly a week after he surrendered before a Special Court here.</p>
<p>In the past, Sanjay Dutt faced several protests outside his home and jail for his parole requests.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sanjay-mishra480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015124" alt="Sanjay Mishra:  'Ankhon Dekhi' is a different film for me because I have always done commercial movies." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sanjay-mishra480.jpg" /></a> Sanjay Mishra: &#8216;Ankhon Dekhi&#8217; is a different film for me because I have always done commercial movies.
<p>Character actor Sanjay Mishra, who is known for his roles in &#8216;All the Best&#8217;, &#8216;Golmaal&#8217; and &#8217;Phas Gaye Re Obama&#8217;, says playing a protagonist in a film is a huge responsibility.</p>
<p>Mishra, 51, who would be seen playing his career&#8217;s first lead in Rajat Kapoor&#8217;s &#8216;Ankhon Dekhi&#8217;, said making your audience glued to the screen for two hours is a challenging task.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a responsibility as I have to run the film completely on my shoulder. &#8216;Ankhon Dekhi&#8217; is a different film for me because I have always done commercial movies. I had to narrate the story for two hours and make my audience glued to the screens.</p>
<p>&#8220;They should stay excited from the first frame to the last one. In this process, my director and co-actors helped me a lot. They were like a family to me on the sets. You don&#8217;t get such kind of chemistry these days,&#8221; Sanjay told PTI.</p>
<p>&#8216;Ankhon Dekhi&#8217;, which is releasing tomorrow, is a family entertainer that revolves around Mishra&#8217;s character Raje Bauji and his day-to-day experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;This film is like a life and it shows all the shades of it. It&#8217;s like an autobiography. It&#8217;s a very general thought that a 50 plus person has. After living his life for his family, my character decides on to live life on its own term,&#8221; Mishra said.</p>
<p>A National School of Drama graduate, Mishra feels that he himself was the reference point for his character in the film. &#8221;There was no reference point to this character. But I am very close to my character. I want to live my life to the fullest. I want to try out new things and experiment with it. I love to take risks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Film&#8217;s director Rajat had written the script keeping Mishra in mind but it was initially offered to Naseeruddin Shah.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big thing in my life that a director like Rajat Kapoor wrote a script keeping me in my mind. He told me about this when we were doing &#8216;Phas Gaye Re Obama&#8217; but I never took it seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After a film finishes, I generally go on hiatus for sometime. When I returned and got to know about it I told him that I might not be able to sell the film but Naseer bhai will give a new high to your film. But after reading the script Naseer bhai also felt that I was the correct person to play the character,&#8221; Mishra said.</p>
<p>Having started his career as a comedian, Mishra is happy that he is still getting good roles and audiences love him. &#8221;I am very happy with the way my career has shaped up. I am happy with whatever I have achieved. I have made a special place in my audiences&#8217; heart and it&#8217;s like winning an Oscar for me,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015040&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bollywood actor Abhay Deol felicitated some young crusaders, who have contributed in bringing change in the society through their campaigns ranging from crime against women to protecting the environment.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old actor praised them and hoped their small but significant efforts would snowball into something big some day.</p>
<p>&#8220;This concept instantly connected with me, as I would like to believe that I too have done things differently in many ways whether it is my career or personal life. It was a pleasure to meet and honour these youngsters today. A platform like this will encourage and inspire them to bring about a change and not just talk about it,&#8221; Abhay said.</p>
<p>The event was organised by UTV Bindass in connection to their recent initiative &#8216;b for change&#8217;. Alisha Sharma from Mumbai and Mishika Singh from Delhi were felicitated for their respective movements -&#8217;Chappal Marungi&#8217; and &#8216;Besharmi Morcha&#8217;.</p>
<p>Sharma&#8217;s campaign encourages victims of eve teasing to fight back the molesters while Singh&#8217;s movement helps raise voice against the attitude of blaming rape or sexual harassment on any aspect of a woman&#8217;s appearance.</p>
<p>Shreeya Parekh from Bangalore was hailed for spreading awareness about environmental issues through her blog. Rashi Anand was also lauded for her initiative &#8216;Lakshyam&#8217;, India&#8217;s first toy library for under privileged children.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was truly inspiring to hear these young change makers talk about their work and I hope many others get inspired to bring about a change in their own little way,&#8221; Abhay added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015092&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Actor Vivek Oberoi will be the voice of the main villain Max Dillon aka Electro in the Hindi version of &#8216;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#8242;.</p>
<p>In the original version of the film, Electro is played by Oscar winning actor Jamie Foxx.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very happy to have Vivek on board for the Hindi version of &#8216;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#8242;. The Hindi version is a large part of our box office and it&#8217;s a very important role that Vivek will be playing in its success. Vivek has played a villain so brilliantly in the past and is already a familiar face in the genre. Kids in particular love him,&#8221; said Kercy Daruwala, MD Sony Pictures India.</p>
<p>Vivek said he agreed to dub for the voice of Electro because he has been a huge fan of the web-casting superhero.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be Electro&#8217;s voice in the Hindi version of &#8216;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#8242;. I have always been a huge fan of the Spider-Man comics and films. Max Dillon/Electro is an immensely fascinating and complex character and it will be interesting to face off with Spider-Man,&#8221; said Vivek, who played a negative role in his last Bollywood release &#8216;Krrish 3&#8242;.</p>
<p>The actor has already begun dubbing for the character. The film starring Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man and Emma Stone as his lady love, will release in India on May 1.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015086&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Actor Vivek Oberoi and actress Kalki Koechlin assumed the role of a teacher for a day for charity.</p>
<p>Vivek, 37, and Kalki, 30, were in the city to participate in the event where they laid the foundation for a new block at the P&amp;G Shiksha school here and turned teachers for a day.</p>
<p>Kalki feels having a strong educational infrastructure is essential for the nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think for me education is one of the most urgent requirement of our country. In many rural areas we are still lacking in terms of basic education for our children. It is heartening to see movements like this,&#8221; Kalki told PTI.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was lovely to lay the foundation. Education is something that is needed in our country. Education is something I have been very passionate about,&#8221; Vivek added.</p>
<p>In its 10th year, the P&amp;G Siksha programme aims to renovate or build new schools as part of their effort to improve the quality of education for children.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015079&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mithun.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015066" alt="Mithun Chakraborty turned rapper for the first time at a dance reality show," src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mithun.jpg" /></a> Mithun Chakraborty turned rapper for the first time at a dance reality show,
<p>Veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty, who recently became a Rajya Sabha member, will be seen in another new avatar on television, where he turned rapper for the first time at a dance reality show.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s original disco dancer will show cool moves in the upcoming grand premiere episode of &#8216;Dance India Dance Li&#8217;l Masters&#8217;, a popular programme on Zee TV with which he has been associated for several years. The episode will be aired on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 62-year-old National Award winning actor sprang a surprise by singing a special track himself to introduce the super 16 contestants, skippers and judges in an extravaganza of dance and comedy.</p>
<p>Dressed like a rapper, Chakraborty looked smashing in a studded black leather jacket with an &#8216;M&#8217; embellished hat along with thick gold chain, pendants and rings in each finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Singing a rap song was a new experience for me as I have never attempted anything like this before ever. For a rap song, one requires a different attitude altogether to maintain the flow and the feel in sync.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, instead of aping anyone, I tried to do it in my own style. It&#8217;s something very &#8216;hatke&#8217; (different) that we planned for this season which will definitely take the audience by surprise,&#8221; Chakraborty said in a statement here.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Agneepath&#8217; actor was very excited to sing his first rap track and he suggested few additions to make it sound cooler and hipper.</p>
<p>The latest edition of the show, in which Chakraborty features as &#8216;Grandmaster&#8217;, will be judged by choreographers Geeta Kapoor and Ahmed Khan, coached and mentored by skippers<br />
Sanam Johar, Raghav Crockroaz Juyal, Rahul &amp; Paul Marshal and DID 4 contestant Swarali Karulkar.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015063&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Actress Sunny Leone today said that she has no problems in doing television serials.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anybody comes to me with a proposal, then I will not reject it. I will definitely work in it,&#8221; said Sunny, 32, who arrived here for the promotion of her latest film<br />
&#8216;Ragini-MMS 2&#8242;.</p>
<p>On the protests against the film at some places, the actress said, &#8220;Those who want to watch the film should watch it. Those against it should not watch it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Answering a question on exposing, she said it was ubiquitous in foreign films too. &#8220;I am a very hard-working woman and also a good wife,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Sunny denied that there were any strains in her relations with the producer Ekta Kapoor.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015041&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Actress Lily Collins says finds waxing more painful than getting tattoos. The 25-year-old &#8216;Mirror Mirror&#8217; star, who is a fan of body art said she never minds the pain it takes to have a design etched onto her skin, reported E!Online.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, women go through worse things. Waxing hurts more than tattoos. And tattoos are permanent, so if it takes a little pain to get there, that&#8217;s okay,&#8221; Collins said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always loved body art I remember being with my mom on Venice Beach when I was really young, and we walked by this guy on a Harley who was covered in tattoos. I was this little British girl, and I went up to him and said, &#8216;Your tattoos are so pretty!,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Collins said she still feels like a little girl dressing up for a big party whenever a red carpet invitation comes her way.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Met Ball? Being invited to something like that? Incredible! I still think, Why am I on the list? I still feel like a little girl dressing up and getting to go to a pretty party,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015033&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Singer duo The Veronicas are returning to music after signing a new record deal with Sony Music.</p>
<p>The Australian duo, made up of twin sisters Lisa and Jessica Origliasso, are seen recording material for their new album in a video posted on YouTube, reported Digital Spy.</p>
<p>The pair began recording their third studio album in 2010, but the project never got off the ground because of a conflict with Warner Bros Records. They parted company with the label in October 2013.</p>
<p>New songs &#8216;Did You Miss Me&#8217; and &#8216;Back to You&#8217; are previewed in the new video, alongside footage of the pair talking about the forthcoming release.</p>
<p>The Veronicas scored their biggest UK hit with &#8217;Untouched&#8217;, which reached number eight on the UK Top 40 in 2007. They have scored seven Top 10 hits in their native Australia, as well as releasing two multi-platinum albums.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015026&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Actor Chris Evans feels the box office battle between his movie &#8216;Captain America 3&#8242; and &#8217;Batman vs Superman&#8217; is a shame.</p>
<p>The biggest-ever battle between Marvel and DC will take place when both franchises face off on May 6, 2016, reported Access Hollywood.</p>
<p>Evans appeared to have learned of the showdown while attending the premiere of his latest film &#8216;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#8217;. &#8221;Well that&#8217;s a shame,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old actor went on to offer his predictions on who will win when Batman and Superman tangle in the upcoming DC movie.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not really fair. Superman would beat everyone really, wouldn&#8217;t he? What can&#8217;t he do?&#8221; he joked. &#8221;Superman can turn back time. So even if he loses, he&#8217;ll just try it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Evans&#8217;s co-star Sebastian Stan recently backed &#8216;Captain America 3&#8242; over &#8216;Batman vs Superman&#8217; in the box office competition.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015017&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8216;Sex and the City&#8217; star Sarah Jessica Parker, who is considered as a fashion icon by many people, says her style is often influenced by women she spots on the streets.</p>
<p>However, the 48-year-old actress said she does not even know the names of these women, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been so cold in New York that bare legs seemed almost undoable&#8230; So I started wearing tights, then I saw  a woman in Seattle wearing stirrups with a pump and thought, &#8217;Maybe I&#8217;ll start wearing them with a strap shoe&#8217;,&#8221; Parker said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aankhon-dekhi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015003" alt="Movie Review: Aankhon Dekhi, Rajat Kapoor's film is an absolute gem, because he gives us a marvelous bunch of characters who make us laugh, and pause, and think." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aankhon-dekhi.jpg" /></a> Movie Review: Aankhon Dekhi, Rajat Kapoor&#8217;s film is an absolute gem, because he gives us a marvelous bunch of characters who make us laugh, and pause, and think.
<p><strong>Movie Review: Aankhon Dekhi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Star Cast: Sanjay Mishra, Rajat Kapoor, Seema Bhargava, Maya Sarao, Taranjeet, Namit Das, Brijendra Kala, Manu Rishi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Director: Rajat Kapoor</strong></p>
<p>What if you come across a man who will believe only what he sees with his own eyes, and negate everything he can’t? Will you call him eccentric and ignore him? Or humour him, and hear him out? Rajat Kapoor’s beautifully written and directed ‘Aankhon Dekhi’ breathes life into such a man, fills him up with not hot air, but a mix of foolishness and wisdom that is at once arresting, and inviting. He is fool, clown and man, all in one. He is us.</p>
<p>Bauji (Sanjay Mishra) lives with his younger brother (Rajat Kapoor) in one of those cramped first floor quarters, more hovel than &#8216;haveli&#8217;, in Old Delhi&#8217;s Fatehpuri area. It has a &#8216;chhatt&#8217; with &#8216;janglas&#8217;, tiny rooms adjacent to each other, a makeshift kitchen, and a common toilet. The family is joint at the hip in more ways than one, which is evident right from the first scene when Bauji’s daughter Rita (Maya Sarao ) is found to be in a relationship with an allegedly disreputable boy (Namit Das), and all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>This is not the India which takes part in the sort of sex surveys that are grist to so many glossy magazine mills. This is still the Bharat, under attack from global forces but holding up perilously, where girls have to hide their boyfriends from their over-protective families and nosy neighbours, and where the &#8216;chacha&#8217; has as much right to clip one across the cheek of the importunate invader as the father.</p>
<p>Those who have grown up in such an atmosphere will instantly recognize Bauji, his &#8216;chota bhai&#8217;, their carping-but-close wives, and their children, growing up and outward, trying to find their place in a rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>Kapoor&#8217;s film is an absolute gem, because he gives us a marvelous bunch of characters who make us laugh, and pause, and think. In another film, Bauji would have come off a caricature. But here he is a man in the vital process of sloughing off dead layers, and discovering his skin. Sanjay Mishra does a terrific job of becoming Bauji.</p>
<p>Everyone else pitches in with performances which are as true and felt: Kapoor as the left-out-but-caring &#8216;chacha&#8217;, Bhargava as Bauji’s constant companion, Taranjeet as Kapoor’s wife, and Sarao as the spirited young Rita who wants to marry a fellow of her own choice. And a clutch of familiar faces (Kala, Rishi) and the others who make up the close-knit &#8216;mohalla&#8217; and the &#8216;yaar- dost&#8217; who show up for incessant &#8216;chai&#8217; and chat, and never leave.</p>
<p>Like all Kapoor&#8217;s best works, this one also works as a parable. There’s a splendid little thread that finds its way into Bauji’s world, in the shape of a young boy who can’t stop talking. And then comes a moment of silence when he stops. The film halts, and lets us savour the quiet. A random fellow asks direction to Lal Qila ( when you are in Fatehpuri, the Red Fort is all around you, to have someone ask how to find it becomes a great cosmic joke : did that guy ( Kapoor gang-member Ranvir Shorey) get there? ) All our senses are engaged, and we are alive to the hilarity, the absurdity, and the unexpected depths of Bauji and his life. And what it teaches us, with such poignance and ease.</p>
<p>Kapoor directs with a sure eye and an unerring ear for the sounds of the Delhi 6 ( only quibble, the background music swells too loudly : those moments didn’t need that kind of underlining). He is also one of the few Indian directors who understands whimsy : it is in every frame, but never overdone, making this a film rich in what appear to be small but are actually significant pleasures.</p>
<p>I have seen it with my own eyes, and I can tell you that &#8216;Aankhon Dekhi&#8217; is a fine , fine film.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mad Men&#8217; star January Jones says she may go under the knife in future but presently anaesthetic procedures scare her.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old actress said she is not against people going for plastic surgery to enhance their looks, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever helps a person feel beautiful and confident is fine with me. I personally am afraid of the procedures that involve anaesthetic but ask me again in twenty years,&#8221; Jones said.</p>
<p>The actress said she took her mother&#8217;s advice on beauty. &#8221;She (my mother) always told me that if I kept making so many weird and ugly faces my face would eventually freeze that way. Luckily I found a job where funny and/or frozen faces are encouraged,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014994&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Supermodel Gisele Bundchen and her husband Tom Brady have reportedly decided to sell their LA home.</p>
<p>The mansion, which is situated in the Brentwood neighbourhood of LA, has been listed by the couple at USD 50 million, reported Ace Showbiz.</p>
<p>The 14,000-square-foot house has many facilities like six bedrooms, a gourmet kitchen, a library, gym, infinity pool, waterfall and a moat. The duo had invested USD 20 million to build the eco-friendly estate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunny-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014941" alt="The tunes in this Sunny Leone-starrer may not be perfect in terms of musicality, all of it is even cheesy." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunny-main.jpg" /></a> The tunes in this Sunny Leone-starrer may not be perfect in terms of musicality, all of it is even cheesy.
<p>With most popular composers of today struggling to give us real chartbusters, producer Ekta Kapoor’s Ragini MMS 2 has the TV queen firing on all cylinders. That she has a music sense was clear in The Dirty Picture. This time she brings together the most unknown and unpredictable names (except Yo Yo Honey Singh) and gives Ragini MMS 2 some perfect little touches. At least in terms of music. The tunes in this Sunny Leone-starrer may not be perfect in terms of musicality, all of it is even cheesy, but what works for this one is the catchy melody, unique voices and those heady beats.</p>
<p>The album opens with Baby doll main sone de. A cracker of a track, it sticks from the moment the first hook hits us. One of the more vibrant item numbers after Munni, the star of the song is Kanika Kapoor, the raw texture of whose slightly shrill voice sounds right out of a ladies sangeet in the interiors of Punjab. There is also a Zandu Balm reference (second in the history of Bollywood music, first one being in Munni) in a coarsely crafted one liner that goes Laava Zandu balm je nachde pai jan thamka. What’s more interesting is the track’s orchestration, which is quite contemporary as all the beats have come out of an octopad. The trademark tumbi is the only Punjabi folk instrument, which rings throughout.</p>
<p>There is Yo Yo Honey Singh’s eulogy to alcoholism called Char bottle vodka, which shifts between buoyant and bittersweet. The infectious groove that borrows from dubstep, has an intoxicating beat and few lines of rap.</p>
<p>Main khud ko by Zahid Mustafa is a simple, romantic ditty, which opens with a soft sarod prelude. Mustafa sounds fine but not convincing enough. Soon the chorus sound better. A decent composition, the song craves an Arijit Singh and his smooth vocals. Enter Kshitij Tarey and his classically trained voice in the reprise version.</p>
<p>Overall the attempt to bring in a host of composers gives us a broth with various fun flavours. But then it only has four songs, two of them with an extra version and one with not much value.<br /> — Suanshu Khurana</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014939&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[While the trade is busy writing her career obit, Kareena’s track record and undeniable talent cannot be ignored. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014935&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kareena.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014938 " alt="Kareena Kapoor" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kareena.jpg" /></a> Kareena is at a crucial juncture in her career.
<p>Oops, she did it again. At a recent media interaction, Kareena Kapoor once again displayed her spirit of generosity. When asked about her penchant for leaving acclaimed film projects, she retorted, “I feel honoured and glad to give work to other people. I hope they (other actresses) become stars as I have rejected big films.”</p>
<p>Maybe she’s just sick of defending her script choices — it will take her a while to live down her decision to walk out of Goliyon Ki Raasleela: Ram Leela and choose Gori Tere Pyaar Mein and Satyagraha instead — but Kareena is surely not getting the Miss Congeniality award  anytime soon.</p>
<p>Recently it came into the tabloids that she was the first choice for Queen and she (true to form) rejected the film.</p>
<p>While filmmaker Vikas Bahl maintains “Kangna Ranaut was the first and last choice for Queen”, Kareena’s camp insists otherwise. Whatever be the truth, it makes you wonder who is advising Kareena if she’s saying No to such amazing stuff. I mean, who in their right mind can nix Queen? It’s practically a love letter to every girl out there.</p>
<p>Kareena is at a crucial juncture in her career. Currently Singham 2 is the only film she is attached to. The ambitious time travel reincarnation saga Shuddhi with Hrithik Roshan isn’t happening anymore. Buzz is rife that Deepika Padukone has been roped in for the film while the hunt for the male lead is still underway. Kareena’s other big-ticket project, Bombay Samurai has been delayed because of Farhan Akhtar’s unavailability.</p>
<p>While the trade is busy writing her career obit, Kareena’s track record and undeniable talent cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>She is no stranger to this phase. She was written off after all her big films flopped but she came back with films such as Chameli, Jab We Met, and Omkara. Kareena doesn’t need to do every project. She has spoken about how she’s enjoying her married life with husband Saif Ali Khan but she’s also said that she’ll continue to act. She needs to get her act together, soon. And make the right choices. The new lot of girls — Parineeti Chopra, Alia Bhatt and Sonakshi Sinha are firing all guns. Deepika, Priyanka Chopra, Anushka Sharma and Kangna are also doing noteworthy work. It’s an interesting time to be a leading lady. Kareena wouldn’t want to miss the bus. Maybe it’s time she paid heed to what filmmaker Anurag Kashyap advised her in Koffee with Karan: “Next time you should not ask who&#8217;s in the film, you should ask what is the film.”</p>
<p>And till then, Bebo, just stop attaching yourself to other people’s films. You are cooler than this. Just breathe and reboot.</p>

<p>Conducted by<strong> Ranjib Mazumder</strong></p>
<p><em>Writers are an important part of the filmmaking process but when it comes to promotions, they are mostly sidelined. Two experts decode the situation.</em></p>
<p><strong>Anubhav Sinha</strong><em> (Producer, Director)</em></p>
<p>Let’s first talk about music. There was appreciation of music in the past. But with T-series coming in, it became glamourised, with Gulshan Kumar and Nadeem-Shravan, appearing on their posters.</p>
<p>And then, musicians became celebrities, music directors and singers becoming judges in reality shows. Since there is such a great consumption of music, it suits the producers to highlight them in promotional materials. The end point is that music gets priority and that’s a major factor in this argument.</p>
<p>When it comes to writers in cinema, sadly, before Salim-Javed, writers hardly had any status, forget celebrity status. By nature, most writers are introverts. It is also demand and supply. When Salim-Javed delivered successes one after another, they managed to demand that status.</p>
<p>The scene nowadays is that writers are not perceived as celebrities in our country. Look at our literary scene. So when a film is up for promotion, it would rather flaunt celebrities like music composers and singers than writers.</p>
<p>Regrettably, we have very little respect for our writers and that shows in our films. But things are changing slowly. Now when writers are demanding their worth, they get it. I for one have given my writers proper credit, because the process of filmmaking starts with writing.</p>
<p>Having said that, we must look at our writing also. Most of our films are constantly recycling ideas. There are hardly films based on books or any published material. That’s the reason why we don’t write films like Gravity, where two characters floating in space can pull off such a spectacular and gripping film.</p>
<p>This lack of innovation must end. We need inventive ideas and scripts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rajat Arora</strong> (<em>Screenwriter</em>)</p>
<p>I personally feel that this is a misconception. With 15-second-long promos that usually focus on songs, they normally leave the writer’s name out. What sells is music, and hence music directors are an essential part of the promotion. Unfortunately, producers don’t think about writers. Our film award functions are the variety shows of the December 31st night kinds. Even if writers speak for just five-six words, it will be edited during broadcast.</p>
<p>It is unfair, no doubt. But to be fair, why only writers, every head of departments must be credited and promoted properly. In the larger scheme of things, the cinematographers, editors and everyone who contributes are an equally important part of filmmaking.</p>
<p>My theory is that a director starts working with a writer, and gradually when the process is finished, there are many people who have come into the picture. And by that time, they have forgotten where it actually started. Unfortunately, the person who started it all becomes the least important person.</p>
<p>Unlike Hollywood, writers were hardly important for Hindi cinema. Before Salim-Javed became star screenwriters, writers had to cite a reason to ask for money. Having said that, there are also writers who take unnecessary short cuts. For example, when a director refers to a certain scene of a film, the writers sometimes reproduce the same scene without any change.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the people I worked with were generous, they were conscious of giving a writer his worth. Now the scene is changing because of the media and forums like Twitter.</p>
<p>Now with the exposure to world cinema, new ideas are pouring in, which the audience is absorbing. This is making the existence of writers important.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014931&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidyabalan3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015193" alt="Vidya Balan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidyabalan3.jpg" /></a> There is talk already, of Balan being replaced by Kangna Ranaut, the freshly anointed queen on the block, in Sujoy Ghosh’s next.
<p>There are rumblings about the stork’s impending visit — according to industry buzz, Vidya Balan is going to be the new mommy on the block. A confirmation of the good news is yet to come from Balan but be that as it may, all this talk of mommyhood has sparked off a debate  within the industry about introducing a non-pregnancy clause for female actors. In a recent interview to a Mumbai tabloid, Balan too had mentioned signing a contract with a no-pregnancy clause, suggesting that such clauses may soon become a norm in Bollywood as they are in Hollywood.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/vidya-balan-aishwarya-rai-bachchan-no-place-for-a-pregnant-actress-in-bollywood/">Also Read: Vidya Balan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan no place for a pregnant actress in Bollywood?</a></p>
<p>Such a clause in an actor’s contract would mean that the actor in question cannot get pregnant during the making of the said film as that would tantamount to violation of the terms laid down by the contract. A couple of years ago Aishwarya Rai Bachchan found herself faced with a similar situation when she had to drop out of Madhur Bhandarkar’s film, Heroine, due to maternity issues.</p>
<p>There is talk already, of Balan being replaced by Kangna Ranaut, the freshly anointed queen on the block, in Sujoy Ghosh’s next. Though again, a press statement has not yet been issued to make the announcement.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidyapregnant.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2013201" alt="vidyapregnant" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidyapregnant.jpg?w=460&#038;h=329" width="460" height="329" /></a></p>
<p>Well, show business is tough and replacements, whether you are in a happy, mommy-to-be space or in a commercially-not-so successful phase, are quick to find and such developments are likely to make things even more difficult for actresses.</p>
<p>There are of course, divergent views on the subject. According to actress Shabana Azmi, such a clause is a norm with international projects — in order to prevent such misunderstandings and inconvenience to all concerned — and it is certainly not sexist. Be that as it may, it certainly puts married, over-30 actresses in a situation of disadvantage and makes a personal life choice just a little more complicated. After all, the only reason male actors will be passed up is an inability to work the box-office numbers. Not so for the actresses, who, already have to deal with a shorter career span.</p>
<p>Heroines in the past found it easier to get past such situations, thanks to the langorous process of filmmaking and the easy going ways of the industry but evidently the rules are a changing. It is not so any longer. Besides, films these days have a lot more money riding on them. The stakes are high and for some reason having a pregnant heroine on board seems too fraught with risk; a surefire producer’s nightmare. A contractual agreement may clear up matters in more ways than one but it certainly seems a little unfair.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidyabalanlose1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2013205" alt="vidyabalanlose" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidyabalanlose1.jpg?w=460&#038;h=329" width="460" height="329" /></a></p>
<p>After all, female actors already bear the brunt of age and matrimony far more than the men, are paid lesser than male contemporaries even though they are as integral to movie-making as the menfolk.<br /> For a movie culture that venerates its mothers, elevating them to almost a goddess like status, it’s ironic that there is no provision for maternity leave for the leading ladies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014923&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kangana-ranaut-queen-vikas.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015116" alt="Although Queen did not open well, it did a business of Rs 18 crore by the end of the first week." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kangana-ranaut-queen-vikas.jpg" /></a> Although Queen did not open well, it did a business of Rs 18 crore by the end of the first week.
<p>Director Vikas Bahl, who is reveling under critical acclaim of Queen, says that the film has benefited from positive word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>The reviews of the film have been really overwhelming, and frankly I am not counting the monies. But it is doing well as the word-of-mouth is really good. Queen is not a niche film, and is doing equally well in single screens. It’s funny, relatable and has reached out to a wide audience.</p>
<p><strong>Kangna Ranaut’s character, Rani, is quite delightful, perfectly capturing the nuances of a Delhi girl. How did you get that right?</strong></p>
<p>I am from Delhi. Having observed my sisters and friends, I know life for girls is planned out for them by their families. They lose their own perspective on life and they are okay with that. They are happy to be told what to do. And where Kangna was concerned, she was not doing anything funny. As a writer, I had to step back and think how a girl, whose world has come to an end, would react and behave in a situation like that. There were a lot of inputs from Kangana too. In the scene with the Italian chef, it was she who suggested about the lip-to-lip kiss. Likewise, the scene where she tells a stranger to click her picture in Amsterdam was suggested by her. In fact, I gave her full freedom. She knew how to maintain the fine line of her character, which otherwise would have become a caricature. The film could not not have been made in 45 days without her involvement.</p>
<p><strong>The detailing was also perfect — right from Kangna’s mehndi fading gradually, to the way she saves her bag from the robber.</strong></p>
<p>Getting the mehndi colour right was a real monkey business, because the film was not shot in a linear fashion. We first shot in Paris and then Amsterdam, then Delhi and with some interior shots in between. I was particular about the detailing of the colour not going wrong. I remember a part of it becoming dark in Paris. There’s a saying that if the mehndi turns dark, the bride will be doted upon by the mother-in-law. But Rani didn’t have a mother-in-law in the picture, so I had to make sure the shade was light. The bag snatching scene was also very genuine. I told the junior actor that he had to snatch the bag from her with all his might, and instructed Kangna that she had to hold on to it with all her might like she would in real life. They got it right even though he had<br />
to drag her on the road.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Haydon was quite impressive and spontaneous in her role of the free-spirited French-Indian woman, Vijaylaksmi. So were the non-Indian actors. The film seems to get the casting right.</strong></p>
<p>When I met Lisa and auditioned her, I found her to be just like the free-spirited Vijay. I wanted her to retain her natural charm and vivaciousness. She worked really hard, rehearsing her French every day for an entire month. The casting of Boyko Mish (Olik) and Jeffery Ho (Taka) was also interesting. We went to London for the auditions, where I met them for a day. After that I saw the actors on the day of the shoot. Between that<br />
time I would Skype and brief them on their parts.</p>
<p>In fact, I spotted Joseph Guitobh (Tim) singing on the street and asked him if he would like to be a part of a Bollywood film. Joseph didn’t know a word of English, and I showed it in the scene where he shows his gang the four rock show tickets, saying one-one-one-one, instead of one-two-three-four.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the climax could have shown Rani coming into her own by showing her to be more ‘evolved’?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn’t have liked to change the climax. She doesn’t make any statement or talk about her future plans.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014920&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sonakshi Sinha, who  turned into a voice-over artist for the Hindi dubbed version of <em>Rio 2</em>, has also sung a few lines for a party number in the film. The actress, who has lent her voice for Jewel &#8211; the macaw, was recently snapped dubbing for the film at Sound and Vision studios in Mumbai. “There is a scene where Jewel is seen dancing and singing, so they made me sing as well,” stated Sinha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Album dedicated to Haveli Sangeet launched</strong></p>
<p>The Padma Binani foundation launched a special album containing three CDs produced by their wings, Vatsalaya (writing for children), Akshar (writing publication) and Suranjali (music). The album aims at promoting Indian culture and art. Titled <em>Mangal Roop Nidhaan Saavro</em>, the songs in each CD celebrates different  occasions and seasons like summer, winter and Lord Krishna’s birth. The songs honour the ancient Haveli Sangeet tradition  and have been performed by popular artists of the genre— The Tailang brothers (Gaurav and Gokulendu Tailang). The album was launched in the presence of several artists last week, including Ravindra Jain, Anup Jalota  among others.</p>

<p><em>Karlo Baatein</em><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>A fresh take</strong></p>
<p>By <strong>Priya Adivarekar</strong></p>
<p>Among the host of budding singers presenting their work through independent singles and music albums, singer Abu recently released his debut album, <em>Karlo Baatein</em>. Featuring seven tracks, which are composed by Nikhil Kamath with lyrics penned by Vimal Kashyap, the album is a melange of songs from different genres of music. Most of the tracks in the album are sung by Abu, with the exception of a duet number for which singer Sadhna Sargam has been roped in. The opening track, <em>FM tere dil ka meri dhadkan</em>, is a romantic dance number, with retro beats dominating the rhythm.<br />
The title track, <em>Karlo baatein</em>, follows next, which is a breezy romantic number. The use of guitar in this track is pretty interesting, but the composer could have experimented with the pace. <em>Teri yaad sataye piya</em> is strictly average, as it takes you back in the ‘90s with its slow rhythm, use of <em>dhol</em> and a melancholic tone. The rock based <em>Mahiya</em> tries to experiment by fusing Urdu words with some hard rock beats, but sadly, none of the above mentioned elements stand out. <em>Jaane jaan jafa ka</em> will take you back in time again, especially because of its dated lyrics and typical use of sounds.<br />
The upbeat <em>Main tere bin</em>a is good, while the last song of the album, Just fooling around sounds straight out of a Shammi Kapoor film. It is very similar to the opening track of the album, albeit with a better pace and beats. As a singer, Abu has a fine voice quality and has sung all the tracks very well, but he will need to experiment with some more genres before he can officially arrive on the music scene. Listen to this album if you miss the good ol’ days of the ‘90s.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013446&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/deool267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013327" alt="A still from Deool, which aired in the 11pm Sunday slot on Doordarshan recently" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/deool267.jpg" /></a> A still from <em>Deool</em>, which aired in the 11pm Sunday slot on Doordarshan recently
<p>Over the last two years, Doordarshan has brought about changes to its channel programming in an effort to win back its audience. One of these was to introduce a slot to screen films that have won National Awards and done rounds of international film festivals. It now follows up on that by creating a weekly slot for Hollywood blockbusters.<br />
“We have tied up with Lionsgate, an agency that purchases the rights to Hollywood films and international television shows for airing. As of now, we are going to try it out free of charge; if the slot is a success, we will make it permanent,” says Tripurari Sharan, Directorate General, Doordarshan. He said that the slot will be introduced by the end of March.<br />
The slot for the indie films — 11pm on Sundays — which was introduced in October last year has yet to pick up. “We received 175 entries for it and shortlisted 74 films. This slot is a long-term investment for us and we will not make changes at present.”<br />
The channel has tied up with channels such as Star Plus and Zee to simulcast <em>Satyamev Jayate</em> (the second season is now on air) and <em>Mahabharat</em> respectively. On the other hand, it has also introduced some new infotainment shows, the kind that National Geographic and Discovery airs, such as <em>Lakshaya: Ek Living Planet</em> that addresses environmental issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sony launches <em>Mission Mumbai</em> </strong></p>
<p>As part of a consumer initiative awareness, <em>CID</em> will cater to various localities of Mumbai every weekend for the next one month, inviting people within the vicinity to participate in various <em>CID</em> games, symbolising the four characters of <em>CID</em>. The activities, which spans over 3 days will culminate in <em>CID Mission Mumbai</em> event. The on-ground event witnesses <em>CID</em> cops felicitating local heroes for their heroic deeds, making Mumbai safe.<br />
<em>Mission Mumbai</em> kickstarted at Pratiksha Nagar in Sion last week. The cast of <em>CID</em>, comprising of ACP Pradyuman (Shivaji Satam), Daya (Dayanand Shetty), Abhijeet (Aditya Shrivastava) Dr. Salunke (Narendra Gupta) among others, felicitated the real-life heroes, who have made a difference to the society. Among those felicitated was a man who saved a girl from rape and a lawyer, who’s known to fight cases for the locals without charging a penny.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/queen2671.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014471" alt="Kangana as Queen" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/queen2671.jpg" /></a> Kangana as Queen
<p>Despite the fact that it was the only big release last Friday, Sonam Kapoor &#8211; Ayushmann Khurrana’s slice-of-life flick <em>Bewakoofiyaan</em> got a below average opening on the first day. Although Nupur Asthana’s directorial venture showed a lot of promise initially, with a number of promotional activities planned by Yash Raj Films, it looks like the film failed to strike a chord with its target audience &#8211; youngsters, because of the ongoing exam period. However last week’s release<em> Queen</em> is going rock steady at the box-office, leaving <em>Gulaab Gang</em> and <em>Total Siyapaa</em> far behind.</p>
<p><strong>Almost there</strong></p>
<p>Going by the early trends, the buzz around <em>Bewakoofiyaan</em> was pretty low. Although the film was targetted at the multiplex audience, a spokesperson from Cinemax &#8211; PVR confirmed that the film’s opening did not match up to their expectations. A good number of shows, around 20 &#8211; 22, were allotted to the film. Although the noon shows saw a dull turnout, the evening shows were expected to get a decent start, but that was not the case. The first few shows opened to a meagre 15-20 per cent, which slowly went up to 50-60 percent during the evening shows. Even the weekend shows haven’t seen a big jump, thanks to the low word-of-mouth publicity and mixed responses coming in from those who have seen the film. “Despite having a fairly good starcast and a solo release, the occupancy in the morning and noon shows was a meagre 20 per cent. The ongoing examination and relatively low buzz surrounding the film kept a major chunk of the cine-going youngsters away from the cinema halls,” stated trade analyst Taran Adarsh.<br />
Mayank Shroff, manager &#8211; programming and marketing, Cinepolis, stated that the film got a below average opening at the Cinepolis chain of multiplexes on the first Friday. “It was just around 60 per cent occupancy and we are not expecting a bigger jump during the weekends. It might just reach a peak of 70 &#8211; 75 per cent, which may not be enough for the film,” he said. Trade expert Vinod Mirani believes that although most films in the last couple of weeks have seen a slow start on the first day, <em>Bewakoofiyaan</em> does not have a long life at the BO. “The long weekend won’t help the film either,” he added.<br />
On the first day, the film has managed to collect Rs. 2.23 cr nett, which is certainly less, keeping in mind the budget of the film, which is Rs.22 crore (including cost of production). A lot will depend on the weekend collections and how the film fares during the weekdays.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The <em>Queen</em>’s rule</strong></p>
<p>On the other hand, the Kangana Ranaut-starrer, <em>Queen</em> which released last week continues to get decent footfalls in most theatres. “<em>Queen</em> almost saw a similar situation like <em>Bewakoofiyaan</em> on the first day, but the strong word of mouth publicity certainly helped the film.<em> Queen</em> will certainly benefit from the three-day long weekend,” stated Mirani, adding that the film collected Rs.2 crore on an average on the second Friday, taking the collections to Rs. 20.30 crore all India nett (first week collections being Rs. 18.80 crore). Adarsh agrees and mentioned that the film saw a phenomenal growth in business during the first week. According to Shroff, the average occupancy at Cinepolis multiplexes is around 60 &#8211; 70 percent, which is good for a film in its second week. Manoj Desai of G7 multiplexes stated that although<em> Bewakoofiyaan</em>’s estimate weekend occupancy is around 70 per cent, it is <em>Queen</em> that will continue to reign during the long weekend, with almost houseful shows.<br />
The other two releases,<em> Gulaab Gang</em> and <em>Total Siyapaa</em>, are slowly phasing out. While <em>Total Siyapaa</em> has been pulled off, <em>Gulaab Gang</em> has been given one &#8211; two shows on an average. “Both the films did not see any growth. During the weekdays, only a handful of people would turn up for<em> Gulaab Gang</em>. Both the films have fared poorly,” mentioned Mirani. Shroff stated that while <em>Total Siyapaa</em> is discontinued in most centres, it is still given one show in North India and Punjab.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>International buzz</strong></p>
<p>While there was no international release this Friday, last week’s release <em>300: Rise Of The Empire</em> is still going strong. “<em>300..</em> certainly saw the best opening last week and even now, it continues to get an average footfall. The occupancy is anywhere around 40 &#8211; 50 percent, which is good,” stated Shroff. The film continues to do well at Cinemax &#8211; PVR, with two &#8211; three shows on an average.<br />
With no big release coming up next week, trade experts believe that <em>Ragini MMS 2</em> will get an upper hand over <em>Gang of Ghosts</em>, because of the popularity of its music and the already established franchise. “Sunny Leone’s inclusion has created some buzz and the music is doing well. The film will get a decent start.<em> Gang of Ghosts</em> is an upbeat, comedy with a different take on horror. Since the film is based on a popular Bengali film, the content will be crucial here. Good word-of-mouth publicity should help the film,” stated Desai.</p>
<p><strong>All figures provided are of the opening day, since we closed our </strong><br />
<strong>issue early due to the Holi holiday.</strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[A major part of the 34-day shooting  schedule of Vartak Nagar- The Story Of Four Crows was spent in capturing action sequences, says debutant director Atul Taishete<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013175&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

<p>Ask debutant director Atul Taishete the most challenging part of shooting <em>Vartak Nagar &#8211; The Story Of Four Crows</em>, and he promptly retorts, “The action sequences.” The film, based in the 80s, has three layers &#8211; friendship between four lower-class boys who go to an English medium school in Mumbai’s mill area, the turf struggle between gangster Jimmy Sheirgill and a mill worker’s union leader Raghu Ram, and the mill strike of 1983.<br />
“<em>Vartak Nagar</em> is a commercial, violent but fun film. It is shot in real locations in Mumbai and several action scenes with five-six major ones, have been picturised for the film. The one which stands out is the big fight during the Ganapati festival, between two gangs led by Jimmy and Raghu Ram. The fight had scale, and we shot in a South Mumbai colony with 200 junior artistes and about 30 fighters. To retain the 80s look and feel, the action sequences had hand-to-hand fights using knives, fists and choppers. No cables, flying men or modern equipment was used by fight director Salam Ansari. But they were well choreographed and directed and despite the large scale of the action went off pretty well,” said the writer and short film-maker-turned-director.<br />
The film is about friendship of four teenagers played by Mohak Meet, Shantanu Rangnekar, Jayesh Kardak and Ashitosh Gaikwad, and they will also be involved in some heavy duty action scenes. “Filming action scenes with children is always risky. An ambulance and a doctor were always present on the set in case anyone was injured,” he said.<br />
<em>Vartak Nagar</em> is presented by Kunal Kohli Productions and produced by Adarsh Telly Media and Dione Entertainment. It is slated to release later this year.</p>

<p>In a first-of-its kind promotional strategy, producer Sunil Bohra will be releasing 35 posters of his upcoming production venture, <em>Mastram</em>. Since the film is a colourful erotica about a series of porn fiction books written by a reluctant writer, who writes under the pseudonym <em>Mastram</em>, Bohra thought it would be interesting to give the film’s promotional activities a new twist.<br />
“I come from a film family and since years, I have seen how important the look of a poster can be when it comes to promoting the film. <em>Mastram</em> is a whacky film, with a different take on life and things. So we thought, why not present several posters of the film, instead of just sticking to two-three boring ones? At first, we designed 10 posters. Gradually, the number went up and we ended up designing 35 quirky posters,” stated Bohra. One of the posters depicts a pen, while another shows the protagonist fervently working on the typewriter. He plans to put up one different poster in each area of Mumbai, so that the audience gets to see a new look of the film wherever they go.<br />
Directed by debutant Akhilesh Jaiswal who had written <em>Gangs of Wasseypur</em>, the film stars Rahul Bagga and Tara Alisha Berr. Produced by Bohra brothers and Jar Picture Productions, <em>Mastram</em> is scheduled to release on May 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Mango</em> to release in June &#8211; July</strong></p>
<p>Abbas Tyrewala’s next directorial venture, <em>Mango</em>, starring Rannvijay Singh, Monali Thakur, Swara Bhaskar among others, which was earlier scheduled to release on April 11, has now been pushed to a later date. Confirming the news, the director stated that it’s unlikely for the film to release in April, since they still have some work left. The film is now scheduled to hit the screens by June &#8211; July. “We were being a bit optimistic about the completion. But it looks like the film will only be ready by end of April. Only then can MSM Motion Pictures and Kaleidoscope Entertainment figure out the release strategy. Honestly, I am very happy because June &#8211; July are traditionally the best months for films aimed at a younger crowd,” mentioned Tyrewala.</p>

<p>After Bangalore-based MD Pallavi finished her play, C Sharp C Blunt, in Delhi last week, a famous dancer met her backstage and said, “You were so good that, for a moment, it crossed my mind that I should give up performing.” Pallavi, 35, also won over the jury for the Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards (META) and took home prizes for Best Actor (Female), Best Original Script (with co-writers Sophia Stepf, Swar Thounaojam and Irawati Karnik) and Best Innovative Sound-Music Design (with Stepf and Nikhil Nagaraj). Excerpts from an interview:</p>
<p><strong>C Sharp C Blunt is an unusual play, especially because you play a mobile app.</strong></p>
<p>This play centres around Shilpa, an attractive mobile phone app. She is created using the latest technology, and will sing for the audience. They decide the song, the voice she should sing in — from sugary and sexy — and she can also shake her hips. Best of all, she behaves the way men expect women to. Since it is a solo show, I play Shilpa as well as the three elements that make her up — mind, body and voice. The mind is the programmer, the body is the actor, and the voice is the singer. Each of them has a story — the programmer quits Shilpa to design a game, the singer is battling pressures to get married and the actor has to field questions about working out late.</p>
<p><strong>In the second half, the app begins to malfunction.</strong></p>
<p>Not only the app, each character begins to malfunction. Social conditioning happens just the way an app is created. When the audience “uses” Shilpa, there is a discomfort arising from “using” the female. Then, the app gets upgraded and something goes wrong — it will not obey all commands. We were sure we did not want an angry play, so we kept the mood humourous.</p>
<p><strong>Was the production autobiographical in any way?</strong></p>
<p>There is a scene in which a singer is being made to sing lewd songs. A few years ago, something like this had happened to me. A producer had, bit by bit, tweaked my voice to how he wanted it to be.</p>
<p><strong>How did you construct the play?</strong></p>
<p>It is a collaboration between me and Sophia Stepf, who is based in Germany. When she proposed the idea of a play that used looping software that are common in electronic music performances and explore the lives of women in showbiz, I decided to try it out. For almost a year, we were only putting ideas in a Dropbox. When Irawati Karnik and Swar Thounaojam came on board, we had a 20-day workshop and the final structure was created. Rehearsals began last year.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your background in theatre and music.</strong></p>
<p>I belong to a family of artistes, with painters, actors and musicians. I couldn’t have done anything else. I began to lean Hindustani music when I was five, I began acting before I can remember. I am married to a drummer so emotion and passion rule our lives. Like all artistes, I am not normal and, thankfully, my family is like that. Once, we performed a street play in the rain with only two people, both with umbrellas, watching. The street was empty except for us because my grandfather said, “The two people have watched half the play, so we must finish it.” The motto we live by is that the show must go on.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013194&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aditi267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013222" alt="Aditi Bhagwat" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/aditi267.jpg" /></a> Aditi Bhagwat
<p>By <strong>Farida Khanzada</strong></p>
<p>When Aditi Bhagwat stepped on the stage for the first time, she was only five years old. Playing innocuous roles in her mother, classical danseuse Ragini Bhagwat’s dance troupe, the experience instilled confidence in her, so that when she faced the august gathering at Raj Bhavan when she was 16 years old, she had dignitaries, including the then Governor of Mumbai, P.C. Alexander spell-bound. “That performance made me realise my true calling,” says Aditi, who has embarked on a two and a half months tour of the US and Canada, under the aegis of Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation, a non-profit organisation dedicated to providing educational facilities and rural development in India.<br />
With a troupe consisting of four musicians, a drummer, a sarangi player, a tabla player and singer, Aditi who is the producer as well as the creative director of the show, will be showcasing the entire journey of classical Hindustani music and kathak to its present role in mainstream cinema. “I have incorporated elements of folk, lavani and kathak. It’s a good combination of live music and dance, using audio-visual technology, giving the effect of doing footwork on stage, with the screen showing my performance. I will perform on Draupadi chirharan, Jatayumoksh besides other acts, involving the fusion of tabla and sarangi,” reveals Aditi.<br />
Trained by Dr Rashul Kumarji and Nandita Puri in the Jaipur style of kathak, Aditi’s experiments with different dance forms began at an early age. A Maharashtrian, the tilt towards the popular folk dance form, lavani was natural, but taking it further, Aditi did not hesitate to give a kathak performance on jazz music. Her collaboration with jazz musician, Louis Banks also saw the birth of an unique style of composition, matching lavani steps with jazz tunes. They formed a band, Akriti which has been performing across the length and breadth of India and abroad for the past 10 years. “We have collaborated jazz music with lavani, using common elements, like jazz blue, baithakichi lavani, in which the dancer sits, using facial expressions during the performance. We have also done kathak-jazz fusion, sometimes adding elements of lavani too. This is when I started doing collaborative work, fusing various styles,” explains Aditi.<br />
Using the innocuous ghungroo, “Jiska mahatva sirf ek adornment, ya part of a costume mana jaata hai, was used in rhythm with the beat of string instruments. That is when the idea of foot percussion came about and I sent a proposal to a fellowship programme initiated by the state department of the US called One Beat. In classical dance, our feet moves in rhythm with a tabla or a pakhwaj, in lavani we combine it with the dholki. So I used the sound of ghungroo to match the pace of drums; jaise ke taal vaadya ho vaise mein ghungroo ka istemal kiya,” explains Aditi. The trip also opened doors of future collaborations, working with musicians from Korea, Egypt, Venezuela. She created rhythm through footwork using her ghungroos in tune with string instruments like the cuatro (Venezulean guitar), created a sound quality that mesmerised the audience, who were unaware that the usual tabla and drum were not used. Her natural progression from classical dancer to lavani to a foot percussionist evolved from these collaborations. “I wanted to show this sargam through my dance. At times, I don’t follow the ghungroo, but the song, for instance, if there is a flute playing in the background then my movements move to the rhythm of the flute. I like to work with music and rhythm together, instead of just focussing on the beat,” says Aditi.<br />
The Riturang Festival held on February 23 in Aurangabad, saw a jugalbandi of kathak and lavani. “Kathak ke bol hai, but bhav lavani ki body language mein dhala hai. It was a challenge since, classical ki bandish le ke chakradar ke bol, tarang ke bol maine lavani ki body language mein dhala hai. Gaano ke saath kathak ki nok jhok bhi hai,” says Aditi. The innovative danseuse has also used gypsy music during her kathak and flamenco performances. Drawing similarities between flamenco dance and kathak, Aditi says, “gypsy music has its roots in India. These are people who travelled to eastern parts of Europe, Spain, etc, that is why we find similarity between flamenco and kathak. Rajasthani kalbelia mein bhi bahut similarities milti hai.”<br />
Closer home, Aditi has also popularised the dance form, laikari which she describes as following the rhythm of a heartbeat. “Between two beats you can fill it with different taals, harkates to compose a piece. It requires tremendous practise and sadhna to play around with rhythm. I hope, I will be able to master it in this life,” ends Aditi on an optimistic note.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Leaving a career in crime journalism behind, Actress Meera Chopra is all set to fulfill her dream by making her Hindi film debut in Gang of Ghosts. The Delhi girl talks to Screen about her beginnings, the big break and why cousin Priyanka is her role model<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013117&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

<p><strong>Launch Vehicle</strong></p>
<p><em>Gang of Ghosts</em> is a fun film, which is a satire on after life. Satish sir has tried to convey that not all ghosts are scary and that there can be funny ghosts in this world too, who actually live like normal people. It&#8217;s a very funny script and the changes that Satish sir has made to the script has taken it a notch above. It&#8217;s humorous and very interesting. I play the youngest ghost in the house named Tina. She&#8217;s love struck and for her, the most important thing is to spread love.</p>
<p><strong>Casting coup</strong></p>
<p>Actually, I had already signed Vikram Bhatt&#8217;s <em>1920 London</em>, when Satish sir heard about me and called me to his office. He spoke to me for sometime and somehow, that turned out to be my audition. He is a veteran director and for him, it was very easy to judge who would be the perfect choice for Tina&#8217;s role. He narrated the script and I fell in love with it. I couldn&#8217;t say yes to it immediately, because my dates were clashing with the schedule of <em>1920 London</em>. But fortunately for me, the film was delayed and I called Satish sir to inform him that I am ready to start shooting. That&#8217;s how I came on board.</p>
<p><strong>Stepping stone</strong></p>
<p>I have done my schooling from Delhi, after which, I went to America for further studies. I did my Masters in Mass Communication and majored in advertising and journalism. It was my dream to become a crime journalist, because Arnab Goswami is my favourite and there were times when I dreamed about being in his place. I also worked in New York for a year in an advertising firm, before coming back to india. After coming back to India, I started working with NDTV as a trainee. That&#8217;s when I started getting lots of modelling offers. I did a couple of print ads and suddenly, offers from the south film industry started pouring in. I did my first film down South, <em>Bangaram</em>, which was a huge hit and since then there was no looking back.</p>
<p><strong>First shot</strong></p>
<p>My first shot for <em>Gang of Ghosts</em> was quite intimidating, despite the fact that I was pretty confident when I had faced the camera for my first Telugu film. Here, I was a bit scared, especially because I was shooting with all the veteran actors around. I was excited but at the same time scared too. But fortunately for me, all&#8217;s well that ends well. The crew supported me a lot.</p>
<p><strong>The takeaway</strong></p>
<p>After working on this film, I think I feel extremely confident now, since I have had the privilege of sharing screen space with many experienced actors. Watching Anupam (Kher) sir and Saurabh (Shukla) sir perform on the sets was a great learning experience. They are so spontaneous. You just cannot expect what they will come up with next.</p>
<p><strong>Stumbling block</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>Gang of Ghosts</em> has been an extremely fun experience. All the actors were very sweet and helpful. I was the youngest on the set, so I was always pampered. There was no stumbling block, really.</p>
<p><strong>Role model</strong></p>
<p>Every female who has stood for herself in life is my inspiration. There are so many strong women around us who keep inspiring us all time. As far as the industry is concerned, I have always said that I look up to Priyanka Chopra. Every girl who is an outsider and wants to get a foothold in this industry should look upto her. What she has achieved being someone who does not belong to a film family, is nothing less than a fairytale.</p>
<p><strong>Future projects</strong></p>
<p>Right now, I have got Vikram Bhatt&#8217;s <em>1920 London</em>, which I am still shooting for. Otherwise, I am waiting for something more exciting to come my way.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/halla267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013253" alt="A still  from the first episode that dealt with eve-teasing" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/halla267.jpg" /></a> A still from the first episode that dealt with eve-teasing
<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Episodic, Bindass, Friday, 7 pm</p>
<p>The harassment and abuse faced by women and young girls has brought much disgrace to this country. Be it in metropolitian cities like Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai or a rural village in Haryana; the cries of victims have reached its peak, but still, there is no respite. Open the newspaper or tune into a newschannel and you will find atleast one such incident being highlighted in the media almost everyday. A report released after the Delhi rape case of 2012 stated that on an average, one woman suffers sexual abuse or harassment in every 20 minutes, in some corner of the country. While the court proceedings of such incidents carry on, the fear lives on and the victims continue to live under depression, while some lose their lives.<br />
To build a sense of awareness and let people know about the ground realities of such problems, several shows have been launched in the past one year which show visual representations of real stories. Bindass has also launched a new show dedicated to the issues faced by women on the eve of International Women&#8217;s Day. Titled <em>Halla Bol</em>, the show is an one hour episodic, which deals with a women&#8217;s issue every week. The main aim of this show is to encourage women to stand up and take a stand against the people who have caused them harm. The road may not be easy, but bringing the ghastly incident out is definitely better than accusing yourself for the incident.<br />
The initial episodes of the show have dealt with two problems with maximum cases in this country, eve teasing and child abuse. The lead protagonist in the first episode, Esha, is a young girl from Faridabad who aspires to become a fashion designer. Her only mode of transport for daily commute to college are the private buses, which turns into a horror hell for her as she faces the wrath of eve teasers everyday, along with two other girls. While Esha&#8217;s dreams take a turn for the worse when the two men attack and almost strip her after a small altercation, the lead protagonist in the second episode, Arti, lives under the constant fear of her uncle coming back from America. Arti is a victim of child abuse and it is this very uncle who had ruined her childhood.<br />
While major portions of both the episodes show the trauma that these girls go through, especially while facing their parents and approaching people for help, the climax shows their rise, as they stand up against everyone and teach their tormentors a lesson. Towards the end of every episode, an actress comes forward and talks about someone in their life who has gone through a similar incident and how girls should deal with it. Kangana Ranaut spoke very well in the first episode, as she discussed the nightmare that her sister, Rangoli, had to go through after the acid attack. Ranaut spoke very little, but her words certainly left an impact.<br />
As a show, the choice of cast in each episode was perfect. The visual representation wasn&#8217;t too fake and the actors have delivered a decent, emotionally controlled performance. Host Karan Tacker is also good as the narrator. But what really stands out is the step taken by Bindass to create awareness about such problems. Some may choose to ignore it saying it is just a television show, but sometimes, all you need is a small spark to build up a fire against such horrific incidents.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> A must watch for all those who underestimate girl power!</p>

<p>It’s OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so. As a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next-door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, Neighbors, that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.<br />
Packed with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes — including a cringe-worthy bumble with a breast pump — the war spirals into depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta Psi Beta frat next-door, led by its slightly damaged president, Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron. But as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film’s biggest battle turns out to be internal.<br />
It is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to “get-off-my-lawn” adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they are sorry to see disappear.<br />
“When you have a kid, that’s great, and obviously amazing, but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous life,” Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters in an interview after the movie’s first public screening. “That’s probably good in some ways, but it’s also a bummer in some ways.”<br />
Early reviews have been largely positive, with critics appreciating the movie’s nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior features writer Andrew Barker describes as “lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid” than previous Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American theatres on May 9.</p>
<p>The audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn. Mac and Kelly’s frantic debate over how to say “keep it down” in a cool way was a crowd favourite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool?</p>
<p><strong>I know these guys</strong></p>
<p>The inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said. He and writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O’Brien are of similar age and going through the same life changes as Mac and Kelly are — not to mention their own fans. “All of a sudden it just started to seem like we were more likely to be the ones calling the cops on the kids partying than to be the kids partying,” Rogen said with a laugh. “That to us was really fertile and original and something we all really related to, and once we started having those conversations, that’s when the movie, I think, took a great shape.”<br />
Byrne’s likable portrayal of Kelly as an enthusiastic partner in revenge earned critical accolades for the Bridesmaids actress. Kelly Radner is not your typical stick-in-the-mud movie wife trying to get her immature husband to quit messing with the frat boys. She helps defeat them.<br />
Efron, characterised by Variety’s Barker as giving “one of his most credible and intriguing performances” as the charismatic Teddy. Crediting Rogen and others in helping him adequately deliver Teddy&#8217;s multi-faceted character, Efron said, “I have a couple of friends like this, and Teddy is sort of a mixture of their best and worst qualities. I know these guys. I&#8217;ve felt those feelings.”</p>

<p><strong>Although <em>Queen</em> did not open well, it picked up and did a business of Rs.18 crore by the end of the first week.</strong></p>
<p>The reviews of the film have been really overwhelming, and frankly I am not counting the monies. But it is doing well as the the word-of-mouth is really good. <em>Queen</em> is not a niche film, and is doing equally well in single screens. It’s funny, relatable and has reached out to a wide audience.</p>
<p><strong>Kangana Ranaut’s character, Rani, is quite delightful, perfectly capturing the nuances of a Delhi girl. How did you get that right?</strong></p>
<p>I am from Delhi. Having observed my sisters and friends, I know life for girls is planned out for them by their families. They lose their own perspective on life and they are okay with that. They are happy to be told what to do. And where Kangana was concerned she was not doing anything funny. As a writer, I had to just step back and think how a girl, whose world has come to an end, would react and behave in the situation she was in. There were a lot of inputs from Kangana too. In the scene with the French chef, it was she who suggested about the lip-to-lip kiss. Likewise the scene where she tells a stranger to click her picture in Amsterdam was suggested by her. In fact, I gave her full freedom. She knew how to maintain the fine line of her character, which otherwise would have become a caricature and fallen flat. The film could not not have been made in 45 days without her complete involvement.</p>
<p><strong>The detailing was also perfect &#8211; right from Kangana’s <em>mehndi</em> fading gradually as the days pass, to the way she saves her bag from the roadside robber.</strong></p>
<p>Getting the<em> mehndi</em> colour right was a real monkey business, because the film was not shot linear. We first shot in Paris and then Amsterdam, then Delhi and with some interior shots in between. I was particular about the detailing of the colour not going wrong, it was top my mind. I remember a part of it becoming dark in Paris. There’s a saying that if <em>mehndi</em> turns dark, the bride will be doted upon by the mother-in-law. But Rani didn’t have a mother-in-law in the picture, so I made to make sure the shade was light.<br />
The bag snatching scene was also very genuine. I told the junior actor that he had to snatch the bag from her with all his might, and instructed Kangana that she had to hold on to it with all her might like she would in real life. They got it right even though he had to drag her on the road!</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Haydon was quite impressive and spontaneous in her role of the free-spirited French Indian woman, Vijaylaksmi. So were the non-Indian actors. The film seem to get the casting right.</strong></p>
<p>When I met Lisa and auditioned her, I found her to be just like the free-spirited Vijay; I wanted her to retain her natural charm and vivaciousness, and be herself. So I asked her to use her own clothes, accessories etc. in the film because giving her a costume would make her feel that she has to act. I must mention that she worked really hard, rehearsing her French every day for an entire month.<br />
The casting of Boyko Mish (Olik) and Jeffery Ho (Taka) was also interesting. We went to London for the auditions, where I met them for a day. After that I saw the actors on the day of the shoot. Between that time I would skype and brief them their parts. In fact, I spotted Joseph Guitobh (Tim) singing on the street and asked him if he would like to be part of a Bollywood film. Joseph didn’t know a word of English, and I showed it in the scene where he shows his gang the four rock show tickets saying one-one-one-one, instead of one-two-three-four!</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the climax could have shown Rani coming into her own by showing her to be more ‘evolved’ so as to say? And what’s next?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn’t have liked to change the climax. She doesn’t make any statement, or talk about her future plans. Just happily walking away by herself was, I felt, a good way to end the film. My next film is with Shahid Kapoor, which talks about destination weddings. It should take off in the middle of this year, till then I am just chilling!<br />

<p>Three Arab countries have banned the Hollywood film Noah on religious grounds even before its worldwide premiere and several others are expected to follow suit, a representative of Paramount Pictures told Reuters recently. Islam frowns upon representing holy figures in art and depictions of the Prophet Mohammad in European and North American media have repeatedly sparked deadly protests in Islamic countries over the last decade, fanning cultural tensions with the West.<br />
“Censors for Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) officially confirmed this week that the film will not release in their countries,” a representative of Paramount Pictures, which produced the $125 million film starring Oscar-winners Russell Crowe and Anthony Hopkins, told Reuters.<br />
“The official statement they offered in confirming this news is because ‘it contradicts the teachings of Islam’,” the representative said, adding the studio expected a similar ban in Egypt, Jordan and Kuwait.<br />
The film will premiere in the United States on March 28. Noah, who in the Bible’s Book of Genesis built the ark that saved his family and many pairs of animals from a great flood, is revered by Judaism, Christianity and Islam. An entire chapter in the Koran is devoted to him. Cairo’s Al-Azhar, the highest authority of Sunni Islam and a main center of Islamic teaching for over a millennium, issued a fatwa, or religious injunction, against the film.<br />
“Al-Azhar &#8230; renews its objection to any act depicting the messengers and prophets of God and the companions of the Prophet (Mohammad), peace be upon him,” it announced in a statement.<br />
They “provoke the feelings of believers &#8230; and are forbidden in Islam and a clear violation of Islamic law,” the fatwa added. Mel Gibson’s 2004 film The Passion of the Christ on Jesus’s crucifixion was widely screened in the Arab World, despite a flurry of objections by Muslim clerics. A 2012 Arab miniseries, Omar on the exploits of a seventh century Muslim ruler and companion of the Prophet Mohammad also managed to defy clerics’ objections and air on a Gulf-based satellite television channel.</p>
<p><strong>Protests</strong></p>
<p>The publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a Danish newspaper in 2006 touched off riots in the Middle East, Africa and Asia in which at least 50 people died. A 2012 amateur Youtube video deriding Mohammad produced in California stoked protests throughout the region, and may have contributed to a deadly militant raid in Libya which killed the U.S. ambassador and three other American staff.<br />
Noah, whose official video trailer depicts a burly Crowe wielding an axe and computer-animated geysers swamping an army of sinners hoping to board his ark, has also stoked religious controversy at home.<br />
Jerry A. Johnson, president of a conservative National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) group, said last month he wanted to “make sure everyone who sees this impactful film knows this is an imaginative interpretation of Scripture, and not literal.”<br />
Paramount responded by agreeing to issue a disclaimer on advertising for the film.<br />
“While artistic license has been taken, we believe that this film is true to the essence, values and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide,” the advisory reads.</p>

Yo Yo Honey Singh continues to be a sensation in the music industry, with his unique compositions and ever increasing fanbase<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013427&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yoyo267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013432" alt="Yo Yo Honey Singh" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yoyo267.jpg" /></a> Yo Yo Honey Singh
<p>In an industry popular for its typical <em>latka</em> and <em>jhatka</em> beats and soulful romantic numbers, rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh’s unique, high on energy tracks came as a refreshing change for youngsters. Most of them believe that they can connect to the chilled-out vibe and fast paced rhythm of his songs. Although he made his debut with a single in 2006 along with a few other artists like Ashok Masti, Singh went on to pursue a course in music from the Trinity school of music in London. “I thought it was an important move as an artist, since learning is always an added advantage,” quipped Singh. It was only in 2011 that he got noticed for his album International Villager and the song <em>Angrezi beat</em> became a rage. The song was later used in the film <em>Cocktail</em>, but little did Singh know that his association with Bollywood would only deepen in the years to come.<br />
From rapping with Akshay Kumar in <em>Khiladi 786</em> and <em>Boss</em> to shaking a leg with Shah Rukh Khan in <em>Lungi dance</em> from <em>Chennai Express</em> and Amitabh Bachchan in <em>Bhoothnath Returns</em>, the singer has done it all. Singh has now become the highest paid artist in Bollywood, charging anywhere between Rs. 70 to 75 lakhs for an entire package of singing, composing and writing a song. “And then, there are times when I make an appearance in the video too. It is so much fun. I remember, my mother was very excited when she heard that I will be dancing with Shah Rukh Khan in <em>Lungi dance</em>. She is a big fan of the actor, so I requested Khan <em>bhai</em> to speak to her over the phone. Then, another dream came true in the form of my upcoming promotional song video with Bachchan sir. My dad is a <em>khatarnaak</em> fan of him. From one proud moment to another, I am definitely living my dream. <em>Maa sherawali ka haath hain mujhpar, bas</em>,” mentioned Singh.<br />
Talking about special moments, Singh has encountered one too many, because of his global fan base. There are various budding singers who sing covers of his tracks and upload it on YouTube. Ask him about it and the singer smiles. “It’s sweet when you see people appreciating your work. I remember, when we were shooting for this song called<em> Bebo di yaan gallan</em> in London, a fan named Nesdi Jones came to meet me all the way from Wales. She used to play the piano in a hotel and someone told me that she has done a cover of my song,<em> Brown rang</em>. I was touched and that’s when I got to know that she has become a YouTube sensation by singing my songs,” he stated. It’s only later that the singer got to know that Jones is a trained vocalist and musician. The duo, along with artist Money Aujla, went on to collaborate on a track titled <em>London</em>. It became a huge hit, even topping the BBC Asian network music charts. Singh adds, “She is now known as <em>The Desi Gori</em> and has more than 25,000 fans on Facebook. Punjab aur Chandigarh <em>main toh bahut famous hain woh</em>. It feels good when such collaborations work out so well for a budding artist.”<br />
Although<em> Lungi dance</em> went on to become a big hit, the artist is not very happy with the fact that it did not get international recognition. “I really wanted <em>Lungi dance</em> to become bigger than Psy’s <em>Gangnam Style</em>. I thought it had the potential to become a bigger global hit. I don’t know what went wrong,” said Singh. He believes that it is high time that the global music industry takes notice of the ever changing music scene in India. Singh adds, “People abroad continue to associate our music with <em>sitar, tabla</em> and typical <em>shaadi waala naach gaana</em>. It’s like they can’t think we can be urbane as well. I want to create a song that proves it to them that yes, we can create unique compositions and we are not all about Bollywood. I am just waiting to release that one insane track, which will create history some day.”<br />
The singer confessed that even if he is pre-occupied with a line up of Bollywood projects, he wants to focus on his singles and the non-film music genre as well. Despite several projects coming his way everyday, the singer is keen on doing more work, even if it means working round-the-clock. “Many people told me that with regular appearances, my work may get over-exposed. But I want to use my fame to bring out all my compositions. Like the tune of my upcoming track in <em>Fugly</em> titled, <em>Yeh Fugly kya hain</em>, was actually created five years back. Right now, I have almost 100 different compositions ready, but they don’t fit into any film. For instance, my song <em>Blue eyes</em> will not fit into any film’s flow. Although I had big hits like <em>Party all night</em> and <em>Lungi dance</em>, there was no need for me to go all out and shoot a video at my own expense. But I can picturise my songs only with me in it. What I write is part of my own observation. They are things that common people relate to and what I see around me,” stated Singh.<br />
Now that he has shot for some music videos for films, the singer will soon leave for South Africa, where he will shoot four of his upcoming singles next month. Come June, Singh will also be seen making his Hindi film debut as an actor in a negative role in director Anant Mahadevan’s <em>The Xpose</em>. Ask about donning different hats and Singh promptly informs that music will always remain his first love. “Music <em>toh saath nahi chodega</em>. It is my bread and butter. I’ll be busy performing at various events, creating tracks and working on my singles throughout the year. I have already finished shooting for <em>The Xpose</em> in January. Surprise karna meri aadat hain, so people, better watch out for my awesome mix of work this year,” signs off Singh.</p>

<p>A scandalous affair, dysfunctional family dramas, missing babies, a blind piano player, Legos and James Franco make up an eclectic slate of spotlight films and documentaries at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival. The lineup of out-of-competition films announced recently in the ‘Spotlight’ section of the New York-based Tribeca festival, a section reserved for more prominent actors and directors, comprises 31 feature films, nine of which are documentaries.<br />
Highlights include Dito Montiel’s Boulevard, an existential family drama starring Robin Williams and Kathy Baker, crime thriller, Every Secret Thing and 5 to 7, an intense love story between an aspiring novelist and the wife of a French diplomat, starring Anton Yelchin and Berenice Marlohe. “Many films feature real-life personalities who’ve accomplished extraordinary feats, while in other films we see personal relationships at pivotal moments of transition,” Genna Terranova, Tribeca’s director of programming, said in a statement. Actor-filmmaker-writer Franco, a staple of the independent film community, will see the premiere of the film adaptation of his book of short stories, Palo Alto by director Gia Coppola, and also stars in Paul Haggis’ gritty love tale Third Person. In the documentaries, Keep On Keepin’ On explores the challenges of a talented 23-year-old blind piano player, while documentarian James Spione takes a look at the journey of two people charged under the U.S. Espionage Act in Silenced. An untitled documentary by film-makers Daniel Junge and Kief Davidson on the fans of Lego plastic toy building blocks will also have its world premiere at the film festival.<br />
Organisers also announced seven films in the Midnight section, which profiles “boundary-pushing genre films”, and five installations in the &#8216;Storyscapes’ section, which showcases interactive, multimedia story-telling formats. Championing independent movies and projects from U.S. and international film-makers, the Tribeca Film Festival was co-founded by actor Robert De Niro in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks on New York’s World Trade Center. The festival is aimed at reviving the economy and culture of Lower Manhattan’s TriBeCa neighbourhood. Organisers say the festival has generated an estimated $850 million in economic activity since its first year in 2002. This year&#8217;s edition will run from April 16 to 27.</p>

<p><strong>Walt Disney, Shanghai Media Group to develop Disney-branded movies</strong></p>
<p>Walt Disney Studios has signed an agreement with Shanghai Media Group Pictures to develop Disney-branded movies, the latest move by a U.S. studio to grow its presence in China’s entertainment business. U.S.-based writers will team up with local writers and film-makers to develop stories and scripts that incorporate Chinese themes in Disney movies, the studio said in a statement.<br />
The studio said the multi-year partnership with Shanghai Media will expand training opportunities between Chinese and American writers and filmmakers. Tony To, the studio’s executive vice president of production, will oversee the co-development programme, which could allow for easier releases of English-language films in China. A 37-member Film Censorship Committee vets every movie in China for nudity, violence and politically sensitive scenes. Western films in addition must meet the committee’s “amendment opinions” to be one of the 34 Hollywood films permitted in China each year. Last year, Disney’s superhero film Iron Man 3 debuted in China and included a top Chinese actress and footage shot in China.<br />
In February, the official Xinhua news agency reported that China will maintain its quota for imported Hollywood movies this year, rejecting reports it had planned to increase access for U.S. films to the world’s second-largest cinema market. Production companies like Viacom Inc’s Paramount Picture and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc have hired Chinese actors and set up co-productions with Chinese firms. China’s entertainment and media market is estimated to grow to $148 billion by 2015 from around $120 billion in 2013, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers’ outlook for the global entertainment and media business 2011-2015.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Indian cinema and its consumers are ready for a fresh perspective. The cast is no longer the clincher as suddenly there is a set of movie-goers who are looking for offbeat storylines, real-life inspired biopics and youth-driven scripts. And clearly it is the multiplex audience that is driving this new trend <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013236&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

<p>By <strong>Anindita Sarkar</strong></p>
<p>It’s the season to celebrate Bollywood. First, the <strong>20th Annual Screen Awards</strong> in January, followed by the <strong>59th Filmfare Awards</strong> the same month and then the<strong> Zee Cine Awards</strong> held last month. And what do they indicate? That Bollywood is changing. Why? Well, firstly because biopic as a genre has finally got the audience on fire. Courtesy <em>Bhaag Milkha Bhaag</em>, the genre was at the top of the jury list at all awards this year. Of course, niche, ‘star-less’ and content driven movies such as <em>Shahid</em> which won the best screenplay award at<em> Screen</em> and <em>The Lunchbox</em> which got the best debut director award at<strong> Zee Cine Awards</strong> also won accolades. And, a film like <em>Chennai Express</em> announced as the best marketing movie of the year at almost all events showcased how important marketing is for Bollywood, which continues to be largely an unorganised sector, still! It was the year 2012 when the sector experienced a new lease of life after several years of muted growth. Audiences returned to the theatres and India’s domestic theatrical revenues grew by 23.8 per cent year-on-year, thereby contributing almost 76 per cent to the Rs.11,240-crore film industry. However, experts argue that it was year 2013 that offered the most exquisite opportunities to the industry and won accolades for several successful experiments. In 2013, eight movies including <em>Grand Masti, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag</em> and <em>Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela</em> made it to the Rs.100-crore club. Also, three movies — <em>Dhoom 3, Chennai Express</em> and <em>Krrish 3</em> — managed to cross the Rs.200-crore box-office collection mark and thus, brought to an end the much-touted reign of Aamir Khan’s <em>3 Idiots</em> since year 2009.<br />
A 2012 versus 2013 comparison will suggest that the craving for South Indian remixes and ‘single-screen’ masala movies in 2012 waned in 2013. As a result, movies like <em>Policegiri, Bullet Raja</em> and <em>Ramaiya Vastavaiya</em> flopped at the box-office. In fact, even star-led movies such as <em>Boss</em> could not make much noise at the plexes unless they boasted enough of differentiated content. On the other hand, small budget movies such as<em> The Lunchbox, Fukrey</em> and <em>Aashiqui 2</em> with an even lesser known star-cast, tasted blood.<br />
Small (Rs.6-12 crore) and mid budget (Rs.15-40 crore) projects such as Sushant Singh Rajput’s <em>Kai Po Che</em>, YRF’s <em>Mere Dad Ki Maruti</em>, Farhan Akhtar’s home production <em>Fukrey</em>, Remo D’Souza’s<em> ABCD — Any Body Can Dance</em>, Arshad Warsi-starrer <em>Jolly LLB</em> and Kunal Khemu’s <em>Go Goa Gone</em> came as surprise hits, indicating that movies with offbeat storylines, real life inspirations, youth-driven scripts and served with a dash of humour were increasingly finding audiences. Movies that reach out to the multiplex audiences were clearly the norm for 2013. The motion picture business in India is expected to touch Rs.19,000 crore in the next five years, with multiplexes being the main driver. No wonder that multiplex chain operator PVR Cinemas added 69 screens in financial year 2013-14.<br />
“These were quite interesting signals. 2013 was a good year for the industry and showed us that audiences are now opting for high powered content. Cast is not as big a criteria as it used to be in the good old days and there is the emergence of an alternative menu. Consequently, it’s time for content creators like us to not just to set up projects, but to create cinema,” says Tanuj Garg, CEO—Balaji Motion Pictures.<br />
At the same time, the entry of studios in the film production business continues unabated, with television broadcaster Multi Screen Media (MSM) debuting in June 2013 through MSM Motion Pictures. Says Sneha Rajani, deputy president and head, MSM Motion Pictures, “Most media houses right now in India and across the globe are vertically integrated players. We are no different. We wanted to get into this business, especially in light of the way the movie business in India is growing.” MSM Motion Pictures aims to co-produce small to mid budget films costing Rs.5-15 crore. Rajani too agrees that 2013 has been a phenomenal year. “With the number of movies released and the the kind of businesses that they had, it only goes on to show that we have still not tapped the potential of the industry to the fullest. The movie making business is only going to grow exponentially in the next five years,” she added. For the record, MSM’s first co-production with Eros International, <em>Bajate Raho</em>, was released in July last year. Its latest co-production, <em>Darr @ the Mall</em>, released last month. <em>Youngistaan</em>, a collaborative venture between MSM Motion Pictures and the Vashu Bhagnani owned Pooja Pictures, releases on March 28.<br />
“Today, about 70-75 per cent of the domestic box office collections come from multiplexes. Ticket prices at multiplexes increase by about 10-15 per cent every year, so their contribution will only go up further,” says Shailesh Kapoor, co-founder and CEO at Ormax Media—the specialised media insights firm. According to Kamal Gianchandani, president, PVR Pictures, growth in the film business is led by two factors — growth in the number of people who come and watch (read admissions) and the growth in the ticket prices. “In 2013, growth was witnessed on both these parameters. The average ticket price (ATP) in multiplexes grew by about 7 per cent while the overall ATP growth nationwide was about 9 per cent. The admissions, meanwhile, have grown by 3-4 per cent,” he says.<br />
Quite evidently, Indian cinema and its consumers are ready for a fresh revolution.</p>
<p><strong>And therefore, the slate&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Viacom18 Motion Pictures (VMP), a full play studio that creates Hindi, English and regional language films, is set to release Manjunath, its next after the recent mid-budget movie <em>Queen</em>, starring Kangana Ranaut, for a March-end release. Set in India’s hinterland, the film is based on the real life story of Manjunath Shanmugham, an IIM Lucknow graduate, who joined an oil company and then went missing.<br />
Additionally, after the resounding success of<em> Bhaag Milkha Bhaag</em>, the studio is creating another biopic titled <em>Mary Kom</em> that portrays the journey of a woman pugilist who goes on to win an Olympic medal. The slate also includes <em>Dharam Sankat Mein</em>, a project that builds on the success of<em> OMG —Oh My God</em>. It is a satirical take on the religious idiosyncrasies of the common man. <em>Gabbar</em> is an action thriller with Akshay Kumar and the studio is also working with the award winning duo Sujoy Ghosh and Vidya Balan on a still unnamed thriller. VMP is also producing <em>Margarita With A Straw</em>, which describes the journey of Laila, a spunky girl born with cerebral palsy. Challenging the norm, it explores how a girl like Laila is curious about sexuality.<br />
Across town, Disney India (earlier known as Disney-UTV) too has a number of movies that span a wide variety of genres ranging from drama, action and horror to romance, comedy and thrillers. The slate also features the first set of locally produced Disney branded movies including <em>Khoobsurat, P.K., ABCD 2</em> and <em>Jagga Jasoos</em> (<em>ABCD 2</em> and <em>JJ</em> release next year). Meanwhile, Imtiaz Ali directed<em> Highway</em> which has just been released, Vishal Bhardwaj directed <em>Haider</em> which is to be released in September, the Salman Khan starrer <em>Kick</em>, an Eid release, directed by Sajid Nadiadwala, Kabir Khan directed <em>Phantom</em>, slated for an October release, and Kunal Deshmukh directed <em>Shaatir</em> are all slated to release this year. It is also co-producing the Lingusamy directed Tamil film, <em>Anjaan</em> starring Suriya, which is slated to release mid 2014.<br />
Now talk of Balaji Motion Pictures and here is how the slate looks like: <em>Shaadi Ke Side Effects</em>, a romantic comedy that released last month, <em>Ragini MMS-2</em>—India’s first ‘horror-and-sex feature that releases on March 21; <em>Main Tera Hero</em>, a romantic comedy that releases in April and <em>The Villain</em>, an action romance co-starring Sidharth Malhotra and Shraddha Kapoor, that releases in June. According to market sources, Balaji Motion Pictures is investing more than Rs. 120 crore into its film business this year which also includes the marketing and distribution costs.<br />
Meanwhile, the bigger studios including VMP and UTV are investing around Rs.500 crore this year. The smaller production houses are also aiming high. DAR Motion Pictures (DAR), a wholly owned subsidiary of DAR Capital Group, came into limelight last year with releases such as <em>The Lunchbox, D Day</em> and <em>Mickey Virus</em>. This year it intends to grow further with movies such as <em>Fattack</em>—a fun youth film against the canvas of ‘<em>gulli</em>’ cricket at a budget of Rs.6 crore, <em>Baaji</em>—the first Marathi vigilante superhero film essayed by Shreyas Talpade at a budget of Rs. 4 crore, <em>Bikini Murders</em> — a crime thriller with an international cast with a budget of Rs.45 crore) and <em>Haunted 2</em> &#8211; sequel to the 3D stereoscopic horror film <em>Haunted</em> 3D for a budget of Rs.2.15 crore.<br />
“In 2014,<em> Peekay, Kick, Singham 2</em> and <em>Happy New Year</em> are some of the big films. But you can be assured that there will be several mid-range films that will stand out, if they get good audience word-of-mouth after release,” adds Shailesh Kapoor, co-founder and CEO at Ormax Media—the specialised media insights firm.</p>

<p>Arshad Warsi has a very specific look in <em>The Legend Of Michael Mishra</em>, especially where it concerns his hair. Since it was the first time that the actor was donning a wig, the need for the perfect one was important. Kishor Arora, the film’s producer, ordered 12 custom-made wigs from Germany costing Rs.5 lakhs. “We are not releasing the ‘wigged’ look as yet, but Arshad will look very different from what you have seen him before,” said Arora.<br />
The comedy, directed by Manish Jha, kicked off in January this year in Delhi. Boman Irani, Aditi Rao Hydari and Kayoze Irani are also part of the film in which Arshad plays the title role.</p>

<p><strong>Amitabh Bachchan on the sets of <em>Bhoothnath Returns </em></strong></p>
<p>There was construction work going on in Versova, Mumbai where a shoot was scheduled for <em>Bhoothnath Returns</em>. Many roads were blocked and neither Amitabh Bachchan’s vanity van or his car could access the sets which was a long walk from the parking area. That’s when Bachchan came up with the idea  of travelling to the location on an automated scooter! And he  enjoyed himself thoroughly during the two-three days he was there. <em>Bhoothnath Returns</em> is directed by Nitesh Tiwari and produced by Bhushan Kumar and Abhay Chopra. It releases on April 11.</p>

<p>If recent films flaunting heroines in bikinis do not raise eyebrows or cause a buzz like it did when my films like <em>Dhoom</em> and <em>Dhoom 2</em> released, it’s because there’s nothing new to it. It’s only when something is not part of a regular culture, does it generate a lot of curiosity and excitement.<br />
Do you find Hollywood making a big deal of bikini scenes in their films? It’s a regular aspect of their lives, and is perhaps, present in most of their films. Now compare the frequency of bikini scenes in Indian films, which has only gone up lately. Much before <em>Dhoom</em>, a history of bikini scenes can be boiled down to three instances — Sharmila Tagore being the first to pose in a two-piece for a magazine cover. It created a sensation. Then came Vyjayanthimala, who, given her strong classical Indian background, created a sensation when she stepped into a swimsuit for Raj Kapoor’s <em>Sangam</em>. Finally, Zeenat Aman, who made the biggest impact as she stepped out of the sea in a scintillating white bikini for Feroz Khan’s<em> Qurbani</em>. Given her western image, the actor has become synonymous with the attire. In fact, she was even seen walking the streets wearing a bikini teamed with a <em>sarong</em> in<em> Dostana</em>. Those three bikini scenes before <em>Dhoom</em> went up by numbers post the release of the film. And when there’s too much of something, it fails to create a stir. For instance, Salman Khan removing his shirt is no longer news today.<br />
Why just bikini, there was a time when embracing or a hero touching a heroine was a big thing in the 1940s, and today a lip-to-lip lock between a lead pair is normal. The latter was a big deal when Aamir Khan kissed Karisma Kapoor in<em> Raja Hindustani</em>. Kissing scenes are now a part of Hindi films, it’s a different thing that only Emraan Hashmi got tagged as a serial kisser, even though everyone around him had being doing it for years.<br />
Bikini is part of a lifestyle reflected in films, where it now gets weaved into a story. When I made Kidnap, there was a scene where Minissha Lamba is seen heading off to the sea after an argument,and she gets kidnapped while swimming. So, it’s obvious she’s going to be dressed in a bikini. It’s like a <em>shaadi ka joda</em> — a bride is expected to wear that when there’s a scene around a marriage.<br />
The success of a bikini scenes also entail a lot of other factors like fitness and the actors involved. No two heroines will elicit the same reaction; each one comes with a different story to her. Sunny Leone’s ability to pull off a bikini in her film is not surprising; she has the confidence to pull it off. But Sonam Kapoor wearing a bikini in <em>Bewakoofiyaan</em> is something else as she has a different image. Even as a fashionista, she’s always so correct in the way she projects herself in films and outside it, so when she wears a swimsuit, there’s a certain amount of curiosity. It was the same with Esha Deol, who had a demure image before donning a bikini in <em>Dhoom</em>. But instead of wearing just the bikini, we made her wear a netting along with it to make it look sexier.<br />
Anything different becomes a marketing tool for a film, even though as a film-maker I don’t see merit in making bikini scenes the USP of a film, not when I have a story to tell. If a bikini scene fails to generate interest today, then I won’t be surprised to see the trend veering to going topless or nude. But at an age when there’s so much exposure to entertainment around the world, trying to make a big deal of such things rings false. Especially when even kids have access to the set-top box and remote, and surf through various channels.</p>
<p>As told to <strong>Priya Sugathan</strong></p>

<p><strong>Written and directed by:</strong> Soukarya Ghoshal</p>
<p><strong>Music:</strong> Mainak Nag Chowdhury</p>
<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Subhashish Mukherjee, Rajesh Sharma, Dr. Koushik Ghosh, Shantilal Mukherjee, Radhika Apte, Rajatava Dutta, Dwijen Banerjee, Anasuya Majumdar, Samadarshi Dutta, Sreelekha Mitra, Anindo Banerjee, Doelpakhi (debut) and others.</p>
<p>By <strong>Shoma A. Chatterji</strong></p>
<p><em>Pendulum</em> generally refers to a separate part of a large clock that functions as the time-keeping element and is a harmonic oscillator that swings back and forth at precise time intervals depending on its length and resists swinging at any other rhythm or speed. It was invented by Christian Huygens in 1656 and till the 1930s, the pendulum clock was the world’s most precise timekeeper.<br />
In Soukarya Ghoshal’s debut film, pendulum is a metaphor for many things &#8211; life, time-travel, death, destiny, love and relationships that oscillate and vacillate much like the pendulum of a huge clock. The anchor story is about a strange, reclusive painter (Subhashish Mukherjee) and collector of newspaper clippings who has a magic box of paint with which he draws a spiraling circle into his paintings or newspaper clippings that marks a point of entry and exit for the viewer who looks at the painting or the newspaper clipping. How he uses this magic box of paints infused with his own magical powers to take the wily builder and promoter (Rajesh Sharma)’s attention away from evicting him from his dilapidated rented apartment where he wants to build a new structure, forms the main story.<br />
Other sub-plots branch out from this core to throw up different slices of life among the urban middle-class in Kolkata. Sadly, these stories do not have any logical link with the main story though one can see the painter appear and disappear in some of the incidents within the story and play a part in one of them. This marks the collapse of the film because time-travel remains confined to the anchor story and the other stories stand almost independent of time-travel. The strongest sub-story is the one in which an old lady wills away her ancestral home to her faithful driver (Shantilal Mukherjee) disowning her son (Koushik Ghosh). The weakest link is the romance between an ordinary student (Samadarshi) and his glamorous ad agency corporate neighbour (Radhika Gupta).<br />
The concept of time-travel through paintings has been ‘inspired’ by Biloy Bindu (Vanishing Point) a short story by the late Sovan Som but Ghoshal takes exclusive credit for the story which is unethical. The script goes out of the director’s control and works its way to a lot of confusion as each separate story remains incomplete. The acting by every member of the cast, the cinematography and lighting by Harendra Singh are outstanding but fail to lift the limping script. Mita Chakraborty’s editing of the multi-layered narrative is very good. But the film is a perfect example of the fact that excellent infra-structure, brilliant acting and good technique cannot rescue a bad script. Ghoshal perhaps, mistaking ambition for ability, stretched himself a bit too far for his first film.</p>

with an exciting gameplay and some gory yet stunning visuals<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013231&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/thief267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013232" alt="Eidos Montreal's Thief " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/thief267.jpg" /></a> Eidos Montreal&#8217;s <em>Thief</em>
<p>Since its first release in 1998, Thief has been one of the most iconic and well-known games in the market. Each new game in the franchise has had heavy expectations and in this case, there is no exception. When Eidos Montreal announced the launch of its newest edition, game lovers couldn&#8217;t have asked for anything more. Although the game does not live up to all the high expectations, it does make for a decent fare.<br />
Pitch black corners and gory visuals dominate the scene in this stealth game, where the player enters the first mission to steal some items of great importance from a baron. But as you go along, the player is transported a year into the future, which shows a destroyed world, parts of which are in shambles. The scenario is so ugly, that all you can see around is death and decay. Now, this is where the player starts facing their real missions, as they have to figure out what exactly happened through the year that went by, when your character Garrett, a cold and calculating thief, was hibernating and then try to fix things out. It won&#8217;t be wrong to say that the gameplay is challenging and very interesting. As Garrett, the gamer has to be alert and keep an eye out for possible secret passages, doors or roads. At times, it does become a task to figure out the possible ways of getting in and out of a place, without getting detected. The moment you get detected, the thief must face dire consequences.<br />
The player gets tools like bow, arrows and blackjack and the character has also been granted special augments to his abilities that can be improved during the process of the game. Although one can&#8217;t use the rope arrow on a wooden surface anymore, this edition more than makes up for it by adding the swoop ability, which adds extra speed to the game.<br />
The entire game is comparatively shorter than other stealth games in the market. But the fact that one can play the different styles of this game over and over again will surely keep the gamers hooked on.<br />
Thief definitely stands out in the technical department. The graphics are good, with incredible use of lighting and shadows. The character and surroundings are very well-designed. Even the sound design is great, with even the minute details being audible if you plug in your headphones. The voice acting is perfectly done by the cast, especially Garrett&#8217;s voice, which is very intriguing.<br />
Overall, Thief carries the franchise&#8217;s torch with great confidence. If you were expecting fireworks, this may not appeal to you. But fans of stealth will definitely enjoy this edition.<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Box Cricket League is an innovative form of cricket where  television actors will show their cricketing skills<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013362&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cricket267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013367" alt="Box Cricket League" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cricket267.jpg" /></a> Box Cricket League
<p>Over 150 television actors including some of the most popular faces on television including Kamya Punjabi, Barkha Bisht, Sayantani Ghosh, Pratyusha Banerjee, Rohit Reddy, Pooja Gor, Indraneil Sengupta, came together for the launch of Box Cricket League at a suburban hotel in Mumbai last week. A rather new and unique form of cricket, it was launched by Sunny Arora and Anand Mishra of Marinating Films. The directors who had earlier come up with the idea of a Telly Calendar with 12 popular small-screen divas, announced their new venture which aims to create the magic of cricket with television actors.<br />
“It’s exciting because the game is unlike anything seen before. It stands out from regular cricket in many ways. For instance, we have eight members instead of the regular 11 members in a team and it is mandatory that from the eight, two have to be females. From the 11 overs that we have kept for every inning, one over will be bowled by the girls,” said Mishra.<br />
The League already has six teams which have been bought by television actors, while some chose to become brand ambassadors. Kamya Punjabi owns <em>Jaipur Joshiley</em> while Sara Khan is the brand ambassador and captain of <em>Surma Bhoopalis</em>. Barkha Bisht is the captain of <em>Ghaint Punjabis</em>, Karan Mehra of <em>Kolkotta Baabu Mooshayees</em> and Krystle D’Souza of <em>Mumbai Mastram</em>, Rajiv Thakur is the captain of <em>Jaipur Joshiley</em> and Suyash Kumar of <em>Dilli Fukrey</em>.<br />
“Though I cannot divulge how much the owners are paying for a team, since it is the first year we have kept the figures low. Let’s see how successful we are with this experiment. The owners in turn recover their money from sponsors,” revealed Mishra.<br />
The other interesting fact about the game is that instead of being played on a regular cricket field of 450 feet and 500 feet, it will be played in a hall measuring 90 by 90 feet inside Amber Studios in Madh Island, Mumbai! The idea of playing the game indoors germinated when Mishra with his co-workers would play cricket in their office measuring 50 feet in length.<br />
“Both, the girls and guys would play together and we used soft smiley balls to avoid any kind of injury. That’s how the League got its name, Box Cricket League. The rules of the game are the same, and here too, we will use soft smiley balls so that no one is hurt,” informed Mishra.<br />
The matches will kick off on March 23 and and will be held periodically on March 28, 29, 30 and April 4. The semi-finals and finals will be held on April 5 and 6 respectively. All the matches will start at 8pm.<br />
“Presently, they are not being aired on any channel. Though some smaller channels have come forward to air them we are looking at the bigger and popular ones. It’s a property which is sure to grow as many actors are showing interest.”<br />
With popular television faces supporting it, only time will tell, whether this concept will play a long inning and become a hot cricket property.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Indie producer Shrihari Sathe, who has produced a number of English short films and won much acclaim, turns to Marathi cinema with the film Ek Hazarachi Note for his directorial debut<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014145&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hazarachi267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014151" alt="The crew shoots for  Ek Hazarachi Note" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hazarachi267.jpg" /></a> The crew shoots for<br />Ek Hazarachi Note
<p>Growing up in Mumbai, it was only natural for Shrihari Sathe to feed on a healthy diet of films. He would watch Hindi and English films as well as Tamil ones without subtitles because he didn’t care too much about the language of a film. This was probably the time Sathe made up his mind to join the film world himself. Today, it would not take a genius to track the trajectory of the 30-year-old’s career and say, “He chose well.”<br />
Set for his directorial debut, with Marathi film<em> Ek Hazarachi Note</em>, Sathe has a sizeable list of achievements to boast of. Having studied films for about eight years in the US — pursuing degrees from the University of Michigan and Columbia University’s School of the Arts and receiving fellowships from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, Producer’s Guild of America, Sundance Institute — Sathe has been producing indie films for nine years. Accolades have been coming his way from film societies in the US and other countries.<em> First Day of Peace</em>, a Bosnian short film he co-produced, won the Grand Jury Prize at the Slamdance Film Festival (2010) while <em>Off Season</em>, another short film Sathe co-produced, was nominated for a BAFTA in 2010. These are only some of the highlights.<br />
All that considered, one wonders why he would turn back home and that,too, towards regional cinema for his directorial debut. “It’s basically a film that happens to be in Marathi. I would get involved in any project if the story interested me; it could be in any language. With<em> Ek Hazarachi Note</em>, the story is set in Maharashtra and, therefore, the language makes sense. The bottomline is that cinema is visual storytelling,” he explains, adding that this is also his first film in the country.<br />
Shot near Pune and set in Vidarbha, the film revolves around an old woman, played by Usha Naik. She leads a happy but uneventful<br />
life till something changes it all. “The film is inspired by how we are. We are the common person, who is perpetually waiting, while those in power dictate how life ought to be lived,” says Sathe explaining that the simplicity of the story captivated him. “I was attached to the subject and the themes of how we can look at present society. The writer’s and characters’ voices interested me,” he says.<br />
Sathe says the name of the film has stuck since the beginning of its inception. “The screenwriter, Shrikant Bojewar, named the film. Literally meaning, ‘thousand rupee note’, it signifies a pivotal point in the film vis-a-vis the woman. It also questions the value of money or the lack of that value, depending on which way one is looking. Of course, it is also a slightly catchy name that triggers some curiosity,” says Sathe.<br />
Currently in the post-production phase, Sathe feels they have managed to produce a hybrid between the American system of making a film while keeping in mind the requirements of shooting in India. Their challenge, however, was the heat. “I have earlier shot in -27 degrees C and this was the other end of the spectrum. We were shooting near Pune during April and May with the temperatures soaring. We had to make sure everyone, including the equipment, was surviving. Ideally, I would like to be somewhere in between,” he says.<br />
Going back to the course of his career, Sathe explains that his next film is in the US and then he has an Arabic venture lined up. But the filmmaker is not done with his homeland. “I am developing Indian content and I will be on the scene,” he says.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Considered a bigger threat than IPL, the impact of  the 16th Lok Sabha elections on film business has been minimised, say film industry pundits, by putting off big ticket releases beyond June<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014195&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/election267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014201" alt="Representational Pic" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/election267.jpg" /></a> Representational Pic
<p>The dual shadow of Indian Premier League (IPL) and Indian general elections of 2009 over Bollywood are once again being played out in the year 2014. While the 16th Lok Sabha will unfold between April 7 to May 16, 2014, IPL will hold fort between April 16 to June 1, 2014. The latter had to relocate their venue to UAE (United Arab Emirates) due to security reasons. Shyam Shroff, director, Shringar Films, believes that much has happened since 2009. “The (movie) scene looks better now with economy in better shape, Sensex rocking and more multiplexes than in 2009.” he said.<br />
The other difference is Bollywood’s perception of IPL and the General elections —the latter, they concede, is the bigger threat.<br />
“IPL is no longer the big giant that threatened to eclipse film business,” says Girish Johar, Head, Distribution and Acquisition, Sahara Motion Pictures. “Over the years, the success of films like <em>Ragini MMS, Shor in the City</em> and <em>Love Sex Aur Dhoka</em> have made the IPL theory redundant. But elections are a different story. Not many will step out around that time to watch films as it causes apprehensions over security, traffic and noise. And though movies are a source of entertainment for the junta at large, it is paid entertainment and last on the priority list.”<br />
Among the films releasing around the election season are the much-awaited films, that include Amitabh-Bachchan starrer <em>Bhoothnath Returns, 2 States</em> with Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, Rajinikanth’s <em>Kochadaiiyaan</em> and Subhashi Ghai’s return vehicle<em> Kaanchi</em>. But Shroff dismisses any notion of these films being affected by the polls. “I don’t think the elections will make a dent on box-office. On the contrary with Rs.30,000 crore being pumped in during elections, as per the recent media reports, the box-office would be better off, provided the movies have something good to offer. Secondly, the elections are well spaced out, and therefore it will not have pan India effect. Yes, the result day could affect the collections,” he elaborates.<br />
Vajir Singh, trade analyst, points out that all the aforementioned films release in April, while election fever actually is at its peak in May. “Look at the films lined up for release in the month of May— you’ll not find a single big release in Hindi in that period because it’s a time when elections are at its peak. So the producers have planned their releases, fully aware of the election season. Releasing small budget, content driven films around this time makes more sense.”<br />
Rajesh Thadani, distributor, feels it’s too early to predict the collatoral damage elections would wreak on films. “But yes, elections will make a dent in the business of films, impacting film promotions as well. The only thing dominating on television then would be elections, taking away any kind of scope or space to promote films. What will help a film rise above these limitations around this period, is its content,” he explains.<br />
One of the films releasing during elections is Samrat &amp; Co, a Rajshri Productions’ film. Says Kavita Barjatya, producer and writer of the film, “What has come to the fore in the research and analysis of the films that released in the past is that content works, not external factors like IPL and elections. The former has now become a regular feature. In fact, films like <em>Houseful, Housefull 2, Jannat, Vicky Donor, ABCD &#8211; Any Body Can Dance</em> (which I loved),<em> Aashiqui 2</em> and <em>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</em> did fantastic business despite the IPL season. Yes, elections can make a dent in the business but that’s only for a day and few shows. Fortunately, the polling in Mumbai is on April 24, and our film is releasing on April 25. The bottomline is that content works, and it is such a beautiful time in cinema that it does not matter whether there’s IPL, elections, stars, no stars in the film, people will come to see a good film.”<br />
While Barjatya does not think that a loss of few shows would make a difference, Akshaye Rathi, distributor/exhibitor, feels that it would make a big difference to a big ticket release. “It’s a good thing that there’s no big ticket release happening around the elections. Unlike IPL, elections are not an everyday event. And it means a big deal in a democracy like India. Besides, it doesn’t end with the announcement of the new government. There’ll be victory rallies and election coverage in the media for the next 15 days after the election results are out. So, there’s no scope for a film to even get a presence in terms of promotions on television. And if it’s a big budget (Rs.50 crore plus) film with an A-list actor (Khans, Roshan, Kapoors and Kumar) in it, then there’s a lot at stake. The dent would be around 15 per cent to 20 per cent, which a big ticket release film cannot afford to have,” he explains.<br />
A fact that film-maker Anil Sharma had to learn the hard way, when he released<em> Singh Saab The Great</em> last November. “Elections always affect a film’s business. The collections of my film <em>Singh Saab..</em>.suffered in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chattishgarh, because of assembly elections that were held there last year. Life comes to a standstill with elections—everything from rallies to public meetings to transportations are centred around it. Elections are a cinema by itself, our humble versions don’t stand a chance against it. But yes, I have learned from this experience and will never release my films during elections,” vows Sharma, who has directed <em>Gadar</em>.<br />
The industry has now trained its eyes on the biggies slated to release from June onwards, which they hope will make up for a low-key summer. These films include,<em> Action Jackson, Humshakals, Kick</em> and <em>Singham 2</em> “The first big ticket film post IPL and elections is Prabhu Dheva’s <em>Action Jackson</em>, starring Akshay Kumar and Sonakshi Sinha, which is slated to release on June 6. In fact, June-July-August are seen as the most lucrative months for big ticket releases, given the performances of films in the recent past like <em>Cocktail, Bol Bachchan, Rowdy Rathore</em> and <em>Chennai Express</em> in these months,” concurs Rathi.</p>

<p>The <em>dhak dhak</em> girl, Madhuri Dixit Nene recently during an interview, mentioned that her husband Dr Shriram Nene has very big plans for the heart patients of India. He is all set to start a state-of-art hospital that will cater to the needy.<br />
Looks like a good business proposition, what with the wife breaking hearts and the husband mending them!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Compliments galore</strong></p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan, whose upcoming film<em> Bhoothnath Returns</em> has Ranbir Kapoor playing a cameo, was all praise for the actor. He mentioned that he not to be seen sharing screen space with Kapoor is unfortunate for him, as he was looking forward to the experience. “I can never compare myself to Ranbir. He is extremely popular. I hope that I get a chance to work with him sometime in the future. Even if that means a blink-and -miss role like a man walking on the road or something,” stated Bachchan. With a compliment like that coming from a legend, we are sure Ranbir must be feeling on Cloud Nine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>One-ab maiden</strong></p>
<p>With Bollywood heroes developing eight pack abs, can the heroines be left far behind. At an event recently, leggy lass, Nargis Fakhri  joined the young brigade of girls who were clamouring to see Varun Dhawan’s abs. But the actor quickly turned around and told the gathering that with Nargis  working very hard on her films, she had also developed abs. Nodding her head in agreement, Fakhri confessed that indeed she too had developed one pack ab!</p>

<p>By <strong>Farida Khanzada</strong></p>
<p>After several months of speculation regarding the cast and then the name of the film, Rajshri Productions has finally registered the title of their next. The Salman Khan-starrer has been named <em>Prem Ratan Dhan Payo</em>, the title that has been derived from the popular <em>bhajan Ram ratan dhan payo</em>. Khan, who shall be working with the Barjatyas after a span of nearly 15 years, will play a double role and will be named Prem and Vijay. “Both roles played by Salman are positive. Like in all our previous films together, in this too one of his character shall be called Prem, while the other is Vijay. It is Neil Nitin Mukesh whose character has shades of grey, though he is not completely negative,” said an official spokesperson of Rajshri.<br />
Starring Sonam Kapoor in the lead, the film also has in its cast Anupam Kher, Swara Bhaskar and Deepak Dobriyal. To go on the floors in June, it will be ready for release in November 2015. Barjatya’s son Devansh Barjatya shall be the assistant director on the project.</p>

<p><strong>Hrithik Roshan in Ashutosh Gowariker’s historical love saga</strong></p>
<p>That Ashutosh Gowariker is in talks with Hrithik Roshan for his next ambitious project. The film is a love story set against the backdrop of the Indus Valley civilisation for which he is reportedly getting together a team of top technicians. Roshan is presently shooting for Siddharth Anand’s <em>Bang Bang</em>, while the film-maker is busy with production work of his television show <em>Everest</em>.</p>

<p>The grand opening of the recently concluded Lakme Fashion Week was like a reunion for several B-town girls of the ’90s. One could see Kajol, Urmila Matondkar and Sonali Bendre Behl bonding over fashion, conversations and their common friendship with Manish Malhotra. While they couldn’t stop raving about the designer’s summer collection, they also couldn’t get enough of the paparazzi’s attention as they stood on the runway to pose for one picture after another, before the event. They were also seen playing Chinese whispers in between, while pointing  at certain models. We wonder what the conversation was all about?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fashion fervour</strong></p>
<p>Sonakshi Sinha has certainly come a long way since her days as a stylist. At the recently-concluded Lakme Fashion Week Summer Resort 2014, the actress turned show- stopper for good friend and designer Manish Malhotra’s showcase. While most showstoppers turn up after all the models do their bit, Sinha came up the ramp rather unexpectedly in the first few minutes of the showcase. Everybody in the audience was shocked to see the actor looking so fresh and thin, while a few whispered that it’s amazing to see the stylist-turned-actress rocking the ramp. “I remember running from the backstage to main stage area during my early days. Styling was good fun, but this ain’t that bad either,” stated Sinha, during the post event media interaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Relationship fundas!</strong></p>
<p>While most people prefer to date people from their own industry, Sonam Kapoor has a slightly different take on it. “I don’t usually, as a rule, date actors,” she says, further adding that relationships where the woman is more successful than a man, don’t work. “As someone who is successful, I’ve actually never consciously  dated someone who’s successful on paper. And to be honest, they’ve not been very successful relationships because there’s been an ego clash, or my work has taken priority. So I guess, such relationships don’t work.” Guess, there’s a lot one can learn from this Kapoor girl’s relationship fundas!</p>

<p>Shahid Kapoor certainly has a lot to look forward to. Revelling under the success of Prabhu Dheva’s <em>R&#8230;Rajkumar</em>, the actor, has been signed by Vikas Bahl who is receiving accolades for the recently released <em>Queen</em>. The film, titled <em>Shaandar</em> is on destination weddings and is likely to take off in mid 2014. And now the actor is in talks with director duo Raj Nidimoru and Krishna D.K. for an action film. “Yes, we are in talks with Shahid for an action film, though he has not yet confirmed the project. Actually it is an action-intrigue film, meaning that it is a thriller-cum-action film. We have been wanting to work with Shahid ever since we saw his performance in <em>Kaminey</em> and are happy that he has liked our script,” said Nidimoru.<br />
The director duo will also be doing a Telugu film with Mahesh Babu in the lead. “We are still discussing the dates with Mahesh and are not sure when the film will start. So once Shahid gives his confirmation, it will be decided which film will start first,” he added.<br />
The director duo whose last venture <em>Go Goa Gone</em> had an above average run at the box-office are presently busy with <em>Happy Ending</em> starring Saif Ali Khan, Ileana D’Cruz and Preity Zinta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pankaj Saraswat, the man behind <em>The Great Indian Laughter Challenge</em> to play a comic villain in<em> Revolver Rani</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Saraswat is married to actress Tejaswani Kolhapure</em></p>
<p>Pankaj Saraswat the man who conceptualised <em>The Great Indian Laughter Challenge</em> show and discovered, trained and groomed comedians like Kapil Sharma, Bharati Singh is now doing a comic role himself in the upcoming Kangana Ranaut starrer, <em>Revolver Rani</em>.<br />
Said Saraswat who plays one of the three brothers (others are Zakir Hussain and Kumud Mishra) in the film says, “There is a lot of black humour in the film. Zakir, Kumud and I are politicians who have run out of power. Inside our home we are always fighting, yelling and pretending to be very aggressive, but when we come face to face with Kangana Ranaut, who plays a rebel politician, we become meek,” said Saraswat who is married to actress-model Tejaswani Kolhapure and has earlier done films like<em> Ab Tak Chappan</em> and the yet to release<em> Paanch</em>.</p>

<p>Gulshan Grover wrote a letter to Forest Minister Patangrao Kadam on behalf of PETA, demanding the release of the 14-year-old elephant Sunder. The actor has joined the campaign along with many celebrities urging the officials to immediately transfer Sunder to a sanctuary in Bangalore. After he was donated to the Jyotiba temple in 2007, Sundar has been kept chained and PETA has got a video footage showing the mahout beating him with a pole.</p>

<p><strong>Wedding bells</strong></p>
<p>At a simple ceremony in Kerala, Ashi Dua, founder of Flying Unicorn Entertainment, married hotelier Sunny Sara. The two had met through common friends about a year ago. The 28-year-old from Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh produced Bombay Talkies in 2013, to pay a tribute to 100 years of India cinema. Minissha Lamba, Anurag Kashyap, Sonam Kapoor and Harman Baweja who is Ashi’s cousin, were present at the wedding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Defamation case</strong></p>
<p>Aamir Khan reportedly met Joint Police Commissioner (Crime) Sadanand Date at Mumbai Police Headquarters last week to register a complaint with the Mumbai police. He alleged that some “false and malicious messages” were being circulated on social networking sites Twitter, Facebook and Whatsapp to damage his image and reputation of his issue-based show <em>Satyamev Jayate (SMJ)</em>. The show went on air two weeks back and has been receiving a good response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Total ban</strong></p>
<p>A ban has been sought on <em>Total Siyappa</em> for its ‘anti-national’ content, by a Hindu right wing organisation. The film was released on March 7. Hindu Janajagruti Samiti (HJS), in their representation to the Central Board of Film Certification, has demanded cancellation of the film&#8217;s censor certificate. Strong objection was taken to certain dialogues in the film, which is a story of a Pakistani man in love with an Indian girl. The film is directed by E Niwas.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013104&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amit267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014358" alt="Amitabh Bachchan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amit267.jpg" /></a> Amitabh Bachchan
<p>Amitabh Bachchan, who played a voice over artist for several films in the past, is all set to turn narrator for debutant director Shiv Sagar’s mythological drama,<em> Arasuri Maa Ambe</em>. The film chronicles the myth and history surrounding the Ambaji Temple, which is situated near the border of Gujarat and Rajasthan.<br />
Interestingly, <em>Arasuri &#8230;</em> happens to be India’s first mythological film, which is shot completely in steroscopic 3-D. Sagar, who is the grandson of late Dr.Ramanand Sagar, approached the actor recently, and the latter instantly gave his nod. “When my dad and I approached Bachchan <em>saab</em>, he immediately agreed. Dad, Mr Prem Sagar and the Bachchan family go long back. Jaya<em>ji</em> and Dad studied together at FTII, Pune together,” stated Sagar. The film stars television actors like Tej Sapru (as King Daksha), Tarun Khanna (as Shiva) and Piyali Munshi (as Sati). While Khanna has worked with Sagar before in <em>Kahani Vikram aur Betal Ki</em>, Munshi played the lead role of Durga on another of Sagar’s show,<em> Jai Jag Janani Maa Durga</em>, both on the Colors channel.<br />
Sagar, who recently set up his own production house, Eastern Motion Pictures, stated that he is in talks with a leading movie studio for a big budget fantasy film, the script of which was written over a period of two years. He adds, “I have been doing several projects on <em>Devi maa</em> since over two years now. It’s time I take the plunge and experiment with genres. The fantasy film will be my first step in this direction.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/300267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014098" alt="300" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/300267.jpg" /></a> 300
<p>The action film, 300: Rise of an Empire, battled its way to $45 million in ticket sales to win the weekend box-office race, slashing its way past the animated film Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman. Based on the Peabody’s Improbable History segments in the 1960s animated TV show starring the characters Rocky and Bullwinkle, Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman collected ticket sales of $32.5 million at U.S. and Canadian theatres.<br />
Last week’s box-office winner, Non-Stop, was third with $15.4 million in sales. The film stars Liam Neeson as an alcoholic U.S. air marshal racing to stop a string of murders on an international flight. 300: Rise of an Empire, set in ancient Greece, is a blood-splattered sequel to the 2006 blockbuster, 300. It takes place before and after the earlier film when 300 Spartans marched to their deaths in a battle against the Persians. In the sequel, an alliance of Greek city-states wage battle on the seas against the Persians.<br />
Both films are based on graphic novels written by author Frank Miller. 300: Rise of an Empire, stars Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton as the Greek leader Themistocles and French actress and model Eva Green as Artemisia, the ruthless commander of the Persian forces.<br />
“This far exceeded our expectations,” said Jeff Goldstein, executive vice president for theatrical distribution at Warner Brothers, which distributed the film produced by Legendary Pictures.<br />
The studio anticipated an opening in the range of $35 million to $40 million, “thinking, if we can get to $100 million (total box-office), we’d be in a good place,” Goldstein added, noting that the movie made nearly half that in its opening days. “Clearly we captured a much broader audience than we anticipated,” Goldstein said. The film added another $88 million from foreign boxes in 58 markets, Warner Brothers said, and another $12 million from IMAX screenings globally.<br />
Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman, which features the talking dog Mr. Peabody and his adopted boy, Sherman, exceeded studio 20th Century Fox’s expectations for an opening from about $25 million to $30 million. “With nostalgia in play, this film was geared toward both adults beyond the traditional family film audience, while introducing the characters of Sherman and Mr. Peabody to a new generation of kids who had never seen them,” said Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution for Fox. Aronson said he expected to film to continue to perform well in the coming weeks, noting “there’s not an animated film for another month, and with spring holidays approaching we’re in a really good place.” The movie was directed by Rob Minkoff, who also directed the 1994 animated film The Lion King. That film was nominated for four Academy Awards and won two Oscars for its music. Minkoff’s earlier Walt Disney Co film collected $987.5 million in worldwide ticket sales, the second most for an animated film after Frozen, according to the website Box Office Mojo.<br />
The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson’s whimsical caper film starring Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray and Owen Wilson, set the box-office on fire over the weekend in a limited opening at only four movie theatres, taking in $800,000. The $200,000 per screen average over three days for the Fox Searchlight film set a per location record, according to box-office tracking firm Rentrak.<br />
The Lego Movie, took the No. 4 overall spot with $11 million, according to Rentrak. Rounding out the top five, Son of God, based on The Bible television mini-series produced by Mark Burnett and his wife, Roma Downey, collected sales of $10 million.</p>

<p><strong>Israel’s prime minister visits Hollywood for premiere of tourism film</strong></p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Hollywood recently for the premiere of a film to promote tourism to the Holy Land, shifting the spotlight away from his frequent focus on dangers facing his country. Netanyahu attended the premiere at Paramount Studios of Israel: The Royal Tour, a one-hour U.S. public television special that is being broadcast this week.<br />
The U.S.-educated Israeli leader played tour guide to the programme’s host, U.S. travel journalist Peter Greenberg when the project was shot in Israel in 2012.<br />
Netanyahu attended the event a day after White House talks with President Barack Obama that focused on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and international efforts to prevent Iran, Israel’s arch-enemy, from developing nuclear weapons. Addressing the crowd, Netanyahu said he not only wanted to promote Israeli tourism but also, “to dispel the various calumnies about the State of Israel and to show the real face of the Jewish state.”<br />
Israel enjoyed its best year of tourism in 2013, with a record 3.5 million visitors, including 623,000 from the United States. The industry contributed about $11.4 billion to the Israeli economy last year, according to the Tourism Ministry, which has said it hopes the TV show will bring in an additional 200,000 visitors.<br />
In the Royal Tour, Netanyahu guided Greenberg around popular tourist sites such as Jerusalem’s walled Old City, Tel Aviv and the ancient desert fortress of Masada. The Old City was on the itinerary, but Bethlehem, the traditional site of Jesus’ birth, was not. The Old City is in a part of Jerusalem that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed, in a move that has not won international recognition.<br />
Filming the Royal Tour was not without mishap. Netanyahu tore a tendon while playing in a friendly soccer match between Arab and Jewish youths that took place within the framework of the programme, and had to wear a cast for several weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/khatron267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013333" alt="Rajneish Duggal with Ranvir Shorey on the sets of Khatron Ke Khiladi Season Five  (left) Rohit Shetty with Mughda Godse" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/khatron267.jpg" /></a> Rajneish Duggal with Ranvir Shorey on the sets of <em>Khatron Ke Khiladi</em> Season Five<br />(left) Rohit Shetty with Mughda Godse
<p>Film-maker Rohit Shetty and the <em>Khatron Ke Khiladi</em> gang of the fifth season are back in the city after shooting the series in Cape Town. It seems the shy Shetty was a tough task-master, as most of them have suffered injuries during the entire shoot in Cape Town.<br />
For instance, a stunt involved contestants being left in a coop with honey and chicken food on their bodies. The fowls began pecking the food off the contestants’ bodies, leaving behind some scars on them. In fact, model-turned -actress Mugdha Godse was reduced to tears as she injured her face during the stunt. Television star Gurmeet Chaudhary, on the other hand, injured his head and nose during an underwater task.<br />
Despite the injuries, most contestants are happy with the experience as it helped them to conquer their fears. Who would have thought that the super strong Daya (Dayanand Shetty) has hydrophobia. Even model-turned-actor Gauahar Khan suffers from a similar phobia, while Godse, and Debina Bonnerjee are pertified of cockroaches. Talking about his fear of snakes, model-turned-actor Rajneish Duggal says, “I knew it was going to be a crazy experience, but didn’t know it would be this crazy and physically demanding. The toughest stunt, for me, was the one with snakes as that’s my biggest fear. The stunt involved 60 snakes. But I’ve conquered my fear.” He adds that in the process of the doing the show, he discovered another fear &#8211; crocodiles. He reveals that the sight of a crocodile, when he looks at you and the sound he makes when his mouth is open, is scary.<br />
Among the challenges that contestants faces was the wind, while doing stunts from a height; the wind speed would vary from 20km per hour to 60km per hour. “With that kind of wind speed, one could easily fall down, either on the ground or in water. It was so difficult,” admits Duggal.<br />
Just as the stunts got tougher, Shetty would put them at ease with his sense of humour. Guess, we’ll have to wait for the drama to unfold, when the new season of <em>Khatron Ke Khiladi</em> goes on air on March 23.</p>

<p><strong>Producer:</strong> Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan</p>
<p><strong>Direction:</strong> Dr. Jabbar Patel</p>
<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Ashok Lokhande, Om Bhutkar, Vaishali Dabhade, Meena Naik, Supriya Vinod, Rekha Kamat, Satish Alekar, Rahul Solapurkar, Benjamin Gilani.</p>
<p>By <strong>Sunil Nandgaonkar</strong></p>
<p>Film-makers have begun to explore and experiment with biopics of eminent personalities among other interesting genres. Dr. Jabbar Patel, who had earlier made a biopic on Dalit leader, Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, is back and this time, the renowned director has tried to present many facets of Yashwantrao Chavan in the film titled <em>Yashwantrao Chavan : Bakhar Eka Vadalachi</em>. Remembered as the legendary iron man of Maharashtra, Chavan who was heading the state of Maharashtra, was invited by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to Delhi to become part of the Central cabinet. He was the first Chief Minister of Maharashtra after the division of Bombay State and the fifth Deputy Prime Minister of India.<br />
Tracing his life from the young days in a village in Maharashtra, the film captures Yashwantrao Chavan’s journey to becoming a freedom fighter in <em>Chale Jao</em> agitation, his arrest and incarceration, political career in the state as well as in New Delhi, his vast knowledge and varied interests ranging from agriculture to culture. It shows his emergence as one of Maharashtra’s powerful political leaders who worked closely with Nehru, and then served as the Defence Minister, his family life, troubled times during the Samyukta Maharashtra movement and the subsequent formation of Maharashtra State etc.<br />
The director has tried to present a collage of all the aspects one would know about Yashwantrao Chavan. But the presentation makes the film look like a documentary. It starts with Nana Patekar as the <em>sutradhar</em> along with a folk poet who narrates the life and times of Chavan in a <em>povada</em> (folk poetic) form. Yashwantrao Chavan’s story unfolds with stock shots in black and white with Ashok Lokhande playing the title role. While Chavan’s meeting with Nehru (Benjamin Gilani), Indira Gandhi (Supriya Vinod) and other leaders bring in a feel of the bygone era, the film dwindles into documentary and narrative story on the background. This tends to get distractive.<br />
Music has been used extensively to underline Chavan’s love for Marathi literature, films, plays and poetry. As a result, the director fails to focus much on the leader’s political and social greatness, especially his contribution to the creation of the modern Maharashtra State. Many songs engage the viewers in nostalgia thus restricting an overall perspective of the personality. The films fares well on music, VFX, and other technical aspects. Though, it is definitely worth a watch, one could come away with the feeling of having sat through a good documentary rather than a feature film on YB Chavan’s life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/singh267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014279" alt="Ranveer Singh" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/singh267.jpg" /></a> Ranveer Singh
<p>With a blockbuster like <em>Goliyon Ki Raasleela &#8211; Ram-leela</em> and a super-hit <em>Gunday</em> on his resume, Ranveer Singh has instantly become one of the sought after actors today. If directors promptly name him as one of the most promising actors in the industry, then the trade pundits label him as an actor with a bright future, while film-makers like Zoya Akhtar regard him as hot property.<br />
Suddenly Singh is not only sweeping the audience off their feet, but has made the industry sit up and take notice of him. So what catapulted the actor on the popularity charts and the wish-list of every film-maker?<br />
“Ranveer is an unparalleled combination of powerhouse talent and childlike enthusiasm. He has the bandwidth to perform any kind of role in any genre,” is how Maneesh Sharma, who directed him in his debut film<em> Band Baaja Baaraat</em>, describes him. Agrees Vikramaditya Motwane the director of<em> Lootera</em>. “Ranveer’s forte as an actor is that he is sincere, extremely hardworking, driven, focussed and talented. I would rate him as the best of the new lot.”<br />
Trade analyst Taran Adarsh also scores him above all the young actors when it comes to connecting with the audience. “Ranveer is outspoken, media friendly and warm towards people. I have seen how friendly he is with fans who come up to him. It’s his gregarious personality which people find very appealing,” says Adarsh.<br />
On his part, Singh who always dreamt of becoming an actor, credits his performances to his love for cinema and the craft of acting. “I have always been obsessed with films. When I went for parties, the minute the DJ went into raw Hindi film music mode, I would be rocking it out on the dance floor. Arjun (Kapoor), who is a close friend, would join me. Hindi music and films were a passion for both of us,” says the actor, smiling at the memories.<br />
Understandably, it’s his love for the process of acting that has helped Singh in fleshing out his onscreen characters with elan and make them real. He brought a lump to the throat as the passionate, yet subdued lover in <em>Lootera</em>, filled up the screen with his effervescence in<em> ..Ram-leela</em> and had the audience cheering him as one of the dynamic protagonists in <em>Gunday</em>.<br />
“Ranveer has been in the industry for only three and a half years, but look at his choice of films. There is a <em>Lootera</em>, a <em>&#8230;Ram-leela</em> and a <em>Gunday</em>. Not many actors get the chance to work in such a variety of films, so early in their careers. Add to it, the fact that both<em> &#8230;Ram-leela</em> and <em>Gunday</em> were hits, which is the ultimate crowning glory in the film industry. He has a very bright future,” opines Adarsh.<br />
Film-makers say that the audience are in awe of his presence — he has that X- factor essential for a star. But when it comes to clamouring for space on screen, the actor seems to be least bothered with that. “If I were to start hogging the entire limelight in a film, it would affect my work. I went into <em>Lootera</em> knowing that the love story was heroine-dominated. I went into <em>Gunday</em> knowing that it was a two-hero project, and now I will start shooting for Zoya Akhtar’s film,<em> Dil Dhadakne Do</em>, that has an ensemble cast. The story, script and character is more important to me in a movie than thinking of space taken up by another character. If I know my part, I am excited and confident about doing a good job with it. I go for it. In fact, I always knew if the chemistry I shared with Arjun because of our off-screen rapport, was translated on screen it would be special. In fact, I wanted to do a film with Arjun much before <em>Gunday</em> was offered to us,” he says.<br />
If film-makers say that he is a talented actor, trade analyst Vajir Singh feels he also has the capacity to draw in the audience into the theatre. “The opening of a film depends on the curiousity the audience has for an actor in a film. And the fantastic opening of <em>Gunday</em> was entirely due to Ranveer Singh. It was his presence in the film which drew the audience. At one time, Ranveer was a multiplex actor, but now he is accepted in single screens too. He is excellent in action and dancing and has shown a flair for comedy in <em>Band Baaja Baaraat</em> too. He is a complete package. Ranveer has definitely arrived, and now he can only grow,” opines Singh.<br />
The statement is seconded by Ali Abbas Zafar, the director of <em>Gunday</em>. “Ranveer has star quality and talent, which very few actors have. He has matured as an actor and is now hitting the mainstream cinema in his own way. His comic timing, dialogue delivery and dancing skills have taken him from multiplexes to single screens,” says Zafar.<br />
But it’s not that the actor is ready to take on any commercial entertainer to prove his pull in the single screens. He took on <em>Gunday</em> because he says it was a mass entertainer with a difference, was credible and substantial. “Today mass entertainers have become an insult for a film as they are just a collection of items and gags.<em> Gunday</em> stayed true to the integrity of story telling and invested in its characters,” elaborates the actor.<br />
Then there’s Shaad Ali’s<em> Kill Dil</em>, the film he is presently shooting. This Yash Raj Films’ production is also an entertainer replete with romance, comedy, action and drama. “I cannot say much about the film and my character except that it’s unique as a genre. But what I must mention is that when I would dream of acting in a movie as a youngster, the director in my dreams would be Shaad Ali and producer Aditya Chopra. It’s very surreal and beyond words when I try and describe the feeling. And the biggest high is to get to share screen space with Govinda<em>ji</em> (Govinda). I have grown up watching and admiring him as my hero and idol. He was my inspiration to become an actor and now actually sharing screen space with him is as if something has been conjured from my imagination.”<br />
Singh also has no qualms of imbibing the nuances of acting from more experienced co-actors. He is an observant co-actor and quick to learn, which is apparent when he talks about Priyanka Chopra, his co-star in <em>Gunday</em>. “Priyanka is a hungry actor and can enhance a scene. When we were doing the song <em>Jiya</em>, we had to do these lifts. She would say you know what to do for this one, ‘Grab me here and swing me around like this and we will end up in that position’. It’s easier. I tried it and it worked,” he says with a smile.<br />
The actor whose motto is ‘never slack in whatever you are doing’ realises that there has been a marked difference in the way the film industry now perceives and responds to him after two hits. But he also understands that <em>&#8230;Ram-leela</em> had more impact than <em>Gunday</em>.<br />
“.<em>..Ram-leela</em> doing well was a complete surprise because it was so improvised and not something I signed on. Mr Bhansali (Sanjay Leela Bhansali) changed everything during the making of the film, even the character, and I was not sure how people would react to the film. But its success had an instant impact. And I know how the public, media, producers and trade feel about me now. Understandably, it had a much bigger subject, bigger budget, a much bigger co-star, an established director. Personally, there is a difference for me when I take up a film and the broad arcs are always constant, but I can feel and understand the change in perception about me. I was also very happy with <em>Lootera</em> considering it was a niche film. It did a business of Rs.35 crore in a week and was the best reviewed film of the year. More than that it has a life. Even 15 years down the line you can watch it and appreciate it,” he predicts.<br />
The change and the appreciation is indeed visible! A no-nonsense director like Zoya finds him ‘hot property’ saying ‘she is very excited to start work with him’. Sharma chips in saying that it is unfair to compare him with anyone but he’s the brightest talent we have around.<br />
No surprise that film-makers want him to be part of their projects. According to his spokesperson, he is in an advanced stage of talks with Bhansali for <em>Bajirao Mastani</em> and there are reports that he will be doing a film with Aditya Chopra and may even land up playing the lead in Motwane’s Bhavesh Joshi. Besides, he will also be seen in a cameo as Deepika Padukone’s husband in <em>Finding Fanny</em>.<br />
Interestingly, there are also plans to diversify in other creative aspects of film-making in the next few years. “I want to start writing films, producing and maybe, even directing films and composing music. But I am not confident of the other skills as yet as I am too caught up with acting,” says the film industry’s hottest star on the block.<br />

<p>It’s not the first time that a college campus has been used to shoot a film, but it’s the first time that the love story of the film actually developed in a campus where the film was shot. Debutant director Abhishek Varman’s<em> 2 States</em> which is based on Chetan Bhagat’s book by the same name, and talks about his real life love story was shot at the same places where Bhagat and his beau studied.<br />
“It was very surreal when I joined the cast and crew of <em>2 States</em> in Ahmedabad at the Indian Institute of Management- Ahmedabad (IIM-A) for the shoot. That’s where my wife and I studied. The film was shot in the same dormitories where we sat, the Louis Khan Plaza where Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt’s convocation is shown in the film is the same place where I got my degree and also hostels where I stayed were captured. IIM-A has a very distinctive structure made of red bricks and is unlike any of the IIMs anywhere else. It’s very unique that a mainstream Bollywood film is captured in an intellectual place like the IIM. Being an alumnus of the Institute and Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions’ reputation helped in getting the required permissions, which would otherwise have been next to impossible,” said Bhagat who has also written, the film’s screenplay.<br />
<em>2 States</em> starring Arjun Kapoor and Alia Bhatt releases on April 18.</p>

<p>Ever since film-maker Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra announced Mirza Sahiba, a love tragedy inspired from folk tales, that will introduce Anil Kapoor’s son Harshwardhan Kapoor, there have been speculations about who will play the leading lady opposite him. After auditioning several girls, the film-maker has zeroed in on Ayesha Kapur, who had played the young Rani Mukerji in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Black and Piyush Jha’s Sikandar and yesteryear actress Usha Kiran’s granddaughter and Tanvi Azmi’s niece, Saiyami Kher a professional model who made her debut in the Telugu film Rey. After attending workshops in January, Kapoor and Kher are the contenders to play the lead in the film.<br />
When contacted Kapoor’s management company Kwan said that “It’s true, both the girls are in the running for the part, but we are as clueless as you regarding who has been selected.”<br />
The director did not respond to our message, inquiring who among the two has been selected. The script has been penned by Gulzar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Buddha In A Traffic Jam</em> to release this year</strong></p>
<p>Vivek Agnohotri’s <em>Buddha In A Traffic Jam</em>, talks about the agony of the underpriviliged in India. The film stars Pallavi Joshi, Anupam Kher, Mahie Gill and Arunodyay Singh is slated to release this year. Agnihotri who had produced the film with the students of the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad where the film was shot in 2011, said that after graduation the students went their separate ways, making it difficult for him to release the film. “But I have taken over and am marketing the film and hope to release it soon,” said Agnihotri.<br />
The film-maker also has two more upcoming films, <em>Freedom</em> and <em>Zid</em> both of which are in post-production.</p>

Jyothish receives his award from Sushma Seth" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jyothish267.jpg" /></a> M.G. Jyothish receives his award from Sushma Seth
<p>When the three witches of Macbeth spoke about hurly burly and rain, the reference wasn’t to a March evening in Delhi. Yet, the scene at the Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards (META) night, held at Taj Mansingh on Sunday was typically Shakespearian — a storm bellowed and raindrops splattered the stage as a cash-strapped director realised he had suddenly become a part of theatre royalty. M.G. Jyothish, selected Best Director for his Malayalam adaptation of Macbeth, discarded his borrowed jacket and arrived in his shirt sleeves to receive the award. “We entered the competition only after discussing it among troupe members. We believe that the arts are not meant for competition but, on the other hand, we were being offered a fee of ` 75,000 to perform. We could pay our actors with that money,” he said.<br />
This was the most that Jyotish (“not shy, just not comfortable with English”) spoke the whole evening. Indeed, his one-liners as he received prizes turned the packed gathering into fans. Picking up the prize for lighting, Jyotish said, “For me, lighting is the use of darkness”. The next award, for Costume Design, too went to him. “Costumes are not just clothes,” he said. Macbeth also won the choreography award for its portrayal of psychological trauma through physical movement.<br />
The awards, by the Mahindra Group, is in its sixth year. It is among the most coveted in the industry with more than 300 entries this year. Eight shortlisted plays were staged in Delhi between March 4 and 8, judged by stalwarts such as Shabana Azmi, Sushma Seth and Kulbhushan Kharbanda.<br />
The other big winner was Mumbai-based Company Theatre’s rollicking adaptation of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, titled Piya Behrupiya. The Best Supporting Actor (Female) nominees, for instance, were all from this play, with Neha Saraf taking home the trophy for her role as the jester. Two actors tied for the META for Best Supporting Actor (Male), Gagan Riar as a drunk nobleman and Amitosh Nagpal, who shone in — as he constantly complained in rhyme throughout the play — the smallest role in Piya Behrupiya, of the heroine’s brother Sebastian. Before the evening ended, Nagpal would win another award — The Special Jury Citation for Script, for his translation of Twelfth Night into Hindi. Director Atul Kumar won the award for Best Ensemble Performance and returned to the stage with his troupe for Best Play. C Sharp C Blunt won for Best Actor (Female), Best Original Script and Best Innovative Sound-Music Design.<br />
Girish Karnad won the award for Lifetime Achievement. Liju Krishna, from the play Moment Just before Death, cradled his META for Stage Design, and stuttered, “Great feel. I love my job. I love theatre, and I am just 23.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rag267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013422" alt="Ragini MMS2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rag267.jpg" /></a> Ragini MMS2
<p>While the music of<em> Ragini MMS</em> was forgettable or almost non &#8211; existent to say the least, the sequel has taken things to the next level with a six track album. The already popular dance number <em>Baby doll</em> is the opening track, where Meet Brothers&#8217; Anjjan have managed to blend some interesting beats, keeping the Punjabi and hip &#8211; hop fusion in mind. The mix of Punjabi, Hindi and English words is done well by Kumaar, but the lyrics may not go down too well with everyone, especially because of its sexual connotations. The tune is definitely catchy, but it is Kanika Kapoor’s unique voice that turns out to be the highlight of this song. Meet Brothers&#8217; Anjjan&#8217;s vocals add a good punch. There is also a remix version in the album done by DJ Shilpi Sharma, but it&#8217;s the original version that certainly has an upper hand.<br />
Rapper and singer Yo Yo Honey Singh makes an entry with Chaar botal vodka, an unusual party number with a twist. The slow beats and Punjabi lyrics packed with words glorifying alcohol will certainly keep the party crowd happy, but there is nothing in store for dance-song lovers here. This is one average affair. Pranay Rijia&#8217;s soft, contemporary number <em>Maine khud ko</em> is easy on the ears. The touch of soft, short words by Kumaar helps in bringing out the romantic feel of the song even more. Singers Mustafa Zahid and Kshitij Tarey get a version each to sing and we must say, both have done a decent job.<br />
<em>Lori of death</em> composed by Chirantan Bhatt goes well with the film&#8217;s subject and narrative, but you can skip this haunting lullaby. Although Aprita Chakraborty has done perfect justice to the song, it is too creepy what with words like <em>Ajgar nigal jaayega</em>?<br />
Overall, the <em>Ragini MMS 2</em> album is below average, with songs that have very little repeat value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>2 States</strong></em><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Full of zest</strong><br />
<em></em></p>
<p><em>Offo</em></p>
<p>Considering that the film&#8217;s theme revolves around the budding love between a young couple belonging to two different cultures, one can expect the songs of <em>2 States</em> to be dominated by urban, hip beats. Composers Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy have made a smart choice by roping in singers Aditi Singh Sharma and Amitabh Bhattacharya for the fun and full of zeal, <em>Offo</em>. Although the sounds used in the track are nothing new, <em>Offo</em> is a decent track that will connect with youngsters. The lyrics penned by Bhattacharya are hummable, as the words are simple yet quirky (sample this: <em>Ishq bhoot sahi par, bhoot bada yeh pyaara hain</em>). The stand out element is the part where the chorus comes together to shout the hookline, which keeps repeating at various intervals. Both Sharma and Bhattacharya have sung the track with great energy. Listen to it once, and you surely won&#8217;t get bored.</p>

Coming from a family of professional actors, the 24 year old, talks about his career in films, future roles <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014158&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arjun267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014159" alt="Arjun Chakraborty" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arjun267.jpg" /></a> Arjun Chakraborty
<p>By <strong>Shoma A. Chatterji</strong></p>
<p><strong>You made a mark with your debut in Rituparno Ghosh’s serial <em>Gaaner Oparey</em>. How did films happen?</strong></p>
<p>Film-makers like Sudeshna Roy and Abhijit Guha and many others who had seen the serial,<em> Gaaner&#8230;</em> liked my work and received offers from several big production houses. Roy and Guha gave me a break in <em>Bapi Bari Jaa</em> in which I played the title role of Bapi who is trying to cope with his sexuality and the trauma he undergoes. Though the film was not a great box- office hit, I got noticed and roles slowly but steadily began to trickle in.</p>
<p><strong>Your family comprising your father, veteran actor Sabyasachi Chakraborty, mother Mithu Chakraborty, elder brother Gaurav (an FTII graduate) and grandmother are actors. Don’t you find it a bit intimidating to be the only one without any training and experience?</strong></p>
<p>On the contrary, I feel that having parents who are also actors is a big advantage. They do not cramp my style. Nor do they dictate my choice of films. I approach them when I feel I need to. Audience expectations might be high because my parents are very successful. They have taught me to go with the flow, which I try to follow.</p>
<p><strong>You worked with Sudeshna and Abhijit for the second time in <em>Jodi Love Dile Na Praane</em>. What was the experience like?</strong></p>
<p>I was a bit nervous to begin with, what with veteran actors like Koushik Ganguly, Abir Chatterjee, Ananya Chatterjee and Sujan Mukherjee in the film. But once homework began, everything fell in place. Sudeshnadi and Abhijitda are organised and their planning is almost perfect. They place you in a comfort zone that helps you perform well. I play the assistant of a noted film-maker but our bonding in the film reaches much beyond work. My character is too mature for his age but is a very likeable personality.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of actor would you describe yourself as?</strong></p>
<p>I am a director’s actor who likes to give inputs if the director is receptive to them, and if they fit into the larger framework of the script. My homework consists in visiting the locations of a film even when I am not needed for the shoot. I often work with my family members and this makes things quite easy. In <em>Jodi Love Dile Na Prane</em>, my mother plays my screen mother as well and we find ourselves enacting some slices of real life in front of the camera. For <em>Bapi Bari Jaa,</em> there was a workshop before the shooting which gave me the confidence to open out in front of the camera.</p>
<p><strong>Are you in a position to reject roles now?</strong></p>
<p>(<em>Smiles shyly</em>) Not really, but I do reject when I find that script is weak and the story will not hold. This is subjective and instinctive, of course. For example, of the seven offers that came to me after<em> Jodi Love Dile Na Prane</em>, I have accepted only three. And I have voluntarily opted out of television completely.</p>
<p><strong>What are these projects?</strong></p>
<p>The three films that I have are all very exciting. One is <em>Aaschhe Bochor Abar Hobe</em> directed by Susanta Das,<em> Chirodini Tumi Je Amar 2</em> directed by Shounak Chatterjee and Anindabikash Dutta’s <em>Bonkubabu</em> in which Saswata Chatterjee plays the title role and is my grandfather. The first film is a love story where Rittika plays my romantic interest and it is shot against the backdrop of the <em>Durga pooja</em> in Durgapur. The second is also a love story where I am cast opposite Urmila Mohanta and the third is an action-cum-love story with Arunima Ghosh as my love interest.</p>
<p><strong>What is your dream role?</strong></p>
<p>Any James Bond kind of action hero is my dream. I have a holistic approach towards fitness. I played a lot of cricket and football earlier and once had dreams of joining the army. But destiny had different plans, but I have no regrets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HC upholds single judge’s order; dismisses appeal</strong></p>
<p>Madras High Court recently dismissed an appeal filed by film producer S Thanu against the order of a single judge declining injunction to restrain elected members of the Tamil Film Producers Council from taking charge to their respective posts. Alleging various malpractices, Thanu had filed a civil suit to declare the election null and void and also sought an injunction restraining the members from taking charge of various posts.<br />
The Court had ordered to conduct the elections and had appointed former judges, Justice S Jagadeesan and Justice K Venkataraman as Judge-Commissioners. Elections were held in Sepember 7 last year.<br />
<strong>-PTI</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Odia stars join politics</strong></p>
<p>Veteran Odia film actor Bijay Mohanty joined Congress recently and is likely to contest the ensuing general elections. This was announced by Odisha PCC president Jaydev Jena at Bhubaneswar when Mohanty joined the party at Congress Bhavan there.<br />
Mohanty, who has worked in over 70 Odia films, joined Congress barely some days after another veteran actress Aparajita Mohanty joined the party. She is likely to contest from Cuttack Lok Sabha seat. Meanwhile, Odia film actors Sritam Das and Pinky Pradhan have joined BJP. Earlier, Odia film actor Anubhav Mohanty and noted comedian Papu had joined the ruling BJD.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ragini267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013169" alt="Scare fare: This is how Sunny Leone looks in a major portion of the film" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ragini267.jpg" /></a> Scare fare: This is how Sunny Leone looks in a major portion of the film
<p>Seductress Sunny Leone’s character takes an evil turn in <em>Ragini MMS2</em>. The makeover happens towards the climax which was shot in Mumbai. For this, Leone had to wear a different set of outfits, a scary wig, decayed teeth and dark, smokey make-up which would completely change her look, and everyone around her would be unable to recognise the actress. “I would always forget how I look while shooting. I remember, someone had brought a toddler on the sets and in between shots, I was told that they wanted me to click a picture with him. I ran, hugged the child and went on to pose, only to realise that the mother was shocked to see me as I still had that scary make-up on,” mentioned Leone, adding that somehow the child wasn’t scared at all, although several people on the sets would often run away thinking it was a real ghost.<br />
The prosthetic make-up would take anywhere between three to four hours. Metallic paint was used on the face, before applying heavy <em>kajal</em> and strokes of black paint. The colour of her teeth were turned into a mix of fungae green and yellow. Several coats of paint were also used on Leone’s body. The make-up was done by three artists, but the team was headed by a lady artist, whom Leone lovingly refers to as GP. “Her husband is popular for prosthetic make-up. She used to keep asking her husband for tips and everyone on the sets believed that she has done a fabulous job,” stated Leone. In addition to the make-up, the audience will see some 3-D work, done to enhance those scenes where Leone appears in her ghostly avatar.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ek267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013343" alt="Ashish Chowdhry  in  Ek Mutthi Aasmaan " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ek267.jpg" /></a> Ashish Chowdhry in<br /><em>Ek Mutthi Aasmaan</em>
<p>Ashish Chowdhry plays Raghav Singhania, a brooding businessman out to avenge his father’s murder in <em>Ek Mutthi Aasmaan</em>, a popular serial on Zee. A quintessential Hindi film hero, who looks tough, but is soft from within. The current track of the show has Singhania in a confused state of mind as he’s in love with Kalpi (Rachna Parulkar), but gets close to Pakhi (Shirina Singh) to take revenge on her father. Ask Chowdhry about the character and he says, “In television, everything keeps changing, so as of now even I don’t know what will happen. But revenge is pretty much the crux of the story, and it will shake up the love story a bit. Personally, I want the revenge track to happen as I’m a huge fan of this American show <em>Revenge</em>. My character in <em>Ek Mutthi&#8230;</em> is slightly similar to that of Emily Vamcamp. But a love story is also important in a show, so that will be around too!”<br />
The actor though is extremely happy with the kind of feedback he’s got for his performance. “I’m glad I got to play a character like Raghav, because there’s so much I get to do here, in terms of the various moods and emotions. It’s satisfying. I’ve been getting some good feedback, but I feel I want to be able to contribute to the creatives, but television is completely a channel and the writer’s medium. I wish I could get into the creatives sometime,” says Chowdhry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A serial on ‘change’</strong></p>
<p><em>Bindass’s new show addresses issues of young Indians with a touch of humour</em></p>
<p>With its new show, <em>Change Ayega, Hum Layenge</em>, Bindass encourages young Indians to bring about a change. The show decodes a multitude of issues affecting youth like education, employment and women’s safety, through satire.<br />
Actor Gurpreet Saini, who was last seen in Anil Kapoor’s <em>24</em>, has been roped in to host the show. Each episode will have a spoof on the issue being discussed and end with a strong message on it.<br />
In order to create spoofs, Bindass has roped in the popular ‘The Viral Fever’ (TVF) of the <em>Qutiyapa</em> fame, that redefined the virtual video space by creating videos that spoof trending topics.</p>

<p>By <strong>Suyash Gabriel</strong></p>
<p>In a performance that revived European history and turned the wheels of time to take one back to the days of maestros such as Bach, Handel and Vivaldi, French soprano singer Dominique Moaty alongside Justin McCarthy on the harpischord, breathed a new lease of life into the long forgotten artistic style of classical Baroque music. The form is known to have evolved in the 17th and 18th centuries. The duo delivered a powerful and emotionally-charged performance titled Europa Barocca at India International Centre recently.<br />
The Baroque period and its artforms are typically characterised by exaggerated motion and easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, and grandeur in various sculptures, paintings, architecture, literature, dance, and music.<br />
The multilingual concert was divided into three movements which represented three different hubs of Baroque evolution — France, Italy and England — and featured songs with themes about heartache and lost love. Under the four spotlights, the performance was dramatically charged with all the theatrics in place, exaggerated gestures and pronounced expressions. “Baroque music is an intimate form which connects with its audience, which is why it didn’t matter that we played in three different languages. The audience should still be able to understand the theme and the mood,” said McCarthy.<br />
The rattling sounds of harpsichord were a perfect match for Moaty’s powerful yet controlled vibrato that resonated in the auditorium, overpowering the space on regular intervals. “I sing other types of music as well, but there is something magical about Baroque music and this period of history. I’m fascinated with this time in history, with the evolution of the Italian perspective of theatre and the evolution of the soloist voice,” said Moaty, who added that she’s always been interested in the melancholic themes including emptiness, patience and longing used in the songs of this period. She reiterated that India also underwent a similar period with the evolution of the Bharatnatyam dance form. “I love the dramatic and expressive nature of theatre and art that evolved during this period,” she added.<br />
McCarthy, who is an American-born Bharatnatyam dancer, plays the classical piano and the harpsichord and has been living and performing in India for over three decades. “I’ve been playing this instrument for over seven years. I think, it’s only now that people are getting used to new sounds. I hope they are not as strange to them anymore,” he said.</p>

<p>If reports are to be believed, then it would be interesting to see Shah Rukh Khan, who plays a bootlegger in Rahul Dholakia’s <em>Raees</em>, share screen space with Nawazuddin Siddique who will play a cop. It was Farhan Akhtar who was supposed to play the role, but had to opt out because of date issues.<br />
<em>Raees</em> is being produced by Ritesh Sidhwani and Farhan Akhtar’s Excel Entertainment. When we tried to contact Sidhwani, he was unavailable<br />
for comment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Rahasya</em> makers to screen film for Talwar’s relative</strong></p>
<p>The makers of the yet-to-be released film <em>Rahasya</em> informed the Bombay High Court that a private screening of the film would be arranged for one relative of Noida’s doctor-couple Rajesh and Nupur Talwar convicted of murdering their daughter Aarushi in 2008. The couple, who is serving a life sentence for the murder of their daughter and domestic help in their Nodia residence in May 2008, had moved the High Court seeking a stay on the film’s release. Their stand was that the film is based on “distorted facts surrounding the gruesome death” of their daughter.<br />
The couple had during the last hearing sought a private screening of the movie for one family member. The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) had earlier informed the court that the movie is based on fiction and bears no resemblance to Talwar’s case. Advocate Atul Damle, appearing for director Manish Gupta and producer UVI Films Production Ltd, today told the court that the film would be screened for one member of the Talwar family and one of their advocates on the condition that they would not disclose the details of the movie.</p>

<p><strong>Sooni Taraporevala ready with a romantic political thriller</strong></p>
<p><em>Wants to pitch it to Aamir Khan</em></p>
<p>By <strong>Geety Sahgal</strong></p>
<p>Sooni Taraporevala, the screenwriter of<em> Mississipi Masala, The Namesake</em> and <em>Salaam Bombay</em> and the writer and director of <em>Little Zizou</em>, has scripted a romantic-political thriller, which she wants to make a film on. “I am in the process of pitching my script to producers and that could include Anand Mahindra (Chairman and Managing Director of the Mahindra Group and the collaborator of the Sundance Institute) as I am a part of his Screenwriters Lab,” said Taraporevala.<br />
Interestingly, Taraporevala is very keen that Aamir Khan goes through her script. “He’s aware of it but has been busy of late. I am waiting as I really want him to read it,” she said.</p>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It is more or less confirmed that Priyanka Chopra will be doing Madhur Bhandarkar’s <em>Madamji</em>. The film traces the journey of an item girl who eventually ventures into politics and Chopra, it seems, is very gung-ho about the project. “Priyanka loved the script, but she has yet to sign on the dotted line as the modalities are still being worked out,” said a source close to Bhandarkar adding that the film is slated to start in October.<br />
</span>“<em>Madamji</em> will be shot in Mumbai, Delhi and UP. The film is woman-centric and like all of Madhur’s films, it will be made on a modest budget.”<br />
Bhandarkar and Chopra had earlier worked in<em> Fashion</em> for which the actress had also won a National Award in the Best Actress Category.</p>
<p><strong>Priyanka in Prabhu Dheva’s next starring Saif Ali Khan?</strong></p>
<p>Although he is currently busy with his next directorial venture, <em>Action Jackson</em>, starring Ajay Devgn, Prabhu Dheva has already started making plans for his other ventures. It was earlier reported that Prabhu Dheva’s next project will be a Reliance Entertainment venture starring Saif Ali Khan. According to latest reports, the new development is that the director has approached Priyanka Chopra for the role of the leading lady in the film.<br />
Considering this pair has never been seen on the celluloid before, the director was keen on signing Chopra for the film. When we tried to contact Prabhu Dheva to confirm the news, the director was unavailable for comment. Chopra’s spokesperson said she could comment on it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014419&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>Q. 1 You played a leader of a vigilante group in <em>Gulaab Gang.</em> What are your views on women empowerment and safety in real life?</strong></p>
<p>I strongly feel that strong guidelines and policies should be formulated to ensure women’s safety on a priority basis. My roles in films like <em>Mrityudand, Lajja, Beta, Prem Granth</em> depicts a woman who is not meek and possesses strength of character. Women should be strong-willed.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 2 How much is education vital for women empowerment?</strong></p>
<p>While, it is imperative that women should be educated, it is equally important to educate men to bring about a change that will benefit society. Education leads to information and also changes one’s perception about others. Men will cease to treat women like an object.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 3 What steps would you take to educate and thus empower women?</strong></p>
<p>I will soon start my own academy, <em>Dance with Madhuri</em> where I want every one to learn dancing. It is my passion that I want other women to share.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 4 Are you anything like <em>Rajjo</em>, the character you play in <em>Gulaab Gang</em>?</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed playing Rajjo very much, because I believe in what she believes in. That is what made me take up this film in the first place, because I strongly feel women should be em-powered in the right sense. Like Rajjo says, ‘<em>Jaise til mein tel hai, jyon chakmak mein aag, Tera saai tujh mein hai, tu jaag sake to jaag</em>’. Likewise, every woman is empowered, it is just that she needs to make her voice heard, come out and say ‘this is me’. The film talks about educating women, equipping them to stand on their own feet and live independently. In the cities we see that a lot, but what about the two tier places and the villages. The film has a message for them too.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 5 Recently, you spoke about self-defence. Are you personally trained in it too?</strong></p>
<p>In Denver, I would take my kids for Taekwondo classes. But, instead of waiting for them to finish their hour-long class, I decided to learn the craft myself. So we took a family class where all of us learnt Taekwondo and we were just five belts away from becoming black belts. This experience helped me during<em> Gulaab Gang</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 6 Would you recommend learning self-defence for the general public?</strong></p>
<p>In today’s world, it is very necessary for girls to be self-reliant. For that matter, even boys need to learn the mechanisms in self-defence, as anything can happen at anytime. You see the world is becoming a crazy place, what with terrorist attacks and unforeseen tragedies, people should know how to react at such times. We are not taught about this and so we do not know what to do. Self-defence should be taught from school itself. The schools in the US have fire drill classes for children where they teach, ‘In case of fire, stop, drop and roll. Don’t just start running.’ This is taught at a young age and so children are aware of how to save themselves even during a tornado or any such conditions. Our schools here are not very forthcoming with such lessons. I think it is very important to be taught how to conduct oneself in stressful conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 7 What is the foremost course that our schools should start?</strong></p>
<p>It is natural for people to panic in case of a tragedy. They should be taught to protect themselves. The first thing they teach you in Taekwondo is if there is a fight walk away from it. But if it is inevitable, like a life and death situation, then you have to not only fight with all your strength, but fight smart. In films we blow punches, that is not possible in real life, but a hard slap should do the trick, or a poke in the eye or a kick in the groin is more affective.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 8 What would be the simplest way for girls to defend themselves; for instance use pepper spray which you recently distributed at an event?</strong></p>
<p>Although learning the art of self-defence is important, it is not physically possible for a woman to fight five men at the same time. But if she thinks right, even those 30 seconds can be useful to help her escape. If someone is pulling you, instead of going away, go towards him and poke him in the eye. That will keep him occupied for sometime which can help you escape and ask for help. Pepper spray is just a temporary weapon to escape nasty situations. But do carry it with you as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 9 What would you suggest for the women of today?</strong></p>
<p>I think, the change must come from within. Even men have to rethink their priorities. They are wired in a different way and that wiring needs to be changed.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 10 As an actor, people idolise you.</strong></p>
<p>That’s true but even I cannot tolerate injustice and believe in fighting the way my characters do on screen. Everybody feels that anger because of what’s happening in the society. We should fight for our cause.</p>

<p>For his negative character in the Hindi and Tamil yet-untitled remake of Mahesh Manjrekar’s Marathi film <em>Kaksparsh</em>, actor Murli Sharma had to shave off his head. Set in the 1930s, Sharma is reprising the role played by Marathi actor Vaibhav Mangale in the original and his character is named Neelkanth Shastri, a staunch Brahmin who has ideological differences with the hero played by Arvind Swamy.<br />
Though Sharma actually worked for about 8-10 days, his dates stretched to a month. The actor had to keep his head clean shaven for over 50 days. “I had heard so much about <em>Kaksparsh</em>, and could not refuse the film when Mahesh Manjrekar approached me. It is one of the landmark films in Marathi cinema,” he added. The film has Tisca Chopra in the role of Swamy’s wife, while Vaidehi Parshurami plays the widow.<br />
Besides this film, Sharma is excited about<em> O Teri</em> that will release on March 28. He plays a negative role, that of a Delhi businessman named Nahata.<br />
In Remo D’Souza’s official remake of <em>Dead on Arrival</em>, Sharma will play a corrupt police inspector, Vishwanath Chinchure. The film starring Rajeev Khandelwal has been tentatively titled <em>Amar Must Die</em>. It is directed by Param Gill, who had earlier directed <em>Rockin’ Meera</em> and <em>Hotel Hollywood</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sushant Singh Rajput in a biopic on Mahendra Singh Dhoni</strong></p>
<p>There are strong indications that Sushant Singh Rajput has been roped in to play Mahendra Singh Dhoni in Neeraj Pandey’s next, that will be a biopic on India’s captain. According to the buzz, Dhoni has given his consent to the project. Rajput, who is busy with Dibakar Bannerjee’s<em> Byomkesh Bannerjee</em> has already started working on the role and had visited Dhoni’s hometown, Ranchi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts of <em>Super Nani</em> to be reshot   </strong></p>
<p>By<strong> Priya Adivarekar</strong></p>
<p>After being delayed for almost a year, director Indra Kumar is all set to release his film <em>Super Nani</em> on May 1. But before that, the cast and crew will re-shoot a few portions of the film. When contacted, actor Sharman Joshi, who plays the male lead in the Rekha starrer, stated that they will be filming a few important parts over a period of two- three days. “Although I am not the best person to talk about this, I know that we will re-shoot some portions. In fact, we have been informed that we will be adding some new scenes as well. It just requires a couple of days of shoot, that’s it. Nothing major,” mentioned Joshi, who will be seen playing Rekha’s loving grandson in the family entertainer.</p>

<p>Actor Saahil Chadha, who is currently seen playing the role of King Nomad in <em>The Adventures of Hatim</em> on Life OK, recently finished shooting an upcoming cross-over film titled<em> Utopia</em>. It was helmed by Iranian director Haasan Nazer who has worked on several short festival films like<em> Black Day, Here Iran</em>, among others.<br />
“<em>Utopia</em> is a docu-drama, which is the story of three people who are living in different parts of the world, that includes Afghanistan, Scotland and India. As the title suggests, people in this film are trying to find their perfect world. My character Rajnysh is a sweet but integral part of the story’s flow. Since childhood, he had considered a man who lived in his neighbourhood and who later becomes his father-in-law, as a role model. The story revolves around the family’s struggle for living in the world of their dreams,” stated Chadha, who added that he has already shot for the film in Jaipur and the crew is currently filming the portions in Afghanistan. Although the film is targetted at a niche audience and will be dominantly screened during film festivals, Chadha mentioned that he is trying to convince the producers, Tripswitch Productions and World Film Production, to ensure that the film gets at least a limited screen release in India.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>City Lights to release on May 1</strong></p>
<p>After the critically-acclaimed <em>Shahid</em>, the team of director Hansal Mehta and actor Rajkummar Rao’s second venture together, <em>City Lights</em> is set to release on May 1. The film is an official remake of the international award winning film <em>Metro Manila</em> and is based on the life of a farmer in Rajasthan who comes to Mumbai with his wife and daughter in hope of a better life. Produced by Fox Star Studios and Vishesh Films, the film also stars debutante Patralekha.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/choota267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013402" alt="Chota Bheem" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/choota267.jpg" /></a> Chota Bheem
<p>After growing up with <em>Tom &amp; Jerry, DuckTales, TaleSpin, Powerpuff Girls</em>, in 2008 children in India were introduced to a new hero—<em>Chota Bheem</em>—by kids channel Pogo. Taking inspiration from Indian mythology, <em>Chota Bheem</em> was the quintessential Indian superhero but with modern sensibilities. No wonder that children developed an instant liking for the animation series of the same name propelling Pogo to the number one position in the kids entertainment genre. Soon followed other characters such as <em>Mighty Raju, Kumbh Karan</em> on Pogo. Launched as a general entertainment channel for kids, Pogo completes 10 years in India this month. In a conversation <strong>KRISHNA DESAI</strong>, executive director and network head, kids, South Asia, Turner International India, talks about the journey of the channel.</p>
<p><strong>Pogo completes 10 years in the country. How has the journey been for the channel which started as second fiddle to Cartoon Network?</strong></p>
<p>The last 10 years have been really fantastic for Pogo in India. The channel was launched in January 1, 2004 as a general entertainment channel (GEC) for kids as back then Cartoon Network was considered to be the main cartoon channel for kids in India. The channel was launched with a variety of programmes including animation, movies, local content, game shows, etc, which was not based on any particular genre. Also, the channel targetted children in the age group of 4-14 years which provided the scope to broaden its programming content. The other reason behind Pogo’s success is that the channel was 100 per cent made for Indian market. 80 per cent of Pogo’s content – animation series such as <em>Chota Bheem, Mighty Raju, Kumbh Karan</em>, the art and craft series<em> MAD</em> – were either locally sourced or created.</p>
<p><strong>To what extend has Chota Bheem turned the tide in favour of Pogo and helped it in its success?</strong></p>
<p>While Pogo was popular at the time, <em>Chota Bheem</em> was launched. In terms of ranking, the channel was third or fourth depending on a particular week’s performance. Cartoon Network was the leader in the kids programming genre. Nickelodeon was not distributed well, so the channel had limited reach and then Disney launched its kids channels. There was no dearth of content as far as the kids genre was considered. But within two and a half years of launching<em> Chota Bheem</em>, Pogo became the number one channel. The show which is now a franchisee provided a huge boost to Pogo and helped us to beat the other channels including Cartoon Network to become number one.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to add more language feeds this year?</strong></p>
<p>Language feed was introduced in 1999 based on Cartoon Network’s <em>desi</em> boom strategy. The aim behind the move was to make content locally relevant for children in this country. Apart from launching Pogo in English, three new feeds were added—Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. There is no plan to launch any more language feeds as in states such as West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka there is no demand for content in regional languages as viewers prefer watching Pogo either in English or Hindi.</p>
<p><strong>Pogo has fewer programmes on air compared to other channels. Is this a deliberate move, and what is the reason behind it?</strong></p>
<p>Kids today have become more selective when it comes to watching television. Time spent on television has reduced to two hours a day. Children have a lot of options with an increase in the number of channels. So we changed our programming strategy, so rather than launching new shows, we increased the volume of our content. We acquired new seasons, which helped in providing a continuity to the story-telling. This strategy has worked in Pogo’s favour.</p>
<p><strong>With broadcasters yet to benefit from digitisation, how will you ensure revenue growth?</strong></p>
<p>The issue with the kids genre is that there is a lot of under-pricing as far as advertising revenue is concerned. The number of channels has increased from one or two channels to nine or 10 today and everyone is fighting for their share of advertising revenue. The kids genre accounts for 6.47 per cent of the total television viewership pie. The genre’s share in the advertising pie is only three per cent, almost half of its share in the viewership pie. As broadcasters, we are yet to benefit from digitisation in the form of subscription revenue. So we try to come out with solutions through which we could provide something extra to our advertisers. We partner with our advertisers through brand associations, various online activities and on-ground initiatives. We have a division called Turner Media Solutions which handles the deals.</p>
<p><strong>For a kids channel, how important is the web which gives the option to introduce games online and on-ground activities. How has Pogo leveraged this platform?</strong></p>
<p>Online games is the pillar of the overall online strategy. Our research revealed that kids spend 70 per cent of their time online playing games. We created branded games based on popular characters such as <em>Chota Bheem</em>, <em>Chutki</em>, etc. On-ground activities are equally important as it provides face-to-face interaction with children. We reach out to thousands of schools and we get quality interaction with kids in a branded environment. We take our popular characters there. For example, through Bheem’s <em>Green Team</em>, we spread the message about environment, that is, ‘how green is good’. We usually organise two large events, followed by three smaller programmes. We reach out to over a million kids over a year.</p>
<p><strong>What are the new programmes that you have lined up for Pogo?</strong></p>
<p>The aim is to always be at the number one position and to ensure this we have acquired new content apart from acquiring new episodes of on-going shows. So viewers will get to see more of <em>Mighty Raju</em> and <em>Chota Bheem</em>. Additionally, the channel will have original programming such as<em> Chhota Chintu Bada Pheku</em>, more live action, tele-movies such as <em>Bhoot Raja Aur Ronnie</em>.</p>

<p>I like to watch comedy based shows like <em>Comedy Circus</em>. I like to be relaxed and comedy is the best way to achieve that. I like to watch <em>Koffee with Karan</em> as he makes actors open up about their unknown side. I used to also watch <em>The Mentalist</em> earlier. I do like to watch Rajeev Masand’s <em>Round Table</em>. I am an avid cricket buff, so whenever there are cricket matches, follow them.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Academy award-winning Jennifer Lawrence, the youngest three-time nominee, keeps displaying the personal qualities which add to her star power<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014109&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jennifer267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014111" alt="Jennifer Lawrence" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jennifer267.jpg" /></a> Jennifer Lawrence
<p>It was at the 2008 Venice Film Festival that Jennifer Lawrence — future Oscar winner, squirrel skinner, American warrior — signalled that she was no ordinary starlet. She wasn’t yet famous then, just a paparazzi afterthought to Charlize Theron, her co-star in The Burning Plain.<br />
During an event for the movie, Theron showered praise on co-star, Kim Basinger, who wasn’t there. Lawrence apparently silenced the room by joking that Basinger had died. The girl can’t help it!<br />
What Lawrence then said was funnier and so blunt that only The Daily Telegraph appears to have carried it. “Working with Kim was one of the most amazing moments of my life,” Lawrence said. “She’s so focused and nice — everything you don’t expect when you hear you’re going to be working with Kim Basinger.”<br />
Was that a ditzy gaffe or a sly, funny dig of the kind that once might have come out of Judy Holliday? Or was Jennifer Lawrence just being Jennifer Lawrence, the best actress winner who tripped on her way to grab her Oscar for David O Russell’s Silver Linings Playbook and then — in what was the perfect capper to the inanity of the awards season — flipped the bird at someone in the press room?Silver Linings Playbook is the movie that turned many around on Lawrence, 23, transforming them from sceptics into admirers. Even her roles as an Ozarks scrapper in Winter’s Bone and as the blue bombshell Mystique in the 2011 action film X-Men: First Class had not convinced most critics. What changed?<br />
As Tiffany, the randy widow turned dancing stalker in Silver Linings, Lawrence inhabited a deceptively tricky role with such transparency that it felt as if she had collapsed the space between her and the character. Tiffany doesn’t make much story sense — she cajoles Bradley Cooper’s character into partnering with her for a dance contest, though neither can really dance — but Russell’s film is irresistible, and Lawrence’s performance so likable that it makes the narrative contrivances irrelevant.<br />
Like all of Lawrence’s signature characters, she can’t be denied, whether chasing down Cooper’s wreck in Silver Linings or landing a kiss on Amy Adams that feels like a sucker punch in Russell’s latest, American Hustle.<br />
In that film, Lawrence plays Rosalyn, the neglected wife of a con man (Christian Bale) who’s fallen for Adams’s character. She doesn’t have all that much screen time, but is a dominating, palpably physical presence.<br />
It’s a delectable, juicy, surprising performance. You never know what Rosalyn wants, but that makes the character a woozy, a delight in a film that makes virtue out of chaos.<br />
Yet while all actors act, stars give more than performances: They deliver identifiable, commodifiable personalities that often blur the lines between their on-screen and off-screen worlds. From Lawrence’s interviews, her offscreen mugging and photo bombing, she doesn’t appear especially interested in playing the star; being human seems enough for now. That isn’t as easy as it sounds given how difficult it has become for stars to have a private life — to walk to a yoga class or pass out drunk in a friend’s car — without becoming fodder for tabloids and gossip sites.<br />
Lawrence may come across like a natural, but her talent has been honed by almost a decade of experience. At 14, while visiting New York, she was tapped by a modelling scout.<br />
In 2008, she added three movies to her résumé, including The Burning Plain and Garden Party. There was also the leading role in The Poker House.<br />
By May 2011, Lawrence had already been nominated for best actress for Winter’s Bone and cast as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games.<br />
In January 2013, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire broke a couple of records, first by overtaking Iron Man 3 to become the highest domestic grosser. That same month, industry observer Mark Harris noticed that the film had reached an even more startling benchmark: It was the first film with a lone female lead to top an annual box-office chart since The Exorcist 40 years earlier.<br />
Even so, media types continue, with smiles and rank condescension, to label Lawrence “awkwardly charming” — a headline recently said she made the Golden Globes “more awesome, in her great goofy way” — which suggests how anomalous she registers, how confusing and unclassifiable she is amid the bland and the blonde.</p>

<p>The third season of <em>DID L’il Masters</em>, will see quite a change in the avatar of Grand Master Mithun Chakraborty. The grand premiere of the show will have Mithun<em>da</em> (as fondly called in the film industry), will be dressed like a rapper. He’ll be seen sporting a studded black leather jacket with an embellished hat along with thick gold chains, pendants and flamboyant rings in each finger. And that’s not all, he actually sings a special rap song to introduce the judges and skippers. The look must’ve surely taken the actor back to his <em>Disco Dancer</em> days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abhishek-Aishwarya to appear on <em>Mad In India</em> </strong></p>
<p>It’s been a while since we saw a star couple on screen, and if all things go as planned, then television audience are in for a treat. The grapevine has it that Abhishek Bachchan and wife, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are expected to appear together on Star Plus’ comic caper <em>Mad In India</em>. “Nothing has been finalised yet,” says a source a close to the show. Considering that Aishwarya Rai has been making very few public appearances, post the birth of daughter Aaradhya, it may turn out to be a coup for the channel, especially when seen in the company of her husband, Abhishek who’s known for his zany sense of humour.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013302&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Is it possible for men to accept successful women as their better halves without being resentful?

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sonam2671.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014271" alt="GENDER BENDER: Sonam Kapoor and  Ayushmann Khurrana in Bewakoofiyaan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sonam2671.jpg" /></a> GENDER BENDER: Sonam Kapoor and<br />Ayushmann Khurrana in Bewakoofiyaan
<p>The festival of colours is upon us and though none of its boisterous festivity is displayed in any of the films that released this week, what is increasingly on display in our films are the multi-hued women protagonists with a whole wide spectrum of situations they find themselves in. The premise of <em>Bewakoofiyaan</em>, a romcom about love in times of recession, directed by Nupur Asthana interested me enough to make a go of watching it all by myself at a neighbouring multiplex. And despite the “flatness” that has been mentioned in the reviews in context of the film, I found it engaging. Call me shallow but when it comes to the movies, a light-hearted take on most things serious is always a good way to go.<br />
Mohit Chadda (Ayushmann Khurrana), an ambitious young MBA ostensibly doing well in the job of his choice — a senior marketing executive in the airlines — believes that love can be smooth sailing even in bumpy recession ridden times. Ditto, his girlfriend Myra (Sonam Kapoor), who has a well-paying job and is earning more than him. It’s not something that bothers them. After all, he’s a bright guy who will soon catch up. Father of the wannabe bride, V.K. Sehgal (Rishi Kapoor in yet another endearing outing) of course, is not convinced about Khurrana being the suitable boy. His argument is sound — he does not think a senior executive in an airline is capable of keeping his daughter comfortable through life and let’s face it, Myra is a smart, personable young girl who splurges on shoes, is sharply turned out in high street labels on all occasions— certainly not someone who would be keen to slum it out.<br />
The premise which questions both the veracity and wisdom of marrying daughters to willing, well settled money minting mundas is rather intriguing. Equality, after all, is a double-edged sword. Can the so-called modern generation, which prides its modernity, handle true egalitarianism when the convention is turned on its head and the woman is bringing home the bacon? <em>Abhimaan</em>, a film rumoured to be based on <em>sitar</em> maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar and his immensely accomplished wife Annapurna Devi dealt with a similar query that — of whether it is possible for a marriage/relationship to survive if the wife is more accomplished, famous or rich than her spouse. In fact decades later, <em>Bewakoofiyaan</em> goes a step further and questions the notion of unconditional romance without the creature comforts that wealth and power brings. Can love really last through trying times?<br />
These are pertinent questions, more relevant today than before, questions that the young and old find asking themselves. V.K. Sehgal’s dilemma when he discovers that his future<em> jamai</em> has been rendered jobless, just as he suspected but is a real nice guy for keeping his promise to his prospective father-in-law despite a major lovers’ tiff, is one worth considering. As also the clash of the new age independent woman and the well meaning new age man caught unaware in the changing times. Myra is willing to be supportive both financially and emotionally, but she is no sacrificing<em> devi</em>— she enjoys her creature comforts including expensive rock show tickets and is unwilling to settle for someone not trying hard enough to get out of a sticky situation. What does that make her? A terrible <em>matlabi</em> materialistic vamp or a woman who knows her mind and her limitations?<br />
Enough questions and answers out there to keep you pondering for a while and for that alone, all else is forgiven.</p>

<p>In what is a first, three talented actors, Naseerudin Shah, Paresh Rawal and Annu Kapoor will be coming together for a satirical comedy, <em>Dharam Sankat Mein</em>. The film is an official adaptation of the 2010 British comedy, <em>The Infidel</em> which is about a British Muslim who goes through an identity crisis when he discovers he was born to a Jewish family and was adopted as a child. While Rawal plays the protagonist, Shah and Kapoor play pivotal roles in the film. The Indian version, <em>Dharam Sankat Mein</em> will like the original, deal with various religious idiosyncrasies.<br />
The film that is produced by Viacom 18 will be helmed by first-time director Fuwad Khan, who has earlier worked as a cinematographer for <em>A Wednesday</em> and <em>Murder</em>, is slated to take off after a few weeks in Mumbai. Paresh Rawal who had earlier worked in the satire <em>OMG: Oh My God!</em> said that, “a satirical comedy gives an actor an opportunity to experiment.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will Action Jackson be pushed?</strong></p>
<p>The Ajay Devgn-Sonakshi Sinha starrer, <em>Action Jackson</em> has been in the news for quite some time. First because of the title tussle with Warner Bros, and now with reports that the film might get pushed by a few months and release around September, three months after its original release date, June 6. While major portions of the film have already been shot, the last schedule consisting of 10-12 days of shooting remains.<br />
When contacted, producer Gowardhan Tanwani stated that the chances of <em>Action Jackson</em> releasing on its scheduled date looked bleak. &#8220;But I can get a clarity after I meet up with Prabhu Dheva and Ajay Devgn. Only if they can work on the film day and night will it be possible to release it on June 6. But the chances look slim,&#8221; mentioned Tanwani.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tanuja267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014215" alt="Veteran actress Tanuja" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tanuja267.jpg" /></a> Veteran actress Tanuja
<p>She’s just finished watching <em>People Like Us</em> on television and found the 2012 American drama thoroughly engaging. The 70-plus Tanuja is a picture of elegance — dressed as she is in white cotton trousers, a satin blue top with a string of pearls around her neck— in her home tucked away in a quiet lane in the otherwise bustling suburbs of Mumbai. The walls of her home are graced with family photographs of daughters Kajol and Tanishaa Mukherjee.<br />
A  loud whistle from her breaks the idyllic moment— that’s her signal to the servant when she wants her cup of <em>chai</em>. It’s my first brush with the Bollywood lore around the actress—that there is no one quite like the vibrant and fiesty Tanuja when it comes to forthrightness. Chuckling at my surprise, she tells you this is exactly the way she has been since the age of 10.<br />
In an instant she transports back from her past. “Except that I have a little more aches and pains in the bones and am not able to do exactly what I did when I was a child. I was naughty, but always listened to what my mother (legendary actress Shobhana Samarth) said. I never told a lie because she once twisted my ear and slapped me silly when I told her a lie,” she guffaws.<br />
After a long hiatus, Tanuja did a Marathi film <em>Pitruroon</em>, that instantly brought her recognition and earned her the <strong>Screen Best Actress Award</strong> this year. The grim character that she portrayed in actor Nitish Bharadwaj’s directorial debut was a far cry from Tanuja’s vibrant persona — she played a widow, who had an air of tragedy around her.<br />
“It’s always good to be acknowledged,” says the actress about winning the best actress award, adding further, “but I still find it strange because in the 60-odd years that I have been in the industry, I have never received an award in the best actress category. It’s always been as an supporting actress. But frankly, I am not enamoured by awards. It’s an award for me when a fan comes up to me and tells me that I have done a good job in a film. It matters when people hug me and tell me that I brought joy into their lives. So in that way, I have already received thousands and millions of awards.”<br />
Recalling a recent incident, Tanuja narrates, “I just went to Vaishno Devi some time back. People of that place and Katara said that, ‘<em>Hum pehle aap ke fan hai, uske baad inke</em>’. I felt good. They kept talking to me about all my films. I was surprised (and felt good) to see that 20-year-olds had seen my films like <em>Jewel Thief</em> and <em>Haathi Mere Saathi</em> and enjoyed the songs. They said I looked so sexy.” The eyes twinkle, lending an impish aura that she was famous for.<br />
A look at Tanuja’s career graph takes us to the time she started as a child actress in a film called <em>Hamari Beti</em> as Baby Tanuja; the film also featured her elder sister, the legendary Nutan. Her first movie as an adult was <em>Chhakili</em>, which again had Nutan in the lead. It was family friend and director Kidar Sharma, who gave her the first lead role in the family drama, <em>Hamari Yaad Aayegi</em> and Hrishikesh Mukherjee in<em> Mem Didi</em>. Films like <em>Baharen Phir Bhi Aayengi, Jeene Ki Raah, Haathi Mere Saathi, Mere Jeevan Saathi, Ek Baar Muskara Do, Pavitra Paai, Bhoot Bangla, Jewel Thief</em> and <em>Anubhav</em> stand out in the 100-odd films that she has worked in.<br />
“I don’t really remember the details of the films I’ve worked in, but I don’t regret any because I enjoyed every one of them. Today I choose not to do too many films, but I am still open to good work. If the first 10-minutes of the story, during a narration, touches me, I know that the film’s for me. I am not interested in my role. I want to hear the director narrate the subject to me, because he’s the one who is going to direct the film. If he has a clear vision, my vision clears up automatically. I was very fortunate that I had Nitish Bharadwaj as a director and Sachin Khedekar as my co-star in <em>Pitruroon</em>. He’s an amazing actor, who works straight from the heart. Once you establish a rapport with an actor like him, you have to match the performance and work straight from the heart too,” says the actress with admiration in her voice.<br />
Ironically, the actress, who is lauded for her spontaneous and sensitive performances never wanted to become an actress. Good with languages, Tanuja wanted to be in the Indian Foreign Service. Her mother sent her to Switzerland for further studies. “I came back because we had some financial problems. I did the only thing that came easily to me — acting. But given a choice, I wanted to travel the world and communicate with people, which I kind of fulfilled in an oblique way through films, which is all about communication. As for the language part of it, I went on to do regional films in Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi and Malayalam .”<br />
When asked if there was any role that she identified with, she says that she enjoyed doing every role even though she took on everything and anything. “I needed the money at that time and had to run the family because of a financial crisis. Besides, I had had enough of education by then. The first two films were from Hrishikesh Mukherjee and family friend, Kidar Sharma. I was quite comfortable doing movies, and the film industry was like my family. It’s as simple as that,” smiles the actress, who was known for her elfin charms.<br />
Tanuja’s always known to call a spade, a spade. However, it’s also a quality that’s not exactly popular in the film industry, where diplomacy is the name of the game. So did her outspoken ways get her into trouble at any time?<br />
“No, I think everybody knew me! And I got along well with all my co-stars like Shashi Kapoor, Vinod Khanna and Jeetendra. Dharmendra is an amazing person; he’s the only actor whom I call my brother. I remember he had come with his entire family to the shooting of<em> Chand Aur Sooraj</em>. His father said that I was a part of the family and should consider Dharam<em>ji</em> my brother. I know for a fact that if I ever need anything, I just have to pick up the phone and tell him, ‘<em>Bhai</em>, I need you’ and he will be there. In that way, Dev<em>saab</em> was also amazing and we were friends for the longest. He was well-read and intelligent, but for him the whole world revolved around himself. It was interesting to see the way he got his finance together for a film and how dedicated he was to his work. We were in constant touch with each other. He would say, ‘Come Tanu, do a role for me. How much do you want?’ He would write the dialogues in English, and translate them literally in Hindi, which I could not understand at times,” she reminisces with a smile.<br />
Though she is her own person, Tanuja confesses that she has been influenced majorly by her mother, her grandmother, her father, poet Kumarsen Samarth and the renowned actor, Motilal, who was her mother’s friend.<br />
“Though my father was always there for us children, <em>Moti kaka</em> was like a father to me as well. My father taught me when to speak my mind and when to keep quiet. My parents were born on the same day, four years apart, but their personalities were so different. My father was a very calm human being and never got angry or shouted, while my mother was just the opposite, very volatile. My uncles and cousins were, and still are like one big family. Family, to me, is very important,” states the actress.<br />
Tanuja recently came in the spotlight when her youngest daughter Tanishaa was seen getting close to her <em>Bigg Boss</em> co-contestant, actor Armaan Kohli with stories speculating about the pair tying the knot. So has she given the go-ahead for their marriage?<br />
“My children and I are friends. There is no barrier between us. We discuss everything under the sun,” says Tanuja, adding, “But Tanishaa hasn’t told me anything about getting married. Kajol and Ajay (actor Ajay Devgn) went around for four years and then they gave me one month’s time to arrange their wedding. Similarly Tanishaa has the liberty to come and tell me whenever she wants to get married. There is no such thing that she needs to tell me in advance. It’s her life and I allow her to lead it the way she wants to, like I did mine. I have brought up my children well, and instilled in them the right values. I was a strict disciplinarian, while their father (the late Shomu Mukherjee) used to spoil them. Tanishaa is very sorted, and knows what she wants. Having a relationship with a person is not a big deal. But a person should think ten times before tying the knot because it has to be forever.”<br />
True to her vibrant nature, Tanuja says that every moment in her life has been a high point because she chooses to enjoy it. She considers life as the greatest gift— she is a voracious reader, who loves to potter around her garden and watch films, preferably on television! The actress, who spends a lot of time at her Lonavala farmhouse, keeps herself busy as the President of the Lonavala Citizen’s Forum. “My goal as the President is to make the hill station garbage free. And I want to tell everyone who visits Lonavala to carry their garbage back with them,” she frowns, looking very annoyed.<br />
Changing the topic, I point to the several rings with different stones on her finger — a pearl stone, a moonstone, a jade among others. So is she superstitious? “You really think I believe in all these <em>grahas</em>? No! I wear them because I just like the colours. People tell me that I will get affected by all these <em>grahas</em> and be beaten by somebody, but I just laugh it off,” concurs Tanuja with a chuckle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bigb-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014706" alt="Amitabh Bachchan." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bigb-main.jpg" /></a> Amitabh Bachchan.
<p>Amitabh Bachchan, who has played a voice-over artiste for several films in the past, is all set to turn narrator for debutant director Shiv Sagar’s mythological drama, Arasuri Maa Ambe. The film chronicles history of the Ambaji Temple, which is situated near the border of Gujarat and Rajasthan.</p>
<p>Arasuri&#8230; happens to be India’s first mythological film, shot completely in steroscopic 3D. Sagar, who is the grandson of late Dr Ramanand Sagar, approached the actor recently, and the latter instantly said yes. “When my father and I approached Bachchan saab, he immediately agreed. My father, Prem Sagar and the Bachchan family go way back. Jayaji and my father studied together at Film &amp; Television Institute of India, Pune, together,” said Sagar. The film stars television actors such as Tej Sapru (as King Daksha), Tarun Khanna (as Shiva) and Piyali Munshi (as Sati). While Khanna has worked with Sagar before in Kahani Vikram aur Betal Ki, Munshi played the lead role of Durga on another of Sagar’s show, Jai Jag Janani Maa Durga.</p>
<p>Sagar, who recently set up his own production house, Eastern Motion Pictures, stated that he is in talks with a leading movie studio for a big budget fantasy film, the script of which was written over a period of two years. He adds, “It’s time I took the plunge and experimented with genres. The fantasy film will be my first step in this direction,” he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014702&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Shahid in talks with Raj &amp; DK</strong></p>
<p>With the success of Prabhu Deva’s R&#8230;Rajkumar, Shahid Kapoor has been signed on by Vikas Bahl, who is receiving accolades for the recently released Queen. The film, titled Shaandar, is about destination weddings and is likely to take off in mid-2014. And now the actor is in talks with director duo Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK for an action film. “Yes, we are in talks with Shahid for an action film, though he has not yet confirmed the project,” said Nidimoru.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Priyanka in madhur’s next</strong></p>
<p>It is more or less confirmed that Priyanka Chopra will be doing Madhur Bhandarkar’s Madamji. The film traces the journey of an item girl who eventually ventures into politics, and Chopra, it seems, is very gung-ho about the project. “Priyanka loved the script, but she is yet to sign on the dotted line as the modalities are still being worked out,” said a source. “Madamji will be shot in Mumbai, Delhi and UP,” added the source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nawazuddin replaces Farhan in Raees</strong></p>
<p>It would be interesting to see Shah Rukh Khan, who plays a bootlegger in Rahul Dholakia’s Raees, share screen space with Nawazuddin Siddique, who will play a cop. Farhan Akhtar was supposed to play the role, but opted out of the film. Raeesis being produced by Ritesh Sidhwani and Akhtar’s Excel Entertainment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hrithik in Ashutosh’s historical</strong></p>
<p>Ashutosh Gowariker is in talks with Hrithik Roshan for his next project. The film is a love story set against the backdrop of the Indus Valley civilisation for which he is reportedly getting together a team of top technicians. Roshan is currently shooting for Siddharth Anand’s Bang Bang.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014698&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/channev-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014692" alt="A poster of Heroes." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/channev-main.jpg" /></a> A poster of Heroes.
<p>Our new journey of change began with Gumrah three years ago. Gumrah became our talking point because no other show had handled the subject of teenage crime on Indian television. From cyber bullying, peer pressure to molestation and date rape, Gumrah tackled all these issues and in a way, became a wake-up call. We never really bothered about ratings or popularity and were surprised when it became such a huge hit and generated clones on other channels.</p>
<p>The unprecedented success of Gumrah opened up our eyes. We realised there was a great need from the consumer’s point of view when it came to creating such content. And so we came up with stage two of our initiative — we launched the VithU App after the 2012 Delhi gang rape case. People always carry their mobile phones and this app was a way to ensure their safety. It has already crossed a million downloads. Fuelled by this feedback, we have now entered stage three with Heroes.</p>
<p>The new show replaces Gumrah and it goes beyond it too. Produced by Endemol India, Heroes is a 26-episode drama series based on the incidents of sexual assault in places such as hospitals, offices, schools and colleges.</p>
<p>The one-hour episode brings one sexual assault story to light from the point of view of the victim. It starts from the beginning — the first time they were harassed to that threshold moment when they could not take it anymore and fought back. These are stories that celebrate the fearlessness of the survivors who take on many social institutions and emerge as the real heroes of our society. This is Season one, and following seasons will have themes such as corruption and ragging.</p>
<p>Sexual assault takes place in our society every day in some form and a show like this will make people more cautious and also empower them. By creating such shows, it reiterates our belief in the philosophy that the abuse will stop when the silence does, and that a girl does not invite rape by wearing short clothes or that when she is harassed, she has not asked for it. The youth today is far more responsible than what is portrayed in the media.</p>
<p>One has to go beyond song and dance and reality shows to tap into that. We need to give our youth a voice and encourage them to come forward. There are two kinds of approaches when it comes to content generation — the immediate call of action like Satyamev Jayate and then there is the slow and steady one, where the focus is to change the mindset of the people wherein we take up a specific issue, present it and let it act as a catalyst of change. In the latter, one has to be consistent with the theme, engage the audience in a conversation and allow them to process it over time. We are letting people know and start a dialogue which is a step towards change.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014687&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>By Ranjib Mazumder</strong></p>
<p>Rajat Kapoor on the existential crisis in his next film Ankhon Dekhi, and why he thinks acting is the easiest job in the world.</p>
<p>Most directors never disclose where their sympathies lie, and so you can only guess. But Rajat Kapoor, the writer-actor-director makes it clear that inorganic films are the curse of our cinematic present. He also says that he stays away from watching Hindi films unless they show greater artistic ambition than what is displayed at present. “I don’t watch Hindi films because they don’t appeal to me. I hate it. I don’t like it. I don’t find it entertaining. Why should I spend time, effort and money in something I don’t enjoy?” he asks. (<a title="Movie Review: Aankhon Dekhi is an absolute gem" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/movie-review-aankhon-dekhi-is-an-absolute-gem/" target="_blank">Movie Review: Aanhkon Dekhi)</a></p>
<p>Kapoor wears many hats but the larger mass recognise him as Preity Zinta’s uncle from Dil Chahta Hai, and a slew of other films such as Bheja Fry and Monsoon Wedding, among others. In <a title="I can’t compromise my film to accommodate stars: Rajat Kapoor" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/i-cant-compromise-my-film-to-accommodate-stars-rajat-kapoor/" target="_blank">Ankhon Dekhi</a>, his next directorial venture, he plays the anguished brother of Bauji, a middle-aged man (played by Sanjay Mishra) who refuses to believe in anything until he experiences it himself. Kapoor, however, maintains that he never looked at himself as an actor, since his main focus was always to be a filmmaker and still is. And acting, for him, is the easiest job in the world. “I enjoy acting because it’s a very easy thing to do. It takes no effort,” he says. Ask what about actors like Daniel Day Lewis who actually make mammoth efforts to play characters, and Kapoor shoots back. “That’s because he chooses to make it difficult. That’s not the way I work. I work without any pressure at all,” he says.</p>
<p>He feels the best actors are instinctive, and names Sanjay Mishra, Vinay Pathak and Ranvir Shorey in his list. “You can’t make acting into a job, into a baggage. I don’t enjoy people who carry the baggage of acting. When the intensity overwhelms you then the instinct is gone. For me instinct is very important. Either you have that or you don’t. If you don’t have the instinct then you do some methods, naatak, pretend that you are acting,” he explains.</p>
<p>Now some old and iconic names pop up, such as Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart, Marcello Mastroianni and Balraj Sahni, who for him defined an ease in their presence. “Acting is just about being present in the moment,” he says. Unless you are playing a biographical character. “Putting on and losing weight — I don’t consider that acting. I call it preparation. If you had to learn how to drive a taxi, I can understand you had to have the ease of driving, that’s a part of the job. That you must do,” he asserts.</p>
<p>Since he is an actor, he is more aware of what actors feel when he is directing. “Actors sometimes feel very humiliated. They feel they are out of the creative space of the film. There are hundreds of people involved, but they are mostly out of that process of filmmaking. I try to integrate the actors in the process,” says Kapoor. And what is the process? He has never done shot breakdown for his films. Rafey Mehmood, the Director of Photography for all his films is hand in gloves with this concurrent arrangement. “Every day we go to the shoot, we discover. For me it is interesting to see, this is the space and how all of us would react today at this moment.Maybe yesterday we would have reacted differently. There is a lot in the moment. What I was yesterday, I am not the same person today. So how can I do the shot breakdown today for tomorrow?,” he says.</p>
<p>Ankhon Dekhi began as a germ of an idea 8-10 years ago. But Kapoor struggled to put it into structure, mulling over it for years, looking for an emotional spine in the story. And one day, he figured out a joint family in Delhi’s neighbourhood. And when the twain met, Bauji’s character emerged. Bauji is a rare breed in Hindi cinema considering he is experiencing an existential crisis. “I think everybody goes through this dilemma in life. If not a dilemma, a nagging thought. For example if you are told that Rajat Kapoor is a b**tard, so you already have an idea about it. And then you meet the person and say are yeh toh aisa nahi hai (He is not like that!). Now what do I believe? I believe what I have been told or what I experienced? Bauji is the journey of a man who is open to all experiences. We slowly miss out on life itself because we are too caught up with our thing and our ideas,” he explains.</p>
<p>But as the trade pundits would predict, a young lead would have been a safer bet. “Bollywood is not even a point of contention. For me, when I am writing a story or script, it’s about being truthful to that story. He can be a 25-year-old too, that’s valid, but it didn’t happen to me. He (Bauji) is the head of the family, and because of his decision, what happens to the family is my story,” says Kapoor, who has dedicated the film to Kumar Shahani and Mani Kaul, his teachers.</p>
<p>Kapoor is eager to know the fate of his film. “If Ankhon Dekhi bombs, it would definitely mean it will be very difficult for me to raise money for my next film,” he says. But then he has the stage to go back to, where an instantaneous audience is waiting. “When I can’t make a film, I do theatre,” he adds. Kapoor who exhibits Shakespeare on stage through a band of clowns, makes the odd man out as the protagonist in his films. Perhaps in the Bollywood idea of narrative, he will always be the self-confessed outsider.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014653&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/papon-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014670" alt="Papon (left) performing at Bandra Fort, Mumbai. (Prashant Nadkar)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/papon-main.jpg" /></a> Papon (left) performing at Bandra Fort, Mumbai. (Prashant Nadkar)
<p>Venue: Bandra Fort, Mumbai. In action. Papon. Instead of the readymade fanfare of a ticketed concert, the singer-musician is greeted with an impromptu crowd that has gathered to hear him sing. The audience comprising passers by, evening walkers and lovers in arms alike may be his smallest or even the most uninformed, but the musician’s connect with the audience here, is probably one of the most genuine.</p>
<p>“I realise one note here and there doesn’t matter when I see people responding well to my music, clapping in the right places, smiling at times,” says Papon, in an interview after his performance for One for the Road, a new show for the soon to be launched channel, Pepsi MTV Indies.</p>
<p>The Assamese singer-songwriter is almost a veteran in live shows, and yet, the experience this time has been unique. It is a part of MTV’s efforts to give indie music a breakthrough into the mainstream, but without robbing it of its indie identity. Papon’s set of six songs, hence, were all his lesser known ones such as Boitha maro, Bawle jharne and Choti choti. There is no popular Bollywood number request to be entertained here. It is nice to see a musician, who is used to swaying fans in large arena concerts, trying to hold the attention of a small group of people, probably strangers to his music, with the spirit of a robust live musician.</p>
<p>The trick of live shows, he says, is all about to be able to “live in the moment”. “When I am on stage, I am in love with the universe. It doesn’t matter, how the rest of the things are. My only nervousness about concerts is the fear of not being able to live the moments,” says the 37-year-old, who performed along with his electric folk fusion band The East India Company.</p>
<p>Live performances can take a toll on sensitive throats of singers, but Papon, despite having problems owing to sinus and cold, appears remarkably in control. “It disappoints and betrays you at times, you can’t help it,” he says, adding, “People say I’m good when I sing live. Maybe it’s because my father used to be very good in live performances.” Papon’s parents, Khagen and Archana Mahanta, are noted folk musicians in Assam.</p>
<p>Live shows apart, Papon’s career has been brimming with new possibilities lately. No more just an indie darling or Assam’s biggest rockstar, his music has been reaching out to untapped quarters. It has helped the musician spread his wings, showcasing his versatile repertoire as was seen in last year’s Coke Studio @MTV Season 3, where he pulled off a thoroughly enjoyable fusion of ghazal, funk, lounge, hindustani classical and folk with aplomb. “I have been seen or heard more because of Coke Studio@MTV and The Dewarists. They made me bigger in terms of reaching out to a wider audience,” he says.</p>
<p>His film projects as a playback have been few and far between — the highlights being the breakthrough Jiye kyun from Dum Maaro Dum (2011), Kyun from Barfi (2012) and Maula from Madras Cafe (2013) — but he is now gaining credence as a composer. Besides crooning a song with Pakistani musician Zebunnisa Bangash in the upcoming RunningShaadi.com, Papon has composed a dreamy, old-fashioned duet with Shreya Ghosal for Bobby Jasoos, and three songs for Ishqeria. “I am lucky to get songs I connect to because I won’t take all kinds of work. To not take up a song is rejecting, and people say all sorts of things in the industry but two to three beautiful songs a year is good enough for me,” he says. His “love for soundscape, sound design” although may lead him to do a full-blown movie score soon.</p>
<p>What makes his music blend with ease with films, independent projects and television shows, and now, a busking (i.e. performing in public places) experience as on the day we met, is its all inclusiveness. Papon’s sound is a vibrant mix of styles and genres, making it difficult to label anything but fusion. As for Papon, he finds the term ‘indie’ and other such bracketing as almost farcical. “I don’t even understand what indie music stands for anymore. To me, it has always been about the melodies, beats and languages. And good or bad songs,” he says.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014665&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/karanveerbogra.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014589" alt="Karanveer" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/karanveerbogra.jpg" /></a> Karanvir did &#8216;Khatron Ke Khiladi&#8217; primarily to overcome his fear of height and performing under pressure.
<p>Popular TV actor Karanvir Bohra, who participated in action-adventure show &#8216;Khatron Ke Khiladi&#8217; says one has to be mentally strong to perform stunts.</p>
<p>Karanvir, 31, did the show primarily to overcome his fear of height and performing under pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;For doing stunts mental balance was important&#8230; One has to be strong mentally more than physically. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the physicality was not important. Before starting a stunt there is this feeling of nervousness as to what kind of stunt it will be, will I be able to perform,&#8221; Karanvir told PTI in an interview here.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was this fear of not performing like a loser. You don&#8217;t want people to laugh on you while you perform stunts,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>But he did complete all his stunts right from falling off a chopper to under water action and bungee jumping. &#8220;I was disappointed as I couldn&#8217;t reach to the finals but I am glad to reach closer to it (the finals). Overall it was an enriching experience as one couldn&#8217;t dare and do the stunts we did,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The actor participated in the fifth season of the show alongwith his wife Teejay Sidhu. &#8220;She was there for me and I was there for her. We both motivated each other. Besides getting nervous for myself I used to get anxious and pray for her when she used to do her stunts,&#8221; Karanvir said.</p>
<p>The actor, who was all praise for the host of this season director Rohit Shetty, said he was a great motivator and pushed him to perform his best.</p>
<p>The other celebrities who participated in the show include Ranvir Shorey, Nikitin Dheer, Dayanand Shetty, Gauhar Khan, Kushal Tandon, Mugdha Godse, Salman Yusuff Khan, Rochelle Maria Rao, Rajniesh Duggall, and stuntwoman Geeta Tandon among others.</p>
<p>The show has already been shot in South Africa, except the winner announcement which will be filmed in Mumbai. The show will go on air from March 22 on Colors channel.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014588&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhichawla2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014496" alt="Juhi Chawla" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhichawla2.jpg" /></a> Juhi put up a montage of her brother Bobby Chawla with &#8216;Zindagi eK Safar&#8217; song in the background.
<p>Bollywood actress Juhi Chawla, who recently lost her brother Bobby Chawla, on Thursday remembered the sweet moments of his life.</p>
<p>The actress, who was last seen in &#8216;Gulaab Gang&#8217;, also put up a montage of her brother Bobby Chawla with &#8216;Zindagi eK Safar&#8217; song in the background.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhibobby.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2014492" alt="juhibobby" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhibobby.jpg?w=460&#038;h=397" width="460" height="397" /></a></p>
<p>Juhi Chawla, let out her emotions on Twitter saying, “Seems like I&#8217;m dreaming all this. 11 days since my brother passed away.” She added, “In a day and a half had to arrange his prayer meeting. Didn&#8217;t want to do just bhajans for him. It felt wrong. He was such an entertaining person. Full of craziness and love.”</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhibobby-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2014493" alt="juhibobby-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhibobby-1.jpg?w=460&#038;h=445" width="460" height="445" /></a></p>
<p>Bobby Chawla, who had been in coma nearly for four years, passed away on March 9 at the age of 55. Bobby Chawla had been in coma since April 2010 and breathed his last at Jaslok Hospital in Mumbai. He went into coma after suffering a massive stroke in 2010.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhibobby-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2014494" alt="juhibobby-2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/juhibobby-2.jpg?w=460&#038;h=326" width="460" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>Juhi Chawla said, “Gone away so young. I brought in friends and family to speak of times spent together. And put together an audio visual of pictures. Have uploaded it so friends and family can see themselves&#8230; as a part of his journey.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jalmusiclaunch.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014474" alt="Jal Muic Launch" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jalmusiclaunch.jpg" /></a> Rajkumar Hirani launched the music of director-producer Girish Malik&#8217;s debut movie &#8216;Jal&#8217; here.
<p>Filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani launched the music of director-producer Girish Malik&#8217;s debut movie &#8216;Jal&#8217; here.</p>
<p>Singer Sonu Nigam and renowned percussionist Bickram Ghosh, who turned music directors for the film, enthralled the audience with a live performance on the occasion.</p>
<p>The film&#8217;s music is inspired by the Rann of Kutch, where the film was shot. The music directors have taken immense inspiration from local Kutchi folk music fusing it with classical and soft rock elements.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Bickram and I decided to turn music directors we wanted to associate with a film which would not just have a strong script but would also have music as an integral part. We both were moved by the concept of the film. It was the right platform to introduce new sounds and music design that both Bickram and I were very excited about,&#8221; Sonu said in a statement here.</p>
<p>The album has songs sung by singers including Sonu, Shubha Mudgal and Ustaad Ghulam Mustafaa Khan. Most of the lyrics have been penned by Sonu.</p>
<p>&#8220;The visual treatment of the film is epic and surreal and the music had to compliment it. It is great to have Bickram and Sonu collaborating as music directors for this film,&#8221;<br />
director Girish Malik said.</p>
<p>Saga Music has been signed on as the films music partner and it will be digitally distributed by sister concern Unisys InfoSolutions.</p>
<p>The film stars Purab Kohli, Kirti Kulhari, Tannishtha Chatterjee, Mukul Dev and Yashpal Sharma amongst others. Set for April 4 release, &#8216;Jal&#8217; is the only Indian film to be in-competition at Busan International Film Festival and has also been the official selection for the Indian Panorama section at IFFI Goa &#8217;13.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014473&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8216;Haider&#8217; also stars Irrfan Khan, Tabu and Kay Kay Menon.

<p>The makers of actress Sunny Leone starrer &#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242; have decided to open the film credits with montages of Hanuman Chalisa.</p>
<p>Previously too, &#8216;Ragini MMS&#8217; (2011) contained the prayer revealing producer Ekta Kapoor&#8217;s superstitious side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ekta believes that the incorporation of the prayer has been lucky and will ward off any unwanted negativity against the film given its horrex (horror and sex) genre,&#8221; sources said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The film will begin with a special montage of scenes from the original cut to the auspicious Hanuman Chalisa,&#8221; sources added.</p>
<p>Directed by Bhushan Patel, the film also stars Sandhya Mridul, Parveen Dabas, Saahil Prem and Divya Dutta. It releases on March 21.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014452&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;The script has to be good. I don&#8217;t look whether (the film) is women-oriented or not because I believe everyone contributes for the film and not just one person. It is about<br />
everybody in the film. The script has to be fabulous,&#8221; Kajol told PTI in an exclusive interview. Kajol said the home venture may take-off by year-end.</p>
<p>She said to get married and have kids was her conscious decision. &#8220;There was dream to be a mother. I think it was very well spent time with my kids. My kids are wonderful and I have a big hand in it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Kajol took a sabbatical when she was at the peak of her career. &#8220;It was the right time for me and I don&#8217;t regret it (the decision) at all. For me, all my decisions have been taken at the right time only. There is no ifs and buts for me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The film that Ajay Devgn would be producing is in news for quite some time but Kajol is in no mood to disclose details.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope it will be both serious and entertaining. We have an idea on hand but it is too early to talk about it. When we start shooting the film then we can say a bit about it,&#8221; the actress said.</p>
<p>When asked how heroines discontinue their Bollywood career after certain age but the male actors continue to work even after the age of 40, Kajol said things will change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel we have less ideas. And our audience wants to watch only certain kind of cinema, however this is changing now. This is the time for new age cinema. The audience is changing and our longevity will increase,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014366&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[New York-based Ari Rowland Jazz Quartet performed at the US Consulate in Kolkata on March 19. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014346&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/band480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014352" alt="The band dished out classic jazz music of the thirties and forties interspersed with some popular Indian songs." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/band480.jpg" /></a> The band dished out classic jazz music of the thirties and forties interspersed with some popular Indian songs.
<p>Some popular Bengali and Hindi songs like &#8216;Yeh Dosti Hum Nahi Chorenge&#8217; and &#8216;Dhitang Dhitang Bole&#8217; have been given a jazz twist by a famous American band.</p>
<p>&#8220;We try to understand the meaning of the song and follow the original spirit by improvising a little bit but we do not copy them while performing,&#8221; Ari Roland of the New York-based Ari Rowland Jazz Quartet told PTI here.</p>
<p>As a special treat for Kolkata&#8217;s jazz connoisseurs hosted by the US Consulate last evening, they dished out classic jazz music of the thirties and forties interspersed with some popular Indian songs.</p>
<p>The &#8216;desi&#8217; fare included the evergreen &#8216;Yeh Dosti Hum nahi Chorenge&#8217; from &#8216;Sholay&#8217;, &#8216;Ei path jodi na sesh hoye&#8217; from Bengali movie &#8216;Saptapadi&#8217;, Hemanta Mukherjee&#8217;s song and a Salil Chowdhury composition &#8216;Dhitang Dhitang bole&#8217; and hit Bengali folk song &#8216;Sundari Kamala Nachey re&#8217;.</p>
<p>Appreciating India&#8217;s rich musical traditions, Roland said Indian music is complex rhythmically and filled with emotions and a storyline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jazz music is also sophisticated and therefore one can blend the two,&#8221; said the musician who admits to be a fan of Rabindranath Tagore. &#8221;As a child my father had given me his book of poems and since then I was hooked onto his works. His songs are very melodious and so easy to remember with passing time. And the meaning of his songs remain relevant even today,&#8221; said the bass player who started playing jazz professionally at the age of 16.</p>
<p>The band is inspired by jazz music from the 1930&#8242;s through 1950&#8242;s, also known as the golden age of jazz. The four member ensemble&#8217;s repertoire includes pieces by jazz legends such as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Billie Holiday as well as their own original compositions.</p>
<p>American Center Director Joanne Joria said, &#8220;Jazz is one of the greatest American art forms with a rich history and legacy that transcends age, race, gender and class&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Ari Roland Quartet will now travel to Delhi to perform at the Delhi Jazz Festival on March 28. The tour is part of US Department of State&#8217;s musical exchange programs which gives local audiences the opportunity to interact directly with American artists.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014346&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Supermodel Naomi Campbell says quitting her smoking habit has been harder than she thought it would be.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old supermodel said in her struggle to end smoking, she found out that it was easier to quit alcohol than cigarettes, reported Daily Mirror.</p>
<p>&#8220;People told me that cigarettes are harder to quit than alcohol. I didn&#8217;t believe it, but you know what? It is harder,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8221;I&#8217;m not someone who wants to light up inside people&#8217;s homes, including my own, and I don&#8217;t want to stand outside on street corners anymore,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The supermodel said even though she is determined to quit her habit, the thought of smoking still makes her desperate for a cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still a struggle. In fact, just talking about it makes me crave one, so let&#8217;s stop, please! But I am really trying. I choose not to drink today in my life because I find that I&#8217;m allergic to alcohol,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have more energy and I have more fun than when I was drinking and I can hang out really late and get up early in the morning with no hangovers and still smile,&#8221; she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014323&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Designer L&#8217;Wren Scott comitted suicide by hanging herself, according to an autopsy report by New York City medical examiner&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>Scott, who was dating rocker Mick Jagger, was found dead in her Manhattan apartment by her assistant on Monday morning. &#8220;The manner of death was determined to be suicide,&#8221; said a spokesperson for the medical examiner&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>One of the most influential designers, Scott had celebrities like Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, Sarah Jessica Parker and the late Elizabeth Taylor as her clients.</p>
<p>A shocked Jagger, who was in Australia for a Rolling Stones tour, rushed back to New York upon hearing the tragic news.</p>
<p>In his tribute, Jagger said: &#8220;I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Rolling Stones tour of Australia and New Zealand has been postponed now.</p>
<p>Scott, 49, was said to be going through a difficult period financially at the time of her death. She had cancelled her upcoming London show due to production delays last month and had planned to unveil her fall 2014 collection via social media in early March, but that too was delayed.</p>
<p>Her company was in debt to the tune of USD 6 million and she was apparently set to announce the closer of her business.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014290&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/satish_vc-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014319" alt="Satish Kaushik said he has incorporated a social angle in 'Gang of Ghosts'. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/satish_vc-480.jpg" /></a> Satish Kaushik said he has incorporated a social angle in &#8216;Gang of Ghosts&#8217;.
<p>After giving several hit comedies in his more than three-decade-long acting career, veteran actor-filmmaker Satish Kaushik is now yearning to get roles that do justice to his talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I am waiting for some very witty roles, where I can justify my talent. The kind of talent I have I think I must do something different from comedy. The comedy bag is now full. Now I must do some characters which are dramatic and have emotional depths,&#8221; Satish, 57, who was the in city to promote his upcoming film &#8216;Gang of Ghosts&#8217;, said at a press conference last evening.</p>
<p>Satish&#8217;s last notable role was in 2011, when he starred as Father Pascal in multi-starrer &#8216;Rascals&#8217;. He would be next seen in a negative role in Nagesh Kukunoor&#8217;s &#8216;Lakshmi&#8217;, which is based on human trafficking.</p>
<p>On his absence from doing comedies in the recent past, Satish said, &#8220;Yes, it has been a long time. There is a null as it happens with actors. When change is happening, sometimes an actor also goes through that. But I have done roles this year which are not comic but are very different,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is an upcoming film &#8216;Lakshmi&#8217; in which I have played a negative character. I have never played this kind of role in the past. And then there is &#8216;Dekh Tamasha Dekh&#8217;,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8216;Gang of Ghosts&#8217;, is a remake of Bengali blockbuster &#8217;Bhooter Bhabishyat&#8217;. It is slated to release on March 21.</p>
<p>The comedy stars Anupam Kher, Sharman Joshi, Mahie Gill, Rajpal Yadav, Chunky Pandey, Saurabh Shukla. The movie also features newcomer Meera Chopra, who is a distant cousin of<br /> actresses Priyanka and Parineeti Chopra.</p>
<p>Satish said his multi-starrer comedy is family film that would entertain people from all the age group. &#8221;I have always made family films, which are still shown on television. This is because they were always clean,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The filmmaker said he has incorporated a social angle in &#8217;Gang of Ghosts&#8217;. &#8221;A comedy is never complete without a tragic element. And in &#8216;Gang of Ghost&#8217;, there is a very deep social structure<br /> driven around the film about the development of the cities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the movie it has been shown how the emerging huge buildings, which are being made by destroying old and abandoned structures are forcing ghosts to leave those places. So in a way the movie also talks about those who are shunted out because of development,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014312&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Initially, the sequel to the comic caper &#8216;Welcome&#8217; titled &#8216;Welcome Back&#8217; seemed well-prepared to clash with the much awaited Aamir Khan starrer &#8216;P.K.&#8217; and now news is that the makers have decided to release the film, a week prior to the scheduled date, i.e. on December 19.</p>
<p>Revealing about the sudden change in dates, director Anees Bazmee stated that releasing the film on this date will ensure audience presence as the Christmas week has always been beneficial for films. Producer Sajid Nadiadwala is excited about it since he believes Christmas will be lucky for the film as the prequel &#8216;Welcome&#8217; too released during this festival.</p>
<p>While the sequel &#8216;Welcome Back&#8217; will retain its earlier cast like Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar and Paresh Rawal, the new addition includes the leads, John Abraham and Shruti Haasan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014294&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/spiderman4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014293" alt="The film promises to be high on action with Spider-Man doing his amazing stunts. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/spiderman4801.jpg" /></a> The film promises to be high on action with Spider-Man doing his amazing stunts.
<p>Sony Pictures has released the final trailer of the much-awaited action flick, &#8216;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&#8242; starring Andrew Garfield, who reprises his role from the prequel.</p>
<p>The two-and-a-half minute trailer is nothing short of exciting and thrilling, leaving fans with sky-high expectations from the Superhero film.</p>
<p>The film promises to be high on action with Spider-Man doing his amazing twirls in the sky and saving people from car crashes and freak attacks.</p>
<p>The trailer reveals Peter Parker, played by Garfield reuniting with his old pal Harry Osborn played by Dane DeHaan, who is absolutely taken up his friend’s weird superpowers.<br />
Later becoming Spider-Man’s arch rival, Harry is shown transforming into the new modified version of the Green Goblin, but not before putting Peter under surveillance by military research and experimental science.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us a glimpse of Electro, played by Jamie Foxx and  Rhino, played by Paul Giamatti.</p>
<p>We also see Andrew Garfield&#8217;s real-life girlfriend Emma Stone reprise her role of Gwen Stacy, the Superhero’s ladylove. Actress Sally Field will play Peter Parker’s aunt, May Parker.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rheachakrbarty.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014280" alt="Rhea Chakraborty" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rheachakrbarty.jpg" /></a> Rhea said, “I won&#8217;t let this go. If we who have to power to speak up, don&#8217;t ten who will?”
<p>Model-VJ Rhea Chakraborty, who made her Bollywood debut with Yash Raj Films&#8217; &#8216;Mere Dad Ki Maruti&#8217;, was molested in Mumbai near her apartment on March 18. The actress, who used her self defence skills to save herself, has now filed an FIR against the alleged molester.</p>
<p>Rhea Chakraborty, who has filed an FIR at Khar police station, took to Twitter to speak about the entire episode.</p>
<p>“Just filed an FIR, watching CCTV footage. I won&#8217;t let this go. If we who have the power to speak up, don&#8217;t then who will? Rhea said that the Khar police has been very supportive and helpful. Rhea said, “Big hi five to them.”</p>
<p>The actress also described the entire incident on her official Twitter handle. Rhea earlier tweeted, “Mumbai is so unsafe, it&#8217;s scary to another level..I am absolutely frustrated with the men in this country .. Here this out, it&#8217;s ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Further narrating the incident, Rhea said: “I just got groped by a very well dressed man who casually walks into my building in broad daylight, with two watchmen chilling in the building. Luckily, I take martial arts classes and I managed to kick him real hard. And screamed so he ran away. But Mumbai is suffocatingly unsafe. The security guards in most buildings need their ass kicked. Ridiculous!” She said, “Can a girl not walk into her own building at 5 pm. Where is the guarantee of not getting molested?</p>
<p>The actress, though trained in Martial arts, said that her instant reaction was to freeze. She said, “Self defence works, but my instant reaction was to freeze, however I managed to react.. So it is very scary.” She added, “I&#8217;m good now .. But I&#8217;m going to find him.”</p>
<p>Rhea Chakraborty also said, “So many women every single day go through so many different kinds and degrees of abuse. It&#8217;s an abyss of suffering, there&#8217;s got to be a way.&#8221; She also added, “Action needs to be taken, or are we waiting for 1000s more to get molested? Is anyone going to bother, elections are round the corner!”</p>
<p>Last year in November, actress Shruti, daughter of Tamil superstar Kamal Haasan, was attacked by a stalker at her Mumbai apartment in Bandra in morning.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old actress was confronted by Trimukhe, later identified as a spot boy, who allegedly tried to barge into the apartment. He questioned the actor as to why she was not recognising him.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014255&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitabhbachchan6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014244" alt="Amitabh BAchchan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitabhbachchan6.jpg" /></a> Amitabh Bachchan said, “As you grow older you just take what comes your way.”
<p>Amitabh Bachchan may be one of the busiest actors in Hindi film industry but the megastar says he is not particularly choosy about his roles as there are not many choices left for him at this age.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this industry as you grow older you do not have many choices&#8230; You just take what comes your way&#8230; Which is not very often. I guess there is always a senior citizen to be enacted in young filmmakers&#8217; scripts, and so they ask,&#8221; 71-year-old Bachchan told PTI in an email interview.</p>
<p>Bachchan would be next seen in horror comedy drama &#8216;Bhoothnath Returns&#8217;, a sequel to the 2008 film of the same name. The actor would reprise his role of a friendly ghost.</p>
<p>&#8220;I liked the concept of &#8216;Bhoothnath Returns&#8217;, and I had worked with Nitesh Tiwari (director) earlier on the promotions of &#8216;Kaun Banega Crorepati&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Sholay&#8217; star was often seen riding an automatic scooter with the kids. He also shot a party song with rapper Honey Singh.</p>
<p>&#8220;That scooter or cycle has been with me for years and has been used often enough&#8230; Even on sets,&#8221; said Bachchan.</p>
<p>The actor says his grandchildren are excited about his upcoming project. &#8216;Bhoothnath Returns&#8217; will hit the screens on April 11 during the Lok Sabha elections but Bachchan is unperturbed by what will happen at the box-office.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall find out soon enough. Not one producer director the world over has ever been able to predict the fate of a film on release. &#8216;Hum toh bahut chote log hain!&#8217; (We are very small),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While Shah Rukh Khan appeared in the first &#8216;Bhootnath&#8217; film, actor Ranbir Kapoor is doing a cameo in the sequel though he does not share screen space with Big B.</p>
<p>&#8220;His cameo is not with me. But I do agree he is an exceptional talent and I would love the opportunity to work with him,&#8221; Bachchan said when asked about Ranbir.<br />
The actor, who is in the wish-list of filmmakers like Shoojit Sircar, Sujoy Ghosh and R Balki, says he admires these directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am fond of both Sujoy and Shoojit, they are creatively talented, and have enjoyed working with them. Shoojit&#8217;s film starts by June and Sujoy is busy with other projects.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the success of &#8216;Paa&#8217;, which also made him bag his career&#8217;s fourth National Award, Bachchan will again be teaming up with Balki for his next project. The untitled film will be produced by his actor son Abhishek Bachchan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Balki is another director that thinks out of the box … And makes it work&#8230; He has again got a most exciting script which he has offered to me, and I hope that we can create the same magic as we did in his earlier films&#8230;,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014241&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

There are reports that Ranbir and Ranveer are also being approached to play the male lead. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014179&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>

<p>Producer Karan Johar&#8217;s &#8216;Shuddhi&#8217; has been making headlines since the film was first announced. After major buzz with regards to the casting, there are reports that &#8216;Chennai Express&#8217; actress Deepika Padukone will be playing the female lead in ‘Shuddhi’.</p>
<p>To be directed by Karan Malhotra of ‘Agneepath’ fame, the film was initially said to star Hrithik Roshan and Kareena Kapoor, However, both actors opted out of it disappointing many fans who were eager to see the once-upon-a-time rumoured lovers onscreen together.</p>
<p>Following this, there were also rumours about ‘Ram-Leela’ actor Ranveer Singh being roped in to take Hrithik’s place. After which, there was much buzz about Ranbir Kapoor also being considered for the male lead. But these soon fizzled out.</p>
<p>Talks of Hrithik Roshan being back in the project have also been doing the rounds. ‘Shuddhi’ is said to be a reincarnation love story.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arbaaz_khan480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014174" alt="Arbaaz Khan: It is always good to see your leading man showing such good range. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arbaaz_khan480.jpg" /></a> Arbaaz Khan: It is always good to see your leading man showing such good range. (Photo: Varinder Chawla)
<p>These are indeed curious times for Arbaaz Khan. While his production &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217; is all set to go on floors later this month, his principle cast is seeing a release of another set of their films on back to back weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;First it was Rajkummar Rao who was seen in &#8216;Queen&#8217;. Then this week there is Sonam Kapoor being seen in &#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217;. And in a few days from now, Pulkit Samrat&#8217;s &#8216;O Teri&#8217; would hit the screens. It is uncanny that each of these films has arrived in March and the lead cast members would now be coming together for another new film of theirs,&#8221; informs a source.</p>
<p>As a producer, Arbaaz is keeping a close eye on the kind of feedback that his actors are fetching as well as the box office response to these films. For starters, &#8216;Queen&#8217; is a good success, both commercially and critically and though the film primarily belongs to Kangna Ranaut, even Rajkumar is fetching some good appreciation for his grey characterization.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is always good to see your leading man showing such good range,&#8221; says Arbaaz, &#8220;Even though Rajkumar&#8217;s part in &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217; is completely different from the kind that we saw in &#8216;Queen&#8217;, it is heartening to know that there is so much talent out there waiting to be explored. He has a good range and I am waiting to see him in action for an altogether different role that he has to play in &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He is also happy with the way Sonam approached her part in this week&#8217;s release &#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217;. Though the role didn&#8217;t quite demand as much histrionics, as was the case in Sonam&#8217;s last release &#8216;Raanjhanaa&#8217;, the actress has fitted in well into the rom-com as a young working woman in an urban contemporary set up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is a sweet and feel good film. Moreover, Sonam came up with a natural performance and ensured that the smiles were on. Rest assured, she has a challenging outing ahead in &#8216;Dolly Ki Doli&#8217;. You would see many more different shades of her in this dramatic fun affair,&#8221; ensures Arbaaz.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he is now looking forward to how audience responds to Pulkit Samrat&#8217;s act in brother-in-law Atul Agnihotri&#8217;s &#8216;O Teri&#8217;. Coming straight from a confident act in box office success &#8216;Fukrey&#8217;, he may well have some surprises up his sleeves.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014124&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

A very negligible number of people.”<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014143&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/anupamkirron1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014147" alt="Anupam Kirron" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/anupamkirron1.jpg" /></a> Anupam Kher said, “There were just&#8230;maybe 7-8 protesters. A very negligible number of people.”
<p>When Kirron Kher landed in Chandigarh Tuesday as BJP&#8217;s candidate for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections she was apparently greeted by raised slogans and thrown eggs by disappointed locals who felt Kirron was an &#8220;outsider.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirron&#8217;s husband Anupam who was with her in Chandigarh by chance laughs off the importance given to these protesters. &#8220;There were just&#8230;maybe 7-8 protesters. A very negligible number of people. And I say, everyone has a right to protest in a democracy. Neither Kirron nor I minded the protest.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/i-will-only-campaign-for-kirron-anupam-kher/">Also Read: I will only campaign for Kirron: Anupam Kher</a></p>
<p>But why the protests? &#8220;They probably felt there were others more qualified for the tickets. But they must understand if the high command thinks a particular candidate is eligible then we mustall respect that decision and not throw tantrums, like a child who has been denied a toy.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/picture-gallery-others/kirron-kher-greeted-with-black-flags-eggs-in-chandigarh/">In pics: Kirron Kher greeted with black flags, eggs in Chandigarh</a></p>
<p>Anupam completely dismisses the enormity of the protests. &#8220;It was nothing. So much hue and cry is being made about a handful of protesters. What about the 500 supporters who came to support and cheer Kirron at the airport? As for reports that eggs were thrown at her, please show me those eggs.I&#8217;d like to make omelettes of them.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kironprotest-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2014149" alt="kironprotest-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kironprotest-1.jpg?w=460&#038;h=305" width="460" height="305" /></a></p>
<p>Anupam says his wife is not the least shaken by the protests. &#8220;She is a strong woman, She is getting ready for a long innings in politics. As for me, I&#8217;ve no plans of ever getting into active politics. One politician in the family is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidentally Anupam was in Chandigarh to promote his film Gang Of Ghosts. &#8220;What a beautiful coincidence. I am glad I could be here to see my wife take her initial steps in this new phase in her life,&#8221; signs of the never-say-&#8217;dye&#8217; actor.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Director Bhushan Patel says the major part of the marketing campaign has focused on Sunny Leone's star value.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014137&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014139" alt="Sunny Leone" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone4.jpg" /></a> Director Bhushan Patel says the major part of the marketing campaign has focused on Sunny Leone&#8217;s star value.
<p>A year and a half after 1920-Evil Returns, which was a successful sequel to Vikram Bhatt&#8217;s 1920, Bhushan Patel is back with another sequel of his directorial career, Ragini MMS 2.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/i-want-to-shed-my-bold-avatar-post-ragini-mms-2-says-sunny-leone/">MUST READ: I want to shed my bold avatar post Ragini MMS 2, says Sunny Leone</a></p>
<p>While the promos of the film as well as a major part of the marketing campaign has focused on Sunny Leone&#8217;s star value, Bhushan promises that behind all the glamour and erotica, there is a horror element in the offering with a definite story to be told. Excerpts:</p>
<p><b>Why so much stress on the &#8216;horrex&#8217; element when such horror would have been good enough to entice its loyal audience?</b><br />
Because that&#8217;s a concept which is being introduced in the Indian market now! Yes, there have been films with sex and horror combination before but primarily in a Ramsay set up. To entice today&#8217;s generation of audience across all centers, the combination has to be shot, presented, promoted and marketed in a certain way. The promise of sex to horror-loving fans is a huge incentive.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleonehot-460.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2014154" alt="sunnyleonehot-460" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleonehot-460.jpg?w=460&#038;h=336" width="460" height="336" /></a></p>
<p><b>Ragini MMS &#8211; 2 appears to be going overboard in this direction.</b><br />
It is by intent! Somehow in this country that we live in, sex and lust as is not considered moral. However, horror and sex go hand in hand when it comes to Ragini MMS &#8211; 2. The promos are promising that because I want to sell what I am showing in the film. If visuals like these can titillate as well as scare you, you would enjoy the film.</p>
<p><b>How are you correctly packaging this aspect of Sunny in the film?</b><br />
Sunny is my film&#8217;s USP and you will see her in different avatars. As a matter of fact, she was always there in the film and came in even before I was signed. People ask me about how she has come across as an actor, considering this is a horror setup. Well, for starters, it is not fair to think that acting is not required for horror films. There are all the facets of acting required here too. With Sunny it was a little difficult to begin with since Hindi is not her first language. Still, she worked very hard. For &#8216;Baby Doll&#8217;, she rehearsed for ten days. She is a director&#8217;s actor. I am more than happy with the way she has performed.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2013525" alt="sunnyleone-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone-1.jpg?w=460&#038;h=307" width="460" height="307" /></a></p>
<p><b>Sunny seems to be quite high on the film&#8217;s climax. No pun intended!</b><br />
(Laughs) Well, climax is the high point of any film, and no pun intended here too. On a serious note, what happens is that if your entire film is good but the climax is drab, people step out of a theatre with disappointment. Especially in a horror movie, the climax has to be the scariest. In that aspect, Sunny totally understood the requirement. She has done very well in the climax. She was pulled and pushed around in the harness but she enjoyed these moves as well (smiles)!</p>

She is a very good wife and she would be a great politician. I am very proud that she is fighting elections from Chandigarh. She is from Chandigarh and I wish her great luck,&quot; he said. (PTI)  " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kirron-kher-anupamkher.jpg" /></a> &#8220;She is a fantastic friend, wife and a mother. She is a very good wife and she would be a great politician. I am very proud that she is fighting elections from Chandigarh. She is from Chandigarh and I wish her great luck,&#8221; he said. (PTI)
<p>Anupam Kher feels his wife Kirron, BJP&#8217;s Lok Sabha nominee from Chandigarh, has the qualities to make a great politician and the veteran actor says he would &#8220;definitely&#8221; campaign for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not associated with any political party. I have only campaigned once that was 25 years ago. But I have known Kirron since 1974. For many years she was my friend and she has been my wife for 28 years. If I campaign for anybody that would only be Kirron and I will definitely go,&#8221; Anupam, who was in the city to promote his upcoming film &#8216;Gang of Ghosts&#8217;, said. The 59-year-old actor believes that Kirron would accomplish great things as a politician.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a fantastic friend, wife and a mother. She is a very good wife and she would be a great politician. I am very proud that she is fighting elections from Chandigarh. She is from Chandigarh and I wish her great luck,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8216;Gang of Ghosts&#8217;, directed by Satish Kaushik, is a remake of Bengali blockbuster &#8216;Bhooter Bhabishyat&#8217;. It is slated to release on March 21.</p>
<p>Besides Anupam, the comedy also features Sharman Joshi, Mahie Gill, Rajpal Yadav, Chunky Pandey, Saurabh Shukla and sister newcomer Meera Chopra, who is a  distant cousin of actresses Priyanka and Parineeti Chopra.</p>
<p>&#8220;(The film) is a comedy of characters. It is not a slapstick or situational comedy. The great thing about it is that usually one feels scared about a ghost movie. But here you will fall in love with them. We were lucky and fortunate that we were surrounded by brilliant actors,&#8221; Anupam said.</p>
<p>Anupam Kher lauded his longtime friend Satish Kaushik for his acting and filmmaking skills. &#8220;I have known him since 1975 from National School of Drama days. After so many years, it is fun to work with him. He is a brilliant director, and a very good actor, We both like to eat. So when all of it gets together, the end product is great,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Anupam feels that humour serves as an incredible stress buster, which is the reason he constantly endeavours to make his fans laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I love to do comedy as there is too much tragedy in our personal lives. I like to make people laugh because in today&#8217;s time, we are living in a world where there is constant competition. You are made to feel an underachiever. So through comedy, I try to make them laugh. It is my contribution in their lives,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also I don&#8217;t take myself so seriously, so it&#8217;s fun to make people laugh. You spread warmth, love and happiness and if I am the cause of somebody&#8217;s happiness, I will be very happy,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The actor may have proved his comic skills many times in his previous films, but he still considers it as a difficult job.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is difficult to make people laugh as it involves the physical reactions from the audience. To make people laugh, you need to have a correct sense of timing and concept. So it&#8217;s is difficult,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014002&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kjol-nysa-yug.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013990 " alt="Kumar Sangakkara is bowled out by West Indies' bowler Dwayne Bravo during their ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup warm up match in Dhaka (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kjol-nysa-yug.jpg" /></a> &#8220;I think I am very hands-on mother. I am very strict and my daughter keeps telling me you are too hard on me,&#8221; says Kajol.
<p>Actress Kajol, who is supporting a campaign aiming to eradicate diarrhoea by promoting hand-washing habits among children, says she is a strict mother and ensures that her kids lead a disciplined life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I am very hands-on mother. I am very strict and my daughter keeps telling me you are too hard on me, and I keep telling her I have to be hard because if I am not hard, you will not learn the lessons that I want you to learn. I think it is really important to be that way. It is essential to teach good habits,&#8221; Kajol, 39, told PTI in an exclusive interview.</p>
<p>Kajol married actor Ajay Devgn in 1999 and the couple are parents to two kids Nysa and Yug. (Read: <a title="Kajol on why she went from drab to fab" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/kajol-on-why-she-went-from-drab-to-fab/" target="_blank">Kajol on why she went from drab to fab</a>)</p>
<p>Speaking about her children, she said, &#8220;they are bubbly and talkative. They are very confident children, so far they are good. As far as my personality is concerned my daughter is temperamentally a lot like my husband but in some ways she is also like me.&#8221; (See Pics: <a title="LFW 2014: Sonakshi walks the ramp for Manish Malhotra; Kajol, Kangana show support" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/lfw-2014-sonakshi-walks-the-ramp-for-manish-malhotra-kajol-kangana-show-support/" target="_blank">Kajol at Lakme Fashion Week 2014</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajol12.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2013996" alt="kajol1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajol12.jpg?w=480&#038;h=480" width="480" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;My son is too young so it is difficult to say whose qualities he has more – mine or my husband,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>As a kid, Kajol said she was a brat. &#8220;I was a complete brat but was an angel with my mother. I used to be perfectly behaved and my mother used to be like&#8230;Really are you badly behaved with other people? I was like no, not at all. But the minute she used to leave the room I was a brat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, she is supporting the cause of hand washing with Lifebuoy&#8217;s &#8216;Help A Child Reach 5&#8242;.  This campaign was adopted in Thesgora, a village in Madhya Pradesh to inculcate hand washing habits. The incidence of diarrhoea in the village, which had one of the highest rates of the disease, has come down from 36 to 5 per cent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been promoting this since a year. Most of the children under the age of five were dying due to diarrhoea and pneumonia&#8230;It is heartrending as its curable,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If through this programme I can save the life of atleast one child I think it would be fabulous. I am proud to support it. The aim is to promote hygiene as it helps in preventing other diseases,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>She reveals they do plan to adopt other villages and want to take this forward in India and 8 other countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is sad that children are dying due to diarrhoea and pneumonia. It is all about bringing hygiene. I definitely want to join causes that are related to children, I want to stand up for it as I believe in it passionately,&#8221; Kajol said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013981&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Coldplay frontman Chris Martin has joined singing reality show &#8216;The Voice&#8217; as a mentor in the<br />
new format.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old singer will be a guest mentor for the second round of battles, and will act as a &#8220;universal advisor&#8221; to the rest of the coaches, the Hollywood Reporter said. He will also aid all of the show&#8217;s contenders during &#8217;Battle Rounds: Round 2,&#8217; which commences from March 31.</p>
<p>The new format will have each contestant paired up and then sing the same song separately in a sudden-death match. The knockout stage was almost leaked weeks ago at a &#8217;Voice&#8217; screening in New York City, hosted by executive producer Mark Burnett, host Carson Daly and mentor Usher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every season, we do reserve the right to look back and say, how do we tweak this show to keep what&#8217;s important, authentic music and the highest level on talent onscreen, with<br />
four of the biggest people in music? And with that do come some tweaks. There might be some surprises this year,&#8221; Daly said.</p>
<p>Apart from appearing on the March 31st episode, Martin will also feature on the NBC show on April 1st and April 7st.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013955&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Songstress Jennifer Lopez has finally set the release date of her highly-anticipated new album.</p>
<p>The 44-year-old singer said that her tenth studio effort would arrive on June 17, reported Ace Showbiz. &#8221;We&#8217;re in the final stages of putting it together. I think I have to turn it in like next week,&#8221; Lopez said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lakshmi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013949" alt="&quot;It should make sense with respect to its budget because the producers and distributors only look at that. The box office cannot be the reason to make a film because if you start like that you only make crap,&quot; Kukunoor, 46, said." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lakshmi.jpg" /></a> &#8220;It should make sense with respect to its budget because the producers and distributors only look at that. The box office cannot be the reason to make a film because if you start like that you only make crap,&#8221; Kukunoor, 46, said.
<p>Filmmaker Nagesh Kukunoor says he is anticipating &#8220;limited release&#8221; for his film &#8216;Lakshmi&#8217;, which is based on human trafficking.</p>
<p>&#8220;It should make sense with respect to its budget because the producers and distributors only look at that. The box office cannot be the reason to make a film because if you start like that you only make crap,&#8221; Kukunoor, 46, said.</p>
<p>The film starring Kukunoor as a pimp is releasing this Friday. Other cast in the film includes Shefali Shah, Ram Kapoor and Satish Kaushik.</p>
<p>&#8220;A film like &#8216;Lakshmi&#8217; will get a limited release. It is not like we will release such a film with 2,000 prints. It would maximum be 300 prints. But the question now is which weekend do you catch and within that what kind of shows you get,&#8221; Kukunoor said, when asked on whether the box office response has become the sole parameter even for non-commercial films like &#8216;The Lunch Box&#8217;, &#8216;Ship of Theseus&#8217; and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a challenge. If a film has to work it will work if it doesn&#8217;t have to it won&#8217;t, no matter what you do it will not work,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8216;Lakshmi&#8217; is a tale of a gritty 13-year-old girl who rises from the cesspit of trafficking and prostitution. The idea for this film came to Kukunoor from the NGO he supports. The NGO rescues and rehabilitates children who are pushed into flesh trade.</p>
<p>Playback singer Monali Thakur is playing the protagonist in the film.</p>
<p>Kukunoor spotted Thakur at a party and finalised her for the role. &#8216;Lakshmi&#8217; was screened at events like the Palm Springs International Film Festival and Melbourne Indian Film Festival among others. &#8220;I am happy with the response it got,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013946&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>British singer George Michael says his coming out as gay in 1998 following an arrest did not help make his life easy.</p>
<p>The singer&#8217;s fans came to know that he was gay following his arrest for &#8220;lewd behavior&#8221; in a park in Beverly Hills. &#8221;For some strange reason, my gay life didn&#8217;t get easier when I came out. Quite the opposite happened, really,&#8221; Michael told BBC in an interview.</p>
<p>Michael, who has had a troubled life since coming out, feels the media destroyed the popularity he had among his straight audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I think some men were frustrated that their girlfriends wouldn&#8217;t let go of the idea that George Michael just hadn&#8217;t found the &#8216;right girl&#8217;. Which is still what a lot of my extended family still think!&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013938&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/keira-knightley-wedding-dress.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013933" alt="The 28-year-old actress married husband James Righton in a Chanel dress that she had owned for sometime but is not troubled that she might not be able to wear it again, reported the Telegraph.

<p>Keira Knightley, who surprised by opting for an old dress to get married instead of picking up a designer gown, says her beloved dress is now splattered with red wine.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old actress married husband James Righton in a Chanel dress that she had owned for sometime but is not troubled that she might not be able to wear it again, reported the Telegraph.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s now got red wine spilled down the front because the last time I wore it my friend (knocked my arm) and now it&#8217;s everywhere. I didn&#8217;t quite realize the extent of it until I got home. It&#8217;s quite impressively splattered.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, hey, a good night is a good night and when a dress has had its time, maybe it&#8217;s had its time. I&#8217;m pretty sure I can get it out but, if I can&#8217;t, I&#8217;m happy with the memory of a good night and the story of how the dress got destroyed,&#8221; Knightley said.</p>
<p>The actress was photographed wearing the prom princess dress on a number of occasions before and after her marriage and Knightley says she opted to marry in the outfit because it carried good memories.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d worn the dress lots. It was my something old. And I liked not making a big deal about it. I just wanted to be in something I had had a great time in, something I would have a great time in again,&#8221; explained Knightley, who is the face of Chanel.</p>
<p>Another favourite item that the star can be spotted sporting in dungarees as she finds them super comfortable since childhood. Knightley said she owns three pairs of dungarees.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013932&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of his next release, Ankhon Dekhi, Sanjay Mishra talks about disillusionment with education, stumbling into acting and why he takes up every role that comes his way.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013613&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/untitled-22.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013634" alt="Sanjay Mishra; (above) a still from Ankhon Dekhi." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/untitled-22.jpg" /></a> Sanjay Mishra; (above) a still from Ankhon Dekhi.
<p>A pressure cooker, a cooking gas, pans and ladles, spices, a camera and an elaborate music system — a peep into the boot of Sanjay Mishra’s car can surprise those who don’t know the actor well. And those who do, will say he’s as passionate about cooking as he is about acting. “For shoots that are a few hours’ drive, I leave ahead of schedule to stop at a picturesque spot, rustle up a meal and click pictures. I did that last month in Fiji too, where fresh catch was easily available,” says Mishra.</p>
<p>When we meet at Film City, Mishra’s left his portable kitchen behind but food is still on his mind. The actor offers to order fish from a popular restaurant nearby. Then, signalling his make-up man to start applying a fake beard for the film he is shooting for, Mishra switches topics to talk about his next, Rajat Kapoor-directed Ankhon Dekhi, which releases on March 21.</p>
<p>Set in a part of Delhi that still retains an old-world charm, Ankhon Dekhi revolves around Babuji’s (played by Mishra) decision — triggered by a family problem — to believe only in what he has either seen or experienced himself. For instance, his need to see a tiger growl before using the Hindi proverb ‘Sher ki tarah dahadhna’. How this pans out for him and the household, which comprises his brother’s family apart from his own — with constant visitors that include nosy neighbours — forms the crux of<br />
the story.</p>
<p>“This drastic decision by Babuji is driven by what’s happening in his daughter’s life. Babuji has probably been a perceptive, sensitive man; he doesn’t appear to be one who goes about his life and work mechanically. That’s what I gathered from the character when I saw the film a few weeks ago,” says Mishra.</p>
<p>For an actor who pretty much carries the film on his shoulders, Mishra’s response makes one wonder why he doesn’t seem sure of his character’s intentions. Rolling a cigarette, he considers the question for a few seconds before explaining that he doesn’t believe an actor can know his character better than the director. “In the early days of my career, I was part of the TV show Chanakya. To prepare for the role, I would read the script thrice a day and work on my character. But on the first day of shoot I realised the image I had conjured of my character was nothing close to what the director wanted. Ever since, I let the director lead me close to his vision and play it out the way he wants it,” he says.</p>
<p>Now, he also responds to the character based on how an audience would view it. To do so, he uses “clues” such as the setting of the scene and the mindset of other characters. For instance, Kapoor’s vision of Babuji that he had gathered from the script became clearer when he saw the house the family lived in, the kind of neighbours they had, and the clothes they wore. He then tried to breathe life into it, improvising the script to make Babuji fit into that kind of a setting.However, Mishra isn’t entirely unlike Babuji. Much like the character who refuses to believe in mathematical theory that parallel lines can meet at infinity “because no one’s seen it happen”, he questioned everything taught in the formal education system during his early years in Varanasi and Delhi. “If education couldn’t answer my questions — Did Emperor Akbar go to bed in such finery every day? Did he have a sense of humour? — I didn’t want it,” he says.<br />
This, in a way, led him to join the National School of Drama (NSD) in Delhi. Upset by his performance in school, Mishra’s journalist father wanted him to take up any job, even that of a peon. But his father’s friend, noted Hindi writer Manohar Shyam Joshi, saw his horoscope and suggested that he go to a drama school instead.</p>
<p>However, Mishra was reluctant. It meant “another three years of schooling. I loved acting because it helped me connect with people even if I didn’t know them. I didn’t want it to come with the burden of being my profession,” he says. But while at NSD, he had an enriching time as he discovered international cinema, and learnt from his roommate Tigmanshu Dhulia and his senior Irrfan, among others.</p>
<p>Yet, Mishra —  who has been critically lauded for his roles in Golmaal Returns, Jolly LLB, and Phas Gaye Re Obama among others — insists he doesn’t take acting too seriously, pointing to his filmography. “I am often asked why I do all kinds of roles and films, especially the ones I know may never release. But acting’s to me is a way of life that also earns me my bread and butter. Films are also my way of rehearsing — I can do that in front of a mirror but I prefer it with a script. I have reached where I am by doing all those films; for instance, I got my next with Yash Raj Films because they saw me in Ankhon Dekhi when it still didn’t have a distributor or a release date.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013613&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013524" alt="Sunny Leone" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone3.jpg" /></a> Sunny Leone said, “I now want to explore the actor within me.&#8221;
<p>Adult film star Sunny Leone wants to shed her bold avatar and focus on doing movies that will get her noticed as an actress.</p>
<p>With her choice of films like &#8216;Jism 2&#8242; and &#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242; Sunny Leone has been tagged as a bold actress and now she wants to change that image.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2013527" alt="sunnyleone-3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone-3.jpg?w=460&#038;h=307" width="460" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I am ecstatic at the response that my songs and scenes from &#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242; have received. While I loved doing all of this, I now want to explore the actor within me,&#8221; Sunny said.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old said that &#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242; will be her last erotica in Bollywood as she wants to take a break from &#8216;horrex&#8217; (horror and sex) movies.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2013525" alt="sunnyleone-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sunnyleone-1.jpg?w=460&#038;h=307" width="460" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Sex and horror is a lethal combination. They are proven sellers. When oomph is combined with horror, it creates an entirely new experience for fans of the genre,&#8221; Tanuj Garg, CEO, Balaji Motion Pictures said.</p>
<p>Directed by Bhushan Patel and produced by Ekta Kapoor, &#8216;Ragini MMS 2&#8242; releases on March 21.</p>

<p>The sudden demise of Paul Walker had put a question mark on the future of Fast &amp; Furious 7. However the makers have decided to commence the shooting of the film, which had been postponed after Paul Walker&#8217;s death in a car crash in Washington, in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Ali Fazal, who is all set to be part of the thrilling saga says happily, &#8220;Yes, I will be joining the Fast &amp; Furious gang soon. We have to finish the filming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though the dates have not been sent to Ali Fazal, he has been told to keep himself ready to leave for Abu Dhabi at the end of this month. The shooting of &#8216;Fast &amp; Furious 7&#8242; resumes in the first week of April.</p>
<p>Ali Fazal also plays the romantic lead opposite Vidya Balan in &#8216;Bobby Jasoos&#8217;. Since he would be required in Mumbai for promoting the film which is expected to release around June (date not yet firmed in) he is hoping that the shooting schedules of &#8216;Fast &amp; Furious 7&#8242; don&#8217;t clash with his promotion of &#8216;Bobby Jasoos&#8217;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013368&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Singer George Michael has revealed that he is embarrassed by the dyed hair and hoop earrings he used to wear when he was a member of Wham.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Faith&#8217; hitmaker, who shot to fame alongside Andrew Ridgeley as a member of Wham, said he finds his look weird when he looks back at old videos on Youtube, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do I start? I know &#8211; the blonde hair from my Wham! days. That came about because I didn&#8217;t really want to be me, so the short, dark, curly hair had to go. And I could have done without those curtain rings in my ears as well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old star also regrets trying out weird ways to alter is looks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do remember another embarrassing moment from the old days&#8230; when Andrew and I went to a music awards ceremony early in our career. I was wearing a suit that made me look a<br />
bit like Colonel Sanders and I was practically orange from overdoing it on a sunbed,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013348&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kate-winslet-babyweight.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013323" alt="The actress debuted a stunning post-baby body while getting her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony recently." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kate-winslet-babyweight.jpg" /></a> The actress debuted a stunning post-baby body while getting her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony recently.
<p>Actress Kate Winslet, who was back filming &#8216;Divergent&#8217; just six weeks after giving birth to son Bear, says she was too busy with the new born to worry about losing the pregnancy weight.</p>
<p>Winslet, who welcomed her son on December 7, says she has rather been eating right to feed her child properly, reported E! News.</p>
<p>The actress debuted a stunning post-baby body while getting her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;after having a baby you end up being so busy with the baby and the nursing. And I have two other children as well obviously, so there&#8217;s so much going on that the difficulty I find is remembering that you have to eat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because when you&#8217;re nursing you really have to eat, otherwise you don&#8217;t produce anything that&#8217;s going to feed your child. So nursing&#8217;s a great excuse to eat heaps. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 38-year-old actress, however, admits that she freaked out a bit when producers asked her to come back for some re-shoots.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Bear, my son, was 6 weeks old, they said, &#8216;We need you. We have a few days of reshoots to do.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;Are you high?!&#8217; Like, how am I going to do this? But somehow you do. You just make it work. There&#8217;s actually something empowering about going, &#8216;Hey, I can do this! I can do all of this!&#8217;&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013313&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahrukhkhangoat.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013239" alt="Shah Rukh Goat" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahrukhkhangoat.jpg" /></a> &#8216;Yeh Hai Bakrapur&#8217; has a goat named Shah Rukh as a protagonist.
<p>National award-winning filmmaker Janaki Vishwanathan&#8217;s maiden Hindi movie &#8216;Yeh Hai Bakrapur&#8217; which has a goat named Shah Rukh as a protagonist is slated for April 25 release.</p>
<p>The official trailer of the film has, however, triggered strong reactions from some fans of the Bollywood superstar on micro-blogging site &#8216;Twitter&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were trending on the date of the official release on March 3 and it was a major hungama on Twitter but honestly the film has nothing to do with Shah Rukh Khan. I was busy with the promos and it was only later I came across the responses,&#8221; Vishwanathan told PTI.</p>
<p>A fan had posted the message &#8216;shame on you&#8217; on her Twitter account and another &#8216;using name &#8216; SRK&#8217; for getting publicity for your film!!! shame on you.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look the goat is named just Shah Rukh. Somehow the fans have got the impression that the film is to mock SRK, but once they come and see it, I feel they will understand,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Vishwanathan said she has great respect for Shah Rukh Khan and what he has achieved and reiterated the film is not an attempt to poke fun at him.</p>
<p>Asked if the 47-year-old actor has reacted, she said, &#8220;We are trying to get in touch with him. I am confident he will appreciate the subject and extend good wishes for the movie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vishwanathan said they planned to screen it at 500 theatres nationwide. The first copy of the movie was ready before the Mumbai film fest in late October last year. She was busy shooting with a promotional song last week. This has also been incorporated, she said.</p>
<p>Besides the Mumbai film festival, the film was also screened at the Goteburg Fest in Sweden in January this year.</p>
<p>Besides the goat, the 90-minute film, scripted and directed by her, stars Anshuman Jha, Asif Basra, Faiz Khan, Shameen Khan and Suruchi Aulakh.<br />
The film is said to be a social-political satire set against the backdrop of rural India. &#8220;It dwells, at the primary level, on the relationship between eight-year-old Zulfi and his pet goat Shah Rukh.&#8221;</p>
<p>The official trailer has received over a million hits since its launch. &#8220;Mind you, it has no superstars,&#8221; she said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hallevidya-aishwarya-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013539" alt="aishwarya" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hallevidya-aishwarya-480.jpg" /></a> Pregnancy is turning out to be a bane rather than boon in showbiz.
<p>Pregnancy is turning out to be a bane rather than boon in Bollywood. After the infamous fallout of Madhur Bhandarkar-Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in 2011, there are reports that director Sujoy Ghosh has also replaced his favourite actress Vidya Balan with Kangana Ranaut in his upcoming film ‘Durga Rani Singh’.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidyapregnant.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013201" alt="vidyapregnant" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidyapregnant.jpg" /></a> Vidya Balan at a press meet for Indian Film Festival of Melbourne.
<p>Sujoy Ghosh, who has worked with Vidya Balan in ‘Kahaani’, is now all set to roll out his next film titled ‘Durga Rani Singh’ with Bollywood&#8217;s &#8216;Queen&#8217; Kangana.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/has-sujoy-signed-kangna-ranaut-for-durga-rani-singh/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0260a8;">Also Read: Has Sujoy Ghosh signed Kangna Ranaut for ‘Durga Rani Singh’</span></a></p>
<p>Everyone expected Sujoy Ghosh to sign his &#8216;Kahaani&#8217; star, however according to reports, Sujoy has replaced Vidya Balan because of her rumoured pregnancy. Vidya Balan has been spotted frequently at a suburban hospital and if reports are to be believed she has been consulting a doctor on regular basis. But the hospital staff has been asked not to divulge any details about her visit.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidyabalanlose1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013205" alt="vidyabalanlose" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidyabalanlose1.jpg" /></a> Vidya Balan was also spotted wearing relatively loose fitted maxi dresses for the promotions of her last release &#8216;Shaadi Ke Side Effects&#8217;.
<p>Vidya Balan, who married UTV’s head honcho Sidharth Roy Kapur in 2012, was also spotted wearing relatively <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/style-alert-why-is-vidya-balan-wearing-loose-fitting-dresses/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0260a8;">loose fitted maxi dresses </span></a> for the promotions of her last release &#8216;Shaadi Ke Side Effects&#8217;. Her choice of outfits raised the suspicion whether the actress was trying to hide an apparent baby bump.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/whats-the-reason-for-vidya-balans-secret-visits-to-doctor/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0260a8;">Also Read: What’s the reason for Vidya Balan’s secret visits to doctor?</span></a></p>
<p>Vidya Balan recently wrapped up the shoot of Dia Mirza&#8217;s debut production &#8216;Bobby Jasoos&#8217; and has no other films in hand at the moment.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidya-21.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013204" alt="vidya-2" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidya-21.jpg" /></a> Vidya Balan at the screening of &#8216;Shaadi Ke Side effects&#8217;.
<p>This recent case has reignited the issue of no pregnancy clause in Bollywood. While many Bollywood veterans believe that the clause is valid some believe otherwise.</p>
<p>In an interview to <a href="http://www.mid-day.com/articles/should-the-no-pregnancy-clause-be-included-in-an-actress-contract/15168070" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0260a8;">Mid-Day</span></a>, veteran actress Hema Malini said, “Today the no pregnancy clause should be made mandatory, but only for a certain time period, say a maximum of six months. If the artiste gets pregnant before the film goes on the floors, she should inform the producer. But if the film gets delayed for other reasons, then it’s wrong to expect the actress to wait. She can’t be held responsible in such a situation.”</p>
<p>While Hema Malini took a midway, producer Ramesh Taurani says that it’s alright for an actress to give importance to her personal life. “At the end of the day, it is just about a film and I don’t think it’s a big deal. If a film hasn’t gone on the floors, the question of monetary loss does not arise at all.”</p>
<p>In 2011, Madhur Bhandarkar had said that he incurred a loss of Rs 4 crore because &#8216;the truth was hidden&#8217;. He even hinted that he would not have started the film had he known about her pregnancy. He also wrote on his blog, &#8220;The entire event would not have taken place if on the onset the actress would have informed the state of her health an impending maternity&#8230; We learnt about the entire thing from news channels like the rest of the world that the said actress was 4-month pregnant and she was due in November.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile cases of prejudice against pregnant actresses is not only an issue in Bollywood. Actress <a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/hollywood/halle-berry-scenes-cut-from-x-men-days-of-future-past/" target="_blank"><span style="color:#0260a8;">Halle Berry</span></a>’s role in the upcoming ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past’ movie has been reportedly cut down.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old actress’ presence in the film as mutant Storm has allegedly been cut down to just one scene. Halle Berry was pregnant with her second child during most of the filming on ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past’ in Montreal. The film will be released in cinemas on May 2. (With PTI inputs)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013197&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gauahar Khan might have expressed her love for actor Kushal Tandon on a reality show but the actress now wants to keep her relationship private.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old actress, who will again be seen with Kushal in upcoming TV show &#8216;Khatron Ke Khiladi&#8217; after their stint in &#8216;Bigg Boss&#8217;, says she does not need any reality show to keep their relationship going.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had expressed our love for each other on a reality show but now it has become very personal. We don&#8217;t need any reality show again to prove how much we love each other. Joining the same show together was just a coincidence. It&#8217;s not a medium to keep our relationship going. I am just loving the whole idea of being in love,&#8221; Gauahar told PTI.</p>
<p>The couple met on &#8216;Bigg Boss&#8217; and love blossomed between the two on show, which Gauahar won.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Rocket Singh: Salesman of the Year&#8217; actress says she is happy with the way Kushal brings the best in her and helped her on the Colors&#8217; stunt-dare reality show.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kushal is one of the best human beings I have ever met. He backs me up whenever I need him and at the same time he keeps me pushing till I achieve the goal, He helps me to bring out the best in me,&#8221; Gauahar said.</p>
<p>The fifth season of &#8216;Khatron Ke Khiladi&#8217; will be hosted by filmmaker Rohit Shetty and will have celebrities like Dayanand Shetty, Salman Yusuff Khan, Mugdha Godse, Ranvir Shorey among others. The show will be on air from March 22.</p>
<p>Gauahar says Rohit is the show&#8217;s best host, which is based on the American &#8216;Fear Factor&#8217;.  &#8220;I took part in the show to overcome every possible fear in my life. And when I heard that Rohit (Shetty) is hosting the show, I grabbed the offer. I feel he is the best host till now. He is encouraging and very big factor for all of us on the show to complete all the task,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Apart from her small screen commitments, the actress is all geared up to release her first film, whose last set of schedule she will shot soon.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013202&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shiney-ahuja-shrutihaasan.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013178" alt="According to reports, Shruti Haasan keeps her distance from the actor. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shiney-ahuja-shrutihaasan.jpg" /></a> According to reports, Shruti Haasan keeps her distance from the actor.
<p>Shiney Ahuja, who has flown off to Dubai to join the cast and crew of Anees Bazmee&#8217;s &#8216;Welcome Back&#8217;, has found whole-hearted acceptance in the unit. Everyone except the film&#8217;s leading lady Shruti Haasan has welcomed Shiney with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>According to reports, <a title=" John Abraham, Shruti Haasan say Welcome Back" href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/picture-gallery/john-abraham-shruti-haasan-say-welcome-back/3275-1.html" target="_blank">Shruti Haasan</a> keeps her distance from the actor.</p>
<p>Says a source from Dubai, &#8220;Anees has made it very clear to Shruti that signing Shiney was his idea. And no one has the right to object. There is some friction between Anees and Shruti over this issue. But he has decided to stand his ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking from Dubai, Anees Bazmee said: &#8220;Initially there was skepticism about Shiney&#8217;s presence. But I was very clear about what I was doing. Whether <a title="Shiney Ahuja to return to silver screen with ‘Welcome Back’" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/shiney-ahuja-to-return-to-silver-screen-with-welcome-back/" target="_blank">Shiney</a> is guilty or not of the crime he was accused of, we&#8217;ve no right to pass judgment on him. Let the law take its course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anees is adamant about giving the actor work to do. &#8220;Shiney has every right to work. He has a wife, daughter and parents to support. His father broke down when he called me to thank me for giving Shiney work. No one from the film industry was willing to give him work, not even Shiney&#8217;s so-called friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, Anees has been receiving threats from elements both within and outside the film industry after the announcement of Shiney Ahuja&#8217;s presence in &#8216;Welcome Back&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not scared of anything. There are people who are unhappy that he is working in my film. Let them do what they like. Now that Shiney Ahuja has shot with me I am even more convinced it was the right decision. He plays a rich spoilt man. This is the first time he will be seen in a comic avatar,&#8221; said Anees.</p>

It is one of the most loved and desired percussion instruments anywhere in the globe,&#8221; Ustad Zakir Hussain told PTI in an interview. (PTI)
<p>Tabla is one of those rare musical instruments that has maintained its universal appeal even in this age, said eminent table player Ustad Zakir Hussain, who kicks off his Masters of Percussion series of performances across North America this week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tabla is one of those rare blessed instrument that has fit in this time and with this generation. It is one of the most loved and desired percussion instruments anywhere in the globe,&#8221; Ustad Zakir Hussain told PTI in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you watch television, Hollywood movies or Bollywood movies, then the background score that you hear is of the tabla&#8230; there is not a single movie I know that does not have a sound of tabla in it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Tabla, he argued, has become a rhythm instrument of choice for a lot of composers, for lot of remix artists, for DJs, for rappers, hip-hop people and of course for the Indian people whether it is the ghazal, qawali or a Bollywood movie.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is an instrument that fits into all these genres of music and therefore it is one of the most universally loved percussion instrument in the similar way like bongo drum or a drum set have been for the last many decades,&#8221; Hussain said.</p>
<p>The 63-year-old musician feels that the young crop of tabla players have also contributed a lot to spread the popularity of the instrument.</p>
<p>&#8220;One other thing about tabla is that now we have a whole bunch of young tabla players who are really very very good. And so it becomes easier for tabla to be promoted through their talents and performances,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan awardee is currently on a multi-city tour in North America called &#8216;Zakir Hussain and Masters of Percussion&#8217;. Beginning in Houston on March 19, the tour would take him to New York, Berkeley in California, Boston, Chicago, Toronto, Portland, Washington DC, Seattle, Charleston, Durham and Winchester.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a very extensive and pretty huge tour of master of percussion this year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Joining the tour are Selvaganesh Vinayakram (Kanjira and Ghatam), Steve Smith (Western Drums), Niladri Kumar (Sitar), Dilshad Khan, (Sarangi), Deepak Bhatt (Dhol), Vijay Chavan (Dholki). Steve Smith is the first western drummer Zakir Hussain has ever selected for Masters of Percussion.</p>
<p>In four cities (Houston, Berkeley, Durham, and New York) they will be joined by the distinguished Kathak dancer Antonia Minnecola. New York will also see performance by singer Hariharan.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know this troupe represents the interesting mix of rhythm tradition that comes from the Rajasthan region, from Punjab, from the coastal region of Maharashtra, from south<br />
India and of course from the western world and all tied into the beautiful visual impact of it through the Kathak dance element,&#8221; the Ustad said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013120&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Starting with a baby boys line,&#8221; Kim said.
<p>Reality TV star Kim Kardashian is keen to create a clothing line for boys in the future.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe have just released a collection, KardashianKids, for baby girls, but they eventually would like to branch out and create stunning pieces for men, reported New York Daily News.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are hoping to in the future! Starting with a baby boys line,&#8221; Kim said.</p>
<p>Kim has been keen to create a line specifically for children after welcoming her daughter North into the world last June with her fiance Kanye West, who is also a designer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe have been busy with their new Spring 2014 Kardashian Kollection for Lipsy, but would investigate the possibility of creating clothing for<br />
mothers-to-be in the future.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013107&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/woody-allen-lena-dunham.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013012" alt="Lena Dunham, 27, said that she was disgusted by the famed director, but she would not indict his works, reported Ace Showbiz." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/woody-allen-lena-dunham.jpg" /></a> Lena Dunham, 27, said that she was disgusted by the famed director, but she would not indict his works, reported Ace Showbiz.
<p>Golden Globe winner Lena Dunham has shown her support to Dylan Farrow, who accused Woody Allen of sexually abusing her.</p>
<p>Lena Dunham, 27, said that she was disgusted by the famed director, but she would not indict his works, reported Ace Showbiz.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the latest Woody Allen debate I&#8217;m decidedly pro-Dylan Farrow and decidedly disgusted with Woody Allen&#8217;s behavior&#8230; I&#8217;m not gonna indict the work. I think that you can decide that you don&#8217;t want to support the work of somebody who has molested a child.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a completely appropriate choice. But going through it and saying, &#8216;Look, he&#8217;s told us in 57 ways that he rapes kids&#8217; &#8211; that&#8217;s not the thing. The thing is to look at the actual evidence that exists in the world, which I think strongly suggests that Woody Allen is in the wrong. But for me the point is not to go through his one-act plays looking for references to child molestation. Because I&#8217;m not comfortable living in a world where art is part of how we convict people of crimes,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Farrow detailed the alleged sexual abuse in an open letter released in February. The &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217; director has denied the allegations, saying that he &#8220;found the idea so ludicrous.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013009&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Reality TV star Khloe Kardashian has revealed that she found it difficult to watch &#8216;Keeping Up With The Kardashians&#8217; after talking about her divorce on the show.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old, who married professional basketball player Lamar Odom in 2009, filed for divorce in December last year amid allegations that he had cheated on her and used drugs, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>Since her separation, Khloe has been trying to remain strong and not get affected by everything that is going on. She said she doesn&#8217;t like to watch her reality show at the moment because it is &#8220;really hard&#8221; to see her personal life laid bare to all.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely not anything I&#8217;m through. I&#8217;m going through it, but I&#8217;m not through it. It&#8217;s really hard to watch yourself on TV too. It&#8217;s definitely different in that the world has to watch too. It&#8217;s definitely not the easiest thing to do but it&#8217;s my life now I guess,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012961&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;You heard right! I&#8217;m going on tour with my good friend Pitbull this fall!,&#8221; Iglesias posted on Twitter.</p>
<p>Asked if they had considered forming an official duo, he replied, &#8220;You know, we&#8217;ve spoken about it, seriously! We should do a whole album together &#8211; it would be amazing. We&#8217;ve toured together as well. He&#8217;s similar to me in that he doesn&#8217;t take his success for granted. We&#8217;re both enjoying where we&#8217;re at in our lives.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012938&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajolfashion.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012510" alt="Kajol" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajolfashion.jpg" /></a> Kajol is labelled as one of the most well dressed actresses in the industry today.
<p>Bollywood actress Kajol recently appeared on chat show ‘Koffee With Karan’ for the fourth time. Being her usual fun and bubbly self, the actress chatted away with her good friend Karan Johar and director cousin Ayan Mukherji, who also graced the couch in the latest episode.</p>
<p>Labelled as one of the most well dressed actresses in the industry today, Kajol spoke about how she made a transition in terms of style and expressing herself through her wardrobe.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajolscreenawards.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012514" alt="kajolscreenawards" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajolscreenawards.jpg?w=460&#038;h=616" width="460" height="616" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Why have you transformed?,” asked Karan. &#8220;Suddenly you&#8217;re in the fashion pages Kajol. I thought two things wouldn’t happen, that I would make an action film which I haven’t and you being in the fashion pages is something none of us expected,” he said. “That is true,” agreed Kajol smilingly. “Even I didn’t expect it.”</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajolstylefile.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012515" alt="kajolstylefile" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajolstylefile.jpg?w=460&#038;h=460" width="460" height="460" /></a></p>
<p>“Designers want to send you their garments…Why has this happened? Apart from the pressure Manish (Malhotra) and I have put on you, there must be some real tangible reason for it,” he pushed.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajolficci.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012513" alt="kajolficci" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajolficci.jpg?w=460&#038;h=773" width="460" height="773" /></a></p>
<p>“The tangible reason is just the fact that I thought of it as…I did think of it from the point of view that there is so much more focus on it today as well that was one consideration. The second consideration, the main consideration, 80% was the fact that I just felt that it’s a part of my personality that I need to develop…that I needed to pay attention to, that I needed to figure out what it was. ”</p>
<p>“From the age of 16, somebody has always told me what to wear and how to wear it. So I have never really had either an opinion or really cared to have an opinion on this topic. And I wanted to know what my opinion was on it.”</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajol-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012512" alt="kajol-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajol-1.jpg?w=460&#038;h=847" width="460" height="847" /></a></p>
<p>When asked how good she thought she was at being a fashionista, the actress said she didn’t think she was too good. “On the level of 1-10, I think I’m a 5,” she said.</p>

<p>Actress Brittany Murphy&#8217;s last film &#8216;Something Wicked&#8217; will finally hit theatres four years after her death.</p>
<p>Murphy, 32, passed away on December 20, 2009. Her final project, which was initially supposed to release in 2011, will debut on April 4 this year at the Regal Theatre in Eugene, Oregon, the city where the movie was filmed, reported New York Daily News.</p>
<p>The movie is slated to open in more theatres across the US shortly after the premiere. In 2011, the film&#8217;s producer and screenwriter Joe Colleran had praised Murphy&#8217;s final role in an interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brittany pulled off one of the spookiest scenes in the movie. There&#8217;s an important scene where her character is unravelling and she spent a long time getting ready and focused and went for it. Personally, I think it&#8217;s one of the best scenes of her career,&#8221; he had said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012436&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/veenamalik.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012456" alt="Veena Malik" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/veenamalik.jpg" /></a> A daily reported that actress Veena Malik, of &#8216;Bigg Boss&#8217; fame, had tweeted anti-India remarks.
<p>Former actress and model Veena Malik cleared the airs about the recent anti-India tweet which raked a storm in the media over the weekend.</p>
<p>A daily reported that actress Veena Malik, of &#8216;Bigg Boss&#8217; fame, had tweeted anti-India remarks. However, the handle used for that tweet was a fake account.</p>
<p>The actress, who has changed her name to &#8216;Veena A Khan Khattak&#8217;, after her marriage to a Dubai-based businessman in December last year, retweeted her clarification, which first appeared in an Arab daily.</p>
<p>After her marriage, Veena Malik had changed her twitter handle form @iVeenaMalik to @iVeenaKhan.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Fake Veena Malik tweet rakes up a storm | Arab News — Saudi Arabia News, Middle East News, Opinion, <a href="http://t.co/q3oyyXCWBg">http://t.co/q3oyyXCWBg</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/Arab_News">@Arab_News</a></p>
<p>— Veena A Khan Khattak (@iVeenaKhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/iVeenaKhan/statuses/445677993654886400">March 17, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the fake tweet attracted a lot of negative attention for the media and the Twitter world alike. There were also reports that Veena Malik had blamed one of her ex-boyfriends for hacking into her Twitter account. Here is the tweet:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>India sucks&#8230;..!!!</p>
<p>— Veena Malik (@iVeenaMalik) <a href="https://twitter.com/iVeenaMalik/statuses/444673965626122240">March 15, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Veen Malik rose to fame after her stay in the controversial reality TV show &#8216;Bigg Boss&#8217; and her relationship with Ashmit Patel.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012455&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut&#8217;s &#8216;Queen&#8217; is still going strong at the box office beating this week&#8217;s fresh release &#8211; Sonam Kapoor and Ayushmann Khurrana&#8217;s &#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217;. Queen has entered its third week.</p>
<p>&#8216;Queen&#8217; collected over Rs 11 crore on the second weekend, whereas last week&#8217;s fresh release &#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217; managed to collect a little above Rs 9 crore.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/queen-review-kangana-ranaut-is-the-queen-of-hearts/">Read Review: Queen </a></p>
<p>Queen&#8217;s grand total however stands at Rs 32 crore. Taran adarsh gave the official figures. “#Bewakoofiyaan Fri 2.23 cr, Sat 2.51 cr, Sun 2.57 cr, Mon 2.06 cr. Total: ₹ 9.37 cr nett. India biz.” and “#Queen [Week 2] Fri 2.15 cr, Sat 3.75 cr, Sun 4.75 cr, Mon 2.50 cr. Grand total: ₹ 32 cr nett. India biz.”</p>
<p>&#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217; boasted of a strong star cast – Rishi Kpaoor, Sonam Kapoor and Ayushmann Khurrana but because of a weak script the movie failed to cast its spell on the audience.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kangana Ranaut&#8217;s &#8216;Queen&#8217; is rock steady, mainly due to the strong word-of -mouth and good reviews. Many Bollywood celebs including Aamir Khan, Amitabh Bachchan, Sonakshi Sinha, Deepika Padukone among others has endorsed Kangana&#8217;s performance and the film itself.</p>
<p>In fact, Deepika Padukone even went on to say that she was jealous of Kangana Ranaut for bagging the role.</p>
<p>Big B said, “In recent times I have never experienced so much word of mouth of a film as I have for &#8216;Queen&#8217; .. delighted for its makers !!”</p>
<p>Aamir Khan had tweeted, “What a film!!! Guys you have to watch QUEEN !!! Anyone who hasn&#8217;t seen it please go now and see it&#8230; Thank you to Vikas Bahl and his team which made the film. And Kangana&#8230; you rock!!!”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012410&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lady-gaga4801.jpg" /></a> Lady Gaga: I had three million dollars in the bank to my name and I threw it all in to make my stage. (Reuters)
<p>Pop star Lady Gaga has revealed that she was bankrupt during her Monster Ball tour in 2009.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old singer was left broke after spending her entire fortune on the show&#8217;s elaborate production, she explained in the upcoming EPIX documentary, reported Ace Showbiz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had three million dollars in the bank to my name and I threw it all in to make my stage. So I was bankrupt during the show,&#8221; Gaga said.</p>
<p>The singer explained that she was forced to reassure her family after they were left confused by her financial troubles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember I went home and I was with my dad and he said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t understand. &#8216;Bad Romance&#8217; is out. You are all over the radio. Everyone is talking about you and you don&#8217;t have a pot to piss in&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;Just let me do this. Let me just put it on the stage because I think if I can do this I can get Arthur Fogel&#8217;s attention.&#8217; And I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8216;Do What U Want&#8217; singer revealed that her gamble paid off when Live Nation CEO Fogle offered her a lucrative deal. &#8221;I remember he called me and he said, &#8216;We want to do this&#8217;. And he got Live Nation to write me a USD 40 million check. And it changed my life and the life of my whole family,&#8221; Gaga said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012383&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Oscar-winning singer Adele is accused of turning people gay with her music in a TV documentary.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old singer is on a list of things that &#8220;men should avoid if they want to be straight&#8221;, reported Daily Star.</p>
<p>Doctor Christian Jessen, 37, made the bizarre discovery in Channel 4&#8242;s &#8216;Cure Me I&#8217;m Gay&#8217;, which sees him visiting the States to test several therapies.</p>
<p>Retired doctor John Smid from Texas offers rehab and orders him to strip his life of things that encourage him to be gay.</p>
<p>In the documentary, Jessen said, &#8220;Adele is very popular within the gay community. You have to listen to Christian music.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jessen also said that he is shocked that people still think that being gay is a curable condition and that it&#8217;s a load of utter rubbish.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012395&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Singer Lily Allen feels behind every successful woman in the music industry, there is a man.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old singer, who recently made her pop comeback after four years, insists that women behind popular male artists never get recognised, but those who produced female artists always become known, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether it &#8216;s Beyonce it&#8217;s Jay Z, if it&#8217;s Adele it&#8217;s Paul Hepworth, with me it was Mark Ronson, same with Amy Winehouse. It&#8217;s sort of like you never get that with men. You can&#8217;t think of the man behind the man because it&#8217;s never a conversation which is bought up. If you&#8217;re Ed Sheeran nobody talks about who produced his music,&#8221; Allen said.</p>
<p>Although Allen has strong female views, her new album &#8217;Sheezus&#8217; is apparently intended as a tribute to Kanye West which she insists that despite being a parody of his record</p>
<p>&#8216;Yeezus&#8217;, it is nothing more than a sign of &#8220;respect&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012377&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Actor Tom Hardy has said that he couldn&#8217;t handle Hollywood when he first found fame.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old actor, who made his debut in 2002 in the sci-fi film &#8216;Star Trek: Nemesis&#8217;, had hit a low point with alcoholism and drug abuse which took its toll on his personal life. He insists that these past experiences have helped shape who he is now, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s taken being someone&#8217;s dad, being divorced, going to rehab, having mortgages, playing different characters, doing theatre, waiting and then it not happening,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The famous actor said his perception of the world has changed since he was younger and now he is more appreciative of the privileges he has.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m not &#8216;white knuckle&#8217;, so if I get invited to a party &#8230; the gratitude I feel &#8230; people are really pleasant, really talented, and I&#8217;m useful! It&#8217;s like, &#8216;How can I help and be a part of this?&#8217; Rather than &#8216;I must impress everyone!&#8217; Which is what it was when I was 24,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012369&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Former child-actor Angus T Jones has slammed &#8216;Two And A Half Men&#8217; since he feels the show<br />
makes light of certain serious situations.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old actor, who starred in the series for the last ten seasons, had criticised the show in 2012 by calling it &#8216;filth&#8217; and urged viewers to stop watching it, reported Ace Showbiz.</p>
<p>The actor said he was a &#8220;paid hypocrite&#8221; because his religious beliefs conflicted with his job as an actor in expressing the show&#8217;s adult content.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was difficult for me to be on the show and be part of something that was making light of topics in our world where there are really problems for a lot of people. I was a paid hypocrite because I wasn&#8217;t OK with it and I was still doing it,&#8221; Jones said.</p>
<p>After this incident, CBS had downgraded his role as &#8216;Jake Harper&#8217; in the series to just a recurring role. Jones also said that he regretted insulting Chuck Lorre&#8217;s television creation so severely and feels he should have approached it differently.</p>
<p>Although Jones has taken a break from acting now, he said he might star in religious-themed productions in the future. &#8221;There&#8217;s a few different productions that like do kind of Bible-based stories. Stuff like that,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012364&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maleficent480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012361" alt="Angelina Jolie: I loved being Maleficent." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maleficent480.jpg" /></a> Angelina Jolie: I loved being Maleficent.
<p>Angelina Jolie says she went &#8221;nuts&#8221; while preparing for her negative role in Disney&#8217;s &#8217;Maleficent&#8217; as it involved screaming at bushes and trying to scare her children with her costume and voice.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old actress enjoyed playing the villaneous fairy in the children&#8217;s classic and would bring her scary costume home to practice for her role, reported Entertainment Weekly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved being Maleficent. I was quite sad to put my staff down and put my horns away because somehow, she just lives in a different world,&#8221; Jolie said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I did have to take my staff home to practice walking with it in my cloak, and then I would go outside and scream at the bushes to expand my voice and play with my voice. So, mom was a bit nutso for a period.&#8221;</p>
<p>Describing her character in the film, Jolie said the role demanded something that she has never done before. &#8221;Maleficent was always so elegant. She always was in control. And to play her was difficult. I worked on my voice a lot. She&#8217;s bigger than me. She&#8217;s on a different level of<br />
performance that I have never done. She&#8217;s very still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s very sure of herself, but I couldn&#8217;t figure out her voice, I kept playing with these different types of British voices, making my voice darker and scarier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jolie&#8217;s daughter Viv plays young Princess Aurora, while Pax and Zahara both play princes and princesses from foreign lands.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012357&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Rapper Chris Brown has been ordered to remain in jail for another month after violating his probation. The 24-year-old singer was arrested on March 14 following his dismissal from a court-ordered rehabilitation facility.</p>
<p>Brown was being treated there for anger management, substance abuse, and issues related to bipolar disorder. He was brought to the court in a bright orange jumpsuit as his attorney Mark Geragos failed to convince the judge that he should be allowed to wear normal clothes and enter another rehab programme instead of jail, reported CNN.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin said he was concerned about &#8220;provocative&#8221; statement counselors said Brown wrote on a card at the Malibu rehab center.</p>
<p>The rehab centre said they threw the rapper out after he refused to take a drug test, made a statement about being good with guns and knives and touched the elbow of a female client.</p>
<p>Brandlin will next hear the case on April 23. The rapper has been under court supervision since pleading guilty to his 2009 assault of ex-girlfriend Rihanna.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012352&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pop star Beyonce has reportedly told friends that she doesn&#8217;t want to attend Kim Kardashian and Kanye West&#8217;s much-hyped wedding.</p>
<p>The 17-time Grammy Award-winner thinks it is extremely tacky that the nuptials are going to be filmed for reality TV show &#8216;Keeping Up With The Kardashians&#8217;, reported Radar online.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beyonce has told husband Jay Z and his best pal, Kanye, that under no circumstances will she be a part of any filming on the wedding day if it is for Kim&#8217;s reality show,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jay and Beyonce&#8217;s wedding was shrouded in secrecy and extreme lengths were made to make sure their wedding was an intimate affair for friends and family, only. This will be the complete opposite. She thinks it is just tacky.</p>
<p>&#8220;She knows she will have to go to the wedding, but really does not to want to,&#8221; the source added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012348&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

He just shoved him aside when he breached into the shooting zone. When the man fell down, he started accusing the bodyguard of slapping him, which is far from true,&#8221; informed a source.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">An ugly incident took place on Saturday (March 15) during the shooting of Akshay Kumar&#8217;s &#8216;Gabbar&#8217; that instantly made headlines. According to a report published in a leading daily, Akshay Kumar&#8217;s bodyguard had apparently slapped an onlooker who was trying to get too close to the actor, but there is a different version to the incident.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;First and foremost the bodyguard never slapped this man, who is supposedly a doctor from New Delhi. He just shoved him aside when he breached into the shooting zone. When the man fell down, he started accusing the bodyguard of slapping him, which is far from true,&#8221; informed a source.</p>
<p>Moreover, even that happened when the onlooker was trying to take pictures and got into a verbal dual when stopped from doing so.</p>
<p>&#8220;When asked to keep a distance, the man started behaving rudely and said &#8211; &#8216;Ye sadak tere baap ki hai kya&#8217; (is this road your personal property)? When things turned totally out of control, the bodyguard shoved him aside that resulted in the fall. He didn&#8217;t mean to consciously hurt him at all,&#8221; the source adds.</p>
<p>However, the man took offence and lodged a police complaint against the bodyguard. Meanwhile an accusation was also made that the shooting of the film was taking place without permission.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a blatant accusation. We had all the required permissions,&#8221; confirms the source from the production house.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a fellow actor adds, &#8220;All this happened because there is no sense of privacy left for celebrities today. With anyone and everyone on the street carrying a cell-phone integrated camera with them, it becomes a nuisance during the shoot, especially at outdoors. It is okay, celebrities do attract attention, but then when someone starts clicking pictures from a foot away, it is highly inconvenient. Being a public figure, it is a job hazard but then a part of the job also demands total concentration while giving a shot. When a random person starts clicking pictures in the middle of this, security has to be beefed up.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012216&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Scarlett Johansson has criticised Woody Allen&#8217;s adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, who accused the filmmaker of molesting her when she was a child in an article, for blaming celebrities like her for working with the director.</p>
<p>Scarlett Johansson, who collaborated with Allen on films like &#8216;Match Point&#8217; and &#8216;Vicky Christina Barcelona&#8217;, broke her silence on the fued that had Hollywood taking sides in an interview to the Guardian newspaper.</p>
<p>Dylan, 28, criticised Johansson, Cate Blanchett, Emma Stone, Diane Keaton and Alec Baldwin for working with Allen in her New York Times essay this year where she renewed allegations of sexual assault against Allen.</p>
<p>Johansson, 29, however, feels it is irresponsible to blame actors like her. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s irresponsible to take a bunch of actors that will have a Google alert on and to suddenly throw their name into a situation that none of us could possibly knowingly<br />
comment on. That just feels irresponsible to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>When asked whether the allegations would affect her relationship with Allen, Johansson said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about it. It would be ridiculous for me to make any kind of assumption one way or the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnasson seemed surprised when asked if there&#8217;s any &#8220;backlash&#8221; against the &#8216;Blue Jasmine&#8217; filmmaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m unaware that there&#8217;s been a backlash. I think he&#8217;ll continue to know what he knows about the situation, and I&#8217;m sure the other people involved have their own experience with it. It&#8217;s not like this is somebody that&#8217;s been prosecuted and found guilty of something, and you can then go, &#8216;I don&#8217;t support this lifestyle or whatever.&#8217; I mean, it&#8217;s all guesswork,&#8221; the actress said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012273&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Singer Nicole Scherzinger and on-again boyfriend Lewis Hamilton are not engaged contrary to reports.</p>
<p>The former Pussycat Doll singer, 35 and Formula One racer boyfriend, 29, have dated on and off for more than five years and they have reunited after spliting up recently, reported Us magazine.</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t proposed. They only just got back together at Christmas, so it&#8217;s very much at a point of working things out still,&#8221; a source told the magazine.</p>
<p>The couple is said to be working things out and Hamilton recently shared a photo of himself with Scherzinger at the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, happy and clearly in love, with Hamilton even affectionately calling Scherzinger his &#8220;wifey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This was a great day&#8230;truly humbled by the Sistine Chapel, plus there with my wifey,&#8221; he wrote alongside the picture, sparking engagement rumours.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012270&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Rolling Stones have cancelled their planned concert in the Australian city of Perth after the death of the fashion designer L&#8217;Wren Scott, the longtime girlfriend of frontman Mick Jagger, the band&#8217;s promoters said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The band had been due to kick off the six concert Australia and New Zealand leg of their world tour on Wednesday but Frontier Touring said the concert would not be going ahead following the apparent suicide of<a title="Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger’s girlfriend L’Wren Scott found dead in New York" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/music/rolling-stones-frontman-mick-jaggers-girlfriend-lwren-scott-found-dead-in-new-york/"> Scott </a>at her Manhattan apartment on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;No further information is available at this time, ticket holders are asked to hold on to their tickets until a further update is available,&#8221; Frontier Touring said on its Facebook page.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajaykareena.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012222" alt="Ajay Kareena" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajaykareena.jpg" /></a> Ajay Devgn who usually does one film at a time is now worked up with commitments this year.
<p>Bollywood actor Ajay Devgn, who usually does one film at a time, is now worked up with commitments this year. The actor recently flew from Bangkok, where he was shooting for Prabhu Dheva&#8217;s &#8216;Action Jackson&#8217;, to Mumbai for Rohit Shetty&#8217;s &#8216;Singham 2&#8242;.</p>
<p><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/salman-khans-bike-car-ride-with-jacqueline-fernandez/#kareenaajay-singham">In pics: On the sets of &#8216;Singham 2&#8242;</a></p>
<p>While the Action Jackson director Prabhu Dheva has stayed back in Bangkok, Ajay Devgn who was shooting for a long spell for the film has flown back to Mumbai for a script reading and intensive rehearsal session for his best-friend Rohit Shetty&#8217;s &#8216;Singham 2&#8242;.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/actionjackson-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012221" alt="actionjackson-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/actionjackson-1.jpg?w=460&#038;h=307" width="460" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>Ajay Devgn joined his &#8216;Singham&#8217; co-actors Kareena Kapoor and Amole Gupte for what turned out to be an immensely revealing bout of pre-shooting preparation. While the film&#8217;s leading lady Kareena Kapoor and the film&#8217;s arch-villain Amole Gupte are no strangers to acting workshops, Ajay Devgn is a notorious switch-off-switch-on actor. Apparently, the last time he indulged himself in an acting workshop was when he did &#8216;Zakham&#8217; with Mahesh Bhatt and Vishal Bhardwaj&#8217;s &#8216;Omkara&#8217;.</p>
<p>According to reports, &#8216;Singham 2&#8242; is far less masala and much more meaningful than &#8216;Singham&#8217;. A source close to the project said, &#8220;From the outside it may look like another Rohit Shetty-Devgn fun and masti film. But &#8216;Singham 2&#8242; &#8216;is not a routine khaki-&#8217;wordy&#8217; drama about a cop doing heavy dialogue-baazi. This cops&#8217; film will look at the burning issues in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajaykareena-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2012223" alt="ajaykareena-1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajaykareena-1.jpg?w=460&#038;h=329" width="460" height="329" /></a></p>
<p>Amole Gupte is all praise for Rohit Shetty, Ajay Devgn and Kareena. &#8220;It&#8217;s all a new sur, a new rhythm of working for me. The writer Farhan (from the Sajid-Farhan duo) is such a terrific storyteller. It would be erroneous to presume that a commercial film doesn&#8217;t demand much preparation. You&#8217;ll be surprised at how much concentration an actor needs to get the language of a massy film right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, Ajay Devgn will take his character cop act as Singham Bajirao to another level in &#8216;Singham 2&#8242;. An actor from the film reveals, &#8220;&#8216;Singham&#8217; was a remake of a Tamil film. &#8216;Singham 2&#8242; is an original script. There is no point in making another anti-establishment cop film. Rohit will look at all the grim happenings in the country since the Nirbhaya incident.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, &#8216;Singham 2&#8242; would have no songs and no item numbers, a first for a Rohit Shetty films, though Devgn, Kareena and Amole Gupte are no strangers to the realistic space in cinema.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012220&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/steve-carell480.jpg" /></a> Steve Carell will reportedly star as well as produce the film. (Reuters)
<p>Actor Steve Carell is set to star in Warner Bros cancer drama &#8216;The Priority List&#8217;. The studio acquired rights to David Menasche&#8217;s memoir &#8217;The Priority List: A Teacher&#8217;s Final Quest to Discover Life&#8217;s Greatest Lessons with Carell attached to star and produce, the Hollywood Reporter said.</p>
<p>The true-story is about Menasche, then a Miami high school teacher, who was told he only had a few months left to live after being diagnosed with brain cancer. He managed to extend his life via several surgeries and years of chemo but a seizure in 2012 ended his teaching career.</p>
<p>Menasche then embarked on a cross-country journey to reconnect with former students from his 15-year teaching career, come to terms with his illness and learn to live fully in the present. He is still alive.</p>
<p>The book was published in January this year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012187&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rapper Kanye West has been given 24 months of probation and ordered to do 240 hours of<br />
community service for attacking a photographer in 2013 for trying to take his photographs outside the LA airport.</p>

His next hearing is scheduled for July 17.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012174&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Oscar-winner Kate Winslet is the latest celebrity to get her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The 38-year-old actress was presented with the 2,520th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>
<p>The actress, who made her first appearance since giving birth to son Bear three months ago, looked beautiful in a black form-fitting dress, reported E! News.</p>
<p>The event was also attended by Winslet&#8217;s &#8216;Divergent&#8217; co-star Shailene Woodley, who described &#8216;The Reader&#8217; actress as &#8220;idol&#8221; while Winslet&#8217;s &#8216;Titanic&#8217; co-star Kathy Bates joked about the things that could happen to her star on famous Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
<p>&#8220;You deserve to have stars strewn at your feet. Even though stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame sometimes get a little dirty with a little poo or whatever, what will last is your wonderful beautiful films, characters that you&#8217;ve played that have stolen our hearts. Nobody can ever poo on those,&#8221; Bates said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012140&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bollywood actress Kajol was on the latest episode of controversial chat show ‘Koffee With Karan’ season 4 along with her director cousin Ayan Mukherji.</p>
<p>While the trio chatted about cinema, relationships and recalled past memories, Karan Johar then decided to bring up the topic of Kajol’s sister and former ‘Bigg Boss 7’ housemate Tanishaa.</p>
<p>“So shall we talk about the elephant in the room?,” asked Karan. “Which we’re not bringing up,” he added. “Please,” replied Kajol. “Which is your sister in ‘Bigg Boss’. What does that feel like?” he asked.</p>
<p>“How did that feel like? I think at first we were very hesitant about her going on the show…My mother and me. We were both not sure whether it was the right decision and she’s literally our princess who was used to everything being done her way, pampered so all of us were really like “Oh baby do you really want to do this? But she was quite insistent…adamant…yes. But I think she’s done very very well. Very proud of her,” said Kajol.

<p>Since becoming famous 50 years ago, Mick Jagger has had a series of high-profile relationships, most tragically with designer L&#8217;Wren Scott, who was found dead in New York on Monday in what was being investigated as an apparent suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some of his former wives and girlfriends:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chrissie Shrimpton:</strong> A leading British model he dated in the mid-1960s, just as the Rolling Stones were becoming superstars. The relationship ended bitterly, with Shrimpton later saying she attempted suicide over his alleged affairs with other women.</p>
<p><strong>Marianne Faithfull:</strong> She was a teenager when she met Jagger and had a hit single in 1964 with a cover of the Rolling Stones ballad &#8220;As Tears Go By.&#8221; They were one of rock&#8217;s most glamorous couples in the late &#8217;60s, but the relationship came apart after she had a miscarriage. In 1969, she nearly overdosed on Tuinals, which are sedatives, and she struggled with drug addiction for years after.</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Jagger:</strong> Mick Jagger met Bianca Perez-Mora Macias in 1970 and they were married a year later in France, a jet set occasion with guests including Paul McCartney and fellow Rolling Stone Keith Richards. They had a daughter, Jade, but the relationship soon soured and they divorced in 1978. A native of Nicaragua, Bianca Jagger is now a prominent human rights activist.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Hall:</strong> Jagger began seeing the Texas-born model while still married to Bianca. Hall reportedly inspired the Stones&#8217; classic &#8220;Miss You.&#8221; They had four children, but allegations of numerous Jagger infidelities helped drive them apart and they split up in 1999. A 1990 wedding ceremony in Bali was annulled.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012053&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Little Mix star Perrie Edwards has asked her boyfriend Zayn Malik to motivate her to go to gym.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old singer says she depends on the One Direction star to help her get fit as she&#8217;s too lazy to do it herself, reported Daily Mirror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve asked Zayn to help me work out because I&#8217;m really lazy and I need motivating but we never have time,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The blonde bombshell also said she doesn&#8217;t wear makeup to the gym &#8211; because it could give her bad skin. &#8221;When you wear make-up in the gym you&#8217;re sweaty and then you get really bad skin,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012040&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8216;Game Of Thrones&#8217; star Emilia Clarke has been banned from eating anything that tastes good in order to prepare for her upcoming movie.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old actress is following strict diet which includes a ban on wheat, sugar, caffeine or dairy for her role of Sarah Connor in &#8216;Terminator: Genesis&#8217;, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not been allowed to eat anything that might taste at all good. But don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m complaining because, believe me, I know exactly how lucky I am.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been spending all day, every day in weapons training. I&#8217;ve been shooting guns, weightlifting, kick boxing and generally kicking a lot of ass,&#8221; Clarke said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012027&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

I hope they (actresses) become stars as I have rejected big films.&#8221;
<p>Actress<a title="Lakme Fashion Week finale: Dazzlers Kareena, Priyanka, Sunny Leone" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/lakme-fashion-week-finale-dazzlers-kareena-priyanka-sunny-leone/"> Kareena Kapoor</a> doesn&#8217;t feel disheartened about her projects getting delayed or things not working out the way she wants them to, and has indeed started taking them in her stride.</p>
<p>Two of Kareena&#8217;s most talked-about films, Karan Johar&#8217;s home production &#8216;Shuddhi&#8217; and &#8216;Bombay Samurai&#8217; opposite Farhan Akhtar are stuck for some reasons. In case of &#8216;Shuddhi&#8217;, the project derailed due to lead actor Hrithik Roshan&#8217;s health issues, forcing Kareena to walk out of the venture. &#8217;Bombay Samurai&#8217; got delayed apparently as the production house (Excel Entertainment) is busy with other project with Shah Rukh Khan.</p>
<p>The film was initially supposed to go on floors this month but now it will happen post September, contrary to reports that it is delayed to next year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have left &#8216;Shuddhi&#8217;, I am not part of it anymore. I am not at all disheartened about it. It (&#8216;Bombay Samurai&#8217; getting delayed) gives me more time for myself and to holiday&#8230; I am married now I am not running a relay marathon now. I don&#8217;t know why the press makes such a big deal about it,&#8221; Kareena Kapoor told PTI in an exclusive interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;After &#8216;Singham 2&#8242;, we will shoot for &#8216;Bombay Samurai&#8217;. It (film) needs international crew so we will begin (to) work on it post September,&#8221; she said, adding that shooting for &#8217;Singham 2&#8242; will start from March 25.</p>
<p>When asked about her refusal to projects like &#8216;Queen&#8217;, &#8217;Ram-Leela&#8217;, &#8216;Chennai Express&#8217;, &#8216;Fashion&#8217;, &#8216;Kal Ho Na Ho&#8217;, &#8217;Black&#8217; and others which subsequently went to other actresses, Kareena Kapoor  said she did not regret her decision. &#8221;I feel honoured and glad to give work to other people. I hope they (actresses) become stars as I have rejected big films,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>When asked about her criteria for picking a film, Kareena Kapoor said she wanted to be related to the project and big banner is secondary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking for films that I want to be part of&#8230; something that excites me. I listen to about two stories a day but I am not going to say yes to anyone, no matter who it is. I don&#8217;t think whether that person is big (filmmaker) or not. I will go by the script and that is more important for me and I have learnt that over the years,&#8221; Kareena Kapoor added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012016&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fashion designer L&#8217;Wren Scott, the girlfriend of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, has been found dead at her apartment in New York, the rocker&#8217;s spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Mick Jagger, 70, was &#8220;completely shocked and devastated&#8221; by the death of the 49-year-old Scott. US media reported that the former model was found hanged.</p>
<p>Jagger is currently in Australia, where he is touring with the Stones, who were due to perform in Perth on Wednesday. Scott had dated the Rolling Stones frontman since 2001 following his split from wife Jerry Hall.</p>
<p>There had been no public sign that anything was wrong. The designer&#8217;s official Twitter account was last updated with a link to a fashion shoot, after police were called to her apartment.</p>
<p>Jagger&#8217;s first wife Bianca tweeted her condolences. &#8220;Heartbroken to learn of the loss of the lovely and talented L&#8217;Wren Scott. My thoughts and prayers are with her family. May she rest in peace,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>New York police refused to release any name but confirmed that officers found a dead woman at 200 11th Avenue in Manhattan&#8217;s Chelsea neighborhood shortly after 10:00 am (1400 GMT).</p>
<p>&#8220;Upon arrival, officers discovered a 49-year-old female unconscious and unresponsive,&#8221; a police spokeswoman told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;She was pronounced dead on arrival. The investigation is ongoing. The medical examiners will determine the cause of death.&#8221;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the New York Fire Department confirmed only that firefighters had found a dead body when called to the address to respond to a &#8220;possible cardiac arrest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot release any more information before any proper family notification,&#8221; the police spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>US media reports said the six-foot, four-inch (1.93m) Scott was found with a scarf tied around her neck. No note was found, local media reported.</p>
<p>Famous for her relationship with Jagger, Scott was also a hugely successful designer whose body-hugging and figure-flattering dresses were loved by Hollywood stars and Michelle Obama alike.</p>
<p>Only last month she had debuted her line at London Fashion Week.  In a relationship for well over a decade with Jagger, she had appeared to give the aging rocker a degree of romantic stability despite the couple&#8217;s 21-year age gap.</p>
<p>He has had a multitude of high-profile relationships with models, singers and actresses, and has seven children with four different women.</p>
<p>He twice married models &#8212; Bianca and Jerry Hall &#8212; while other ex-lovers include singers Marianne Faithfull and Carla Bruni, who is now married to former French president Nicolas Sarkozy.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/halleyberry.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011686" alt="Halle Berry" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/halleyberry.jpg" /></a> Berry&#8217;s presence in the film as mutant Storm has allegedly been cut down to just one scene.
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Actress Halle Berry&#8217;s role in the upcoming &#8216;X-Men: Days of Future Past&#8217; movie has been reportedly cut down.</span></p>
<p>The 47-year-old actress joined several other stars from the original X-Men films for the new movie, including Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen, reported New York Daily News.</p>
<p>Berry&#8217;s presence in the film as mutant Storm has allegedly been cut down to just one scene. Berry was pregnant with her second child during most of the filming on &#8216;X-Men: Days of Future Past&#8217; in Montreal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Storm probably won&#8217;t be as badass as she was going to be,&#8221; Berry said after filming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we won&#8217;t be able to do any fighting or flying or things like that. There&#8217;s something very revealing and shocking about Storm in this movie that I thought was needed,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Last year, it was revealed that Anna Paquin&#8217;s role as Rogue was completely cut out of the movie. &#8216;X-Men: Days of Future Past&#8217; will be released in cinemas on May 2.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011685&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Singer Nicole Scherzinger has reportedly agreed to tie the knot with her on-and-off partner Lewis Hamilton.</span></p>
<p>The 35-year-old former Pussycat Dolls singer had apparently turned down Hamilton&#8217;s proposal on three previous occasions, reported Daily Star.</p>
<p>This time the Formula 1 racer popped the question at his Swiss mansion where the pair will apparently settle down after their wedding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lewis will be the main breadwinner when Nicole is not working and she will always have access to is private jet if she needs to travel,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the ideal plan for both of them and will hopefully lead to a big summer wedding in August when Lewis has a three-week break from his F1 schedule,&#8221; the source added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011681&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nupita.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011678" alt="Nupita" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nupita.jpg" /></a> Lupita Nyong&#8217;o is rumoured to have met with &#8216;Star Wars: Episode VII&#8217; director JJ Abrams.
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong&#8217;o is rumoured to have met with &#8216;Star Wars: Episode VII&#8217; director JJ Abrams.</span></p>
<p>The 31-year-old Kenyan actress is being considered for the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi&#8217;s descendant, the Hollywood Reporter said.</p>
<p>There is a lot of secrecy surrounding the plot and casting decisions of &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; owing to its high profile status and constant media coverage.</p>
<p>The character to be played by the &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; star may be one of the lead female roles but there is a separate ongoing search for two actors &#8211; a male and female &#8211; in their twenties who will, most likely, have some form of romantic relationship.</p>
<p>A relative newcomer to mainstream Hollywood, Nyong&#8217;o attracted attention and widespread admiration for her role in &#8217;12 Years a Slave&#8217; in which she played Patsey. Nyong&#8217;o took home the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in movie and it was around this time that she met with Abrams.</p>
<p>Nyong&#8217;o, following her performance in the historical drama and reception during the awards season, has been linked to a number of other productions in addition to &#8216;Star Wars&#8217;.</p>
<p>She was rumoured to be up for the role of Tiger Lily in &#8216;Pan&#8217;, a role which has since been filled by Rooney Mara. Nyong&#8217;o is also in the running for a courtroom drama, &#8216;The Whole Truth&#8217;, which Daniel Craig has already been cast in.</p>
<p>The seventh &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; film is due to be released in December 2015.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011677&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hollywood star Johnny Depp and his fiancee Amber Heard celebrated their upcoming wedding with a star-studded engagement party.</p>
<p>The party was held at the Carondelet House in downtown Los Angeles and was attended by Steven Tyler, Jerry Bruckheimer, Mandy Moore, Ryan Adams, Marilyn Manson, Andy Garcia and music producer Rick Rubin, reported People magazine.</p>
<p>Depp looked dapper in a black suit and matching fedora, while his bride-to-be was elegant in a white silk camisole top and a navy skirt.</p>
<p>Family members included Heard&#8217;s sister Whitney, Depp&#8217;s mother Betty Sue Palmer and son Jack.</p>
<p>&#8220;The invites to get inside was a black envelope, with the initials &#8216;A and J&#8217;, and what appeared to be a golden ticket. Guests were then escorted to a tent with red velvet curtains, which led to the entrance of the 1920s themed event space,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>The partygoers were also spotted with gifts for Depp and Heard. The 27-year-old actress and Depp, 50, got engaged in January, right after the &#8217;3 Days to Kill&#8217; starlet was first seen wearing a diamond ring on that finger. The pair met on the set of their 2011 film &#8216;The Rum Diary&#8217;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011672&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[ “She remains our chief executive officer, and we turn to her for all the tough decisions that come our way," said Amitabh Bachchan about his daughter Shweta Nanda. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011618&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitabhshweta.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011619" alt="Amitabh Shweta" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitabhshweta.jpg" /></a> Amitabh Bachchan said his daughter Shweta Nanda has been his rock at all times.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan said his daughter Shweta Nanda, who celebrates her 40th birthday on March 17,  has been his rock at all times.</span></p>
<p>The actor, who did not celebrate Holi due a loss in the family, flew to Delhi, where Shweta is settled after her marriage to industrialist Nikhil Nanda.</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan said, “She remains our chief executive officer, and we turn to her for all the tough decisions that come our way … daughters have a sense of the sixth, one that never fails to ring that cliched bell within us .. for us it always rings well and loud .. we are blessed and proud ..!!”</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan also got nostalgic remembering Shweta&#8217;s childhood. “Tomorrow is a day of travel again, to be with Shweta on her 40th .. dear me … so many years … and we still treat her like that cute cuddly little bundle, who would stare at me in wonder every time she would come to pick me up from the airport after a long stint of shooting from out of the country or land .. she would wonder who I was, and what I meant to her, for, absence from her for long days would perplex her … she was just a couple of years old,” Big B wrote.</p>
<p>Big B further said that even after her marriage and the distance, Shweta has never made them feel distanced. “But how much connected she remains with me now .. a picture of dedication not just with the family she has gone to in marriage, but with us here,” Big B wrote.</p>
<p>When she comes home to Jalsa, its never as though she went away .. and she does not ever allows us to feel that she left .. daughters have a way of doing that, and doing that well ..</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011618&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Bollywood actress Kalki Koechlin is not letting a bad year ruin her Holi plans. The actress, who is gradually becoming a strong voice of feminity says she is going to play Holi like ‘crazy’.</span></p>

<p>Last year the actess separated from her filmmaker husband Anurag Kashyap after 2 years of marriage. However, neither of them have elaborated much on the separation, there have been speculations that Anurag Kashyap’s alleged affair with ‘Gangs Of Wasseypur’ actress Huma Qureshi is the reason why the couple separated. However, both Kalki and Anurag have rubbished the rumour.</p>
<p>Of late, Kalki’s growing closeness with her ‘Shaitan’ co-star Gulshan Devaiya is also becoming the talk of the town. Kakli will also be seen in ‘Severing Ties’ with the ‘Ram-Leela’ actor.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011590&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/atal-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011142" alt="It appears that as the masses adored a political party, they catapulted its leader, a pedestrian peddler of rhymes, into the orbit of the greatest bards." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/atal-m.jpg" /></a> It appears that as the masses adored a political party, they catapulted its leader, a pedestrian peddler of rhymes, into the orbit of the greatest bards.
<p>Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Kumar Vishwas has all but seven cheesy rhymes listed on  <a href="http://www.poem­hunter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.poem­hunter.com</a>, a website of global poetry  — Main to jhonka hun hava ka uda le jaonga, jaagti rehna tujhe tujhse chura le jaonga (I am a draught of air, I will take you away. Remain awake, I will steal you from yourself). But he occupies the 26th slot among top 500 poets, higher than Kabir and Mirza Ghalib and many others, on the website. His CV informs about his birth in a “Gaur Brahmin family” (apparently the highest sub-caste of Brahmins in Uttar Pradesh), the only poet in the list to showcase his caste.</p>
<p>The lone Indian above him on the list is Rabindranath Tagore. Vishwas’s status, the website editors say, is determined by the hits his pages get. His website, Kumarvishwas.in, has other gems. “Main tujhse door kaise hoon, tu mujhse door kaisi hai; Ye tera dil samajhta hai, ya mera dil samajhta hai. Not something that needs translation for Bollywood song buffs. His site proclaims him as a “new-age poet, credited with reviving Hindi poetry among young generation”.</p>
<p>It appears that as the masses adored a political party, they catapulted its leader, a pedestrian peddler of rhymes, into the orbit of the greatest bards. Vishwas is not the first politician to take to poetry. His courage to foist verses on readers follows a lineage of illustrious predecessors. Former education minister Kapil Sibal believed he composed poetry as he texted and got the SMS published as a collection of poems. The Urdu poet who inhabited his Chandni Chowk constituency in the last century must have angrily considered the Right to Recall. The minister insisted poetry for him was a meditation on life. He confirmed it by celebrating his first month on Twitter with what he wanted to be called a poem: “30 days, 84 tweets/ They say I&#8217;ve reached over 2cr peeps/ As much I am on this medium sold/I gather all that twitters isn&#8217;t gold/ Here I gather plenty insights/from politics to basic rights.”</p>
<p>The Pokhran-II king, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, recited with valour paralleled only by Rajput emperors; Bofors crusader VP Singh did write some reasonable verses but once also cheekily compared a woman with a kettle. All of them found their muse, and publishers, only when they were in the office. The leap of AAP’s resident poet’s popularity corresponds with his party’s surge. That’s how politics trumps poetics.</p>
<p>But why only politicians as poets? Why so few novelists or story writers? First, the failings of language and emotion get exposed in fiction. Poetry lends no leniency either, but since it can be performed, staged and sung, it is handy for politicians, the great performers. A novel may take years. A poem is accomplished by pressing just a few keys of the BlackBerry.</p>
<p>Third, connoisseurs might disparage mushayaras as chintzy binge but the romantic halo cast by a lyricist over the crowd is the precise aspiration of a politician. A poet is essentially a romancer, a seducer. In its finest moments, politics carries an inescapable yearning for poetics. Not to write great poetry, but to achieve the poetic effect. To be called a poet. A soul smoldering for love, suffering for the pain of others. Remember the archetypal image of the poet in Guru Dutt’s Pyaasa. This poetic halo invokes instant public empathy. Vajpayee acquired a romantic charm solely because he was established as a poet.</p>
<p>Kapil Sibal and Vishwas have not left Hindi poetry any richer than it was earlier. Nor are there any signs that poetry made them better politicians or at least enriched their politics and discourse. But when Vishwas invokes a “poetic licence” to justify his kali-peeli remark against Kerala nurses, he shows how a politician could misuse poetry.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions. Not politician-turned-poets, but primarily poets who later joined politics like Sahitya Akademi winner Shrikant Verma. Among the closest confidants of Indira Gandhi, he supported her during Emergency, wrote her slogans and speeches, and was boycotted by his artist friends. But his nightmarish political experiences eventually led him to compose Magadh, probably among the finest poetry collections of modern Indian literature. Chahta to bach sakta tha, magar kaise bach sakta tha, jo rachega, kaise bachega? (I could have saved myself. But how could I? How could a creator ever save himself?) He wrote remembering the Emergency, and died in a US hospital of cancer soon after the award.</p>
<p>Poets repelled Plato. Poetry for him was an inferior genre, an imitative art and found no place in the Republic. For centuries, poets have resented the Greek political thinker. They would applaud if a few politicians were asked to focus only on the sovereign, socialist republic and leave poetry untrampled.  n</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011131&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cartoon-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011129" alt="Colour me true: A still from Painted Rainbow; animation filmmaker Gitanjali Rao" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cartoon-m.jpg" /></a> Colour me true: A still from Painted Rainbow.
<p>Animated characters are not cartoon characters. I don’t like when my characters speak. If I can hear my painted characters, it is jarring and I lose interest. My film has to be a series of paintings with sound that tells the story,” says Gitanjali Rao, who won the Golden Conch Best Animation Film Award at the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF) last month for True Love Story. In this 18-minute film, set in the streets of Mumbai, Bollywood fantasy dazzles its characters — who go about experiencing the exuberance and anguish of love, braving the grimy, grungy reality that the metropolis offers — before they encounter its rather reckless side. Rao, an indie animation filmmaker, narrates their journey in this kaleidoscopic world and makes bold statements without any dialogues.</p>
<p>Though her characters don’t speak, they inhabit an interesting world — something the Mumbai-based animator-illustrator envisioned in her debut film, Printed Rainbow. In this, an old woman and her cat escape their lonely and urban black-and-white world into the fantastical world of match-box covers. The heart-warming film won three awards when it premiered at the Critic’s Week of the Cannes Film Festival, 2006. “I make it very challenging for myself by not giving them dialogues,” says Rao, who graduated from Mumbai’s JJ Institute of Applied Art in 1994. However, she has given in to the need to use voices in Orange (2006) and Chai (2013). The first is a dialogue between two girls on love and its loss over wine and cigarettes. The latter, a documentary-style short, merges live action with animation, to tell a story of migration though four different people who have makeshift tea stalls.</p>
<p>Mostly self-taught, what has helped Rao — who also makes advertisements and illustrations for education aids — carry the narrative forward is her training in theatre. “The advantage of being a stage actor is that one has to express with her body language and face,” she says. Rao did theatre for nearly four years, working with Satyadev Dubey and Sunil Shanbag, among others, while studying at JJ. “I was more interested in sets and lighting than acting. Yet, when I started acting, I found it very rewarding,” says Rao. Born to architect parents, who love movies and music, she was exposed to various forms of art.</p>
<p>But filmmaking also attracted her. After she graduated with a gold medal in applied art, she chose a career in animation as it combines the art of illustration and filmmaking. “To educate myself in animation, I joined Ram Mohan Biographics, set up by veteran animator Ram Mohan. They used to take students from various art colleges and teach them animation on the job, at a low stipend,” she says. This was followed by a stint at Mumbai’s Famous Studio, where she was into design, storyboards and animation for commercials and small projects. She directed some of them.</p>
<p>That prepared her to make animation films and Printed Rainbow followed. For three years, she laboured over every frame of Printed Rainbow — dedicated to her mother and her cat — before Cannes festival officials fell in love with it. “A former curator of the festival happened to watch it when Rajivan Ayyappan was working on its sound at a Paris studio. On the curator’s suggestion, I sent it for the Critics’ Week,” she says. Eight years since, it continues to be a festival favourite.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the cash award she collected at MIFF, being averse to dialogues has not always paid off. For one, it has not fetched her producers. All her films so far, Printed Rainbow, Orange and True Love Story, are independently produced, barring Chai, which was one of the five shorts released on the internet by Viacom 18 last year. Even though she tried to raise funds for Girgit through collaboration and co-production, she did not have much luck. Anurag Kashyap, whose production company tried to raise funds for Rao’s feature film, says, “For animation artists not trying to ape Disney, it is extremely difficult to raise money, especially in a country where animation is referred to as cartoons and are perceived to be only for children.”</p>
<p>Silence apart, what distinguishes Rao is her artwork. “The impression of space that live action or a documentary film can create, I do through drawings and paintings. Once that’s achieved, it takes animation to another level,” says Rao. In spite of the growing popularity of 3D, Rao has stuck to the more traditional way of animation. “In 3D, you almost cheat to create reality. I never wanted to do that. I wanted to express it like Wong Kar-Wai, who takes reality and paints it like a canvas.”</p>
<p>According to Kashyap, what makes Rao special is the way she looks at the world, how she observes tiny details and recreates them, her imagination and her originality. Praising her style, Ram Mohan says, “Though she is comfortable using digital technology, she draws mostly from traditional Indian paintings.” According to Anand Patwardhan, head of MIFF jury, Rao is an artist who brings a world view to her art rather than looking at a mere frame. “I have seen Painted Rainbow and True Love Story, and both took my breath away not just because of the technique but also the intriguing and engrossing content.”</p>
<p>As Rao’s life experiences are growing, the urge to express those have become stronger. “When I get curious about people, a story emerges,” she says. Yet, she has some serious self-confessed handicaps: she can’t crack a joke. “Good storytellers can tell a joke well. I fumble with the punchline, and never get its timing correct. However, I can paint the story for you. And to tell a 30-second story, I will take 30 days,” she says.</p>
<p>Telling these stories through animation is a lengthy process, and can easily take up to three years. “I need to say a lot of things in a short and also keep emotions that drive the story,” says Rao. Keeping that in mind, she worked on the expression of first love as a story for True Love Story. However, this film is meant to be a part of a feature-length film, where three stories find a meeting point much like in the iconic Mexican film Amores Perros (2000). The other stories will revolve around the old woman, who had a bit role in the MIFF-winner, and a migrant boy.</p>
<p>Rao plans to make these three movies in phases. “I spent six years trying to find funding for features. It’s so much easier to make a short film,” she says. True Love Story was made on a shoe-string budget. For her next, the short film on the old woman, Rao wants to go the crowdfunding way.</p>
<p>Before she returns to the storyboards of this cherished project, travelling with True Love Story will be on her agenda. Cannes features on it too. She is sending it to the international festival. Hopefully, the film will win them over this time too. n</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011127&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011120&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/awara-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011123" alt="Father Prithviraj famously turned down the role and told his son, ‘Prithviraj doesn’t play the role of the hero’s father.’ Abbas saved the day by retorting, ‘It is Raj Kapoor who is playing the hero’s son’." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/awara-m.jpg" /></a> Father Prithviraj famously turned down the role and told his son, ‘Prithviraj doesn’t play the role of the hero’s father.’ Abbas saved the day by retorting, ‘It is Raj Kapoor who is playing the hero’s son’.
<p>There are three sides to this story. Judge Raghunath (Prithviraj Kapoor) believes, “Shareefon ki aulad hamesha shareef hoti hai aur chor daku ki aulad hamesha chor daku hoti hai.” On the other hand, Raj (Raj Kapoor) believes, “Yeh jo roti hoti hai na, yeh zulmi badi bewafa hoti hai.” He would know, because when he was young (Shashi Kapoor, as the younger Raj, tugs on your heartstrings like only he could), he even took up a part-time job as a boot polish boy just to earn his school fees, but poverty turned him into a thief, and an awara. Then there is the pretty Rita (Nargis), who is caught in the crossfire between her mentor-guardian and childhood sweetheart, and who believes, “Dil kisi kanoon ko nahin samajhta.”</p>
<p>The year was 1951. In Awara, Raj Kapoor saw an opportunity to make a strong social comment on the India that was emerging four years after Independence. In Raj’s own words, “Awara celebrates the innocence of the Republic, newly born, learning to cope with the difficult world.” In the book, Raj Kapoor Speaks, his daughter Ritu Nanda mentions how Raj famously bought the script of Awara from KA Abbas, who had initially offered it to Mehboob Khan. Khan was dilly-dallying on the script and was keen to make it only if he got Ashok Kumar to play the judge and Dilip Kumar the son.</p>
<p>Abbas refused to wait and went to narrate his script to Raj, who sealed it with one word, “Done.” Incidentally, the casting was a risky business for Raj as well. Father Prithviraj famously turned down the role and told his son, “Prithviraj does not play the role of the hero’s father.” Abbas saved the day by retorting, “No, you are not playing the hero’s father. It is Raj Kapoor who is playing the hero’s son.”</p>
<p>In Awara, Raj channelled his Charlie Chaplin tramp avatar — which was quite apt since his character was literally a tramp, born on the footpath. That image of him in the hat and coat, swinging a watch that he’s just stolen as he goes about singing Awara hoon&#8230; is imprinted on our collective DNA.</p>
<p>Awara was his third directorial venture after Aag and Barsaat and one has to doff one’s hat to Raj’s sheer range, showmanship and ambition to craft Awara as a three-tier saga. Awara is as much a social film on the nature versus nurture debate, as it is a father-son confrontation drama, but at its heart, it’s a beautiful, noble love story. This completeness of Awara is, perhaps, the reason why it was included in Time’s 100 all-time greats and was the Grand Prize nominee at the Cannes Film Festival in 1953.</p>
<p>The romance of Awara is about being a better man, it’s about fighting for legitimacy and a right to have an equal future. It’s a classic father-son story. Even though he hates his father for throwing his pregnant mother on the street on the basis of suspicion, the son asks him, “Tumhare man ki adalat ka kya faisla hai.” The film is also about a woman’s fight to bring out the potential of the man she loves in front of the world. After the necklace gift scene, when she comes to know that the man she loves is a thief, Rita tells Raj: “Achche ho, bure ho, nirdosh ho, apradhi ho, jo bhi ho tum mere ho.”</p>
<p>Raj and Nargis did on screen what only they could. When they meet after 12 years, they stare longingly into each other’s eyes. She says, “Kitne badal gaye ho tum.” He replies, “Aur tum zara bhi nahin badli.” She wants to know, “Kahan kho gaye they Raj?” He says, “Tumhari talaash mein.” Sigh.</p>
<p>Then there is the famous beach moment — Nargis rocks a one-piece swimsuit — where she calls him a “junglee” and he slaps her four times and she throws herself at his feet. I’ve never made peace with the slaps or Nargis’s happy abdication that “maarna chahte ho toh lo maar lo”. I don’t even buy Raj’s inner turmoil, which he articulates as, “Kisse maaroon? Tumhe ya apne aap ko?” I get it that he’s awara, and it gnaws at him that he doesn’t deserve the love of this woman, but the slaps still rankle. What makes it okay is the beautiful man-woman conversation that follows as the lovers croon Dum bhar jo udhar mooh phere. That one expression by Shailendra, Chand ko chanda roz hi dekhe, meri pehli raat, makes this song unforgettable for me.</p>
<p>Then there is Ghar aaya mera pardesi — regarded as India’s first dream sequence song — that earned French dancer Madame Simkie a mention in the main titles for the “Dream Sequence Dance Direction”. Awara was the first film to be shot in RK Studios and it’s a film that travelled continents.

<p>Pop star Britney Spears reportedly left a party after suffering a panic attack as the overcrowded gathering made her uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old singer, who recently attended Sir Elton John&#8217;s AIDS Foundation Oscar-viewing party, made a quick exit from the event just minutes after arriving as she had apparently encountered a panic attack, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Britney was excited when she first went to the party but moments later she was fazed about being at such an over-crowded event,&#8221; a source said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She started to break out in a sweat and become short of breath, it was like she was having a panic attack ,&#8221; the source added.</p>
<p>Spears, who suffers from bipolar disorder had also shaved her head some years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Britney still finds large crowds nerve-wracking and doesn&#8217;t feel comfortable at showbiz events. The chaos of the red carpet and all the unfamiliar faces is very daunting, a source said.</p>
<p>&#8220;She manages to block out the crowd and put on an act when she&#8217;s on stage, but it&#8217;s harder when she&#8217;s socialising,&#8221; the source added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011041&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Big B says that there have been certain ‘ill moments’ in the year, which still continue and therefore the celebrations will be low. Besides, Holi this year coincides with his daughter Shweta’s birthday, and therefore Amitabh Bachchan will be with her in Delhi.</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan wrote, “Holi is on the 17th .. Shweta’s Birthday and we shall be with her … so am not going to celebrate … there have been certain ill moments in the year and they still continue .. when there is mourning in the family festivals are put away, traditionally .. and so… Each year we hope that there is joy and happiness around .. and I do hope this year is one such ..”</p>
<p>Big B elaborated, “We do not celebrate it again … there have been discomforting news for the year, the passing away of relations distant, of long months of struggle against illness .. it would be disrespectful to be immersed in the colours of abandon and joy when some among us mourn ..”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011020&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hollywood star Sharon Stone says it is not possible for one to remain beautiful all their life as ageing is inevitable.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old actress feels happy to learn that she is still thought as an attractive person, reported Daily Mirror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think ageless beauty exists. I think it&#8217;s just a catch-phrase. And so, you know, I think that&#8217;s stupid. To be the best you can be, you know, we have to recognise that it&#8217;s an internal thing. Not just an external thing,&#8221; Stone said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, I think it&#8217;s a sense of ethics. It&#8217;s everything, you know. If you want to keep yourself together, it&#8217;s all things,&#8221; she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010981&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Oscar-winning actor Jared Leto and his band 30 Seconds to Mars performed at a concert in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Leto made headlines weeks ago for paying tribute to Ukrainians while accepting the Best Supporting Actor prize for &#8216;Dallas Buyers Club&#8217; at the 2014 Academy Awards, reported Digital Spy.</p>
<p>30 Seconds to Mars played a gig in Kiev&#8217;s Maiden Square with Leto praising the Ukrainian people by waving the country&#8217;s flag.</p>
<p>&#8220;You guys are in the midst of something really beautiful and it may be difficult, but there&#8217;s no price too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want to let you know, I understand other bands have cancelled their shows, but there was no way, 30 Seconds to Mars wasn&#8217;t going to be here in this beautiful city, in this great country here tonight.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010977&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Director Bryan Singer has revealed that the forthcoming &#8216;X-Men: Apocalypse&#8217; will have &#8216;mass destruction&#8217; in a way the franchise has never seen before.</p>
<p>The director, who returns to the series with this summer&#8217;s &#8216;X-Men: Days of Future Past&#8217;, shed light on the storyline for the superhero movie, reported Total Film<br />
magazine.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to deal with the notion of ancient mutants &#8211; the fact they were born and existed thousands of years ago,&#8221; Singer said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;ll be a contemporary movie &#8211; well, it&#8217;ll take place in the &#8217;80s&#8230; The &#8217;80s is a period now &#8211; it&#8217;s hard for me to believe that. &#8216;Apocalypse&#8217; will have more of the mass destruction that &#8216;X-Men&#8217; films, to date, have not relied upon. There&#8217;s definitely now a character and a story that allow room for that kind of spectacle,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8216;X-Men: Apocalypse&#8217; will open in cinemas on May 27, 2016. &#8216;X-Men: Days of Future Past&#8217; will be released on May 22.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010970&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, who made a rage in 2013 with his rom com &#8216;Chennai Express&#8217;, is all praise for megastar Amitabh Bachchan&#8217;s upcoming supernatural comedy film &#8216;Bhoothnath Returns&#8217;.</p>
<p>King Khan, who has given innumerable hits in Bollywood, says that Big B&#8217;s &#8216;Bhoothnath Returns&#8217; will be one of the top three hits of the year 2014.</p>
<p>Shah Rukh Khan made an unexpected visit to the sets of Amitabh Bachchan&#8217;s &#8216;Bhoothnath Returns&#8217;, in which he has a cameo.</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan wrote on his blog, “It was really sweet of Shahrukh to state quite unexpectedly as he arrived on the sets of Bhoothnath, that this film would be one of the three biggest hits of the year .. aapke muh mein ghee shakkar, laddo peda sab kuch ..”</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/srkamitabh-460.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2010960" alt="srkamitabh-460" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/srkamitabh-460.jpg?w=460&#038;h=306" width="460" height="306" /></a></p>
<p>‘Bhoothnath Returns’ also stars National Award wining actress Usha Jhadav, actor Boman Irani and child actor Parth Bhalerao in lead roles. Ranbir Kapoor will also be seen in a cameo role.</p>
<p>The film is a hilarious take on the prevalent political issues and sees Amitabh Bachchan as the friendly ghost who contests in local elections. The film is slated to release on April 11.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010957&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ashton-mila480.jpg" /></a> Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis first met on the sets of their television series &#8216;That &#8217;70s Show&#8217;.
<p>Newly engaged couple Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis joined &#8216;Two and a Half Men&#8217; co-star Jon<br />
Cryer and his wife for a dinner date.</p>
<p>The foursome was spotted in casual clothes with Kunis opting to go makeup free, reported New York Daily News. While the 30-year-old actress showed off in a short denim dress and red heels, one thing that wasn&#8217;t visible was her new ring.</p>
<p>The pair started dating nearly two years ago and, after many speculations about their engagement, Kutcher reportedly popped the question earlier this year with Kunis spotted wearing the ring for the first time on February 26.</p>
<p>The couple, who starred alongside one another for eight seasons on &#8216;That &#8217;70s Show&#8217; where they first met, are reuniting on the small screen as Kunis is set to appear on &#8217;Two and a Half Men&#8217; the network announced on March 4.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010504&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dk-anita-dongre_diamirza480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2010500" alt="Dia Mirza: Women-dominated films have a long history in Bollywood. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dk-anita-dongre_diamirza480.jpg" /></a> Dia Mirza: Women-dominated films have a long history in Bollywood.
<p>Actress-producer Dia Mirza feels women-centric films in Bollywood are mostly one-sided but<br />
things are now changing.</p>
<p>Dia also said that there is a scope for such movies to be presented as wholesome entertainers for a larger audience. &#8221;Heroines have always been an essential part of films but their portrayal in cinema is not a much explored subject. Actresses are added primarily for glamour quotient,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women-dominated films have a long history in Bollywood, but &#8216;Bobby Jasoos&#8217;, a spy-thriller centred around a female detective (Vidya Balan), attempts to break into a domain until now largely occupied by male actors,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The first look of Vidya, dressed as a male beggar with beard and ragged hair, and unveiled a few weeks ago caught everyone&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very excited about &#8216;Bobby Jasoos&#8217; as a lover of cinema, as a maker of cinema and as an audience. The manner in which we have approached and viewed women-centric subjects is tilted only in one direction &#8211; they are gritty, deep, dark and intense,&#8221; Dia told PTI in an interview here.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is now refreshing is our story tellers are beginning to believe and execute women stories that are not what we think or perceive women subjects to be like. They are wholesome entertainers for everyone to see,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Dia hoped &#8216;Bobby Jasoos&#8217;, slated for release later this year, gets thumps up from people. &#8221;I hope &#8216;Bobby Jasoos&#8217; is loved by men as much as women. We have made this film for everybody. It is not a film for women alone or women power.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film, directed by Samar Shaikh, has been produced under the banner of Born Free Entertainment, co-owned by the former beauty queen and her beau Sahil Sangha.</p>
<p>This is Dia&#8217;s second film as a producer after `Love Breakups Zindagi&#8217; (2011) and and she is enjoying her innings as a producer. &#8220;There is a lot of hard work as a producer and it is compelling. It is like a drug&#8230;it entices you and once you get addicted, it is very difficult to draw away from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if she misses acting, pat comes the reply, &#8220;Off course I do&#8230; But facilitating a film is far more meaningful and fulfilling experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 32-year-old model-turned-actor was seen walking the ramp for ace designer Anita Dongre last night at the Lakme Fashion Week. Dia said she still gets nervous while on ramp.</p>
<p>&#8220;You feel that adrenaline rush&#8230;the attack of anxiety is there. But once you hit the ramp the energy from the audience helps, it is a great high to be on ramp.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010493&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Though her body remains testament to its success, singer-actress Jennifer Hudson is no longer a face of Weight Watchers.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Dreamgirls&#8217; star and the weight-loss brand have parted ways after four years, her commitment to the company fulfilled, her representative said, reported E! online.</p>
<p>&#8220;My experience with Weight Watchers has truly been life changing. I am grateful for what I have learned throughout the process and will always take it with me. I have chosen to step away from my role as ambassador and I am excited for the year to come, with many new projects and lots of new music,&#8221; &#8220; Hudson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Speculation about a possibly not-very-amicable split circulated after Hudson tweeted, &#8220;Sometimes you have to step back and let your work speak for you, and when that doesn&#8217;t work you walk away knowing you did your best&#8230;It&#8217;s been fun and a pleasure good luck to you all @WeightWatchers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hudson welcomed son David in 2009 and hooked up with Weight Watchers the following year—and never looked back.</p>
<p>The &#8216;American Idol&#8217; castoff turned Oscar winner ultimately shed 80 pounds and became quite the red-carpet standout, having gone from a size 16 to a 6.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010418&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Filmmaker Karan Johar, who has given several Bollywood hits both as a producer and a director, recalls his days when he joined hands with Chopra clan&#8217;s Aditya Chopra to give the blockbuster hit &#8216;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge&#8217; 20 years back.</p>
<p>Karan Johar, who considers Aditya Chopra to be his mentor and the reason for him to be in the film industry, today tweeted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I joined Aditya Chopra exactly 20 years ago as an Assistant Director on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DDLJ&amp;src=hash">#DDLJ</a>&#8230;he is my mentor and the reason I am in the movies today&#8230;</p>
<p>— Karan Johar (@karanjohar) <a href="https://twitter.com/karanjohar/statuses/444721525761908736">March 15, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&#8216;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&#8217; director got nostalgic and remembered his journey to the Yash Raj Films office on March 15, 1994. He tweeted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I remember the journey from my house to the YRF office on the 15th of March,1994&#8230;remember wondering if this is the right career choice&#8230;</p>
<p>— Karan Johar (@karanjohar) <a href="https://twitter.com/karanjohar/statuses/444722241993863169">March 15, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Missing the two important people in his life, Karan said, “I miss my father and Yash uncle tremendously today&#8230;Adi and me are blessed to have them look over us constantly&#8230;”</p>
<p>Karan Johar&#8217;s last directorial venture was &#8216;Student of the Year&#8217; and partially &#8216;Bombay Talkies. He has Alia Bhatt and Arjun Kapoor starrer &#8217;2 States&#8217; coming up under his production banner Dharma Productions.</p>
<p>He will soon be seen in Anurag Kashyap&#8217;s Bombay Velvet.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010407&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>There have been frequent rumours about Shilpa Shetty and Raj Kundra planning to produce a TV show and now, Raj Kundra recently revealed that they will indeed be making a show which will deal with social causes tentatively titled &#8216;Sone Ka Dil&#8217;.</p>
<p>Denying the comparisons with Aamir&#8217;s popular show &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217;, this show is said to have a different format where the team will honour the people who are working towards development in the society by presenting gold medals or coins as well as promote NGOs where Raj and Shilpa will also be donating for these charitable causes.</p>
<p>Though currently the airing slot and the rest of the details of the show are being worked out, Raj announced that they have found thirteen people from different parts of India whose efforts will be acknowledged in the show.</p>
<p>He also added that they have shot a music video for the show titled Bharat Bhagya Vidhata which is sung by Altamash Faridi and composed by Palash Muchhal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010402&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A few years back, Nawab Saif Ali Khan was charged for assaulting an NRI businessman from South Africa named Iqbal Sharma at the Taj Hotel in Mumbai. And now, after the charges were read by the court, the actor and the others accused Bilal Amrohi and Shakeel Ladak have been pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Saif was arrested two years ago after the businessman Iqbal accused the actor of breaking his nose and beating up his father-in-law with his friends at a five star hotel in Mumbai.</p>
<p>However, the actor was given bail and in a public apology and statement to the media, Saif had claimed that he did not hit the businessman and had lost his cool because the businessman was abusing the ladies in their group which included Kareena Kapoor, Amrita Arora and Malaika Arora Khan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010390&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Only my own dates need to be worked out.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010382&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/anilkapoor480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2010386" alt="Last year, Anil Kapoor declined all movie offers in order to focus on '24'." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/anilkapoor480.jpg" /></a> Last year, Anil Kapoor declined all movie offers in order to focus on &#8217;24&#8242;.
<p>The game-changing serial &#8217;24&#8242; is all set to go into Season 2. Yup, it&#8217;s time for Anil Kapoor to don the producer&#8217;s hat once again, even if it is to be done at the cost of his film offers.</p>
<p>Apparently, Anil has 6 major film offers this year. But he is tempted to again give priority to &#8217;24&#8242;. Confirming his full-throttle plans for Season 2 Anil says, &#8220;My entire team is into pre-production. Only my own dates need to be worked out. I am in a bit of a fix.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, Anil said no to all movie offers in order to focus on &#8217;24&#8242;. This year, the movie offers have piled up but Anil is in the mood for Season 2 of the series. Confesses the director, &#8220;There are quite a number of tempting film offers. But I haven&#8217;t said yes to them as yet. I need to work out my dates for Season 2 of &#8217;24&#8242;. That&#8217;s a commitment I&#8217;ve made to myself. As a movie actor I&#8217;ve seen and done it all. Television is a new medium for me. And it&#8217;s very exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>So would Anil end up doing no films in 2014? &#8220;I am already doing Anees Bazmee&#8217;s Welcome Back. So I&#8217;ve a major film coming up this year. As for more movies, they would depend on how much time Season 2 of &#8217;24&#8242; would need. You see, the first season was tougher with the entire machinery and logistics of television being new to me. A lot of the production hassles would be automatically lessened this time,&#8221; reveals Anil excitedly.</p>
<p>The one thing that is most certainly going to be seen in Season 2 of &#8217;24&#8242; is the core cast of Anil Kapoor, Tisca Chopra and Mandira Bedi. Rishi Kapoor and Jeetendra are likely to join the cast. &#8220;Let&#8217;s see how it goes. I am even more excited about Season 2,&#8221; reveals Anil who took a few days off this week to attend his brother Sanjay Kapoor&#8217;s brother-in-law&#8217;s wedding.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010382&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sonam4802.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2010380" alt="Sonam Kapoor: I wasn't really tense about wearing a bikini. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sonam4802.jpg" /></a> Sonam Kapoor: I wasn&#8217;t really tense about wearing a bikini.
<p>You&#8217;d think that Sonam Kapoor is only carrying forward the illustrious Yash Raj legacy by getting into a bikini for Bewakoofiyan. After all, we&#8217;ve seen number of Yash Raj heroines from the old Sonam in Vijay (1983) to today&#8217;s Sonam Kapoor in Bewakoofiyan don the bikini.</p>
<p>But Sonam springs a saucy surprise by saying the bikini was her idea. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the producer Aditya Chopra or the director Nupur Asthana&#8217;s idea that I wear a bikini. In fact, the director suggested a one-piece bathing costume. But I thought a bikini was fine. If you see the trailer there are two young people going for swim. It&#8217;s perfectly natural for the girl to be in a bikini. It&#8217;s not Halle Berry in a James Bond film or Bipasha Basu in Dhoom making a splash. The bikini blends naturally into the scene. And I am very happy to be wearing one. Having a female director around helped. But I wasn&#8217;t really tense about wearing a bikini.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sonam&#8217;s father Anil Kapoor has apparently said that Sonam&#8217;s bikini shot would get Bewakoofiyan a good opening. Sonam completely refutes any such statement from her father. &#8220;My father never said that. All that I said at a press meet was that my father feels the film would get a good opening. That statement found itself bonding with the bikini in the newspaper headlines. I&#8217;ve realized I have to be very careful in what I say. I speak my heart out. Such honesty is not appreciated in the film industry. Instead, it is twisted and distorted. A lot of what I say is lost in translation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sonam is very happy to have done a frothy feel-happy film like Bewakoofiyan. &#8220;Finally! I&#8217;ve been doing too many intense films from Saawariya, Delhi 6, Mausam and last year there was Raanjhanaa and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. After doing Bewakoofiyan I realized I hadn&#8217;t done any conventional films at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bewakoofiyan helped Sonam to relax. &#8220;I needed to unwind, just have fun doing a role. Also, some of my films have taken longer to be completed than usual. This one took only 40 days to shoot. It wasn&#8217;t a marathon race but more like a quick run. It was chicken soup for my soul. It was a very easy smooth slip-in-slip-out kind of shoot. I never realized when we started the shooting and when it ended.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other factor that Sonam found relaxing in Bewakoofiyan was the rom-com format. &#8220;I have two heroine-centric films Khoobsurat and Dolly Ki Doli lined up. Before I went into these films where I had to shoulder the film&#8217;s weight, I needed to do something where both the leads had equal responsibility to share. Bewakoofiyan was liberating.&#8221;</p>
<p>The film&#8217;s sensibility is very close to Sonam&#8217;s personality. &#8220;Bewakoofiyan is a frothy American rom-com kind of film about urban kids. Since both Ayushmann and I are urban youngsters it was relatively easy for us to identify with the situations in the script.&#8221;</p>
<p>Remind her that Ayushmann is from Chandigarh which is not that urbanized a background and Sonam protests, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll be surprised at how urban Chandigarh has become. I&#8217;ve shot there recently. Believe me, it is no longer a small town. And besides, Ayushmann has spent most of his life in Delhi. So his sensibilities are very urban. I had great fun shooting with him.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010345&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/bewakoof480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009851" alt="Bewakoofiyaan review." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/bewakoof480.jpg" /></a> Bewakoofiyaan review.
<p>Bewakoofiyaan offers its viewers to become a part of the movie experience: if you watch the film expecting a Queen or a Hasee Toh Phasee, you are pretty much doing what the title says. Though the lead pair does a decent job, they are burdened with a tired script and a cliched concept.</p>
<p>As usual, our reporter interviewed celeb watchers of the film to figure out what they thought of Bewakoofiyan. In keeping with the mood of the season, his first three interviewees were the three top political figures in India today.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bewakoofiyan_kejriwal-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2010286" alt="Bewakoofiyan_Kejriwal 1" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bewakoofiyan_kejriwal-1.jpg?w=448&#038;h=448" width="448" height="448" /></a></p>

<p>Before he could tell Arvind that Mango is not exactly an Aam Aadmi brand, he was left alone. After the AAP supremo, it was the turn of Narendra Modi.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bewakoofiyan_namo-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2010290" alt="Bewakoofiyan_NaMo 3" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bewakoofiyan_namo-3.jpg?w=470&#038;h=450" width="470" height="450" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, Rahul Gandhi turned up, and our reporter prepared himself for prepared answers.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bewakoofiyan_raga_5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2010292" alt="Bewakoofiyan_RaGa_5" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bewakoofiyan_raga_5.jpg?w=470&#038;h=450" width="470" height="450" /></a></p>

<p>After the political heavyweights of the present, it was the turn of a literal political heavyweight from millenia ago.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bewakoofiyan_kumbh-7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2010288" alt="Bewakoofiyan_Kumbh 7" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bewakoofiyan_kumbh-7.jpg?w=448&#038;h=448" width="448" height="448" /></a></p>

<p>Our reporter left in confusion, telling himself that Ra.One might actually have been a better viewing choice.</p>

<p>Pop star Lady Gaga claims she has put on weight by eating meat during her stay in Austin, Texas, for the South by Southwest festival.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old singer, who has admitted her weight fluctuates because of her love of Italian food, has been gorging on barbecue food and meat during her stay in Austin, reported E! online.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s actually why I wore it because I am really fat right now because I have been eating BBQ. I had some at Stubb&#8217;s because I am playing there and some Salt Lick too. Or any meat that I find on the street, I just eat,&#8221; the singer said.</p>
<p>Gaga has been soaking up the atmosphere at the festival, where she will deliver the SXSW keynote speech with Fuse&#8217;s John Norris.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010219&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Singer-songwriter John Legend says Kanye West is a genuine person and people judge him wrong.</p>
<p>Legend, 35, who has worked with West several times, said that that they do argue for bringing out the best for their album and he sometimes goes against West&#8217;s wish, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;We always have differences of opinion. We try to get to a place where we agree on a song, but occasionally I put something on that I love and Kanye isn&#8217;t too fond of,&#8221; Legend said.</p>
<p>Legend feels that people judge West wrong and is often criticised for his public rants. &#8221;He is so honest that people think there must be something else behind it, but it&#8217;s just him telling the truth as he sees it. We place a premium on being polite, but it&#8217;s not the most necessary thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at what Kanye says and does, it might upset our sense of politeness, but has he ever actually hurt anybody? No,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010215&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Photo: Varinder Chawla)
<p>Superstar Aamir Khan, who is currently busy with his TV show &#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217; says that his monetary earnings from the programme are less but he is enriched by the experience of meeting different people.</p>
<p>There were reports that Aamir was not charging anything for the show but the actor said, &#8220;I do take money for the show&#8230; I think I should take money for the work I do. I used to earn more money through ads but I don&#8217;t do much ads now. If I look at it financially, commercially&#8230; then I am earning less.</p>
<p>&#8220;(But) My earning is more in another way&#8230; like meeting people from various walks of life, touching their lives. I feel enriched,&#8221; Aamir told reporters here.</p>
<p>&#8216;Satyamev Jayate&#8217; has been one of the most influential television shows in the recent times. The first season saw Aamir raising some sensitive topics like female foeticide, child sexual abuse, medical malpractice, dowry system, love marriages and honour killings among others.</p>
<p>In the second season, which kicked off on March 2, issues like rape and police reforms were raised. The actor, however, did not elaborate on the subjects, which would be highlighted in the upcoming episodes.</p>
<p>On ensuing polls, he said, &#8220;I will come forward for an issue&#8230; but I will not campaign&#8230; support any party or person. I know people in politics. I don&#8217;t want to influence anyone. I think youngsters should vote&#8230; think and vote.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past, Aamir did support social activist Anna Hazare when he was fighting for corruption. On AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, Aamir said, &#8220;It is a<br />
new party let&#8217;s see what kind of work they do. I don&#8217;t want to comment on them right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>His good friend Salman Khan too would be seen in a social show &#8216;Mission Sapne&#8217;, where the celebrity would be leading the life of a common man for a day and give the earnings to them<br />
(common man).</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very happy Salman is doing this kind of a show. I wish more people from industry come and support it (social issues),&#8221; Aamir said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010204&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>So Long, See You Tomorrow</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bombay Bicycle Club</strong></p>
<p><strong>Universal/Island</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rs 1,144</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> **** 1/2</p>
<p>Much like the now-defunct London restaurant they’ve adopted their name from, there’s warm comfort in the familiarity that Bombay Bicycle Club (BBC) instills in an Indian listener. It’s the kind of sentiment that an ’80s or ’90s child probably experienced when, while listening to Poison, Nirvana or The Smiths, she found an occasional Cornershop, brimming with Indian notes fused with British post-punk sounds. Or chanced upon Goldspot, the British indie-pop outfit known for their “retro filmi” influences.</p>
<p>But in So Long, See You Tomorrow, BBC — with Jack Steadman (on vocals, guitar, piano) at the helm, Jamie MacColl (guitar), Suren de Saram (drums) and Ed Nash (bass) — doesn’t just create an easy ambience. It infuses a pinch of blues (used in their debut album I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose) and folk tunes (used in Flaws) in its crisp electronic pop soundscape.</p>
<p>The first image that comes to mind with the track Feel is the amorous snake dance in the film Nagin (1976). The track starts with the familiar Man Dole Tera Tan Dole’s shehnai tune embellished with booming bass, smoothly progressing to danceable techno pop. Further, there is a brief grungy version of the “Nagin song” interlude, followed by “Our love was lost, oh lost/And then forgotten like an old song/ You said your life went on”. Luna, on the other hand, even though ridden with tabla musings, is a psychedelic mix of female chorus and trance-like sea of sounds.</p>
<p>With the intensity reminiscent of the British jazz-electronic outfit, The Cinematic Orchestra, and a wholesome diversity of sounds (Bollywood samples laced with orchestral-quality stringed instrumentals, for instance), Overdone is set against turntablist and electronic elements. Steadman’s restrained vocals, sweeping in and out of occasional chorus, make the track a concert-goer’s dream.</p>
<p>Carry me struts heavily with mixed emotions of dub, pop  and techno, a repetitive “You carry me” reverberating across the  sounds. Tracks such as Home by now, Eyes off you and Whenever, wherever are mellow.</p>
<p>Making up for the infusion of sounds, BBC’s minimalistic vocals polish up the style they have been tampering with, successfully so, since 2006. The 10-track album concludes with the titular song So long, see you tomorrow. It’s a clean-cut composition, but goes astray with Steadman’s inexhaustible “When you reign it down, lights come/ You go round and round and round” in loop for six minutes. Once it’s over, So long… leaves one with a disconcertingly bittersweet aftertaste, a good sign of more to come from one of the most underrated bands from London.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009964&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now that Filmfare Awards, Screen Awards, etc etc are long gone, it’s time for the Ghanta Awards. India’s version of the Golden Raspberry Awards (Razzies), the Ghanta Awards recognize the worst in Bollywood.</p>
<p>The nominations bash recently took place in Delhi at the Stein auditoriumin the India Habitat Centre. The hosts for the evening were five stand-up comedians &#8211; Sorabh Pant and his ‘East India Comedy’ members &#8211; Kunal Rao, Sahil Shah, Darsheel Safary and Azeem Banatwalla.</p>
<p>The night saw spoofs and singing with parodies on Bollywood using songs by the Backstreet Boys and even one Alok Nath, who was a trending topic on Twitter last month.</p>
<p>The categories included worst actor, actress, and director with a new category this season was ‘Kuoting Krap with Karan’, inspired from Karan Johar’s talk show ‘Koffee with Karan’.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009845&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/days480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009836" alt="Movie review: 3 Days To Kill." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/days480.jpg" /></a> Movie review: 3 Days To Kill.
<p><strong><br />
Director: McG<br />
Casting: Kevin Costner, Hailee Steinfeld, Connie Nielsen, Amber Heard<br />
The Indian Express rating: **</strong></p>
<p>NORMAL folks would think twice accepting a syringe full of an experimental drug from a woman in skin-tight leather, high heels, red lips, crazy wigs, a flashy car and, most importantly, some incredulous association with the CIA. No such thought flits across Ethan&#8217;s (Costner) mind. Himself a retired CIA agent, he has presumably seen weirder things in life, even weirder than the aforementioned &#8216;Vivi (Heard)&#8217;.</p>
<p>You are willing to grant 3 Days to Kill that, given that director McG and writer-co-screenwriter Luc Besson have Charlies Angels, Terminator Salvation, Transporter, The Fifth Element and many other light-on-feet action films between them. Besson even managed a hit with Taken, a similar story as 3 Days to Kill about a retired CIA agent and his daughter, played by an equally scruffy, deadbeat Liam Neeson. However, this one fails to even rise to that level, for the action is too tired, the humour too forced, the relationship too cliched, an accompanying storyline too unbelievable (even compared to Vivi), and children just too many to have around guns.</p>
<p>Vivi first spots Ethan during an operation gone wrong in Serbia, in which blasts go around a suitcase with nuclear bombs. Never mind, what&#8217;s more troubling is the bad cough Ethan has &#8212; hardly ever the case of the flu in movies. Sure enough, he discovers he has &#8220;brain cancer, which has spread to the lungs&#8221;, with a couple of months to live. Ethan leaves the Agency and decides to spend that time making up to his estranged wife and the teenage daughter he barely knows.</p>
<p>Wife Christina (Nielsen) and daughter Zoey (Steinfeld) are not very welcoming, though the former melts on hearing about his medical condition. The film is about how Ethan wins Zoey over, while fighting the bad guys and, often, taking parenting and cooking tips from them. If only it was that alone, for there are few as winning as Costner in such thankless roles. However, Vivi keeps reappearing, seeking Ethan&#8217;s help for a reason that is not supposed to make sense, and claiming an association with the CIA that should have the Agency worried. In exchange, she offers Ethan the experimental drug that may or may not extend his life.</p>
<p>With little coherent thought intended, the film is neither about Ethan&#8217;s desperation or his love for Zoey, nor about the bad guys threatening him. That McG is capable is clear from the scene where Ethan teaches Zoey how to ride a bicycle, as she asks the questions she has always wanted to from her absentee father.</p>
<p>Rather, as Costner suffers though a lot else, including witnessing childbirth by a woman who is no more than a stranger, it&#8217;s Heard who may get the best career bump. If this is a celebration of absurdities, she is the one dressed for the party.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009833&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/matt_damon_reuters480.jpg" /></a> Matt damon will be seen in Terry Gilliam&#8217;s new sci-fi drama &#8216;The Zero Theorem&#8217;. (Reuters)
<p>Actor Matt Damon signed up to appear in director Terry Gilliam&#8217;s new sci-fi drama &#8216;The Zero Theorem without even reading the script.</p>
<p>Gilliam admits casting &#8216;The Bourne Identity&#8217; star in the low-budget drama because he was ready and willing to do whatever was required of him, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I called Matt and said, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got a small part for you, probably four or five days, I&#8217;ll send you the script.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t bother, I&#8217;m in,&#8217;&#8221; Gilliam said.</p>
<p>And Damon was not the only star who signed on to work with Gilliam without a script read or an agreed salary. Tilda Swinton and &#8216;Skyfall&#8217; actor Ben Whishaw also jumped at the chance to team up with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Tilda and I) had met at different festivals and always said we ought to work together, Ben Whishaw, the same thing. And basically I just called them and they all just came and they worked for scale, that&#8217;s how we made the film, because we didn&#8217;t have the budget,&#8221; Gilliam added.</p>
<p>&#8216;The Zero Theorem&#8217; centres on a reclusive computer hacker, played by Christoph Waltz, who attempts to discover the reason for human existence.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009771&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/marykom.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009711" alt="The boxer, whose rise from poverty to being a global sports icon is now being made into a film starring Priyanka Chopra, was a &quot;natural&quot; before the camera." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/marykom.jpg" /></a> The boxer, whose rise from poverty to being a global sports icon is now being made into a film starring Priyanka Chopra, was a &#8220;natural&#8221; before the camera.
<p>Filmmaker Shoojit Sircar has done in 3 minutes what Priyanka Chopra would take 3 hours to say. In an ad that he shot over three days last week, Shoojit got boxing champion Mary Kom to enact her own life on camera.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a remarkably inspiring three-day shoot. Though it&#8217;s an ad we got Mary Kom to feature in it. And we encapsulated every phase of her life from her childhood struggle for a decent life to her hard-working teens to her current status as boxing champ and a home-maker, we got all of this into the script in just a three-minute film,&#8221; says Shoojit</p>
<p>The director says it was a huge challenge to get Mary Kom&#8217;s life on to the film in such meager footage. &#8220;I wanted it to be an inspirational saga told in just a few minutes. I didn&#8217;t want her to come across as a model selling a product but a responsible citizen selling an idea to the millions who look up to her. I had never expected her to be so camera-friendly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boxer, whose rise from poverty to being a global sports icon is now being made into a film starring Priyanka Chopra, was a &#8220;natural&#8221; before the camera.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was such a pleasure shooting with Mary Kom. She came to the sets with no attitude or fixed notions. She surrendered to whatever the script demanded. She was fully there with me, collaborating and participating like a true member of the crew,&#8221; says Shoojit.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009701&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ayushmann-khurrana-new.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009690" alt="ayushmann-khurrana-new" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ayushmann-khurrana-new.jpg" /></a> &#8220;But I don&#8217;t relate to the joblessness. I rather feel I was always at the right place at the right time,&#8221; said Ayushmann Khurrana.
<p>Actor Ayushmann Khurrana, who is playing a bankrupt lover in rom-com &#8216;<a title="Movie Review Bewakoofiyaan: Sonam Kapoor is as flat as the film" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/movie-review-bewakoofiyaan-sonam-kapoor-is-as-flat-as-the-film/">Bewakoofiyaan</a>&#8216;, said the film took him to his earlier days when he had only Rs 10,000 as savings for marriage.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old &#8216;Vicky Donor&#8217; star said he eventually overcame his financial troubles by finding fame in showbiz.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not struggled much in my career as my character (Mohit Chadhdha) in the film does. I did face rejections but was never bogged down. I only relate to the financial insecurity part of my character. I remember when I married Tahira, I only had Rs 10,000 in my account.  But I don&#8217;t relate to the joblessness. I rather feel I was always at the right place at the right time,&#8221; said <a title="A coffee date with ‘Bewakoofiyaan’ couple Sonam, Ayushmann" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/a-coffee-date-with-bewakoofiyaan-couple-sonam-ayushmann/">Ayushmann Khurrana. </a></p>
<p>The actor married his childhood sweetheart Tahira before entering Bollywood.</p>
<p>&#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217;, also starring Sonam Kapoor and veteran actor Rishi Kapoor in prominent roles, hit theatres today. The love-story is set in the backdrop of recession.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not nervous but I have always been excited about my every release. I am getting good response because it&#8217;s a quirky and edgy film. It&#8217;s a young film. I think effects of<br />
recession are still there as people continue to get pink slips. There is a lot of unemployment in India due to the recession,&#8221; Ayushmann said.</p>
<p>Asked if Tahira has watched the film yet, the &#8216;Pani Da&#8217; hitmaker said, &#8220;She is in Chandigarh now. I am planning to fly down to Chandigarh by evening and we are going to watch it. But she has read the script.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayushmann, who has teamed up with Sonam for the first time in the film, said he was initially sceptical about the onscreen chemistry with the fashionista.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before starting the shoot, I was sceptical about our onscreen pairing. She is fashion conscious and I am boy-next-door. But after meeting her I realised that she is a<br />
nice girl who is pure at heart. This is how I feel our chemistry rocked onscreen,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ayushmann is currently shooting for his next Yash Raj Films venture &#8216;Dum Laga Ke Haisha&#8217; in Rishikesh and Haridwar. Directed by Maneesh Sharma, the story revoles around the life of a small town couple.</p>
<p>The actor also learnt Marathi for &#8216;Bambai Fairytale&#8217;, where he is playing eminent scientist Shivkar Bapuji Talpade.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009687&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two of the biggest superhero films are set for a showdown at the box office this year with Marvel and Warner Bros releasing &#8216;Captain America 3&#8242; and &#8216;Batman/Superman&#8217; on the same day in May.</p>
<p>Marvel Studios and parent company Disney first declared that they would be releasing a big film on May 6 as they have been releasing first weekend of summer for past decade.</p>
<p>However, Warner Bros announced in January that it would open Batman-Superman on May 6, 2016 as well. The film stars Ben Affleck as Batman and Henry Cavill once again as Superman.</p>
<p>The film was originally slated to release in summer 2015 but the date got pushed by a year.</p>
<p>Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige recently said he had no plans to shift the release date of one of his superhero films on May 6 to avoid a clash.</p>
<p>While Feige declined to give the name of the film, the Hollywood Reporter said it will be &#8216;Captain America 3&#8242;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009653&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Singer-actress Kelly Osbourne undergone her third session of laser treatment in a bid to remove some of the tattoos on her arms.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Fashion Police&#8217; host advised fans to &#8220;think&#8221; before committing to the permanent body art, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;As humans we fill our conscience with cliches to selfishly justify the ridiculous things we do in life&#8230; Such as getting stupid tattoos.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have now undergone my third laser tattoo removal. All day I have found myself saying &#8216;no pain no gain&#8217; or &#8216;pain is beauty!&#8217; However the bigger lesson I have taken away from this horrendously painful experience is THINK BEFORE YOU INK!&#8230;&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The singer had been considering tattoo removal for a long time. In 2010, she had revealed that she regretted the inkings and wanted to get rid of some of her body art.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some still have a special meaning, like the matching ones my brother Jack and I have of each other&#8217;s names, but now I feel like some were a mistake,&#8221; she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009629&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pop star Britney Spears&#8217; younger sister Jamie Lynn has sparked rumours that she might be getting hitched to her fiance James Watson by the end of this month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bewakoofiyaan-review.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009598" alt="bewakoofiyaan-review" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bewakoofiyaan-review.jpg" /></a> Movie Review Bewakoofiyaan: Sonam is one of the few Bollywood denizens who wears her clothes beautifully. But acting is a whole different thing.
<p><strong>Movie Review: </strong>Bewakoofiyaan</p>
<p><strong>Cast: </strong>Ayushmann Khurrana, Sonam Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor</p>
<p><strong>Director: </strong>Nupur Asthana</p>
<p>Mohit is a pink-slipped MBA looking for a job. Myra is his girlfriend with an eye for designer footwear. And ‘Bewakoofiyaan’ is an unfortunate title in search of a film.</p>
<p>This one could also have been called &#8220;How to knit a grim subject like recession in a frothy Yashraj rom com and not go anywhere with it&#8221;. Losing a job can be a bummer. Ambitious airline executive Mohit Chaddha (Ayushmann Khurrana) starts getting shaky in the love department as soon as he goes down in the employment stakes. How will Myra handle it? More importantly, how will her father?</p>
<p>This plot point could have led the film into exploring the tricky terrain of joblessness, gender expectations, and rocky relationships. Done well, it could have been revealing and rewarding: how does a guy feel when his girl gives him a hand-out; how does a girl feel when she has to keep doing it and not let him feel like a loser? But &#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217; spends most of its time trying to showcase a slew of brands, get us to smile at the antics of the father of the bride which are singularly unfunny, and to convince us that its leading lady can helm an entire film.</p>
<p>V K Sehgal (Rishi Kapoor) is an about-to-retire senior Dilli babu with a regulation white Ambi, and the habit of throwing about the names of the &#8216;higher-ups&#8217; he knows. He also treats his daughter Myra (Sonam), all grown up and gainfully employed, like a twit who isn&#8217;t capable of knowing her mind about whom she should marry. The fellow has to prove himself, he thunders, like a heavy-handed &#8216;baap&#8217; from an old style &#8216;ma-pitaji&#8217; film.</p>
<p>If love is indeed all you need, and that is presumably why these two got together in the first place, then why all this blather? Is Myra the shoe-hound and the lover of expensive rock concerts the kind of girl who only wants her boyfriend&#8217;s credit card? Is Mohit an arrogant jerk who has to be taught some hard lessons before he comes to heel? These ideas, and their predictable resolutions, float around confusedly in a meandering story.</p>
<p>Sonam is one of the few Bollywood denizens who wears her clothes beautifully, and doesn’t let them wear her. Her elegantly-assembled outfits are a joy. But acting is a whole different thing. Neither the veteran Kapoor nor the couple- of-films-old Khurrana manage to lift off the screen: they are as flat as the film.</p>

<p>The games &#8212; &#8216;Kochadaiiyaan the Legend; Kingdom Run&#8217; and &#8216;Kochadaiiyaan the legend; Reign of Arrow&#8217; had been developed by Vroovy, a joint venture between digital media company Hungama and game service company &#8212; Gameshashtra, it said.</p>
<p>They would be available across various operating systems including Android, Windows, iOS, also in Direct to Home platforms and in social networking portal Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes gamers to an altered state as the detailing and game play matches the iconic characteristic of Kochadaiiyaan, a character immortalised by Rajinikanth&#8221;, Soundarya said in the statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this new age of digital, we are delighted to be working with India&#8217;s first 3D motion animated film, Kochadaiiyaan , showcasing the most iconic star of Indian cinema,&#8221; she further said in the statement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ayan480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009513" alt="Ayan thinks Katrina is the most stunning girl. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ayan480.jpg" /></a> Ayan thinks Katrina is the most stunning girl.
<p>Director Ayan Mukherji says that Deepika Padukone and Katrina Kaif would be the last two film actresses between whom he would like to be stuck on a deserted island.</p>
<p>Ayan said this in response to a query from filmmaker Karan Johar in the rapid fire round on his popular chat show &#8216;Koffee with Karan&#8217;.</p>
<p>This episode of the talk show will be aired on coming Sunday on Star World, where Ayan would be joined by cousin and actress Kajol Devgn.</p>
<p>Deepika was previously in a relationship with Ayan&#8217;s good actor-friend Ranbir Kapoor while Katrina is rumoured to be his current girlfriend.</p>
<p>During the chat when Karan further quizzed Ayan on these two leading ladies, the young director mostly picked up Katrina in his responses.</p>
<p>To &#8216;An actress you think is sexy&#8217;, Ayan said Katrina.<br />
On who would score highest if Katrina, Kareena and Deepika took an IQ test, Ayan thought Katrina would lead.<br />
On another question &#8212; Deepika, Katrina or Kareena&#8211; the most stunning girl, the answer was Katrina.</p>
<p>Further when Karan asked him &#8211; &#8216;If you were to make biopics on these two people what would you name them&#8217; ? Ayan replied, On Deepika Padukone &#8211; &#8216;The girl with the broken heart&#8217; and on Katrina, &#8216;The Girl who Tried&#8217;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009510&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajol480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009469" alt="Kajol has given several hit films." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajol480.jpg" /></a> Kajol has given several hit films.
<p>Actress Kajol, who has acted in several hit films in company of superstar Shah Rukh Khan, thinks Ranbir Kapoor scores higher than her long-time good friend Aamir Khan in terms of acting capabilities.</p>
<p>In an upcoming episode of popular TV chat show &#8216;Koffee with Karan&#8217;, the host, filmmaker Karan Johar, asks Kajol to rank &#8211; talent and acting ability wise &#8211; Shah Rukh, Salman Khan, Aamir, Ranbir and Hrithik in order of preference.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajolayan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2009491" alt="kajolayan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kajolayan.jpg?w=480&#038;h=360" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>The &#8216;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&#8217; actress was quick to crown Ranbir, the junior-most among them, as No 1, though the two have not yet shared screen space.<br />
&#8220;On the top I would say Ranbir&#8230;I think he is fantastic.&#8221;</p>
<p>On second position Shah Rukh and Aamir are on par with each other&#8230;there is no up or down in that. Then we come to Salman and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>To another question, Kajol said she would like to ask the Bollywood badshah about his frankness in airing his views. &#8220;Why are you so candid all the time? Don&#8217;t you know people like to hear nice&#8230;pretty lies once in a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>From her cousin-actress Rani Mukherji, Kajol wants to know when is the &#8216;Bunty Aur Babli&#8217; star getting married, a query she would pose to producer-director Aditya Chopra too.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kaj_rani.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2009490" alt="kaj_rani" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kaj_rani.jpg?w=480&#038;h=400" width="480" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Reports of Rani-Aditya marriage had been doing the round since quite sometime.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old &#8220;Fanaa&#8221; star yearns to spend more time with actor-husband Ajay Devgn. &#8220;I don&#8217;t get enough time with him. I would really like to take him out for a romantic date.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kajol, who dominated Bollywood in 1990s along with Madhuri Dixit, said she is extremely choosy about doing films.<br />
&#8220;It (the script) has to be good. I don&#8217;t want to work with someone who is not going to bring out the best in me. I don&#8217;t want to work with somebody who is going to depend on me to do the 90 per cent of the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the episode to be aired on March 16 on Star World, the bubbly and outspoken actress will be seen with her director-cousin Ayan Mukherji.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009444&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rapper Lil Wayne is planning to record his &#8216;final solo album&#8217; after which he would only focus on collaborations. The 31-year-old &#8216;Lollipop&#8217; hitmaker upcoming 11th studio album &#8216;Tha Carter V&#8217; is slated to release on May 5, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally plan on this being my final solo album, yes, and it&#8217;s definitely the final Carter album. It&#8217;s the<br />
final Carter album. It&#8217;s stopping at five,&#8221; Wayne said.</p>
<p>The rapper, who also founded the record label Young Money Entertainment in 2005 which signed famous hip-hop stars like Drake and Nicki Minaj, has reassured fans he will still work with his artists and collaborate with other stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;I plan on it being my final solo album. Whenever I have to pitch in for a Young Money album, a &#8216;Like Father, Like Son&#8217; album and something like that and maybe something out the blue.

<p>Comedian and actress Tina Fey has shot down reports which suggested that a sequel to the 2004 teen comedy film &#8216;Mean Girls&#8217; was in the making.</p>
<p>Actress Lindsay Lohan, who starred as the main lead in the movie had revealed last week that there could be a 10th anniversary project in the making, reported Contactmusic. However, the 43-year-old comedienne, who had penned the screenplay of the movie, clarified that no such project was underway.</p>
<p>The former &#8216;Saturday Night Live&#8217; star did not completely rule out any kind of reunion for the cast, but said there definitely isn&#8217;t going to be a follow up to the high-school comedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said to her (Lindsay), &#8216;Oh, I think someone may call us about doing some kind of reunion because next month is the tenth anniversary of the movie.&#8217; And so really&#8230; if everyone&#8217;s around we might try to do some kind of like panel discussion,&#8221; Fey said</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s not like &#8211; it&#8217;s not another movie. At most it would be like a panel discussion with a plate of hot wings,&#8221; she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009452&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Actress Scarlett Johansson says a celebrity must never try to fit back into society after reaching stardom as it changes a person&#8217;s life. The 29-year-old actress said she understands that the lack of privacy comes as a part of her job, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see some young actors and young celebrities today desperately trying to fit back into society, which I totally understand,&#8221; Johansson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But really, once you accept your fate as someone who&#8217;s a recognisable person, who&#8217;s no longer anonymous, I think you have a much easier time fitting in than if you are constantly trying to be &#8216;normal&#8217;,&#8221; she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009445&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Actress-singer Naya Rivera has sparked rumours that she might be making an exit from the hit musical series &#8216;Glee&#8217;. Rivera, 27, who has been a part of &#8216;Glee&#8217; since the very beginning, posted a cryptic tweet hinting that she could be leaving the show, reported E!Online.</p>
<p>&#8220;On set with &#8216;Glee&#8217; shooting a very sweet Brit/Santana scene! Start together end together,&#8221; Rivera posted recently. Lea Michele, who has been promoting the series 100th episode has also been omitted Rivera&#8217;s name while talking about the upcoming New York episodes. &#8221;It&#8217;s New York now&#8230;So it&#8217;s me and Chris Colfer and Darren Criss and Chord Overstreet and Kevin McHale,&#8221; Lea had said earlier.</p>
<p>Apparently Rivera&#8217;s character Santana will be missing for at least two episodes this season, however the current plan is for her to return before the fifth season ends in May.</p>
<p>She will remain a series regular on the show for season five, but the actress will not be in every episode—which has been quite common on &#8216;Glee&#8217;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009419&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage feels that people nowadays make constant effort to appear famous without achieving anything substantial in life.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old actor wanted to work in the movies ever since he saw Hollywood icon James Dean in Eden on the big screen, reported Daily Mirror.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Watching him) It blew my mind. I was like, &#8216;That&#8217;s what I want to do&#8217;. This was before everyone had a thing called a smartphone, and before the advent of being famous for famous&#8217;s sake,&#8221; Cage said. &#8221;I&#8217;m not complaining, but it really feels bad to be famous right now,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The &#8216;Ghost Rider&#8217; star feels that movie reviews these days talk more about the personal lives of the casts than the film. &#8221;Now even the art of film criticism&#8230;the critic who reviewed &#8216;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans&#8217; incorporated how many homes I bought or sold into the review,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has Lindsay Lohan&#8217;s personal life have to do with her performance in &#8216;The Canyons&#8217;? It should always be about the work itself,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009410&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma are busy shooting in Tissa, south Sri Lanka for Anurag Kahsyap&#8217;s upcoming &#8216;Bombay Velvet&#8217;. Interestingly the actors&#8217; rumoured lovers – Katrina Kaif and Virat Kohli reportedly made a special trip to meet them.</p>
<p>On March 9, both Virat Kohli and Katrina Kaif were in Sri Lanka to spend some special time with their respective rumoured flames – Anushka Sharma and Ranbir Kapoor.</p>
<p>According to reports, the two couples got along well and decided to watch a movie together. Virat even took to social networking site Twitter recently to ask for suggestions. “Relaxing day. Feel like watching a movie. Any suggestions?,” posted the cricketer. We wonder where did the rumoured love birds actually go?</p>
<p>However, the trip was short and sweet, Virat Kohli was spotted at the airport on Thursday morning (March 13), on his return from Colombo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, looks like Katrina is going to stick around in Sri Lanka to make up for lost time. The couple has reportedly been going through a rough patch since their trip to New York for New Year.</p>

<p>They were said to have been spending time apart and Ranbir was spotted solo on quite a few occasions. However, it looks like both Ranbir and Katrina are working things out between them.</p>

<p>Bollywood&#8217;s style diva Sonam Kapoor will be seen romancing  Ayushmann Khurrana of &#8216;Vicky Donor&#8217; fame in her new release s &#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217;, which releases today.</p>
<p>&#8216;Bewakoofiyaan&#8217; is another rom-com from the Yash Raj Films banner, where a jobless Ayushmann tries to woo his girlfriend Sonam Kapoor’s father played by Rishi Kapoor. (In Pics: <a title="Nargis Fakhri, Ileana D’Cruz, Sonam Kapoor are hot bikini girls" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/entertainment-gallery/nargis-fakhri-ileana-dcruz-sonam-kapoor-are-hot-bikini-girls/">Bikini girls Sonam, Sunny Leone, Nargis</a>)</p>
<p>The chemistry between Sonam and Ayushmann has become the talk of the town and an added flavour by veteran actor Rishi Kapoor will make ‘Bewakoofiyaan’ an interesting watch.</p>
<p>Sonam Kapoor flaunting her perfect bod in a pink bikini is also being talked about. In fact director Nupur Asthana said she feels disappointed that people are only talking about actress Sonam Kapoor wearing a bikini in ‘Bewakoofiyaan’.</p>
<p>Around two years back, Sonam Kapoor had said that she would never wear a bikini as she does not have a perfect body to carry it off. “It is disappointing that people are talking about it (bikini scene) only…the focus is on that. There are other things too in the promo to look for. I am sure when people will see the film they will understand the relevance of it (bikini scene) and get to see a lovely film,” said Nupur.</p>
<p>“The story was written by Habib Faisal and I just loved the idea of a love story in times of recession. It is something not attempted earlier. We did make certain changes to the storyline to make it more entertaining for the audience,” Nupur said.</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s releases ‘Queen’, ‘Gulaab Gang’ and ‘Total Siyapaa’ have all done moderate business. Bewakoofiyan has a chance to do well at the box office.</p>

<p>Indo-American comedian Aziz Ansari has turned to his fans online for tips on relationship as a part of research for his new book, &#8216;Modern Romantics&#8217;.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old, best known for his role in hit TV series &#8217;Parks and Recreation&#8217;, created a forum on a social networking site Reddit where he posted questions about love, reported Contactmusic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please do not mistake anything you read here as professional advice. Any and all stories posted here may be<br />
used in my book on modern romance,&#8221; he said. The forum includes questions such as &#8220;Does social media/online world make it harder to be a faithful person in a relationship?&#8221; and &#8220;Do you find yourself more susceptible to flirtations than before?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ansari made a lucrative deal with publisher Penguin Press to pen a book about the perils of dating in the modern age and is expecting to get good help out of his research from this online forum.</p>
<p>&#8216;Modern Romance&#8217; is due to hit shelves in September 2015.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009340&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

We ask two directors
<p><em>With the success of the female-centric Highway and Queen, has the tide finally turned in favour of women-oriented films? We ask two directors</em></p>
<p><strong>Aanand L Rai</strong><br />
<strong>Director, Raanjhanaa</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never thought of cinema this way because I have been brought up on Bimay Roy&#8217;s Bandini and Sujata, Guru Dutt’s Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam or for that matter films by Raj Kapoor and how they have treated their female characters. I come from the school of cinema where women have a spine.</p>
<p>I would rather say that we are back on track. In between we were lost, during the decades of the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s. We were trying to figure out what works for the audience and in doing that, there were desperate attempts to make an entertainer. If you look at the history of our cinema, Mother India still represents us at our best and it was about a woman; it did great business at the box office besides being a great film. Another great example is Vijay Anand’s Guide.</p>
<p>It is all part of a cycle and I believe we are not going to lose it again, rather  we would discover new things along  the way.</p>
<p>For me, the audience has evolved and moved quite ahead. They understand new ideas of storytelling with the increase in exposure to world cinema. If Queen and Highway are doing well, that’s a great welcome change. This is encouraging. Even Kahaani proved that a film with a woman protagonist can make money. As a maker, we want the horizon to widen up so that we can accommodate new stories, which will entail new characters. It is going to take  a little more time, but we are on the right path.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also high time for the audience and the makers to understand that there is a remarkable change in women too. The talk of equality between men and women is passe, it’s almost accepted now. The new modern woman is much more than that. And as a storyteller, we have to understand her.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this is the triumph of new stories.</p>
<p><strong>Vikas Bahl</strong><br />
<strong>Producer and Director, Queen</strong></p>
<p>I am not too much of a propagator of women-centric cinema. Rather, I am a propagator of cinema, good cinema. I think these women-centric stories are coming to the fore, because people are watching new and novel stories. If the story works with the audience, any kind of film will work, be it women-centric, children-centric, animal-centric or a typical hero-centric.</p>
<p>As a part of the storytelling industry, we should not limit ourselves as far as the medium is concerned. Thankfully, a newer wave of storytelling is sweeping our industry because a lot of new blood is entering our industry that has not been born and brought up in the fraternity. As a result, new ideas, new characters, new stories, and new interpretations are being told through original and innovative stories.</p>
<p>It hasn’t happened for long because we don’t explore enough. Why can’t we crack something like Gravity or Terminator? Unless and until we work towards them, we won’t be able to claim our bid as a storyteller. Even for women-centric cinema, we have mostly portrayed women as handling sad, depressing issues while totally ignoring the very happy, entertaining side to a woman’s life. As writers, we should look for interesting stories. Even by default, women-oriented cinema would come to the fore because they are exciting stories.</p>
<p>I believe everything has a cycle. The old order of storytelling is giving way to the new, and this new wave is just a part of that. In fact, whenever people ask me whether Queen would have been  possible a decade or two ago, I tell  them that it would have been  absolutely possible. If you give the audience the content that is good, they will lap it up. The end point is people are ready when cinema is ready.</p>

<p>Dear Kangna Ranaut,</p>
<p>What did I ever do to you that you decided to wreck me in this way? Do you have any idea how you’ve casually destroyed me? Okay, so once I termed you “a Pronunciation Nazi’s Delight” but you can’t be holding that against me. Let’s be fair. That ‘Kwaaaaaaterrrrr Vodka’ and ‘Bustaaard’ just could not be overlooked. Surely a few words written in a piece can’t be the reason why you did what you did.</p>
<p>We don’t even really know each other. At best we’ve exchanged a few ‘I spot you- she looks familiar’ vacant social smiles at events. I think once we did have a conversation — but it was very random and very tired — in an airplane when we were both on our way back from Hong Kong/ Macau. To be honest, the conversation didn’t really leave any impression on me and I’m sure it must have been the same for you. But hey, now that I rejig my memory, I was actually quite nice to you.</p>
<p>Remember when you almost dropped the award statuette you had won in Macau? Who was it that rescued it? Ding Dong!! It was I.</p>
<p>So then why so mean, ya Kangna?</p>
<p>Just what business did you have making me meet myself in a darkened theatre? Who gave you the right to display my life and its messes so brilliantly on screen for the entire world to gawk at it, in Queen? You had no right to mock my heartbreak, my issues of low self-esteem, utter confusion, heartbreak, despair, heartbreak, under confidence, depression, awkward dance movements, heartbreak on screen. And then there was the Eiffel Tower moment. And like you met Roxette in Amsterdam, I met Sasha. You had to go ahead and steal that too, right? And hello, did you film me in that nightclub in London where I too tucked my sweater in my handbag? My nani had sent it for me so I had to protect it but what was your excuse? And did you read my personal journal to know how my travels transformed-healed-cleansed-elevated me? How a new place, its landscape, its people (now my friends) and food saved my life? To think you would put all this — such personal stuff — in your movie just to make it a hit? Like. Seriously.</p>
<p>I’m sure everyone has told you how good you were in Queen. Bet you are making the most of your Matthew McConaughey moment. Like he is enjoying his McConaissance, you my dear (whatever!!) girl are in the midst of your McRanaussance. So make the most of it. Just don’t lose yourself again, okay? I’m not so petty that I will hold this against you even though you stole so much of my life’s story for your movie. I’m just venting. Sure you wouldn’t mind it. As every Queen knows it: closure is an important step of healing. Now that we’ve had this conversation, I’m at peace.</p>
<p>And yeah, in case, I wasn’t clear enough: you were very good in Queen. I think we can be friends. Just don’t mind if I send you a legal notice for copyright infringement of my life. And you too director Vikas Bahl.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009138&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shazahn267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008556" alt="Shazahn Padamsee" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shazahn267.jpg" /></a> Shazahn Padamsee
<p>Shazahn Padamsee plays a Buddhist girl in her next film, titled <em>Siddhartha</em>. The film is directed by debutant director Mukul Mishra. Ask Padamsee about it and she says, “I think it was something which was meant to be. My friend Simone had introduced me to the art of chanting and to Buddhism. This has been one of the most positive things in my life, and then this role was offered to me. It’s really uncanny.” According to the actress, she plays a very intense character in the film. “My role has a very good graph, and I know that there’s a lot that will go into it, so we’ve started extensive workshops. You’ll know why I’m saying this when you watch the film. But I think our director Mukul has been very inspiring. He’s intelligent, and has a great understanding of cinema, so that is making it slightly easier. Yet, the character is definitely going to be very demanding and difficult,” says the <em>Dil Toh Baccha Hai Jee</em> actress.<br />
The cast and crew began shooting for the film in Manali earlier this week. “While some parts will be shot in Mumbai, a major portion is being shot there. We’ll be stationed in Manali for almost a month,” says Shazahn. Apart from her role, she’s also excited to share screen space with Mahesh Bhatt who plays her father in the film. “He’s someone whom I deeply admire and respect. It’s going to be like a dream to have him as a co-actor, especially in the role of my father.”</p>

<p>The shooting for <em>Jis Lahore Nahin Dekhya Woh Jamiya Nahin</em>, that was supposed to begin in December 2013 has now been pushed to November 2014. Raj Kumar Santoshi who was all set to explore the sensitive subject of Indo-Pak relations in the film said, “We were to begin shooting the film last December by putting up a set in a Mumbai Studio. But we realised that the setting needed to be more authentic and the film should be shot in real locations. Now my team is scouting locations near Amritsar. Since we cannot shoot during the summer months because of the oppressive heat the shooting will start in November,” said the director. The film-maker has roped in actor Anil Kapoor to play the lead in the film.<br />
Meanwhile Santoshi wants to start working on the action film he had planned with Vidyut Jamwal.<br />
As for making <em>Khakee 2</em>, a sequel to his 2004 <em>Khakee</em> with Amitabh Bachchan, Akshay Kumar, Ajay Devgn, Aishwarya Rai and Tusshar, the director says that he is writing a script which talks about a group of cops on a mission. “It’s a new story and not <em>Khakee 2</em>,” he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Debutant director Syed Ahmad Afzal, designer Leepakshi Ellawadi and the team of Youngistaan talk about the work that went into creating suave and sophisticated outfits to fit the political backdrop of the film<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008352&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jacky267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008355" alt="Jacky Bhagnani" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jacky267.jpg" /></a> Jackky Bhagnani
<p>Think political dramas and the first thing to come to mind will be a typical image of a <em>kurta</em> clad politician with a Gandhi <em>topi</em> on his head. But with the Jackky Bhagnani–Neha Sharma starrer <em>Youngistaan</em>, director Syed Ahmad Afzal is keen on changing this mindset. He is all set to present a debonair politician, who is intelligent, stylish and does not shy away from walking around the town (and even rural parts of India) with his girlfriend.<br />
Since the film is an urban love story with a political backdrop, Afzal had a few meetings with costume designer Leepakshi Ellawadi, where they discussed the characters and conceptualised the looks for Abhimanyu Kaul (Bhagnani) and Anvita (Sharma). “We had to add different nuances to the look of each character. We played around with a lot of Indo–western outfits. Both Leepakshi and I designed Abhimanyu Kaul’s look, keeping in mind the fact that his character changes over a period of time,” mentioned Afzal. When Abhimanyu is living in Japan in the early stage, he will be seen wearing casual, modern outfits like jackets, semi-formal blazers among others. But once he arrives in India, the character goes through a major transition and so the outfits change accordingly. He wears a lot of crisp white Lucknowi <em>kurtas</em>, Nehru jackets, Aligadi <em>sherwanis</em> among others for public gatherings. Ellawadi used several fabrics like cotton, linen, khadi and even blended wool to give a sleek and classy look to his outfits. “The fabrics were mostly sourced from Dubai, while a few were picked from the local vendors in India,” stated Ellawadi. The designer stated that to create the right look, she took inspiration from the outfits worn by young politicians like Sachin Pilot, Milind Deora, Rahul Gandhi among others. She adds, “We wanted to make sure that the clothes complement his body language and added elements like side pockets and wooden buttons to give that extra edge.”</p>
<p><em>Bhagnani has got a tattoo with his girlfriend’s name, Anvita, written on his right hand. It ‘s his way of showing his love for her to the world. It also underlines that he likes to do things his way</em></p>
<p><em>His character Abhimanyu Kaul sports a short crop, which is combed neatly with elnett spray. He is seen sporting a light stubble as well</em></p>
<p><em>Bhagnani will be seen in white cotton kurtas, Nehru jackets in bold colours, </em><em>suits, sweatshirts, Aligadi sherwanis among others</em></p>
<p><em>Instead of opting for the usual salwars or churidars, Bhagnani will be seen wearing denims and cotton harem pants with kurtas and sherwanis</em></p>
<p><em>Unlike those who prefer wearing chappals with kurtas, Bhagnani will be sporting lace up shoes and moccassins to add a formal touch</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Formal outings</strong></p>
<p>Besides plain <em>kurtas</em>  and <em>sherwanis</em>, Bhagnani’s character  will also be seen wearing sophisticated suits  and tuxedos while he is shown to be in India.  “As  a  young minister, one  will see him wearing well fitted suits in solid colors, aviators and formal leather shoes for important meetings,” adds Afzal.  Instead of black, Lipakshi has opted for a dark colour palette like navy blues, maroons, steel greys among others, which the  director felt would add a negative impact to the outfit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Changing looks</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Late Farooque Shaikh</strong></em></p>
<p>One of the most important characters in the film is that of late actor Farooque Shaikh, who plays Bhagnani’s political advisor, Akbar Ahmad. The actor is seen in formal outfits, with the use of light coloured well-fitted full sleeve shirts, half sleeve sweaters and trousers. Most of his sweaters’ colour were in sync with the shirts worn by him.</p>
<p><em><strong>Neha Sharma</strong></em></p>
<p>Anvita’s fashion sense is similar to my personal fashion statement,” says Neha Sharma about the character that she plays in the film. The glamour has been toned down to give her the girl-next-door effect. It’s done that way so that the audience can identify with her. She likes teaming up a <em>kurta</em> with jeans or colourful <em>churidars</em> or even opts for Anarkali suits. There are no flirty gowns or loud make-up. Sharma believes that it is a refreshing change from the glam outfits that she sported in other films.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kayoze Irani</strong></em></p>
<p>Kayoze Irani, who plays a game developer named Sampath in the film, will be seen in smart and stylish suits, shirts, jackets among others; it’s a far cry from his look in his last film —<em> Student Of The Year</em>. The actor confessed that he will be sporting thick black spectacle frames in the film.</p>

<p>Although it is a known fact that the film has a hip, urban vibe to it, it is interesting how director Nupur Asthana roped in artist Raghu Dixit to compose the songs of <em>Bewakoofiyaan</em>. And we must say, that sure was a good decision. The contemporary soundtrack makes for a good hear, especially since the metropolitan working individuals can relate to most of the lyrics that go with the song. The album opens with a high on energy club number, <em>Gulcharrey</em>. Sung brilliantly by Benny Dayal, with decent support from Aditi Singh Sharma, the track maintains a good pace and is pretty catchy.<br />
The peppy <em>Khamakhaan</em> follows next, where Neeti Mohan is joined by the lead actor, Ayushmann Khurrana himself. The use of instruments like the flute and guitar are perfect, while the singers add a lovable charm to the track. This is the only song penned by Habib Faisal and he has done a good job. The modern contemporary title track of the film, <em>Bewakoofiyaan</em>, follows next, which is definitely one of the highlights of the album. It is the uniqueness of this song that is the stand out element. The use of drums and a steady guitar provided some foot &#8211; tapping beats. Dixit belts out this number with perfection, as he touches some high notes with great ease.<br />
Shreya Ghoshal and Mohit Chauhan&#8217;s magical combination fails to impress in <em>Rumaani Sa</em>. Although the use of guitar is beautiful and the hookline is hummable, this ode to love does not strike a chord. Chauhan&#8217;s voice does not go well with the track. Vishal Dadlani comes in as the singer for <em>Aye Jigida</em>, a situational track with incredible instrumentation. Dadlani&#8217;s voice packs the perfect punch. Khurrana&#8217;s single for YRF, <em>O Heeriye</em>, is also added to the album as a bonus track. Written, composed and crooned by Khurrana, it&#8217;s a decent song with a heavy dose of Punjabi lyrics, which may fail to connect if you are not a fan of folk fusion tracks like these. But otherwise, it does make for a good hear.<br />
Overall, the <em>Bewakoofiyaan</em> album does come as a refreshing change from the typical tunes churned out these days. Hear it and you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dishkiyaoon/ High on beats</strong></p>
<p><em>Tu mere type ka nahi hai</em></p>
<p>Adding a dance number that you know will be played during the end credits has become the norm these days. The latest to join this bandwagon is a high on energy, yet very <em>desi Tu mere type ka nahi hai</em> from <em>Dishkiyaoon</em>. It won&#8217;t be wrong to say that this composition by White Noise Productions has a nice ring to it, especially because of the hookline, which keeps playing several times. The retro feel of the opening lines give a good build up to the song and the song maintains a decent pace throughout. Both Kunal and Gayatri Ganjawala have done justice to the number, though we wish the vocals would have got a better boost, since some words tend to get lost in the middle of the high voltage beats. Mayur Puri&#8217;s words are extremely quirky with words like &#8216;<em>Tujh mein koi scope nahi hai, tera koi hope nahi hai</em>&#8216;, thus giving dominance to the use of Hinglish. It does make for a good dance number, but definitely not something that will top the charts.</p>

<p>Singer Suresh Wadkar&#8217;s alma mater, Ajivasan Sangeet Niketan, celebrated the 14th edition of Vasantotsav at Ajivasan hall last week. At the event, Wadkar was joined by several music maestros, including Ustad Zakir Hussain, Sitara Devi, Padma Shri U. Srinivas, Hariharan among others. The highlight of the event was the felicitation ceremony of Hindustani classical music legend, Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan. Commenting on the occasion, Wadkar stated that they regret the fact that it took time for them to honour a legend like Khan. &#8220;We think that we have been late in presenting this award to Khansahab. He is among the most deserving gurus in India. His contribution to Indian classical music by way of his own performances as well as the students trained and groomed by him is tremendous,&#8221; stated Wadkar, who added that Vasantotsav is organised every where as they aim to preserve and nurture the pristine Hindustani classical music genre, which is the country&#8217;s legacy.<br />
While talking about the annual event, Wadkar stated that it almost takes a year long planning to decide the awardees list and execute everything. The schedule is always adjusted according to Hussain&#8217;s availability. He adds, &#8220;We are truly honoured and indebted to him for treating Vasantotsav as his own family event and making himself available each year amidst his tight schedule.&#8221; According to the yearly ritual, the evening ended with a melodious performance given by Hussain, Srinavas and Khan. They enthralled the audience with their jugalbandi.<br />
Meanwhile, Wadkar has plans to expand Ajivasan&#8217;s reach to music lovers and students across the globe. &#8220;We do have expansion plans in the near future. Currently, we have our branches in New Jersey and Dubai. Plans for expansion in UK and Australia are currently in the pipeline. But, our first priority would be to open some more branches within Mumbai, as the requests are overwhelming.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Honey Singh to release four singles this year</strong></p>
<p>A hit on the Bollywood dance number scene, rapper and composer Yo Yo Honey Singh has major projects lined up this year. But his main goal is to pay more attention on his singles, which according to the singer has his signature stamp. “I don’t get to experiment too much with Bollywood music. So, I want to focus on my singles as well, four of which will be released this year. I will be flying to Cape Town to do some  recce and after that, we will shoot the music videos there,” stated Singh. He further added that he plans to stay in Cape Town for a month and finish all the work, so that he can focus on other projects after coming back to India.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[A majestic set up in a resort near Raigad was turned into a blend of eerie and elegance, as Big B and Yo Yo Honey Singh shook a leg on Party with the Bhoothnath<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007429&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bhoothnath2671.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007431" alt="Amitabh Bachchan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bhoothnath2671.jpg" /></a> Amitabh Bachchan
<p>A modern day <em>Haveli</em> resort, located in Raigad district, was buzzing with activities for two days. A masquerade party set up was created inside the <em>Haveli</em> for a two day schedule of a special dance sequence for <em>Bhoothnath Returns</em>. Amitabh Bachchan’s arrival, with Yo Yo Honey Singh&#8217;s track hookline &#8216;<em>Come party with the Bhootnath, relax man</em>&#8216; playing in the background, made heads turn. So much, that everyone around stopped work to catch a glimpse of the superstar, learning a move or two in between shots. Later, he got busy filming a sequence inside an artificial tunnel outside the palace. “It’s wonderful how we have managed to do a good job in two days. Before performing with Honey Singh, I was very nervous. <em>Kya kya karte hain woh. Mujhe sab mushkil lagta hain</em>. Matching steps with these youngsters ain’t easy. He is an incredible performer and I enjoyed dancing with him. <em>Main toh nritya aache se karne ki koshish kar raha hoon bas</em>,” he stated.</p>
<p><strong>Shaking a leg</strong></p>
<p>Apart from a bevy of Indian and international dancers, dressed in dazzling evening gowns and tuxedos, there were a large group of kids dressed up in funky outfits, who formed a part of the background in different portions. Choreographer duo Anil and Karan were busy forming several chunks of hip – hop routines blended with easy going hook steps. Singh rehearsed his steps, some of which included self choreographed moves, in one corner. “Performing alongside Mr.Bachchan is a blessing. My dad is a <em>khatarnaak</em> fan of him and I have had the time of my life during these two days,” stated Singh. The track has been composed, penned and sung by him and it aims at connecting with all age groups, while maintaining the feel of a party anthem. Singh adds, “There is a touch of Yo Yo&#8217;s charm for sure, but it reflects the theme of <em>Bhoothnath</em> more.”</p>
<p><strong>Bhoothnath’s abode</strong></p>
<p>Co &#8211; producer Bhushan Kumar’s description of the set was that of a spooky yet elegant <em>bhoot bangla</em>. Members of the unit informed that the interiors of the palace were specially painted, well in advance, as the walls required a shiny, gold hue. Bold maroon curtains with gold borders added a royal touch to the <em>jharokhas</em>, which were a part of the palace. “We didn&#8217;t want to create a music video just for the need of it. The idea was to let the theme of the film stand out in the dance number. We wanted a grand palace which can look majestic yet ghostly, so this resort fitted the bill. As for the presence of Mr. Bachchan and Honey Singh, it is certainly a winning combination for us and the film,” stated Kumar. The final cut of the song will include lots of special effects, portions of which were shot on chroma, with a green background.</p>
<p><strong>Amitabh Bachchan adds some ghostly swag while shooting for the song</strong></p>
<p>An urban hip-hop street outfit is incomplete without a chunky, gold link neckpiece. The chain was thick and heavy.</p>
<p>According to Bachchan, ghosts are not very fashionable. Maybe that’s why he was given a pair of  contrast six pocket cargo pants in this sequence.</p>
<p>Big B shows his funky side as a ghost with these red aviators. The choice of colour was  to give the outfit a more stronger feel.</p>
<p>A military green jacket with diamante work was used for one portion, while an uber cool grey track suit with dollar prints was used in another.</p>
<p>The actor was seen sporting a pair of blingy, sequinned gold moccassins, which added some extra bling to the outfit.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Reflecting the multi-layered change in regional cinema, a growing number of Marathi films now have Hindi and English titles<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007869&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/time267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007908" alt="Ketaki Mategaonkar and Prathamesh Parab in Time Pass" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/time267.jpg" /></a> Ketaki Mategaonkar and Prathamesh Parab in Time Pass
<p>It is a momentous phase for Marathi cinema. Starting last year, film-makers have been courageously testing new waters — experimenting with themes, styles and techniques — and even ruling it with aplomb. A closer look also shows them spreading their wings across the language barrier, and picking titles in Hindi and English over traditionally-used Marathi names.<br />
So we have films such as Gajendra Ahire’s <em>Touring Talkies</em>, Amol Palekar and Sandhya Gokhale’s <em>We are on – Houn Jau Dya</em>, Vijay Rane’s <em>Power</em>, Sameer Vidwans’<em> Time Please</em>, Ratnakar Matkari’s <em>Investment</em> and Swapnil Jaykar’s <em>Tendulkar Out</em>. January has added two more names to the list — <em>Timepass</em> and <em>A Rainy Day</em>. The reasons offered are many, from gaining a wider audience, to the common parlance becoming a mix of various languages, to even the urban nature of these films.<br />
Sanjay Jadhav, director of <em>Duniyadaari</em>, says that the bottom line is that every film-maker wants to make a good film. “We don’t start with thinking that we want to make a film that has a good title. Of course, the title is very important because it is the first thing that attracts the audience, so we pick what is relevant,” he says.<br />
Explaining his own thought process, Jadhav, whose upcoming film is called <em>Pyar Wali Love Story</em>, says, “The youth does not think only in the vernacular. The makers’ thought process too is not exclusively Marathi anymore; we are acquainted with Hollywood and Bollywood and think similarly. I also want my audience to connect with my film. If I were to name it<em> Pyar Wali Prem Kahani</em>, the young audience would lose interest.”<br />
Vidwans, who has directed <em>Time Please</em>, says that the diminishing gap between urban and rural classes has changed the canvas of films and therefore, the kind of names too. “Earlier, most films had rural settings and stories. These days, Marathi films tell urban stories revolving around urban characters,” says Vidwans, adding that it was a conscious decision to call his film<em> Time Please</em> because it talks about an urban couple taking some time off when their relationship goes through a rough patch.<br />
But director Rajendra Talak, whose film<em> A Rainy Day</em> took on its own name because it was entirely shot in the rain, differs in his opinion. “A film’s content is more important than its title. People will not come to watch a film just because your film has an English or Hindi title,” he says.<br />
Whatever be the motivations, film critic and Executive President of the Federation of Film Society of India’s Maharashtra Chapter, Virendra Chitrav, says it is a good trend. “Over the last decade, Marathi cinema has taken on a global tone; this is its golden era. Now, there is a wider audience and evidently, even non-Marathi filmgoers are watching Marathi films. In view of all the changes, it is only right for the titles to take on an universal touch.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Adah Sharma in Puri Jagannath’s next with Mahesh Babu</strong></p>
<p>Adah Sharma’s Telugu film<em> Heart Attack</em> has been received very well in the South since its release in January. In fact the film, also starring Nithin, is running in its fifth week. Now Sharma is all set to do another Telugu film. Apparently she has been finalised for Puri Jagannath’s next film which will have Mahesh Babu as her leading man. The actress, it is heard, is also in talks for a Tamil film.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gopinath Munde launches Marathi film</strong></p>
<p>Seen at the launch of RDX Cinema Company’s Marathi film<em> Ticha Umbartha</em> are producer-action master Ravi Dewan, chief guest Gopinath Munde and Suniel Shetty in Mumbai. Directed by Pradeep Ghonsikar and written by Jayant Pawar, the film stars Chinmay Mandlekar, Tejaswini Pandit, Jyoti Chandekar, Suyash Tilak and Harsha Khandeparkar</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/anil267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007349" alt="Anil Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/anil267.jpg" /></a> Anil Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor
<p>Mention Anil Kapoor’s name, and daughter Sonam Kapoor can’t help but break into a huge smile. What’s even more endearing is when she talks about him. “I think he’s the best father I could have ever asked for. The way he has brought us up, he’s given us all the freedom to do everything that we want to. He’s just so cool. He’s amazing and likes everyone he meets. He’s always been so liberal and open-minded. I truly feel blessed to have a father like him.”<br />
We’re sure papa Kapoor also shares similar thoughts about his famous daughter!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nobody like  Kareena!</strong></p>
<p>Alia Bhatt has been compared to Kareena Kapoor Khan time and again. But these comparisons don’t really bother her. In fact, she believes there’s only one Kareena Kapoor. “I don’t think it’s true when people think I’m like her. I don’t think so at all. I strongly believe that there can be only one Kareena Kapoor and I’m a big fan of her!” Isn’t that being quite modest?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Candy floss</strong></p>
<p>That Randeep Hooda is fond of horses is well known, but it seems the actor also adores dogs. When he saw an abandoned pariah pup six years ago, he simply adopted her and named her Candy. In time he became so fond of the dog that he refuses to tie her or lock her up in a room when he has guests who are scared of dogs. “This is Candy’s house, so she is free to go and sit anywhere. The guests just have to deal with it,” is what he says.</p>

<p>The audience that tuned in to watch ABC’s live telecast of the Oscars hosted by Ellen DeGeneres on Sunday was the show’s highest in 14 years after ratings were upwardly revised.<br />
Nielsen ratings data on Tuesday showed that the audience for the telecast was 43.7 million, versus the 43 million reported on Monday, the highest since 2000 and 8 per cent higher than last year. The Oscars attract the biggest non-sports audience in the United States. Walt Disney Co’s ABC network has signed on to broadcast the film industry’s highest honours through 2020.<br />
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences kept producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron for the second straight year, but swapped out Seth MacFarlane as host after his provocative humor prompted harsh criticism. Comic and daytime talk show host DeGeneres, who hosted in 2007 and is only the second woman to emcee Hollywood’s biggest night on her own, brought an easy breezy style to the Dolby Theatre, though she did poke the powerful people in the room.<br />
The best news for ABC might have been the numbers in the more youthful segments, considering the challenges of bringing a younger audience to an old-school awards show. The audience in the 18-49 age rose one per cent from 2013 to a four-year high, but the 18-34 audience was 3 per cent higher and teen viewers 12-17 were up 13 per cent from last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ellen’s Oscar ‘selfie’ crashes Twitter, breaks record</strong></p>
<p>Is this the year the ‘selfie’ stole the Oscars? A self-portrait of host Ellen DeGeneres and stars including Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper taken during Hollywood’s annual Academy Awards ceremony quickly became the most shared photo ever on Twitter.<br />
“We got an email from Twitter and we crashed and broke Twitter. We have made history,” DeGeneres said shortly after access to the social media site was disrupted due to sharing of her star-studded picture. Kevin Spacey, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and new Oscar winner Lupita Nyong’o, also crowded into the picture, which was snapped by Cooper after DeGeneres mingled with stars seated in the audience. “I’ve never tweeted before!” Streep, a three-time Oscar winner, gushed after Cooper snapped the photo with a mobile device.<br />
DeGeneres shared the selfie via her Twitter feed here It was shared, or retweeted, more than 2 million times in some two hours during the broadcast of the 86th annual Academy Awards.<br />
The photo surpassed the record set by U.S. President Barack Obama’s ‘Four More Years’ re-election victory shot. The picture of Obama hugging first lady Michelle Obama on election night in 2012 has been retweeted more than 780,000 times. Other widely shared photos from Sunday’s Oscars included a DeGeneres selfie with Liza Minnelli, taken after the host made a biting comment about the appearance of the veteran actress and Broadway star.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nonstop2671.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007780" alt="Liam Neeson" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nonstop2671.jpg" /></a> Liam Neeson
<p>Non-Stop, a thriller starring Liam Neeson as a U.S. air marshal trying to stop a string of murders on an international flight, collected $30 million in ticket sales to soar into the lead at the domestic box-office.<br />
It swept the week’s other new film, Son of God, into second place with $26.5 million in sales during a strong box-office weekend which coincided with Hollywood’s biggest night, the annual Oscars.<br />
Son of God is based on The Bible, a television mini-series produced by Survivor producer Mark Burnett and his wife, Roma Downey.<br />
The Lego Movie, which led the box-office for three consecutive weeks, was third in ticket sales at U.S. and Canadian theatres with $21 million, according to studio estimates compiled by tracking firm Rentrak. Non-Stop is the latest film to feature Neeson in an action role, following his hit thriller Taken 2 in 2012.<br />
The voice of the 61-year-old Irish former amateur boxing champion is also featured in the animated Lego Movie, which ‘stars’ characters based on the colourful plastic toy blocks.<br />
That has racked up nearly $210 million at the boxoffice since its February 7 release.<br />
Universal released Non-Stop during the same part of the year as Neeson’s 2009 hit Taken, which opened in late January, and the move paid off handsomely as the film far surpassed studio projections for a total of about $19-21 million.<br />
“This was a great result for the weekend,” said Nikki Rocco, president for domestic distribution at Universal Pictures, which released Non-Stop.<br />
“Liam has become a bonafide star, but we saw a little more diffuse audience than we’ve seen for his previous films.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beating forecasts</strong></p>
<p>She said more than one-third of ticket buyers were under 25, and prospects for the film looked strong in coming weeks as his films tended to have box office “longevity”. Son of God, which stars Portuguese actor and former model Diogo Morgado as Jesus Christ, features scenes not used in the History Channel mini-series that was nominated for three Emmy nominations.<br />
The movie received generally poor reviews, getting “rotten” reviews from 37 of 50 critics tallied on the site Rotten Tomatoes, although 82 per cent of audience members liked it. “It’s a phenomenal opening,” said Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution for Fox, which distributed the movie. He said forecasting the fortunes for the religious-themed movie “defied all conventional wisdom”. “I thought if we were in the $12 million to $15 million range we’d be in great shape,” he said.<br />
“But I’m not at all surprised it did more than that.” The Lego Movie, which also features the voices of Will Ferrell, Will Arnett and Morgan Freeman, was the fourth film since October to lead the box-office over three straight weekends. It followed on the heels of Gravity in October and The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug in December, according to Box Office Mojo. Ride Along also led the box-office for three consecutive weekends in January.<br />
Rounding out the top five, the George Clooney World War Two-era film The Monuments Men took in $5 million, while 3 Days to Kill, starring Kevin Costner as an over-the-hill international spy, was fifth with $4.9 million in ticket sales.<br />
Warner Brothers, a unit of Time Warner, released the film The Lego Movie. Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast&#8217;s NBC Universal division, distributed Non-Stop. Son of God was released by Fox, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox. Relativity distributed 3 Days to Kill. The Monuments Men was released by Sony&#8217;s Columbia Pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Viacom18 Motion Pictures to release Darren Aronofsky’s magnum opus Noah in India</strong></p>
<p>Fascinated by the compelling story about Noah since a very young age, director Darren Aronofsky is all set to present his take on the larger-than-life story of courage, sacrifice and hope, titled Noah. Paramount Pictures recently released the first pulse-racing trailer of the film, which has attracted amazing response from the audience across the globe.<br />
The film boasts of a stellar cast, comprising of Academy Award winners Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly as Noah and his wife, Naameh, respectively. It also features Oscar Award winner Anthony Hopkins and the Harry Potter actress, Emma Watson. The director, Darren Aronofsky, who has given the world remarkable award winning films like Pi, Black Swan and The Wrestler, had been working on the screenplay of the epic since 2004.<br />
The adventure packed film has spectacular VFX with mass scale production. The film features Noah having visions of an apocalyptic deluge, taking measures to protect his family and saving the innocent animals from the coming flood. In a world ravaged by human sin, Noah is given a divine mission: to build an Ark to save God&#8217;s creation from the devastating flood. Noah and his family build a massive ark, large enough to give shelter to two of every type of animal, who, when the time is right, appear at the foot of the great ship to board. What follows is a battle for Noah&#8217;s Ark, so that the storm can be survived.<br />
With the film due for a worldwide release next month, Black Swan film-maker Aronofsky has certainly left the audience looking forward to the grand cinematic experience. Presented by Paramount Pictures, the film is slated for release on 28th March by Viacom18 Motion Pictures in India.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/oscars267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007731" alt="A man sets a digital display above the red carpet during preparations for the 86th Academy Awards in Hollywood, California February 26, 2014." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/oscars267.jpg" /></a> A man sets a digital display above the red carpet during preparations for the 86th Academy Awards in Hollywood, California February 26, 2014.
<p>Three days before the Oscars, the Los Angeles film czar and a think tank delivered some damning news to Tinseltown: Hollywood’s status as the home of American film and television production is threatened because places like New York are offering better financial incentives to studios.<br />
The study of employment and production data released recently by the Milken Institute, an economic think tank, says California has lost tens of thousands of entertainment jobs to New York and other U.S. states in the past decade, and film and television productions with them.<br />
While it may be one of the best years for high-quality film in recent memory, with nine strong films nominated for the best picture Oscar, just one of the nine was filmed in California. Ken Ziffren, a veteran California attorney recently appointed as Hollywood’s film czar by the mayor of Los Angeles, said the report showed Hollywood was in a ‘bad spiral’, both in terms of jobs and productions leaving California. Ziffren repeated a call for an expanded California film and tax credit, as did the Milken report — an issue that is politically controversial.<br />
Proponents say it is vital to keep middle-class jobs and film production in the state. Opponents say wealthy Hollywood studios don’t need another tax break and question whether further financial incentives will produce a net gain in jobs and revenue.<br />
The report by the Milken Institute, headquartered in Santa Monica, California, but with a national and international perspective, said California lost 16,137 film and TV industry jobs between 2004 and 2012, based on U.S. Labor Department statistics. During the same period, the report said, New York state gained 10,675 entertainment jobs. “California is losing film and television productions to New York and other states,” the report said. “The data shows that other states are being more effective in using their incentives to bring in new productions and create jobs.”<br />
The report said the loss of jobs was particularly troublesome because it represented the exodus of middle-class wage earners with high pay, an average of $98,500 per person, and businesses that thrive on the movie industry such as caterers.<br />
California has a tax-credit programme, but essentially only productions with budgets of $75 million or less qualify for the rebate of 20 per cent to 25 per cent. Proponents of legislation under consideration in California want the incentives to cover big-budget movies, as well as television pilots and dramas.<br />
New York offers tax credits of between 30 per cent and 35 per cent and allocates more money —$420 million annually — out of its budget to give incentives to film and television production there, roughly four times what is awarded in California. Other states such as Louisiana, Texas and New Mexico have also drawn jobs and production from California in recent years through tax credits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Not made in Mexico</strong></p>
<p>Cuaron’s fellow expatriates Del Toro and Inarritu, to whom he paid tribute in his Oscar acceptance speech, have also both been backed by big U.S. studios.<br />
The fact is not lost on those still working in Mexico. “These three do not make Mexican film. They do not make their film in the Mexican system and their themes do not result from living here in the society where the rest of us live,” said Julian Hernandez, whose brooding, homoerotic films have won international awards and foreign distribution, but which have seen little commercial success in conservative Mexico.<br />
“This makes us all happy, to see a Mexican recognised,” Hernandez said. “But this doesn’t mean that it will get any better for Mexican cinema.” Since the ‘three amigos’ — Cuaron, Del Toro and Inarritu — rose to international fame, another generation of film-makers has matured and won a string of international awards.<br />
But the new crop have struggled to achieve the same level of box-office success and support from Hollywood. Mexico’s art-scene directors have won honours at the world’s top festivals in Cannes, Berlin and Venice, with gritty, personal visions that mix elements of fiction and documentary.<br />
Mexican drama Despues de Lucia, by writer-director Michel Franco, took the top prize in Cannes Film Festival’s Un Certain Regard category in 2012. Last month, Alonso Ruizpalacios won Berlin’s best first feature award with his debut Gueros.<br />
Meanwhile, other directors like Eugenio Polgovsky and Juan Carlos Rulfo have pushed the boundaries of documentaries.<br />
“The challenge is getting more of these movies actually distributed and released,” said Robert Koehler, a Los Angeles-based film critic with publication Cinema Scope, who argued that filmmakers should look at Gravity “as the Trojan horse for importing Mexican cinema into the United States.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shabbir267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007519" alt="Shabbir Ahluwalia" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shabbir267.jpg" /></a> Shabbir Ahluwalia
<p>Ekta Kapoor’s new show <em>Kumkum Bhagya</em>, a passionate love story with a middle-class backdrop is likely to go on air in April. It will have Shabbir Ahluwalia back on television after a long time, playing a rockstar. Talking about his rockstar look, Ahluwalia says, “I had to imbibe the various nuances of a rockstar, how he walks and talks. Everyone has a different image of a rockstar, and they are normally perceived as wearing long hair and leading unconventional lifestyle. My character Akki, though he’s crazy, will endear himself to the family audience. The creative team and the designers have worked on my look. Apart from music, my character also loves the adulation, fame, and attention, and that’s what also reflects in the look.”<br />
Meanwhile, actress Sriti Jha, who was last seen as Ganga in <em>Balika Vadhu</em>, is the quintessential good girl. “My character, Pragya is also very independent and individualistic. It’s always interesting to do something different like this. To portray the fact, that I am a simple, serious girl and a bookworm, I will be wearing a <em>chashma</em> and be seen wearing only plain shades of <em>salwar-kameez</em> always.”<br />
Actress Mrunal Thakur plays a character called Bulbul, who is Pragya’s sister. “Bulbul is a happy-go-lucky girl, and you can use the word ‘<em>phataka</em>’ for her. She wants to be a singer and is a die-hard romantic, who always dreams about this rockstar Akki. The show is made realistically, complete with all the drama and <em>masala</em> that will lure the viewers,” shares Thakur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>More twists in Veera after Ranvijay-Gunjan marriage </strong></p>
<p>Ranvijay (played by Shivin Narang) and Gunjan (played Farnaz Shetty) have finally tied the knot under unavoidable circumstances in <em>Ek Veer Ki Ardaas&#8230;Veera</em>. Gunjan, who has shades of grey, will turn more negative post the marriage. “The circumstances in which the marriage has taken place is interesting, it will have Gunjan taking over the reins. The twist in the tale takes on dangerous tones as Gunjan turns vamp after marriage and will harass Ranvijay’s family. She will become manipulative and try to destroy the bond between Ranvijay’s family, but hopefully she won’t succeed,” reveals Narang. When asked if his character Ranvijay will continue to remain unaffected by the capricious dealings of his wife, Narang laughs,“He has always been sweet. He’s like the modern-day Ram. Too perfect! So he’ll obviously remain the same.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitabhbachchan.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004548" alt="Amitabh Bachchan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitabhbachchan.jpg" /></a> Amitabh Bachchan has two projects lined up.
<p>Amitabh Bachchan has been juggling quite a few projects this year. While he is busy promoting his first release of 2014, <em>Bhoothnath Returns</em>, he has also started shooting for R. Balki’s untitled directorial venture with Dhanush. Soon after that, the veteran actor will start work on Shoojit Sircar’s next titled<em> Piku</em>.</p>
<p>“I have been busy with quite a few things. There are a few shots left for <em>Bhoothnath Returns</em> and then, there is Balki’s film which I am already working on. Once I am done with these commitments, I will then start work on <em>Piku</em>, which will be directed by Shoojit,” stated Bachchan, who added that the latter is a quirky film. When contacted, producer Ronnie Lahiri confirmed that <em>Piku</em> is a slice-of-life film, with a quirky take on things.</p>
<p>“The quirky elements in the film will make you smile. <em>Piku</em> will have three main characters and the lead cast includes Amitabh Bachchan, Irrfan and a female protagonist, who is yet to be finalised. It is not Deepika Padukone, as reported.” Lahiri further added that the film explores the father and daughter relationship, with a quirky twist. Bachchan will be seen playing the father, while Irrfan is a principal character. Although, the film will take off by</p>
<p>May end or first week of June, Bachchan has confirmed that he will start shooting for the film only in August. <em>Piku</em> will be set in Delhi and Kolkata.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008564&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">After producing films like <em>Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, 1&amp; II, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster</em> and <em>Shahid</em>, Sunil Bohra, is testing new waters. For his next venture, besides producing and distributing the film, he shall also be seen in the capacity of a story-screenplay-dialogue writer and director. The yet-to-be titled film has TV actor Pavan Shankar playing the role of guy from Benaras who has been staying in Mumbai for 16 years and wishes to meet Dawood Ibrahim.<br />
</span>“In a couple of days, casting director Mukesh Chabbra will finalise the actor to play the character of Dawood Ibrahim. Since the film revolves around these two people, there is no other cast except for a few small actors who will participate in the shoot for a day or two,” said Bohra. The film is a hardcore comedy and will be made on a budget of Rs.1.5 crore, but the marketing budget will exceed Rs.7-8 crore, he says. The 95-minute film will be shot in sync sound and does not have any song or dance numbers.<br />
Bohra says that he decided to make a film on Dawood, as the common man is curious to know how the don looks like, talks, etc. “I did not do much research, as it is not a gangster film, but a fictional comedy. I have even given the character a different name,” says the producer.<br />
The film will go on the floors in Mumbai in mid-April with a 20-25 days schedule and later there will be a short spell in Karachi. Bohra plans to release the film this year.</p>
<p><strong>Releases in 2014</strong></p>
<p>Besides the film on Dawood Ibrahim, producer Sunil Bohra is busy with <em>Akki Te Vikki Te Nikki</em>, a Hindi film with the backdrop of Bollywood. The shooting for the film started on March 9 with a 20-25 days schedule in Ahmedabad. The next schedule will be for 8-10 days in Mumbai, and has Mathira Mohammed, considered the Sunny Leone of Pakistan playing Nikki, while Zeeshan Kadri of<em> Gangs of Wasseypur</em> fame plays Vikki and Akki is played by debutant Anand.<br />
<em>Ganglords of 1985</em>, directed by Rocky Khanna, and starring Vivaan Shah and Nasseeruddin Shah is almost 50 per cent complete, with the last schedule in April.<br />
Shooting of Howard Rosemeyer’s <em>Jia Aur Jia</em>, with Richa Chaddha and Kalki Koechlin is complete, while Akhilesh Jaiswal-directed <em>Mastram</em> will release on May 1.<br />
Bohra will also be making <em>Malegaon Ka Spiderman</em>. Elaborating he says, “This Spiderman is a fat guy. He is overweight because his older brother Superman did all the good work, while Spiderman sat at home gorging on food, and putting on weight. Even the web he casts is unable to take his weight. The film will release in January next year. A local Malegaon actor is playing the role.”</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Jaipur born singer Pawni Pandey, who earned acclaim for her rendition of Sharm laaj from Gulaab Gang, talks about her favourite music genres, early beginnings and why she wants to focus on film music<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007709&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pawni267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007713" alt="Pawni Pandey" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pawni267.jpg" /></a> Pawni Pandey
<p>Pawni Pandey has come a long way since her first appearance on the reality show, <em>Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Lil Champs</em> in 2006. Although she did not win the coveted prize back then, Pandey never lost hope and continued to pursue her passion for singing. Pandey, now 21 years old, has toured several countries with popular singers and musicians, the most recent one being the six city US tour with Sukhwinder Singh. While tours and recording sessions keep her busy, Pandey never fails to miss her <em>riyaz</em> even today. &#8220;I started singing at a very young age, three to be precise, and I have always believed that music was my calling since childhood. It was only when I turned nine that my family realised that I was very keen on pursuing a full time career in this field. I was born in Jaipur, but my parents decided to shift to Mumbai to give my career a push,&#8221; stated Pandey, who confessed that her family had no idea about the industry in Mumbai, since they didn&#8217;t know anyone. It was<em> Sa Re Ga Ma Pa</em> that pushed her into the limelight, as she became a household name thanks to her popular performances.<br />
Formally trained in Indian classical, with special training in western music from world renowned vocal dynamics trainer Thomas Appell from Los Angeles, Pandey looks upto Lata Mangeshkar and is a big fan of both the Hindustani and western music genres. &#8220;Maybe, that is the reason why my family sent me to California for a formal training in western music, which I think has really helped me,&#8221; she quipped. Pandey&#8217;s first break came with the Punjabi film, <em>Ek Jind Ek Jaan</em> in 2006. Although she was only 13 years old back then, she was roped to sing the number<em> Cheecho cheech ganeriyan</em> with singer Hans Raj Hans. She adds, &#8220;I was definitely excited, since I went on to sing in different languages including Telugu, Oriya, Marathi, Bhojpuri among others. But I was also looking forward to my Bollywood debut. It finally happened when composer Dabboo Malik <em>ji</em> recommended my name for Sohail Khan&#8217;s production venture, <em>Kissan</em>, in 2009. I sang a dance number called <em>Jhoomo re jhoomo</em>.&#8221; After that, there was no looking back, as Pandey received several offers. She went on to sing tracks for films like <em>Bodyguard, Policegiri</em> among others.<br />
Although the singer has worked with quite a few popular composers in the industry, Pandey enjoyed working with director and composer Soumik Sen, for whom she sang the upbeat dance number,<em> Sharm laaj</em>, in the Madhuri Dixit Nene &#8211; Juhi Chawla starrer <em>Gulaab Gang</em>.&#8221;Working with Soumik sir was an absolutely fun-filled experience. He is very friendly and made me feel comfortable. He pays close attention to the details of a song and such things help upcoming artists like me,&#8221; mentioned Pandey. While talking about her experience of working with senior music composers, she expressed her wish to perform with music maestro A.R. Rahman. &#8220;A.R. Rahman is one of my favourites. It is every singer&#8217;s dream to sing for his composition, so even I am waiting for my chance,&#8221; she adds.<br />
Instead of focusing on the trends of albums and singles, Pandey prefers to pay attention to a bunch of projects which are coming up soon. “This year, you will hear my voice in films like<em> Fugly, Majhi &#8211; The Mountain Man, Guns Of Benaras</em> among others. Hopefully, the audience will like my work and continue to support me,” concluded Pandey.</p>

<p><strong>Q. 1 What were your thoughts when you learned that you had to play a politician in Youngistaan?</strong></p>
<p>I thought it would be cool to see a young politician doing some great work. He is a young Prime Minister who never points a finger at any other politician or party which doesn’t happen nowadays. They are all into the blame-game politics. But the politician that I play does not do that. He also enjoys a normal life.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 2 Who do you admire among politicians?</strong></p>
<p>The entire team of <em>Youngistaan</em> has been inspired by a lot of people like Rajiv Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and international politicians like Benazir Bhutto. All these people are not just politicians, they’ve also been leaders. We’ve kind of put together the traits of all these inspiring leaders in the politician that I play in the film.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 3 What did you do to make your role look authentic?</strong></p>
<p>I had to be politically aware, and educated on the subject to make it look real. Getting the body language right was difficult, especially since I had to be a little uncertain in the first half of the film and later look confident as the story progresses. Director Afzal Ahmed Syed, and late Farooque Shaikh were there to guide me through.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 4 Since politics is a serious subject, didn’t you have apprehensions about doing the film?</strong></p>
<p>Primarily, it’s a film, so we’re here to entertain, but we had to also give out a certain message without being preachy. <em>Youngistaan</em> is also a politician’s love story. There were apprehensions, but at the end of it, I’m just happy I could do a role like that.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 5 What’s the message that Youngistaan conveys?</strong></p>
<p>We’re just saying that if you want to bring a change, then be a part of that change. Nobody is going to do anything for you, unless you do it yourself. We throw garbage on the roads, but when we go abroad, we look for a dustbin. Why can’t we do that in our own country?</p>
<p><strong>Q. 6 As someone who’s part of the youth, what kind of change do you want in your country?</strong></p>
<p>I just feel that the biggest thing to do is, stop playing blame-game politics. Honestly, the young generation is not asking for gold, silver or diamonds, so don’t make all those grandiose promises. Stick to what you commit. Make us feel that you’re making an effort. I may be wrong, but as a representative of the youth, I just feel that we miss having a true leader.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 7 Do you think the advent of social media has led to more people voicing their opinions about politics?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has a right to have an opinion, but at the same time, I feel, that one should use his discretion in doing that on social medium. Sometimes people are so biased, that just because they don’t particularly like something, they’re going to bad mouth it. Technology has both, advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 8 You seem to have learnt a lot about politics through this film.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve learnt a lot more about life through this film. Initially when I approached this character, I took him as a representative of the youth. I’ve learned so much through this whole journey.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 9 What were the kind of problems that you became aware while playing a young PM?</strong></p>
<p>We travelled to villages and shot on real locations. One day, while chatting with some villagers during the shoot, they confessed that they didn’t have basic amenities like food or education. Whereas we get angry about our wi-fi connection not being good. I also realised that as a leader, you have to be like a father, who has ten children, and every child has a different requirement that needs to be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Q. 10 Would you describe Youngistaan as a reality check for you?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s what made me grow as a person. I’m thankful I got to play this role. I come from a family where I have been fortunate, so for me to experience and see the other side of life, was only possible because of this character. Now I’m thankful and grateful for the things I have in life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mtv267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007533" alt="Film-makers Rohan Sippy, Anurag Basu and Abhinay Deo at the launch of MTV Films " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mtv267.jpg" /></a> Film-makers Rohan Sippy, Anurag Basu and Abhinay Deo at the launch of MTV Films
<p>While topnotch film-makers directing telefilms is nothing new, directing films for a music channel definitely is. MTV, one of the leading music channels has tied up with Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), to make six films that highlight their brand values and philosophies. Anurag Basu, Anurag Kashyap, Shoojit Sircar, Rohan Sippy, Nikhil Advani and Abhinay Deo are the noted film-makers set to make a 45-minute film each, which will be shown on MTV every month.<br />
Talking about this initiative, Aditya Swamy, EVP and Business Head, MTV India, elaborates, “With so many channels, and brands around, one has to take risks to keep the brand alive. MTV Films is a platform reaches out to young people, but I think what’s exciting for me is that no two films are actually talking about the same aspect of young people’s lives.”<br />
These film-makers will be highlighting the core values of different brands under HUL. For instance, Anurag Basu’s film deals with Sunsilk, Rohan Sippy’s film highlights the philosophies of Tresemme, and the product given to Abhinay Deo is Lakme. Hemant Bakshi, executive director, home and personal care, Hindustan Unilever Ltd explains the process behind shortlisting the products, “Our brands stand for much more than what the functional attributes of the brand may be. So we decided to choose brands, like Sunsilk which have a larger purpose and philosophy that we wanted to talk about for this initiative.”<br />
MTV Films takes off on March 23 with a film by Anurag Basu, which is centred around three girls. Talking of the experience, the <em>Barfi!</em> director says, “When we work on a film, we first write the script and then decide everything else, here, it’s the other way round. First we were given the brand’s philosophy, the script was woven around it. Consumers are intelligent these days, so it’s important to come up with innovative ways to market a product.” When asked to elaborate on his film, he said, “I will not reveal much, but it’s about three girls who run a radio show on their own for a day. I would actually give all the credit to Akarsh Khurana, who is more of a director on this film than I am, and who’s also done the casting for it.”<br />
Abhinay Deo found the project as creatively liberating. “I’ve been doing a lot of television commercials, so I was happy to be offered this because now I get 45 minutes to do something which I did in 45 seconds. We’re still working on the script of my film, because mine is the last one. It will be interesting to see how we take the philosophy of Lakme forward. We’re not really endorsing the brand, but making the viewers connect to the brand emotionally, by encorporating its values in an entertaining film,” he says, adding that this one time the film-makers are not bound by the presssures of stars or the box-office. “It’s pure creativity,” he adds.<br />
Rohan Sippy’s film, which is yet to be shot, signifies glamour and confidence. The director saw the project as an opportunity to bond with other directors. “The project is another way to know how powerful television is, it is an evolution in a fun way. Moreover, since all these brands are women-centric, the films will also have women playing pivotal roles. For me, it’s also been a lot of fun to share some time with Anurag, Abhinay and other directors on this,” says the <em>Bluffmaster</em> director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Samvidhaan</em> to be pitched to other channels </strong></p>
<p><em>Rajya Sabha TV also plans to document few other important chapters of history</em></p>
<p><em>Samvidhaan</em>, the ten episode series based on the making of the Constitution of India and co-produced by Rajya Sabha TV and Shyam Benegal’s Sahyadri Films premiered on Rajya Sabha TV on March 2. The buzz is that the makers of the series now plan to pitch it to other channels for telecast. “<em>Samvindhan</em> may be aired on other channels as well. We’ll be talking to other channels to work on a distribution pattern,” says Gurdeep Singh Sappal, CEO and Executive Editor, Rajya Sabha TV. Moreover, he also revealed that Rajya Sabha TV will now be made a compulsory channel, to reach out to more people.<br />
Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha TV plans to create more content. “We have plans to document many more chapters of history. Because I think it’s our basic mandate to make people aware about it,” adds Sappal.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/varun267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007381" alt="Varun Dhawan and his female fans " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/varun267.jpg" /></a> Varun Dhawan and his female fans
<p>While actors thrive on the attention that they get from their fans, sometimes handling their frenzy can get a bit too much.  At the recent music launch of his film<em> Main Tera Hero</em>, at a suburban mall, Varun Dhawan almost regretted the offer to his fans to come on stage and shake a leg with him. No sooner had he uttered the words, a bevy of young girls stormed the stage. They not only gheraoed him, but in all the commotion, one girl planted a kiss on his cheek, much to the amazement of the actor and those present. Recovering his composure, Dhawan quickly retreated from the scene. Guess, the public display of affection was too hot for the actor to handle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Superhero moments</strong></p>
<p>At an event held recently, Amitabh Bachchan was asked if, as a child, he was ever scared of ghosts or if those around him gave him any mantra to protect him from such problems. The actor laughed it off and quipped, “<em>Bachpan mein hum aisi baatein sunte rehte thain</em>. Although I was never scared of ghosts, I was definitely carried away by superheroes. When<em> Superman</em> released, <em>hum sab aisa sochte the ke peeche chaadar pehen ke hum sab udne lagenge</em>. As a child, even I stood on a window, wearing a bedsheet as my cape and underwear over my pants, while trying to jump off and fly. Little did I know that it’s not going to work.” He added that everyone around saved him before he took flight! Well, he’s made up for lost time by being quite the superhero in reel life!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A secret admirer</strong></p>
<p>Having a secret admirer is not news when it comes to actors. However, a fan of Pooja Chopra of <em>Commando</em> fame is completely smitten by her and showers her with special gifts on every occasion. What’s more, at this year’s Valentine’s Day, Pooja received a bouquet, a card with warm wishes and a two-month old cute Labrador along with a guide book on how to look after puppies and his food manual.<br />
He stated that he was aware of Pooja’s preferences and her love for dogs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/adil267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008626" alt="Adil Hussain" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/adil267.jpg" /></a> Adil Hussain
<p>Director Leena Yadav of <em>Teen Patti</em> fame is shooting for her next project titled <em>Parched</em>, a woman-oriented film about the journey of a group of local women, set in rural India. The film stars Radhika Apte, Tanishtha Chatterjee, Surveen Chawla among others, with actor Adil Hussain playing the male lead. Although Hussain could not divulge too many details about his role, he mentioned, “The only hint I can give you is that I will be seen as a mystic singer in the film. I still haven’t shot for my portions and will join the team in the first week of April. I am looking forward to this experience.”<br />
A few portions of the film have been shot in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. Interestingly, two Oscar-winning technicians are working on the project. While cinematographer Russell Carpenter has earlier worked on films like <em>Titanic</em>, editor Hughes Wisborne had worked on <em>Crash</em>. The film is a co-production of Los Angeles-based Shivalaya Entertainment, a newly-formed alliance between Brillstein Entertainment Partners and actor Ajay Devgn. <em>Parched</em> will be presented by Blue Waters Motion Pictures and Marylebone Entertainment along with Shivalaya.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sanjay Gupta’s next is a supernatural thriller</strong></p>
<p><em>To be helmed by Ragini MMS2 director, Bhushan Patel</em></p>
<p>Sanjay Gupta has signed director Bhushan Patel for a supernatural thriller which will be made under Gupta’s production house White Feather Films. Patel, who has wrapped up <em>Ragini MMS2</em> will start work on the untitled venture by the end of the year. The cast will be finialised by mid-2014. Both Patel (who is busy with <em>Ragini MMS 2</em>) and producer Sanjay Gupta (whose next directorial venture <em>Mumbai Saga</em> is scheduled to take off in May) will give priority to their respective projects before working on this.<br />
Confirming the news, Gupta stated, “Yes, we have signed Bhushan Patel for a supernatural thriller. He happens to be a friend and we came to a mutual decision that we shall start working on this project only once he has finished all his commitments related to <em>Ragini MMS 2</em>. We will start location hunting and work on getting the cast in place only after that. The film will go on the floors by end of this year.”</p>

deals with the fragility of ambitions in life<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007452&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/taramandal267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007453" alt="Actors depicting anger and below sublime peace,  two aspect  of the play" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/taramandal267.jpg" /></a> Actors depicting anger and below sublime peace,<br />two aspect of the play
<p>That <em>Taramandal</em> is a special play is not an overstatement on many accounts. Apart from the fact that it is based on Satyajit Ray’s short story <em>Patol Babu, Film Star</em>, the play comes with three “firsts”. It is for the first time that the Vinod Doshi Memorial Theatre Festival is staging a multilingual play in Pune — <em>Taramandal</em> is a Hindi-English-Bengali play; it is the first time the venue, Yashwantrao Chavan Natyagruha — is hosting a multilingual play; and it is also the first time that The Tadpole Repertory will be performing in Pune.<br />
“I had read this story in 2002 when I was pursuing MA in Film Studies in Delhi; it captivated me. I always felt that the story had the potential to be converted into a play or a film,” says Neel Chaudhuri, who went on to translate his notion into action after 2009 when he founded the theatre group, The Tadpole Repertory. “We were all brainstorming about the story for our next production and I suggested<em> Patol Babu, Film Star</em>; everyone loved the idea. However, we added some more fictional characters to it while keeping the basic structure of the story intact,” says Chaudhuri, who has directed the play. Since its maiden show in Delhi in 2010, <em>Taramandal</em> has been showcased in Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai. Last year, it was staged at the Dublin Theatre Festival, Ireland.<br />
Written in the ’70s,<em> Patol Babu, Film Star</em> revolves around a character called Patol Babu, about 50 years old, who has lived quite an unexciting life. His only passion — acting — never really culminated into anything, barring a few theatre performances at school or in the neighbourhood as a child. However, one day, he gets an offer to play a small role in a film. Though the role is only of a pedestrian, Patol embraces the opportunity. While <em>Patol Babu, Film Star</em> is about Patol, Chaudhuri says that <em>Taramandal</em> extends the short story by constructing parallel narratives that mirror Patol Babu. “In Ray’s story, where the protagonist remembers his childhood, we have introduced five different characters, who have different stories,” says Chaudhuri, adding that all the five stories portray fragility of ambitions. While the central character, Patol Babu, is essayed by Andrew Hoffland, others in the cast include Bikram Ghosh, Kriti Pant, Mallika Taneja, Neel Debdutt Paul and Sandeep Shikhar.<br />
Besides <em>Taramandal</em>, the Delhi-based theatre group has staged several English plays in the past — including <em>Rhapsody</em> (2011), <em>Ich bin Fassbinder</em> (2011), <em>Still and Still Moving</em> (2012) and <em>The Winter’s Tale</em> (2013). “Our plays are both humorous and melancholic, turning a mirror towards our contemporary experience and telling stories that seem to be about people we know or have known in our lifetime,” says Chaudhuri.<br />
The director adds that besides Ray’s story, there is another factor that became an inspiration for <em>Taramandal</em>. “The motivations to write are most often selfish. I do it so that I can work with actors. The politics, poetics, if there are any, develop later and make very little sense to me in the absence of players. This is perhaps most true of <em>Taramandal</em>, a play written with actors, about people who want to be actors,” he says.<br />
Citing an incident from four years ago, he says, “I was in Mumbai for a theatre workshop. During the conversation, I heard actors talking about their ambition and their careers so far, looking back and looking ahead. Back in Delhi, I interviewed another set of actors. All this material — copious notes of it — stewed in the workshop with the actors, who became the cast of <em>Taramandal</em>,” says Chaudhuri.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ayushmann267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008546" alt="Ayushmann Khurana" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ayushmann267.jpg" /></a> Ayushmann Khurrana
<p>After completing the promotions of his upcoming film,<em> Bewakoofiyaan</em>, Ayushmann Khurrana will start work on the next schedule of YRF’s, <em>Dum Laga Ke Haisha</em>. “I’ll be going to Haridwar again for <em>Dum Laga&#8230;</em>, and hopefully by mid-April we shall wrap the film,” says the actor. Interestingly, while his character in this film hails from the heartland of Uttar Pradesh, the actor will be playing a Maharashtrian scientist in debutant director Vibhu Puri’s<em> Bambai Fairytale</em>.<br />
“It’s difficult because both the characters are so drastically different. In <em>Dum Laga&#8230;</em> I have to speak in Bhojpuri at times. After I finish shooting for it, we will start the next schedule of <em>Bambai Fairytale</em>, in which I play a Maharashtrian. So, it’s a very different experience.”<br />
Khurrana will also be seen in Shoojit Sircar’s <em>1911</em>, alongside John Abraham. It’s based on Mohun Bagan Athletic Club. Mohun Bagan became the first native team to have won the IFA Sheild. Since Khurrana will be seen playing a football player in the film, he will begin training for it. “I had to lose weight for <em>Dum Laga Ke..</em>.but now I’ll have to gain weight for <em>1911</em>. We may begin the film in October,” says the <em>Vicky Donor</em> actor without divulging any more information.</p>

<p><strong>Rannvijay Singh in 3 AM</strong></p>
<p>By <strong>Namita Nivas</strong></p>
<p>Film-maker Vishal Mahadkar is working on his next, horror film titled <em>3 AM</em>. He confirmed that while Rannvijay Singh has been signed, the film also stars model and debutante Anindita Nayar as the heroine with TV and film actors Salil Acharya and Kavin Dave in pivotal roles. “It is not a remake of any movie and is a completely original script written by me,” said Mahadkar. The film is presently being shot in Mumbai with a spell in Goa too. It will be complete by April 7 and will release in September.</p>

<p>Director Anees Bazmee who had directed <em>No Entry</em> and will now be helming the sequel <em>No Entry Mein Entry</em> said that even though Bipasha Basu’s role in the original ended, he is re-working on the script to include her in the cast. “I met Bipasha casually some time back and like me she was also keen to work in the sequel. So I spent 20 days rewriting the script to include her, and her character will be quite different from her earlier role. Though she has yet to sign the film, she will most likely be doing the film,” said Bazmee.<br />
Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor and Fardeen Khan have been finalised for the film which will have 10 leading ladies. Asked whether Chitrangada<br />
Singh and Esha Gupta are on board, he said no one has been signed as yet.<br />
“We are in talks with many actresses,” said Bazmee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second schedule of <em>Jagga Jasoos</em> to take off next month</strong></p>
<p>Anurag Basu’s <em>Jagga Jasoos</em> starring Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif has already completed one schedule. “The shoot is going well, we’ll be starting another schedule next month,” confirms Basu.<br />
The  film spans across ten years, with Kapoor playing the title role. It also stars Govinda who is supposedly Kapoor’s step father in the film. Meanwhile, Kishore Kumar’s biopic which Basu is going to direct with Ranbir Kapoor in the lead, has been pushed to next year, since they’re busy with <em>Jagga Jasoos</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Purani Jeans</em> to release on May 1</strong></p>
<p><em>Purani Jeans</em> which is helmed by ad film-maker turned director Tanushri Chattrji Bassu will release on May 1, 2014. The film is a coming-of- age saga, depicting the agony and ecstasy of youth. Set in the mid-90s, the film has a retro feel. Set in a small town in picturesque Himachal Pradesh the cast includes Tanuj Virwani and Isabelle Liete (she debuted in <em>Sixteen</em>). The film is produced by Manju Lulla of Eros International and NextGen Films.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alfonso267.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007746" alt="Alfonso Cuaron and Angelina Jolie at the Oscars" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alfonso267.jpg" /></a> Alfonso Cuaron and Angelina Jolie at the Oscars
<p>As Mexico basks in the glow of its first best director Oscar for Alfonso Cuaron and his blockbuster film Gravity, a new generation of homegrown filmmakers wonders if the magic of the golden statuette will rub off on them.<br />
Cuaron’s 3D space thriller scooped seven Oscars, the most of any film, and was lauded for groundbreaking special effects conveying space and weightlessness, though it lost the best picture award to drama 12 Years a Slave.<br />
The movie, which stars Sandra Bullock as an astronaut cut loose from her space shuttle, has already earned $700 million at the worldwide box office and Cuaron’s win is the first best director Oscar for a Latin American.<br />
However, the 52-year-old Cuaron has spent most of his career outside Mexico, after he struggled to raise financing for projects back home, and fellow leading directors Guillermo Del Toro and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu also both moved abroad.<br />
Back in his homeland, a new generation of Mexican directors has been quick to point out Cuaron’s work has had little to do with the domestic industry. Gravity was made for an estimated $100 million by Warner Bros. Pictures, while directors in Mexico have to scramble to drum up just $2 million for a film.<br />
Many Mexican independent film-makers have had more commercial success abroad than in their home country, where film-makers complain they can’t compete against the big budgets of Hollywood studios, whose films dominate screens at cinemas.<br />
“The only place where you cannot see Mexican film is in Mexico,” said Ivan Avila Duenas, who debuted his fourth feature film at the National Autonomous University of Mexico&#8217;s International Film Festival, FICUNAM, recently.<br />
Though Cuaron cut his teeth in Mexico, most of his best known works have been Hollywood-backed projects. In the 1990s, he left Mexico to work in the United States, then Britain, and became more known for his movie adaptations of British authors, including the third installment of J.K. Rowling’s work, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, as well as P.D. James’ dystopian Children of Men. Ironically, success abroad enabled Cuaron to direct with bigger budgets in Mexico, where his 2001 Spanish-language road trip film Y Tu Mama Tambien, helped launch the international careers of actors Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna.<br />
When Cuaron scored his first hit in the 1990s, Mexican film output was anemic, with only 10 or so films a year. Last year yielded over 100, aided by tax breaks for corporate sponsors and co-productions between Mexican and foreign companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>12 Years Oscar a golden ticket for box office, DVD sales</strong></p>
<p>Historical drama 12 Years a Slave was awarded the top prize at Academy Awards show, claiming the Oscar for best picture and boosting the revenue its distributor Fox Searchlight can expect from added theatre and home entertainment sales. 12 Years a Slave won a total of three Oscars, including for Lupita Nyong’o for best supporting actress. Gravity, distributed by Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros., was the night’s big winner with seven Oscars, including one for Alfonso Cuaron as best director.<br />
The Oscars telecast, seen by an average each year of about 40 million people in the United States, is Hollywood’s biggest annual publicity event and can spark new interest in the winning films. Before the ceremony, studios generally spent upwards of $2 million for advertisements, screenings and other events aimed at the Academy’s more than 6,000 voters, according to industry insiders.<br />
“There’s a bump when a film gets a nomination and another if it’s a winner in one of the major categories,” said former Columbia Pictures marketing president Peter Sealey, CEO of the Sausalito Group strategic marketing company. “It’s not big but it can be meaningful.”<br />
Last year, Warner Bros. added nearly 200 theatres the weekend after Argo won best picture, even though the Ben Affleck film had been playing on the big screen for five months and its DVD was already on sale.<br />
The film collected nearly $8 million in theatre ticket sales over the next month, according to the tracking site Box Office Mojo, boosting its overall box office by 5 per cent. Fox Searchlight intends to release 12 Years a Slave on Blu-ray disc , while the film is still playing in about 340 U.S. theatres. It also is on the big screen in 56 foreign territories. The studio has not yet said whether it might bring the film to more theatres after the Oscars.<br />
The film had sold $140 million worth of tickets around the world before the Oscar ceremony, according to tracking firm Rentrak.</p>

<p>By <strong>Shoma A. Chatterji</strong></p>
<p><strong>In your decade long career, the repertoire of films have been limited. Why?</strong></p>
<p>I guess I am very selective because in the beginning of my career, I had made some wrong choices. Today, I am happy with whatever little I do and am not in a hurry to be a part of any race. I am taking things easy as I know things will fall in place.</p>
<p><strong>You have worked with some of the best directors in the industry like Suman Ghosh in Dwando, Rituparno Ghosh in Abohomaan, Buddhadeb Dasgupta in a cameo in Anwar Ka Ajab Kissa, Kamaleshwar Mukherjee’s Meghe Dhaka Tara and now Sudesha Roy-Abhijit Guha’s Jodi Love Dile Na Prane. How has the journey been?</strong></p>
<p>It has been an unimaginably enriching experience. Rituda’s direction won me my National Award. He once told me that acting was like a sharp-edged sword. ‘Keep it within the safety of its sheath. Take it out only when you need to.’ Each director belongs to a different school and an actor gains from this diversity. Sudeshnadi and Abhijitda have a light-hearted approach towards film-making and working with them is fun because they do not carry any baggage with them. Suman Ghosh is very passionate about his work and transfers this passion to his artists. A genius that he is, Kamaleshwar is extremely organised. He never tells you what to do, instead, he tells what the scene demands.<br />
Working with Buddhada is a very democratic experience because he respects everyone on the sets and there is no hierarchy. So it is very comfortable while working with him.</p>
<p><strong>How would you classify yourself as an actress?</strong></p>
<p>I have never been to any film school. I am a combination of a spontaneous actor and a director’s actor. I need not be told specifically what to do. But the entire process of acting is adjusting to the director’s vision, to the situation, to your character, your co-actors and to the ambience. It is an on-going process.</p>
<p><strong>What is your role in Jodi Love Dile Na Prane?</strong></p>
<p>I play Paromita who is obsessed more with the concept of love than with actually loving the man she is obsessed with. The story is based on the philosophy that love exists and is not dead. Paromita feels she is obsessed with her past love, Anik even when she is married to Salil. It takes her 20 years to realise what love is all about.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of homework do you do for a film?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on many factors like the film, the director, the character you are portraying, etc. I believe in reading the script umpteen number of times so that I can internalise the character deeply enough to be able to face the camera confidently. At times, it means ‘becoming’ the character one is playing. When I portrayed Paromita, I faced the camera as Paromita and reciprocating as Paromita and not as Ananya Chatterjee.</p>
<p><strong>Of your films, which has been your favourite till date?</strong></p>
<p>I love my work in films like <em>Abohomaan, Dwando, Angshumaner Chhobi, Meghe Dhaka Tara</em> and <em>Jodi Love Dile Na Prane</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Four new multiplexes in Bangalore</strong></p>
<p>After starting operations in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Carnival Cinemas opened its first, a four-screen multiplex at Rockline Mall, Jalahalli Cross in Bangalore. Earlier, it was at Angamaly in Kerala and Dindigul in Tamil Nadu that a state-of-the-art multiplex was introduced.<br />
The Bangalore outlet was inaugurated by superstar Sudeep along with producer-actor Rockline Venkatesh. This ultramodern four screen multiplex has a seating capacity of 927. It also incorporates the best in cinema technology such as 2K and 4K Digital projection, 7.1 Dolby surround sound, 3D enabled silver screens and a combination of JBL 3-way and 4-way speakers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Suriya to promote Satyamev Jayate</strong></p>
<p>After Malayalam legend Mohanlal, now superstar Suriya will promote <em>Satyamev Jayate</em>, actor-host Aamir Khan’s issue-based TV show among the Telugu audience. Suriya is a Tamil actor, film producer and television presenter with a big fan following down South. Apparently, through this association with the show, the brand ambassadors of various regions will communicate the need to come together, as a nation, and support <em>Satyamev Jayate</em> to raise, discuss and find solutions to the problems that plague India and its people. It will be aired on Star Plus, STAR Pravah, STAR Vijay, Asianet, STAR Utsav, DD at 11 am and a differed telecast at 1.00 pm on ETV.</p>

<p>I don’t like to watch Hindi shows on television now, it’s very boring. I used to watch <em>Desperate Housewives</em>. I loved watching this TV series called <em>Spartacus</em>, but they&#8217;ve not aired the new seasons here in India. I love <em>Game Of Thrones</em>. All these shows have amazing content, and such great acting!<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Exhibitor-distributor Akshaye Rathi roots for women power despite poor openings of two women-centric films, Gulaab Gang and Queen at the box-office<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008447&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All three films — <em>Gulaab Gang (GG), Queen</em> and <em>Total Siyapaa (TS)</em> — which released last Friday, have had dismal openings at the box-office, two of which were women-centric films. Having said that, I believe that the poor response to the films were due to other factors, and not because of its women oriented themes.<br />
Both the films have performed more or less the same — while <em>Queen</em> worked extremely well in the Mumbai and Delhi circuits, <em>GG</em> has performed better outside these two circuits. But the former’s performance is still commendable as it had a limited release, in fact almost half in comparison to<em> GG</em> and <em>TS</em>; its single screen presence being almost zilch.<br />
But this is in no way a reflection on women centric films. To cite one of the most famous example of women power in Bollywood, <em>Biwi No. 1</em> went on to become one of the biggest hits, even though it released around the Cricket World Cup time in 1999. Cricket fever was at its peak at the time, but it still had audiences coming to see the film, which was clearly a woman oriented film.<br />
Go back even further, you’ll find the example of <em>Jai Santoshi Maa</em>, one of the biggest money-spinners, which released at the same time as <em>Sholay</em>. So while the latter went to break box-office records and become a cult film, <em>Jai Santoshi Maa</em> too had box-office coffers overflowing because women audience kept coming back to see the film with their families; my parents tell me that the craze was such that people came with<em> puja thalis</em> to watch the film.<br />
It’s not a man film or a woman film that brings in the audience, it’s a good story which entertains that brings in the audience. Many believe that if the protagonist is a woman, women will come flocking to the theatre. That’s not the case. It’s when you engage the audience with good entertainment, it will make a difference. In most cases, families watch the film together. But in the case of <em>Grand Masti</em> — most came to watch the film, wearing mufflers and caps as they didn’t want to be caught seeing a sex comedy. But it’s one film that the entire family, including women saw separately.<br />
The success of Vidya Balan’s films like<em> The Dirty Picture</em> and <em>Kahaani</em> is simple — the common thread running through these two diverse stories was the entertainment factor. It entertained. The sex angle worked for <em>The Dirty Picture.</em> Blatant sex puts off an audience, tease them and the film scores. Besides, the film also released at a time when only two things sold — Salman Khan and sex. <em>Kahaani</em> again had a strong performance from Balan, but it also had a gripping story. The suspense in the film had the audience on the edge till the end, and they went away, highly entertained.<br />
The success of <em>English Vinglish</em> again reinforces one thing —that we Indians love stories of an underdog. The film had an engaging story and a fantastic performance from Sridevi as a neglected wife and mother. What worked for it is that women could relate to the story. I remember having come out with women-only shows in the 3 pm slot for Sooraj Barjatya’s film <em>Vivaah</em> in 2006, and it all went houseful. The film went on to run for 12-15 weeks. The successes of these films are instances of women power at its best — alienate them and watch the box-office figures fluctuate.<br />
Having a big star in a film ensures a good opening for a film, not the overall success. If star power was the only deciding factor, then Ranbir Kapoor, who had the record-breaking <em>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</em> to his credit would not have had a resounding flop within a span of four months with <em>Besharam</em>. While we have the Khans and Kapoors commanding a clout at the box-office, Deepika Padukone is the only one among the heroines to ensure an opening today. People come to watch her in the films. But it’s unfair to compare her success to the time when Hema Malini and Sridevi ruled because it took years and a body of work to establish them as box-office queens. Deepika in a span of eight years has shown tremendous growth as an actress. Parineeti Chopra is another heroine, who has a steady fan following of her own —and the success of <em>Hasee Toh Phasee</em> in the multiplex centres proves that.</p>
<p>As told to <strong>Priya Sugathan</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008447&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>By <strong>Farida Khanzada</strong><br />
If making a film is an immersive task, how the final product is delivered to the masses becomes equally important. With production houses allocating a huge percentage of their budget to marketing, sales, promotion and distribution, the dynamics of film-making has changed over the years. At times, the P&amp;A (promotions and advertising) budget even exceeds the cost of making the film. Take for instance, the 2011 release, <em>Ragini MMS</em> produced under ALT Entertainment, an off-shoot of Balaji Motion Pictures that believes in, according to its CEO, Tanuj Garg, “making a leap of faith films, that are slightly unconventional. The film was made on a budget of Rs. 1 to 1.5 crore, but the money spent on marketing and distribution was almost to the tune of Rs.5 crore. Such unconventional movies require a push because these films are not sold on starpower, but on the basis of an idea. It is a concept push rather than star appeal and requires that much more participation in terms of funds marketing etc.”<br />
While the budget varies with each film, what percentage is allocated to promote for instance their next venture, <em>Ragini MMS2</em>? Garg explains, “We cannot reveal the figures, since ours is a public limited company. We can talk about the budget of films that are a year or two old. However, with the Sunny Leone-starrer, it was easier to work on the marketing strategy, as Sunny has a particular image, and since the film falls in the horror-sex thriller category and is a sequel, we already have a set audience, namely the youth and those under 50 who are our main target.”<br />
While the money spent on P&amp;A varies with each film, several factors are taken into account and strategies drawn to sell their product. Garg informs that each film, depending on the audience it is going to cater to will have its own plan and budget. So, while the promotions of<em> Shaadi Ke Side Effects</em>, reflected the type of audience it would cater to, mainly the classes, <em>Ragini MMS2</em>, “which is more commercial and mass driven is aimed at single screen audience, across the country,” says Ekta Kapoor, who runs her companies Balaji Motion Pictures and Balaji Telefilms with precision. Not only does she oversee the production of her films, but also is invol-ved in the creative aspect of film-making. Balaji, which co-produced <em>Shaadi&#8230;</em> with Pritish Nandy Communications, was responsible for the distribution and marketing of the film. Kapoor says, “We also gave in our creative inputs as and when required.” Chalking out several unique strategies to promote, <em>Shaadi&#8230;</em> Kapoor feels the biggest USP of the film were the actors and this unique pairing created the right buzz in the market for the film. “It was the kind of film I definitely wanted to make, because of the great actors. Our aim was to give the film a good release, because it was one of the movies that people were dying to see. Hence, we packaged it in an interesting manner, by releasing some great material, and made sure that the film got a good opening at the theatres, as many wanted to see Farhan Akhtar and Vidya Balan together.”<br />
How does a production house recover its costs, when a film fails to perform as expected? “There are different revenue streams and in many cases even before the film releases, the producer has recovered his money, with the theatrical release working as a bonus. In other cases, you may have recovered 60-70 percent of the cost and the rest is recovered by monetising the product throughout its life, since as producers, we become the sole owners of the property. The shortfall in the initial stages, are taken care of during the life span of the film,” explains Garg.<br />
While it was not smooth sailing, to come up with novel ideas for a film, that is not the usual run-of-the-mill, so, how are they going to promote <em>Ragini&#8230;</em>? After several brainstorming sessions, with Kapoor actively involved with each promo, the ideas were scrutinised, sieving off the ones that did not meet the requirement of the franchise. Explains Garg, “For the sequel, we have upped the ante, We have coined a term, ‘Horroex’ that succintly describes the content of the film, and all our communication across various platforms is also aimed at focussing on the horror-erotica angle, that reflects the image of the franchise. Just showing horror is not enough, so we have focussed on erotica to engage the attention of our audience. We have used the digital platform and come up with a ‘chatrule’, which is a web chatroom site designed in a way that when the user logs in, he or she can indulge in a pre-recorded web chat with Sunny Leone. The twist in the tale comes when at the end of the chat, a huge image of a ghost will pop up suddenly on the screen to scare the wits out of you!”<br />
Working on the image that Leone has, the team even designed the posters using the erotic theme. “We have made sure that we do not digress from the horror or the erotica part as these are the mainstay of the film. Even in the teaser trailer we have struck a balance between the two so people are now very clear about what to expect from the film. Some of the activities are also very mass driven and focusses on the film’s theme,” explains Garg. To garner a mass base, provocative posters have been put behind rickshaws across the city. Plans to release interesting merchandise and games like Truth and Dare are also in the offing. Taking advantage of the digital medium, the team has designed a web application, called the Sunny Sexy Alarm, that will have the voice of the actress waking you up from your slumber. “In certain multiplexes where there is a lot of incinema branding, we have put up a Sunny Sexy Bed, that has a big image of her lying on the bed, with handcuffs attached and a person can actually lie down on the bed, giving the illusion that he or she is lying on top of Sunny. Also while launching the Baby doll song at a mall, instead of getting Sunny to do an item number and interact with the media, we brought her in a cage covered with a black cloth. We have used this in all our city tours so that the cage and the Baby doll image becomes firmly embedded in people’s mind. Our aim is to release every bit of information that will either culminate in horror or in some kind of a sexual takeaway.” Another innovative idea, informs Garg is an etiquette promo that they have designed, for which they have signed up with a leading multiplex chain. The promo has Sunny wearing a corset and provocatively telling the viewers that ‘today, I am going to be nice to you and give you what you desire, but keep your mobile phones switched off’. But, as she unzips her corset, the phone rings and Sunny looks angrily at the viewers telling them, ‘I’m not going to give you what you want, go away’. The promo ends with the message asking the audience to switch off their phones during the main feature.”<br />
The makers are planning to release 1000 to 1200 prints pan India, with a fairly equitable distribution at both multiplexes and single screens. “Horror and sex is a genre consumed as much by the masses as by the classes. The classes might just be a little more a-typical about it and pretend that they don’t consume this, but the fact is that they do,” says Garg.<br />
Meanwhile, the company has no intentions of venturing into international collaborations, as according to Kapoor, “They need to be pursued for many years and for the present, I have no intentions of stepping into that domain.” Preferring to tap the domestic market, the company has launched Balaji Spark, a celebrity management firm that aims to invest its time, money and expertise to identify new talent in acting and direction.</p>

<p><strong>Irrfan to be the brand ambassador of a deodorant brand, Envy 1000</strong><br />
Envy 1000 has appointed Irrfan as its ambassador, thus justifying the product&#8217;s real value positioning, as Irrfan represents the values of real men.

<p>While most college students often use their year abroad to embrace the culture and nightlife of new countries, British actor Freddie Highmore opted to play one of the most notorious fictional serial killers, Norman Bates.<br />
Highmore, 22, plays a teenage version of Norman Bates who helps his erratic mother run a hotel in modern-day Oregon in the A&amp;E series Bates Motel, which returned for a second season last week.<br />
Bates Motel is the first television series for Highmore, who is currently finishing up his final year at Cambridge University, where he studies Spanish and Arabic. The actor started out his career playing wide-eyed young boys in films such as 2004’s Finding Neverland and 2005’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br />
But playing Norman Bates has presented a new direction in Highmore’s career, playing an innocent, sensitive teenager who begins to transition into a psychologically disturbed young man with an abnormally intimate relationship with his mother, played by Vera Farmiga.<br />
“I always did want to get to play a killer, so I guess that one’s ticked off,” the young actor said with a laugh.<br />
“What’s fun about Bates Motel is that the characters change so much. The Norman that we see at the start of season one is markedly different to the end of season two,” he said.<br />
After a dramatic finale in season one that culminated with the suspicious death of Norman’s attractive young female teacher, the second season opens with Norman trying to cope with her demise by embracing taxidermy. The hobby of stuffing dead animals may be an eerie foreshadowing of his future path.<br />
“The biggest journey he’ll go on is this growing sense of self-awareness about who he is or who he might become,” Highmore said.</p>
<p><strong>FRAUGHT RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p>
<p>At the center of Bates Motel is the complex and at times, almost inappropriate relationship between Norman and his high-strung single mother Norma, which earned Farmiga an Emmy nod. In the first season, the two are dependent on each other for support and comfort as they try to start fresh with the purchase of the motel in a new hometown, but in the second season, Highmore said their bond will be more fraught with tension.<br />
“Vera and I disagree, but I think our disagreements fall in line with our characters and she sees the relationship as more platonic,” Highmore said. The close relationship and fascination that Norman has with his mother was made famous in Robert Bloch’s 1959 novel Psycho that was adapted by director Alfred Hitchcock into a film of the same name in 1960, becoming one of his most famous films.<br />
Norman Bates is based on real-life serial. killer Ed Gein.</p>
