				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">India&#8217;s unimpressive run at global academic rankings continued as no higher education institute from the country found place among top 200 reputed universities of the world in a list based on a survey of senior academics across the globe. </span></p>
<p>The 2014 World Reputation Rankings, released by the UK-based Times Higher Education on Friday, was dominated by the American and British institutions, but it also had a few universities from Asian nations like China, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.</p>
<p>In the World Reputation Rankings, described as a definitive list of the world’s 100 most prestigious universities, the famed IITs and the Indian Institute of Science have slid below the 200 mark.</p>
<p>Phil Baty, the editor of Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings, told The Indian Express that India is clearly “some way off the pace”.</p>
<p>He pointed out, “India’s most prestigious institution, based on the results of our expert global opinion poll, is the Indian Institute of Science, but it sits roughly around the 200th position and fell further since last year. IITs &#8211; Bombay, Delhi and Kanpur &#8211; are also top of India’s ranking, but they have slipped in the global list”.</p>
<p>Baty said India’s absence from the list could affect its ability to attract globally reputed faculty.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001914&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stories of love and longing from ancient Sanskrit literature, lesser known among modern readers have been rendered into English by retired diplomat and Haksar, acclaimed for his translation of the Kama Sutra.</p>
<p>In &#8220;The Seduction of Shiva: Tales of Life And Love&#8221; Haksar has compiled an eclectic stories of erotic love from ancient Sanskrit texts which academics have estimated to have been spread over a period of 1500 years, nearly a millennium from the present times. &#8221;All great literature deals with the theme of the relation between the sexes and I have tried to bring together a collection of stories covering as big a period as possible,&#8221; Haksar said during the book release here recently.</p>
<p>The first story in the anthology talks about how the god Shiva is seduced by Mohini, the female form assumed by Vishnu. In another tale, Urvashi curses the Pandava prince Arjuna when he rejects her advances. The protagonist in another story pursues pleasure first as a man and then as a woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stories in the &#8216;Seduction of Shiva&#8217; have been taken over a over 1500 years let me drew material from not only from what is called secular writing but also literature traditionally regarded as scriptural like tales from the Puranas,&#8221; says Haksar.</p>
<p>The story of Bodhisattva, before he became the Buddha is also narrated in the tome. &#8220;The tale of Prince Sudhana from the eighth century Divyavadana is also a love story, the only one in my knowledge which features the future Buddha as a lover,&#8221; the author says.</p>
<p>Most jataka accounts of his deeds in former births dwell on the cultivation of virtues like compassion, truth patience and self control as prerequisites for eventual enlightenment points out Haksar.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996745&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>QUEST:</strong> A schools’ initiative from The Indian Express</p>
<p>Quest organised a heritage walk at <strong>GANDHI SMRITI</strong> with the students of <strong>Delhi Public School</strong>, R K Puram</p>
<p>School trips are always fun but this trip was not only enjoyable but also very informative. It was my first visit to Gandhi Smriti and I was very impressed by the way the volunteers conducted the tour and guided us. They told us about how Gandhi Smriti was a place symbolising peace and serenity. People from all over the country come to this place to pay respects to the Father of the Nation. At the museum, we learnt about Mahatma Gandhi’s life and discovered facts, which until then had been unknown to us. The gardens were very beautiful. We took a stroll with our classmates and the guide. All in all, it was a great trip and I cannot wait to visit the place again.</p>
<p>* <strong>Pragati Sinha, X-C</strong></p>
<p>Recently, on a school trip, we visited Gandhi Smriti. The trip commenced with a visit to ‘Martyr’s Column’, where Gandhiji was assassinated. There were footprints made of stone, signifying the steps of the Father of the Nation in his final moments. Next, we visited a room, where Gandhiji lived in his final days. On display were some of his personal belongings and inspirational quotes, which will continue to be a source of pride and inspiration for future generations too. The best part was a tour of the museum. We were first shown a short presentation of the fateful, tragic day when Gandhiji was assassinated. The tour of the museum was educative and fascinating. One of the incredible features on display was the Tree of Unity, depicted by a group of people holding hands, which would light up a pole and, if any one broke the connection, the lights would go off. Another spectacle was a beam, which was divided into rotating segments, each displaying a unique ideal that Gandhiji believed in.</p>
<p>* <strong>Sonakshi Saini, X-C</strong></p>
<p>On January 30, 1948, a great man left us. His name was Mahatma Gandhi. He was the man who led India to independence from the British. Gandhiji was a very noble man and is still respected all over the world. He believed in ‘karma’ and in the power of truth. He lived the last 144 days of his life at Gandhi Smriti. Gandhi Smriti, formerly known as Birla House or Birla Bhawan, is a museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi, situated on Tees January Road, in New Delhi. Fortunately, I got a chance to visit the place as my school organised a trip to the place. It is a very well-maintained place. We got to know a lot more about Gandhiji there. There is a great museum, which makes use of latest technology. Each segment preaches Gandhiji’s message to the people. The place is very serene and informative. We also saw many short clippings on Gandhiji’s life, which made us respect him even more.</p>
<div><strong>* Harsh Bhoot, X-C</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong></strong>A towering statue of Mahatma Gandhi, with the inscription ‘My life is my message’ engraved on its pedestal, greeted us at the entrance. The lush green lawn, which was earlier used as a prayer ground by the Mahatma, has a string of concrete footsteps, which culminate at a small pavilion which marks the spot where Gandhiji was supposedly gunned down by Nathuram Godse. Inside the Gandhi Smriti, the ground floor has been dedicated to Gandhiji’s life, aptly showcased by a collection of photographs and information.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Next, there is a room where Gandhiji lived, which has been preserved as Gandhiji left it with his humble</div>
<div>belongings such as spectacles, charkha and chappals. The top floor is a multimedia museum, completely distinct from the floor below. However, it does manage to capture all the Gandhian ideals. The Tree of Unity, for instance, which lights up on holding hands, epitomises the strength of unity.</div>
<div><strong>* Khushboo Upreti, X-B</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong></strong>The martyr’S Column stands a metre or two away from the paved ground, on an elevated platform, with a roof and a boundary wall. The words “Hey Ram” are inscribed in Devanagari across the face of the structure — the final words of the Father of the Nation. The thing about Gandhi Smriti is that even amidst the noise of the visitors and the crowded corridors, the text on the boards hung from the walls seem to draw its observer away into a different world. They seem to provide stability, an unfamiliar sense of pride and serenity.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The short animation, which plays out on the wall of the staircase hall above the miniature version of the memorial, is beautifully executed and doesn’t dramatise the event’s grief.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The occasional tour guide can be an irritant with their penchant for not letting one use the interactive exhibits, but that doesn’t take away from the overall experience.</div>
<div><strong>* Shubhankar Mukherjee, X</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Gandhi Smriti (formerly known as Birla House) is a place where Mahatma Gandhi spent the last 144 days of his life and was assassinated by Nathuram Godse on January 30, 1948. The vast campus of Gandhi Smriti was acquired by the government of India in 1971 and has been converted into a museum and shrine to Gandhiji’s life and ideals. The garden comprises of concrete footsteps leading to a memorial, which marks the place where the Mahatma was killed.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The corridors, beside the shrine and within the main building, recount Gandhiji’s life and the history of the Independence movement. Gandhiji’s sayings have been placed all around the campus and they continue to embolden visitors to face the difficulties of life. Then there is the room, where he lived and did his daily work during his last days. The next level comprises of completely modern and sophisticated interactive exhibits.</div>
<div><strong>* Priyanshu Kumar Jain, X-B</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>Recently, I paid a visit to Gandhi Smriti, also known as Birla House, through our school. On reaching the place, we were made to gather in the puja mandap. From there, we walked along the gallery, simultaneously reading all the quotes of Mahatma Gandhi that were displayed there. We saw the place where Gandhiji was shot by Nathuram Godse on January 30, 1948. A lot of things which belonged to Mahatma Gandhi have been preserved at the place. We were shown a documentry, which comprised of an animated scene when Gandhiji was assassinated. After the documentry was over, we were divided into groups and taken upstairs into the main museum. There was an instrument which, when we spoke into a mike, played according to the tone of our voice. After that, we saw a series of exhibits like Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi’s statues, charkhas, a light that lit only when a group of people joined hands. We were also shown the timeline of Gandhiji life. After that, I came down and entered another room, in which there were exhibits showing different stages in the Mahatma’s life and, finally, a large statue of him outside.<br />
<strong>* Manan Raizada, X-B</strong></div>
<p>A school trip to Gandhi Smriti for Class X students was organised in January. We got a chance to know about the life of the Father of the Nation. Gandhi Smriti, formerly known as Birla House or Birla Bhawan, is a museum dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi situated on Tees January Road. It is here that Mahatma Gandhi spent the last 144 days of his life and was assassinated on January 30, 1948. It was originally the house of Indian business tycoons, the Birla family. It is now known as the Eternal Gandhi Multi-Media Museum. The Martyr’s Column now marks the place, where Gandhiji was assassinated. We also saw a three-minute film based on Gandhiji’s last day and the museum at the place has a number of artifacts associated with Gandhij’s life and death. We also saw Gandhiji’s well- preserved spectacles, walking stick, his room and office etc. It was a great opportunity for us to see Gandhi Smriti as every aspect of his life has been so beautifully presented that it made us even more anxious to know about Gandhiji’s life.<br />

<p>The DoE order states,”All unaided private recognised schools of the capital are directed to comply with the provisions of Right to Education Act, 2009, in letter and spirit and not to indulge in the practice of demanding and accepting donation/capitation fee of any kind, directly or indirectly, while admitting a child, from parents.”</p>
<p>Section 13(2) of the Right to Education Act says that no school or person, while admitting a child, can collect any capitation fee and subject the child or parents or guardian to any screening. Any school contravening the provision “shall be punishable with fine which may extend up to ten times of the capitation fee charged”.</p>
<p>It further cites a Delhi High Court order which says, “It is common knowledge that though there is obligation on the state to provide free and compulsory education to children and the corresponding responsibility of the institution to afford the same, educational institutions cannot be allowed to run as ‘teaching shops’ as the same would be detrimental to equal opportunity to children”, warning of stern action in case of violation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1959726&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Malaysia has extended an invitation to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) to set up a branch campus in the country. Datuk Seri G Palanivel, Federal Minister for Natural Resources &amp; Environment of the Republic of Malaysia, made the announcement in the Capital on Wednesday.<br />
“Several students from Malaysia come to India to get degrees in dentistry, engineering and medicine and some of the Indian educational institutions have already set up centres there. We also invite the IITs to set up a branch campus in Malaysia,” he said, adding that Malaysia would also like to work closely with India in the area of biodiversity. Of Indian origin, Palanivel is also the President of the Malaysian Indian Congress.<br />
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who inaugurated the 12th Pravasi Bharatiya Divas in the Capital, meanwhile assured the Indian diaspora of the country’s continued support to them and said there is no reason to despair about India’s present or worry about its future.<br />
“There is a perception in some quarters outside India that the country is losing its momentum of the past decade. This is also amplified by the political contestations here in India, which are inevitably louder in the election season that is now on the horizon,” the PM said.<br />
He added that the country is “heading towards better times” and urged the non-resident Indian community to remain engaged in the future of the country with confidence and optimism. Quoting an average growth rate of 7.9 per cent per annum since 2004, Singh said, “There has been no doubt a slowdown in the recent past, and we will probably end this year at the same level as last year with 5% growth. A number of international as well as domestic factors have contributed to this situation. Despite these challenges, our economic fundamentals remain strong.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1957109&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 19-Yea-old first-year student of Indian Law Society’s Law College committed suicide in his room allegedly after failing the exams Saturday. Hundreds of ILS students met the principal Tuesday alleging error in the evaluation of answer sheets.<br />
Saumitra Dhoble was on vacation in his hometown Nagpur when the results were declared. “His sister and I had gone out when the incident happened. His parents called him but he didn’t reply. Then his father went up to his room, which is on the first floor. The room was locked from inside. He broke open the window and saw Saumitra’s body hanging from the fan. With the help of neighbours, he took him to the nearest hospital where he was declared dead on arrival,” said Mahendra Balpande, Saumitra’s brother-in-law.<br />
Saumitra apparently got five marks in English and 0 in history.<br />
“This has been happening since we were in the first year. After revaluation, the marks get increased. But for a single paper’s revaluation, we have to pay above Rs 700. Some times, there is even a 20-mark increase. At time, almost all students’ marks are increased, at other times no one’s marks go up,” said a third-year student.<br />
ILS principal Vaijayanti Joshi said, “A delegation of students met me today. I asked them to follow the proper procedure. I have asked them to get two volunteers to look into the results and analyse if there is a pattern in the results. If there is one, we will approach the university. Otherwise, I have asked students to apply for revaluation.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1956672&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A three-day reading festival organised by CBSE in association with Katha was recently held in the city. </p>
<p>The three day festival not only saw participation from young enthusiastic kids but also saw the whos who of the literary circle mingling with children. Innovative and diverse,the event was filled with various sessions on the art of reading,the importance of technology,the beauty of writing and various competitions for students to have some fun.</p>
<p>The main objective of this CBSE-Katha initiative is to identify,encourage and provide a platform to all the future poets,novelists and translators of the country. </p>
<p>The event also saw various publishers and editors since great story writing comes from accepting the great criticism from the masters of the trade.</p>
<p>Sakshi Jain,Art Director,Katha,excited to be a part of the festival said,Books are not merely a product to be sold,they are a product of love which originate in the mind of the writer and then transferred to the mind of the reader.</p>
<p>When asked about his thoughts on such events,Vineet Joshi,Chairman,CBSE,said It is a must that more and more such festivals are organized to rejuvenate the art of reading amongst students. Technology has started playing such a big role today those children almost seem to forget the printed word.</p>
<p>During the workshop,various spots were allotted in Sanskriti School wherein the students could go and showcase their creative skills. There was a Culture Café where the students could create flavors and textures of the culture they come from. This included excellence in writing,translation and illustration. Similarly,there was also a Twitter Café and a YouTube café where the young writers could learn,share,make friends with their tweets and record the video of anything around them with the camera provided to them and share that on YouTube. </p>
<p>CBSE and Katha started a joint venture earlier this year to help nurture future writers in the country. Several Katha clubs were formed in CBSE schools that held literary lessons for students. Students who showcased a flair for literary writing were selected from these clubs for this national workshop.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1214618&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terming its new Android mobile App as a major development in the Indian job portal sector,Naukri.com Tuesday claimed to have record more than 2.9 lakh downloads of the App within a month of its launch.</p>
<p>According to the company this mobile App is available for free at the Google App store and is currently ranked 134 with a rating of 4.4 stars.</p>
<p>Vibhore Sharma,CTO-Naukri said,More than two lakh downloads was an important milestone for us. Now it clearly demonstrates that this App has filled the need of job seekers.</p>
<p>When asked to highlight some of the reasons behind the record number of App downloads,Sharma said that a lot of companies in the present era have a prohibition on recruitment sites in their offices. This App overcomes this problem by letting job seekers obtain access to jobs through their mobile phones.</p>
<p>23% of our job seekers visit Naukri.com from mobile phones. Job seekers response to the android app has been overwhelming.  With over 4 lakh detailed job description views ,43,000 searches and more than 50,000 applies a day &#8211; Naukris Adroid App has made significant inroads into the mobile phones of job seekers, he said.</p>
<p>Executive Vice President Product and Analytics Naukri,Vivek Jain said this mobile Android is the most extensively used platforms and therefore it was a natural choice for the company to launch an App catering to Android devices.</p>
<p>Through this App we want to broaden our user base by engaging more with Android users Vivek said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1203067&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top Indian universities including IIT Kanpur and IIT Madras have now partnered with University of Melbourne in Australia to offer a new joint PhD scholarship programme from 2014.</p>
<p>The multimillion-dollar scholarship programme was launched in India on Monday to provide the next generation of researchers,innovators and entrepreneurs in Melbourne and India with world-leading academic supervision and support.</p>
<p>According to an official statement,the Melbourne-India Postgraduate Programme (MIPP) will link the University of Melbourne with some of the leading research institutes in India,the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore (IISc),the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IIT-K) and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M).</p>
<p>A joint initiative of the four institutions is an AUD 3 million programme which will provide 16 PhD scholarships and associated support for research exchanges over the next three years.</p>
<p>Speaking ahead of the launch,Melbourne University Vice-Chancellor Glyn Davis said the new programme was a valuable addition to Melbourne&#8217;s already extensive scholarship offerings.</p>
<p>&#8220;By enabling students from India and Australia to undertake jointly developed research of the highest quality,we&#8217;re confident the programme will address shared global challenges in areas of environmental,societal and technological need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited that the program will give students the opportunity to contribute to the development of education,cultural and industry links between both countries,&#8221; Davis said.</p>
<p>The programme will officially commence in 2014 and will be open to PhD students enrolled at the University Of Melbourne,to be co-supervised by staff at IIT-K,IIT-M or IISC.</p>
<p>Alternatively,students enrolled in one of the three Indian institutions will have access to co-supervision with Melbourne academics.</p>
<p>IIT-K Director Professor Indranil Manna said the initiative would bring leading institutions together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Australian and Indian communities hold immense respect for each other and this is yet another opportunity that would contribute to the strengthening of cultural ties between the two great nations,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1193936&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Private schools in Kashmir,under the cover of a status quo order from the High Court,have hiked the tuition and other fees by a substantial 15 per cent,which has left many parents worried.</p>
<p>One of the leading private missionary schools has hiked the fees by Rs 350 per month,an increase of 18 per cent over the fees charged last year. In fact,the school has increased the tuition fees over the past three years by almost 100 per cent now.</p>
<p>&#8220;When my daughter got admission in this school in 2010,the monthly tuition fee was only Rs 1200. From this month onwards,I am supposed to pay Rs 2300 per month,&#8221; Mohammad Shafi,a parent,said.</p>
<p>He said the transportation charges have also nearly doubled in the past three years from Rs 600 per month to present Rs 1100. &#8220;There has been no hike in transportation charges this year so far,&#8221; Shafi added.</p>
<p>Fayaz Ahmad,whose two daughters are enrolled in a leading &#8216;Girls Only&#8217; school of the valley,said the school management had thrown all government guidelines and the Supreme Court orders to wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is strict ban on capitation fees or donations imposed by the Supreme Court. However,the school charged Rs 25,000 as donation and even gave a receipt for the same,&#8221; he claimed.</p>
<p>Ahmad said the school management has affected an increase of 15 per cent in the tuition fees this year.</p>
<p>The schools are also imposing annual sundry charges like development fees,library fees and medical fees.</p>
<p>The schools are even putting the synonyms to good use. One of the schools has levied Rs 575 for &#8216;Excursion and Extracurricular&#8217; activities and another Rs 575 per year as &#8216;Physical Training and Outings&#8217; charge.</p>
<p>Many parents are complaining that despite availing so many benefits from the government,including land at nominal rent,these private schools were fleecing the people in the naming of imparting quality education.</p>
<p>The missionary schools in the valley have been given hundreds of acres of land in prime areas on a nominal rent as low as Rs 100 per acre for improving the education scenario. However,the schools are now seen as commercial enterprises which earn crores of rupees every year through donations,admission fees and exorbitant tuition fees.</p>
<p>Acting on orders of Jammu and Kashmir High Court in a public interest litigation filed last year,the state government in May this year formed a committee headed by Justice (retired) Bilal Nazki to look into the fee structure and facilities provided by these schools.</p>
<p>The mandate of the committee was to grade the schools according to infrastructure,quality of faculty and other services and suggest fees slabs for them.</p>
<p>The committee failed to take off immediately as the government could not provide an office for it to start work. In the meantime,an organisation of private schools approached the court with the plea to quash the government order that led to formation of the committee.</p>
<p>The High Court last month directed the state government to file objections to the plea within three weeks and ordered the parties to maintain status quo on the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had started the proceedings but the High Court has now ordered status quo,&#8221; Justice Nazki said.</p>
<p>He said further proceedings will be carried out once the High Court issues some clear directions in the matter.</p>
<p>Advocate General Mohammad Ishaq Qadri said while there are no clear directions from the High Court in the case,maintaining the status quo should have meant that nothing,including the existing fees,should change till further orders.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing in the orders that can stop the government appointed committee to continue the proceedings as the committee had started functioning before the petition was filed,&#8221; Qadri said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1193179&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday pressed upon the IITs to devise strategies to attract under- graduate students towards post graduate programmes and research activities,saying lack of enthusiasm to pursue higher studies does not auger well for the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;IITs have so far not been very successful in attracting undergraduate students to post graduate education and research. IIT should devise some strategy to attract under graduate to post graduate programmes,&#8221; he said while addressing the 44th convocation of IIT-Delhi.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand that very few IIT graduates are pursuing specialised education leading to PhD or higher degrees. In the long term,this will deprive the country of talented specialised personnel who are most important assets in a knowledge economy,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The President said as against the student strength of 71,000 in National Institute of Technology (NITs),there are about 4,000 PhD students. Similarly,in IITs,as against the strength of 60,000 students,there are around 3,000 PhD students.</p>
<p>&#8220;This indicates that bright students are moving away from research and innovation. This does not speak well for our research facilities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Asserting that the present day economy is knowledge- driven,he said IIT-Delhi needs to take a giant leap as a contributor of knowledge. This can happen only by further strengthening and enhancing post graduate education and research in IITs,he said.</p>
<p>India is also far behind in creation of intangible assets and creation of ownership. Hence,the time has come to recover this trend through research in frontier areas of technology,engineering and science,Mukherjee said.</p>
<p>As IIT system has seen an increase of new institutes and increase in number of seats,he asked the established and old IITs to provide the same kind of support and hand-holding to the new IITs which they received when they were set up by friendly countries. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1192872&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The massive 1.15 lakh square feet four storeyed adminstrative block will have an auditorium with seating for 1500,gymnasium,indoor stadium,clinic,virtual digital library and video conferencing facility. The well stocked library would have 9,000 volumes of books and journals.</p>

<p>Students also need not fret over missing classes as advanced classrooms would ensure that they would be able to listen to recorded lectures later,he said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In what comes as a respite for aspiring PG medical students,the Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear a <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/review-plea-in-supreme-court-against-its-verdict-quashing-common-medical-test/1151424/" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b> plea seeking review</b></font></a> of its verdict that had <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sc-rejects-common-medical-entry-exam/1143913/" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b> quashed common entrance test</b></font></a> for admission in medical colleges.</p>
<p>The apex court further issued notice to various private and minority medical colleges on whose plea it had quashed the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET).</p>
<p>The Supreme Court had earlier held the all-India <a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/cet-from-next-year-for-medical-aspirants/1159468/" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b> common entrance test for medical admissions</b></font></a> as illegal and unconstitutional,saying it interfered with the rights of private,minority and linguistic institutions to admit students.</p>
<p>In a 2-1 split verdict on the validity of the National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET),a bench led by Chief Justice Altamas Kabir said that the Medical Council of India and the Dental Council of India lacked legal authority to control admissions to MBBS,BDS and post-graduate courses. This view was shared by Justice Vikramjit Sen.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1186765&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A joint project by University of East London and TISS on Super 30,an institute that helps underprivileged children crack IIT exam,has found how education could be used for social transition.</p>
<p>Super 30 run by noted mathematician Anand Kumar has the distinction of preparing children from poor section of society by offering free education,lodging and food to help them compete in IITs.</p>
<p>Starting in 2002,this year 28 out of 30 students qualified for IITs from the Patna-based centre which has attracted praise from within the country and abroad.</p>
<p>The study,a joint collaboration of University of East London and Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS),Mumbai is funded by British Council&#8217;s UK India Education and Research Initiative (UKIERI).</p>
<p>The researchers,who spent time with the students found how they overcame deprivation in a conducive atmosphere provided by the institution to add wings to their dreams.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been a good case study,as it has been able to drive home the point how education could be used for social transition,&#8221; excerpt of the research work said.</p>
<p>As part of the study,the researchers interviewed 50 students,including those who have passed out and are in good jobs both in India and abroad to find out how life has changed for them.</p>
<p>The project is aimed at mapping social innovation in overcoming multiple deprivation in selected locations in India and UK. The research was carried out in three case studies in India and UK,Meera Tiwari,Associate Professor in International Development and Head of Global studies school of law and social sciences,University of East London said.</p>
<p>In India,besides two case studies in Mumbai,it chose to study innovations and strategies of Super 30,she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1186679&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The Open Text Based Assessment  will first begin for classes IX and XI from the academic session 2013-14.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1185148&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ushering in a new  system of conducting examinations,the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has told schools across the country to implement open book examinations from March 2014 and has also released study material for the same.</p>
<p>The Open Text Based Assessment (OTBA) will first begin for classes IX and XI from the academic session 2013-14. For Class IX,study material has been released for all main subjects including English,Hindi,mathematics,science and social science,and for class XI,the material is for geography,economics and biology. OTBA will be applicable only to these subjects in the next session .</p>
<p>However,open book examination doesnt mean that students will be allowed to carry textbooks inside the examination hall. CBSEs version of open book implies that students will be informed four months in advance about the study material on which the exam would be conducted.</p>
<p>The main reason behind implementing this new system is to strengthen students analytical and theoretical skills by moving away from the trend of rote learning.</p>
<p>The CBSE recommends that multiple modes of assessment need to be provided to cater to the varied abilities of individual strengths of learners. It is,therefore,decided to introduce an element of Open Text Based Assessment for Classes IX and XI in the March 2014 examination. These are meant to incorporate analytical and theoretical skills,thus moving away from memorisation, the CBSE circular states.</p>
<p>The Board has also reworked the marks distribution to accommodate OTBA scores in the main subject marks. The question papers in main subjects under Summative Assessment (SA)-II will be of 90 marks (70 marks for English and 20 marks for assessment of speaking and listening skills) based on prescribed syllabus and question paper design. The question paper in each main subject will have a separate section (10 marks) for OTBA.</p>
<p>The OTBA section will comprise text followed by two or three questions based on it. The questions will require students to apply concepts to situations given in the article,report,or case study and draw inferences or conclusions. The questions will be open-ended,extrapolative,inferential and will look at personal response justifying a point of view.</p>
<p>CBSE has also advised the teachers associated with the new system to read,discuss and analyse the text material closely. Teachers should guide students and encourage open responses in solving situations, the circular said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1185148&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With an increasing number of schools going international worldwide,the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has created a Foreign Schools Cell (FSC) which will ensure that CBSE schools outside India are given the right academic and administrative support.</p>
<p>The FSC,based out of Delhi,will take care of CBSE affiliated schools in 25 countries worldwide. It will serve as a single-point contact for foreign schools to coordinate and resolve complaints and look into the needs of more than 60,000 students who have registered with the Board.</p>
<p>In view of large number of schools in 25 countries and 60,300 candidates registered from Classes IX to XII,a Foreign Schools Cell is hereby created in the Regional Office,Delhi, the circular posted on the Boards website said.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind the large number of candidates registered with the Board,the FSC will be staffed with two superintendent rank officials in addition to senior CBSE official Sanjay Sachdeva,who currently in-charge of the CBSE-i unit. Issues regarding affiliation,academics,examinations,publications and coordination will be dealt with by these officials.</p>
<p>The CBSE-i is like a subsidiary education board associated with CBSE and has a curriculum that focuses on students who plan to go abroad for higher education. Since its inception last year,close to 300 schools have applied for CBSE-i curriculum with 30 are already in operation,according to the Boards chairman Vineet Joshi.</p>
<p>The Board hopes that the officials experience with CBSE-i will aid them in handling FSCs operation. Besides ensuring that schools receive proper professional advise,the officials will also make sure a proper support system exists for foreign schools in the country.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1184537&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strengthening of UGC rules and provisions governing higher educational institutes could well be on the cards even as a new programme approved by the government yesterday threatens to strip the commission of its funding powers.</p>
<p>The need for an overhaul of the University Grants Commission (UGC) comes in the backdrop of an increased criticism that the body is beginning to lose its sheen given the current state of higher education in the country.</p>
<p>The statutory organisation is in charge of coordination,determination and maintenance of standards of university education.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim would be to give more teeth to the body with the strengthening of its rules and provisions,&#8221; said an official in the HRD Ministry.</p>
<p>Back in 2004-05,there was a proposal to amend the UGC Act,but it failed to materialise.</p>
<p>According to officials,the revamped body could be called as a &#8216;higher education commission&#8217; which,unlike the existing body,would have full time members.</p>
<p>While it will continue to set standards and norms,its funding powers could be curtailed in keeping with the suggestions of a Yashpal Committee report which had suggested that the money giving function and the standard setting function of UGC should be separated.</p>
<p>UGC at present has an annual corpus of about Rs 6000 crore of which Rs 2000 crore are disbursed among the central universities.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) programme,the body could well stand to lose its funding powers to the states which comes to about Rs 3500 crore.</p>
<p>Funding under RUSA would be directly provided by the Centre to the states.</p>
<p>RUSA seeks to improve the overall quality of existing state higher educational institutions by ensuring conformity to prescribed norms and standards and adoption of accreditation as a mandatory quality assurance framework.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1178529&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced the fourth edition of the Students Global Aptitude Index (SGAI). Developed as a paper pencil test by a renowned team of field experts,SGAI is customised to suit the Indian context. </p>
<p>It is designed keeping in mind the fact that each individual is unique in terms of aptitude,interest and motivation. </p>
<p>SGAI aims at initiating a dialogue on the decision making of academic choices among various stakeholders besides empowering a student since subject choices of a student are very often dictated by parents&#8217; expectations,peer pressure,social prestige and many other external factors. </p>
<p>The larger purpose of SGAI is to sensitise parents,teacher and students on effective career planning later in life.</p>
<p>Aptitude testing should be made an integral part of the school system and to make it more inclusive,there is a need to sensitize schools,students and parents about SGAI preferably from class IX itself. Although there is a demand to make SGAI a compulsory activity,but the schools and students should themselves feel the importance of such a facility and come forward to register, said Vineet Joshi,chairman,CBSE. </p>
<p>There has been a change in the schedule of the fourth edition. Instead of January 2014,SGAI will tentatively be held in the month of November 2013. The purpose behind rescheduling is to provide students the assessment reports well ahead of their entry into class XI. The last date of registration for SGAI Fourth edition is till September 30 but not later than October 15.There is no late fee for SGAI.</p>
<p>In the past three years,around 4,00,000 students from 6000 schools across the globe have opted for CBSE-SGAI. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1174643&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teachers of Jamia Millia Islamia on Thursday wrote to the President Pranab Mukherjee,who is also the visitor of the university,requesting him to appoint an academician of high repute and integrity as the next vice-chancellor of the university.</p>
<p>The letter  signed by at least 322 Jamia teachers  stated,Teachers of the university request you to oblige us by appointing as the new Vice-Chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia,an academician of high repute and integrity. Our humble request is in conformity with the qualifications for the appointment of V-Cs as prescribed by the University Grants Commission (UGC).</p>
<p>According to the letter,the UGC defines criteria for selection of vice-chancellors of universities as:  Persons of the highest level of competence,integrity,morals and institutional commitment are to be appointed as vice-chancellor. The vice-chancellor to be appointed should be a distinguished academician,with a minimum of 10 years of experience as a professor in a university system or 10 years of experience in an equivalent position in a reputed research and/or academic administrative organisation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,the search committee has not yet been officially announced. It is this committee which shortlists names for the appointment of the next vice-chancellor. The university continues to function under officiating vice-chancellor Professor S M Sajid.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/2-months-after-jung-made-lg-names-for-jamia-vc-do-the-rounds/1163696/"target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b> Related: 2 months after Jung made L-G,names for Jamia V-C do the rounds</b></font></a> </p>
<p>According to Jamia sources,the executive council has named Justice Aftab Alam and Professor G N Qazi,current vice-chancellor of Jamia Hamdard,as their nominees to the three-member committee.</p>
<p>The third member of the search committee is nominated by the visitor of the university,in this case,the President. Since the third member has not been named by the President,the committee has not taken official form as yet.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1171560&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The University of Wolverhampton,one of the much-sought-after education campuses in UK,is interested in attracting more students from India and Asia,its Chancellor Lord Swraj Paul has said.</p>
<p>Delivering the Chancellor&#8217;s Graduation Dinner Speech at the University,Lord Paul said,&#8221;Our ties with this area of the world are strong. It is important to emphasise the importance of international students and how we can work even more closely with businesses in this part of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can help provide opportunities to develop a skilled workforce for years to come in these countries,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Recalling his visit to a school in India this year,he said,&#8221;there,we were able to fund the education of a group of students through scholarships,giving them the opportunity to improve their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said the year saw a 6 million pound investment in research,highlighting the University&#8217;s commitment to research excellence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an aim to ensure that our graduates leave us as truly global citizens.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are proud to have an international network of partners and students from over 150 nationalities and we deliver our courses in 11 countries,&#8221; Paul earlier said at the Graduation Ceremony at the School of Applied Sciences of the University.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1169223&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University on Tuesday topped an authoritative list of the world&#8217;s top 200 university rankings that did not figure any educational institutions from India.</p>
<p>Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi,the country&#8217;s premier institution,comes in way down at No 222,dropping from 212 last year,in the &#8216;QS World University Rankings&#8217; released here today.</p>
<p>The list is predictably dominated with US universities,with MIT grabbing the top slot and Harvard at No 2,pushing Britain&#8217;s Cambridge University to No 3.</p>
<p>As part of one of its most comprehensive global reviews,the 800-strong annual ranking includes 11 Indian institutions in all with the IITs leading the charge &#8211; IIT Bombay at 233,IIT Kanpur at 295,IIT Madras at 313 and IIT Kharagpur at 346.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stable performance of Indian institutions is a reflection on the country&#8217;s efforts to internationalise its higher education system.</p>
<p>However,it&#8217;s clear that more efforts are needed in the area if the country&#8217;s institutions wish to feature more prominently at the top of global rankings,&#8221; said Ben Sowter,head of research at QS,a British firm specialising in education and study abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a country where education is prized above all matters and competition for a coveted place at one of the country&#8217;s top institutions is high,students need a broader comparison of domestic universities. QS is currently working closely with Indian institutions in a pilot ranking project for the &#8216;BRICS&#8217; nations,which is due to be launched later this year,&#8221; Sowter added.</p>
<p>The annual rankings take into account the subject range,research results and academic reputation offered by 3,000 institutions internationally.</p>
<p>In the list of the top 50 universties in Asia,IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay come in at 38 and 39 followed by IIT Kanpur at 51 and IIT Roorkee at 66.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology tops the Asian rankings followed by a number of Chinese,Japanese and Korean institutions.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s Quaid-e-Azam University ranks at 119 and the National University of Sciences and Technology in Islamabad is at 120 &#8211; both ahead of the University of Mumbai which is at 140.</p>
<p>The best-performing countries in terms of number of universities ranked in 2013 include the US (144); UK (69); Germany (42); France (40),followed by Japan (38).</p>
<p>The UK now boasts six of the world&#8217;s top 20 universities with Edinburgh and King&#8217;s College,London edging into the top 20 slot alongside Cambridge,UCL,Imperial and Oxford in the top 10.</p>
<p>The researchers report that the average undergraduate tuition fees for the global top 10 universities are up to a record high of around USD 34,000 per year,nearly double the 2007 average of USD 18,500.</p>
<p>With the rupee going through a period of extreme volatility,an elite world-class education for an Indian student may be at its costliest ever.</p>
<p>The &#8216;QS World University Rankings&#8217; is made up of six indicators: academic reputation (40 per cent),employer reputation (10 per cent),faculty student ratio (20 per cent),citations per faculty (20 per cent),international students (5 per cent) and international faculty (5 per cent).</p>
<p>This year,62,094 academic and 27,957 employer responses contributed towards the results,making the survey one of the largest of its kind in the world.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1167154&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rahul,a Delhiite,has performed exceedingly well in his senior secondary examination and is excited to join a prestigious undergraduate programme at an Ivy league university. He and his parents are least bothered about the weakening of the rupee against the dollar and its negative impact on the cost of overseas education. This is not due to his affluent background but because he will be pursuing the programme at the Gurgaon campus of the foreign university. This dream of thousands,may be millions,of Indian students aspiring for world-class foreign education at rupee cost may soon become reality if the government has its way.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that the MHRD had formulated the Foreign Education Providers Bill in 2010 to permit foreign universities to set up campuses in India. The Bill,however,has been awaiting Parliamentary nod for a long time. Given the existing situation,we now understand that the government is in the process of finalising regulations that seek to achieve the objectives defined under the aforesaid Bill. This development has been confirmed by the education minister while replying to a question in Parliament. The Bill,in its current form,had placed certain conditions,such as a minimum corpus of R500 million and restriction on ploughing back of profits on foreign universities desirous of setting up a campus in India.</p>
<p>In the past few years,some of these onerous conditions have been a subject of intense debate in the industry. As per some industry experts,such conditions will put off some of the most prestigious global universities to invest in the Indian market. We will have to wait and watch as to how many of these conditions are prescribed under the proposed regulations.</p>
<p>These regulations have become all the more important for an Indian student eyeing overseas degrees given the recent fall in the value of the rupee. To quote statistics,the rupee has depreciated by about 9% in the last month itself with analysts predicting new lows in the near future.</p>
<p>Further,the monthly average value of rupee versus dollar in the last one year indicates a fall of nearly 13% in value.</p>
<p>The accompanying table clearly indicates that the cost of pursuing an MBA from Stanford University has gone up by around 17% due to the weakening rupee. Please note that the additional burden on the student is even more significant as social costs of living have not been included in this calculation.</p>
<p>In todays tough economic situation,this is bound to impact the plans of the aspiring middle class seeking overseas education for their wards. The proposed regulations can thus provide a breather by providing access to quality higher education at an affordable cost and transform the entire landscape of higher education system in the country. The foreign universities are expected to introduce global best practices in pedagogy,curricula,research and training. In order to meet the new benchmark,the domestic education players would be forced to improve the quality of their service offerings also. In addition,the domestic campuses of foreign universities would also help the government in keeping a check on brain-drain as most of the academically brilliant students,who currently pursue education overseas,generally tend to accept foreign job offers.</p>
<p>In the past,institutions such as Duke University,Virginia Tech,University of Southern California and many more have openly expressed their interest in setting up a campus in India. Such institutions are expected to revive their India plans on notification of the proposed regulations. With over 50% of the populations below 25 years,annual enrolment of over 21 million students in higher education and GER of around 18% the country offers an attractive proposition for such institutions. We believe this is certainly a step in the right direction and is expected to reap rich benefits in the long run. We would ideally like a law to be passed and enacted that will supersede the proposed regulations in order to lend more comfort to the foreign institutions planning to invest in the Indian market.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Colleges are unable to expand because they fall within the regulated zone of heritage sites<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1166146&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gargi College shares a wall with Siri Fort,one of the seven cities of Delhi. Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) is within walking distance of the Rajpur Cemetery,the final resting place of soldiers who died in the revolt of 1857.</p>
<p>These are just two of several colleges under Delhi University (DU) located close to historical structures. But these colleges,instead of feeling proud,say the past is coming in the way of the future.</p>
<p>From a few hundred students they used to accommodate when they were built,these colleges today give admission to thousands of students. Unfortunately,despite the need to add capacity,the infrastructure of these institutions has not kept pace with students intake.</p>
<p>Many colleges were built before Independence. The buildings remain the same even today,more or less.</p>
<p>The primary reason why these colleges are not being able to expand is because the institutions fall within the regulated zone of heritage sites. It means they are governed by the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation) Act 2010,the Delhi Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 2004 and the by-laws of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD).</p>
<p>The first Act prohibits any alteration to buildings within 100 m (prohibited area) of the heritage structure and only alteration for which permission has been obtained in the next 200 m (regulated area).</p>
<p>Similarly,the second Act Act prohibits any alteration to buildings within 50 m (prohibited area) of the heritage structure and only alteration for which permission has been obtained in the next 100 m (regulated area).</p>
<p>Even after obtaining approval,clearance is required from a host of agencies like the MCD,Delhi Development Authority (DDA),Delhi Urban Art Commission (DUAC),Pollution Control Board (PCB),Delhi Jal Board (DJB) and the Airports Authority of India (AAI),among others,before construction can begin.</p>
<p>Besides SRCC and Gargi,which are located near heritage sites protected by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI),eight structures under DU are heritage buildings  the university office,the Gwyer Hall in North Campus,St Stephens College,St Stephens College chapel,IP College for Women,Tibbia College,St Stephens College Teachers Hostel and Guard House,and Hindu College.</p>
<p>Gargi College had to wait for two years to secure approval for a new academic block  a three-and-half storeyed structure  from the National Monuments Authority (NMA). Having moved past the NMA,the plan is now stuck with the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).</p>
<p>It took us almost two years to get the approval of heritage authorities. The new block will have additional classrooms and laboratories, principal Shashi Tyagi said.</p>
<p>SRCC has long felt the need to add more classrooms and hostels for its growing number of students. But the colleges proximity to the Rajpur Cemetery has become a stumbling block in the way of its expansion.</p>
<p>When SRCC wanted to construct a building to accommodate its growing number of students,it had to seek the ASIs permission. After a long wait,the files are now stuck with the MCD.</p>
<p>SRCC falls within 183 m of the Rajpur Cemetery. We have given the college authorities permission to construct a building up to 13 m high, said Vasant Kumar Swarnkar,superintending archaeologist and head of ASIs Delhi region.</p>
<p>Yogender Mann,Director (public relations),MCD (South),told Newsline that around a month ago,SRCCs case was taken up by its Buildings department. It found that the current building was not in accordance with the original layout. So we asked them to rectify the layout plan and come back for permission, he said.</p>
<p>On Gargi College,Swarnkar said: It is very close to Siri Fort,which is under ASI protection. They want to construct a conference hall close to the boundary wall of the fort,which is the bone of contention between them and the ASI. The case has come up several times and is still pending resolution.</p>
<p>Similarly,Hindu College plans to add an academic block to its infrastructure. While the process for seeking approval from various authorities began in 2009,the college has still not been able to start construction.</p>
<p>The college,located within 200 metres of the Chauburja mosque,had to wait for around two years to get the approval of the heritage authorities. Because of its proximity to the mosque,we needed the approval of the heritage authorities. While the plan was with the ASI earlier,after the formation of the NMA we had to seek approval from them, Principal Pradyumn Kumar said.</p>
<p>All these processes are taking a lot of time. The problem is not just the multiple authorities which need to be approached for approval,it is also regarding the 10-12 provisions that each approval requires, Kumar added.</p>
<p>For example,a college has to submit a range of reports to obtain clearance from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC). For DPCCs approval,we need a geo-technical report and a sewage report,among others. We appointed a surveyor towards the end of 2011 for the purpose, Kumar said. The college had approached the DPCC in 2010.</p>
<p>Kamala Nehru College,too,received approval from the NMA only around three months ago. The college has been battling with regulatory authorities since 2004-05 for approval to add another floor to its existing building. The DDA has to give the final approval, Principal Minoti Chatterjee said.</p>
<p>On the other hand,Ram Lal Anand College,which plans to build a womens hostel and a new academic block,was asked to pay a fee of Rs 20 crore for its Rs 8-crore project by the DDA.</p>
<p>The governing body chairman of the college has asked for an appointment with the L-G. The college,along with four other colleges,had also met senior officials at the Directorate of Higher Education some weeks back to apprise them of the situation, principal Vijay K Sharma said.</p>
<p>To look into these problems,the DU administration has set up an infrastructure committee. Colleges maintain that while the university has taken measures to look into the issue,the government needs to do the same.</p>
<p>Pradyumn Kumar said,There should be some nodal agency which has members from the university and regulatory authorities. It can provide a single-window clearance to all colleges.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1166146&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bill to set up the first-ever national aviation university in the country named after Rajiv Gandhi to train pilots,cabin crew and aircraft engineers was passed in the Lok Sabha on Friday.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/rae-bareli-gets-first-aviation-university/1140785/" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b> Related: Rae Bareli gets aviation university</b></font></a></p>
<p>The proposed university would come up at Sonia Gandhi&#8217;s constituency of Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh moved the Rajiv Gandhi National Aviation University Bill,2013 which provides for creation of this central university on a 26 acre plot at the Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Udaan Academy at Fursatganj in Rae Bareli. It was passed after a short discussion.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/aviation-min-s-budget-wish-list-rs-8500-cr-for-ai-in-201314/1058150/" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b> Related: Civil Aviation Ministry wants Rs 80 crore for setting up of aviation university</b></font></a></p>
<p>Speaking before the Bill was put to vote,Singh allayed fears of members on privatisation of airports. &#8220;I want to say that all these airports in the country will continue to be owned by the Airports Authority of India,&#8221; he said,adding that any construction or development of the existing airports will be done on Public-Private Partnership (PPP) basis.</p>
<p>He also said his ministry is working on opening more domestic airports in the country and may expand the airports of the Air Force for this purpose in some districts.</p>
<p>Initiating the debate on the bill,Ananth Kumar (BJP) questioned the logic behind setting up the proposed university in Rae Bareli. &#8220;Rae Bareli is an aviation desert. It should be set up in Bangalore,where all the required infrastructure is present,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Kumar also questioned why the proposed institution is being named after late Rajiv Gandhi. He said while he had nothing against the former Prime Minister,the university could have been named in the memory of M Vishveshwariah who was behind the creation of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.</p>
<p>He accused Congress members of indulging in sycophancy by naming various schemes after Rajiv Gandhi and wondered why the Civil Aviation Minister,who heads RLD,had to be part of that.</p>
<p>The university,an autonomous body under administrative control of the Civil Aviation Ministry,would have an estimated funding of Rs 202 crore during the 12th Plan period,of which Rs 80 crore has already been sanctioned by the Centre.</p>
<p>The need for the university was felt due to the &#8220;marked absence of credible institutions imparting specialised technical and managerial training in air transportation,safety,security and regulatory areas,&#8221; the bill&#8217;s Statement of Objects and Reasons said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The opportunity cost of not investing in human resources required for the civil aviation sector in India at this juncture would result in reduced growth,increased cost of operations,compromise on safety and missed opportunities,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The varsity would promote aviation studies,training and research with focus on emerging areas like aviation management,aviation regulation and policy,aviation history,aviation science and engineering,aviation law,aviation safety and security and aviation medicine.</p>
<p>During the debate on the Bill,Shailendra Kumar (SP) said while he supported the bill,he wanted the Centre to set up new institutions in other parts of UP. &#8220;You already have a Rail Coach Factory,petroleum institute and a women&#8217;s university there. Everything need not be in either Rae Bareli or Amethi,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Gorakhnath Pandey (BSP) also supported the measure but said similar institute should be set up Bhadoi which has ample land.</p>
<p>Saugata Roy (TMC) lamented a lack of standardisation in courses offering training in various branches of civil aviation. He also attacked companies like GMR and GVK,which he alleged,were not doing a good job in modernising airports.</p>
<p>He alleged that Singh was forced to privatise airports under pressure from the Planning Commission. He insisted that while some airport operations can be outsourced,management and critical operations should remain with the government. Sharad Yadav (JD-U) supported Roy.</p>
<p>Sushil Kumar Singh (JD-U),T R Baalu (DMK),Nama Nageshwar Rao (TDP),S K Bwiswmuthiary (BPF) also spoke during the debate. Saidul Haque (CPI-M) opposed the Bill.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1165622&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Members from various parties in the Lok Sabha today questioned the delay by the government in brining a Constitutional Amendment Bill to negate a Supreme Court order against reservation for faculty in superspeciality section in AIIMS.</p>
<p>JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav,SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav,BSP leader Dara Singh Chouhan and DMK&#8217;s T K S Elangovan raised the issue of the apex court order during Zero Hour,saying that despite assurance by Law Minister Kapil Sibal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath the bill has not been introduced.</p>
<p>They said with only four days were left for the Monsoon Session to conclude,the government should inform the House about its plans. &#8220;Several days have passed after the SC order. Its order has now come into effect. Today,the issue is being raised inside Parliament,tomorrow it could be raised outside also,&#8221; the JD(U) chief said.</p>
<p>Mulayam Singh Yadav said since this session had only a few days left,the bill should be brought to negate the verdict. Chauhan wondered whether government was backtracking from its assurance on the bill. Similar sentiments were expressed by Elangovan.</p>
<p>Amid demands from various parties,government had recently told the Lok Sabha that it will consider bringing a constitutional amendment bill in the current session of Parliament to annul a Supreme Court order against reservation for faculty in superspeciality section in AIIMS. Government has already filed a review petition against the SC order. Sibal had said if the order is not annulled,the government will bring a constitutional amendment bill in Parliament.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1163977&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thirteen-year-old child prodigy Sushma Verma has made it to the MSc Microbiology course at Lucknow University in the second merit list for postgraduate courses,which were announced Monday night.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/at-13-she-is-busy-preparing-for-msc-microbiology-at-lu/1139947/" target="_blank"><font color="#0260a8"><b> At 13,she is busy preparing for MSc microbiology at LU</b></font></a></p>
<p>Sushmas father Tej Bahadur Verma said he locked the seat Tuesday itself by paying the fee online.</p>
<p>LU Vice-Chancellor Dr S B Nimse had recommended her name to the admission coordinator,saying her age should not be a hurdle to all that she wants to achieve while also adding that proper procedures would be followed for her application.</p>
<p>Even though he had time till Friday,an elated Tej Bahadur locked the seat Tuesday by paying the first installment of Rs 25,075. Bahadur,a daily wage earner,hopes to somehow manage to pay the fee of subsequent semesters.</p>
<p>Sushma,meanwhile,said she is happy as her wait is over. I was hoping to get into Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar (central) University as it is close by. After initial denial,they granted me admission and asked me to wait for an admission letter to be sent to my home,which hasnt come yet, Sushma said. </p>
<p>So when I was selected at LU,I asked my father to lock the seat as I didn&#8217;t want to risk losing an year, she said.</p>
<p>This year,Sushma completed her BSc in Zoology and Botany from an LU-affiliated college in three years. The college was close by and my father would drop and pick me. LU campus is far and the every day commute may be troublesome but Im looking forward to studying there, Sushma said. </p>
<p>Like other MSc Microbiology students,she has to report to the department on September 2.</p>
<p>Being a self-financed course,MSc Microbiology requires a minimum of 40 per cent seats to run. We are certain the course will run but the picture will be clear only after the seats are locked for the second merit list, LU admission coordinator Prof N K Khare said. With a total of 30 seats,the course requires a minimum of 12 seats to run. </p>
<p>Sushma passed Class 10 in 2007 at the age of seven,earning herself her a Limca book of records for being the youngest student to do so; in 2010,she passed class 12 at ten years of age. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1161167&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Fee revenue at present constitutes just 7-10 per cent of total non-plan expenditure of an IIT.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1159863&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A change in the fee payment policy of the IITs could well be on the cards to augment fiscal resources of these institutes as fees under the present system are paid only by about 50 per cent of the students.</p>
<p>Fee revenue at present constitutes just 7-10 per cent of total non-plan expenditure of an IIT.</p>
<p>Under the existing system,fees for about 22 per cent of students from the SC/ST category are fully waived. Besides,up to 25 per cent of the students,whose parental annual income is less than Rs 4.5 lakh,are entitled to a fee-waiver. The remaining students pay the full fee.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop,the IIT council,in its meeting here on September 3,is expected to examine the proposal for a change in the fee payment policy.</p>
<p>A study by IIT Bombay,suggests that all students should pay the fees and those who are exempted from paying fees under government policy should receive the required amount of funds as fee-scholarship through the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme.</p>
<p>IITs meet most of their expenses such as salaries and staff cost which are fixed through financial grants from HRD Ministry.</p>
<p>The Planning Commission as well as the Department of Expenditure,Ministry of Finance has also highlighted the need to increase the fee revenue,sources said.</p>
<p>The council could also consider a dedicated technical cadre to free the faculty members of extra administrative load and help them devote more time to teaching and research activities.</p>
<p>An acute shortage of technical manpower especially in the older IITs is being increasingly felt as a result of the growing engagement with research and new equipment that requires different technical skill sets.</p>
<p>A high number of non-faculty staff,due to legacy,has further reduced the space for hiring trained technical staff.</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind,the IITs would push a proposal for the technical cadre at the next IIT council meeting,sources said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim of the proposal for creating a technical cadre is to free the faculty from lab/workshops responsibilities and enable them to devote their time to teaching and research,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>The standing committee of IIT council has suggested that in order to meet the urgent requirement of technical Staff,as an interim measure,IITs may start recruitment process in this cadre against anticipated attrition of non-technical,non-faculty posts.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1159863&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last time teachers were hired for Urdu medium schools in the capital was in 1989. Twenty-three years on,these 115 teachers,recruited with the help of the Urdu Academy,are still working on a contractual basis.</p>
<p>Earlier this year,the government had announced that 100 new teachers will be added to Urdu medium schools in Delhi under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) as well as in schools where Urdu was taught as a second language. The figure was later revised to 200. But they are yet to be recruited.</p>
<p>Speaking to Newsline,Education Minister Kiran Walia said a fresh notification will be issued soon by the government which will exempt teachers from the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET).</p>
<p>The qualification certificate is a key requirement in the appointment of these teachers as they are being recruited under the SSA scheme of the Central government.</p>
<p>Professor Akhtarul Wasey,vice-chairman of the Urdu Academy,said owing to the dismal performance of many in CTET,finding teachers has been difficult even for Urdu medium schools.</p>
<p>The Urdu teachers are being trained by IASE,faculty of education,JMI,so that they can be employed in schools.</p>
<p>Wasey wrote to the Delhi government in July 2013 raising concerns over the acute shortage of Urdu medium teachers in the city. He said either Urdu schools are without teachers or the job is entrusted to non-Urdu teachers.</p>
<p>In his letter,he also quoted the percentage of those qualifying the CTET last year as merely two per cent.</p>
<p>The Urdu Academy had demanded that whenever CTET teachers are available,they may be considered on a priority basis.</p>
<p>However,if such teachers are not available,then teachers with BEd or elementary teachers training may be considered for appointment.</p>
<p>According to Wasey,there are 84 primary Urdu medium schools in the city under the municipal corporations and 22 senior secondary schools under the Directorate of Education.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1157923&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The desire to outshine others has helped these three officers attain their goals.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1157078&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born in small towns,the stories of struggle and triumph of three young IAS probationers are similar to many IAS aspirants in the country. But the desire to outshine others and do things differently had helped them attain their goals.</p>
<p>The three are Harikesh Meena,a native of remote Rajasthan village Sawai Madhopur in Hauntiya district,Dr Richa Verma of Yumanagar in Haryana and Rakesh Prajapati from Uttar Pradeshs Gorakhpur. Currently,they are on their field attachments in Kangra,Solan and Mandi districts.</p>
<p>Harikesh,an electrical engineer,had cracked Indian Forest Service (IFS) in 2009. Prior to that,he worked with private sector Vedanta group in Orissa. While Richa is a dentist and a daughter of a government servant,Rakesh holds duel degrees in MTech (Mechanical and Computers) and had worked with NTPC and a private company in Paris. None have gone to English medium schools.</p>
<p>I did not have plans to become a IAS officer. But my school teacher spoke about it when I was in Class V or VI. I did not forget his words. But me and my parents only hoped for something good. I always wanted a career which empowers me to do something for the society. I am in Himachal to fulfill my dream, said Harikesh.</p>
<p>But for Harikeshs batchmate Rakesh,cracking IAS was more than a dream come true. I was doing well as a mechanical engineer in NTPC. However,one day my boss,perhaps unwittingly,snubbed me by saying dont try to behave like as collector (IAS officer)&#8230;. that made me want to prove to him my worth and become a collector, he said.</p>
<p>Richas is not very different than her colleagues. Having done her schooling at Karnal,Ambala and Panchkula,she wanted to make her mark in medicine. While doing her BDS at Rohtak,she decided to try her luck at UPSC.</p>
<p>I feel lucky,as being a girl from Haryana,it is a double victory for me and my family. I do not feel things are so bad as is always projected. Girls are really shining in my state and education has brought about this change in the mindset, she said.</p>
<p>Asked what they propose to do in Himachal,Richa added: Himachal has done very well in the education sector. Yet,the quality of education needs immediate attention. Some areas,including the tribal areas,needs better healthcare infrastructure. Disaster management and a sustainable model of growth is also needed. Thats the governments priority,I believe.</p>
<p>Maintaining that Himachal is a peaceful state,Rakesh said: I believe use of IT can solve many problems to make the government corruption free and ensure greater accountability and transparency.</p>
<p>On challenges faced by young IAS officers like Durga Shakti Nagpal,Richa said: We cannot give up once it comes to enforcing the rule of law. Every profession has hazards and we should be prepared.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1157078&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Premier business school,the Indian Institute of Management,Ahmedabad (IIM-A) said that it conducted its first ever online elections yesterday,to choose representatives for its first-year student body posts. Conducted by IIM-A&#8217;s elected student body,the Students&#8217; Affairs Council (SAC),the elections involved first year students voting to select candidates for various portfolios like cultural representative,batch representative and sports representative,an official statement said today.</p>
<p>Developed by the Computer Centre Committee (CCC) of IIM-A,the online platform was an unprecedented success with voter turnout of nearly 95 per cent for first year elections,an IIM-A spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The system is a result of months of hard work put in by the CCC of IIM-A,the body responsible for providing innovative infotech solutions to the institute,&#8221; IIM-A Secretary for IT Infrastructure,Anil Vishwanadhula said. Elections in IIM-A followed the ranked choice voting system,where candidates contesting were ranked by voters according to their order of preference. </p>
<p>&#8220;A unique feature of this system is that,using a secure online link,voters may cross verify whether their vote had been cast for the right candidate,after the voting process,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It also has an option to select &#8216;None of the above&#8217; in case,a voter is unconvinced about any of the candidates,the statement said.</p>
<p>IIM-A Students&#8217; Council General Secretary Sreejit Nair attributed the high voter turnout to implementation of the new format as well as enthusiasm from the incoming batch. </p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that the high turnout percentage is testimony to the success of a participatory decision making process that we follow at IIM-A student affairs. Anil and his team were able to provide an efficient way to channelise this enthusiasm through technological means with the result that we were able to record such huge turnout,&#8221; he said. So far,IIM-A elections were conducted using the pen-and-paper ballot method,where voters had to manually enter  their preferences on a ballot paper to cast their votes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1149901&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on Saturday withdrew its order,issued earlier this week,that asked residents of its womens hostels at Abdullah Hall to wear proper and decent-looking dresses,i.e.,salwar kameez with dupatta,both in or outside the hostel.</p>
<p>As the diktat drew criticism from various quarters,the AMU authorities last night withdrew the circular while clarifying that it &#8220;never even remotely suggested that jeans or T-shirts or any other dress is on the ban list at AMU&#8221;. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have no intention whatsoever of specifying any dress code and neither did the above circular do so. All that we have sought is that students including girls should be in a decent attire which reflects the ethos of our society.</p>
<p>&#8220;In any case the above circular was issued not by top university administration but the provost of one of the halls of residence,&#8221; said Brigadier (Retd) S Ahmad Ali,AMU&#8217;s Pro-Vice Chancellor,who is holding charge as the acting VC in the absence of Lt Gen Shah.</p>
<p>The students had been told that they can keep only one mobile phone whose number is known to their parents  because,according to the university authorities,many students use their phones to speak to boyfriends on the sly.</p>
<p>The women had also been told that they cannot visit cinemas,restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p>The restrictions had been put up on the noticeboards of the six hostels that make up Abdullah Hall,and in which nearly 1,300 students of AMUs Womens College stay.</p>
<p>Ali said there are five halls of residence for girls in AMU and one out of these had issued an advisory mainly dealing with rules and regulations including the compulsory presentation of ID cards while entering the girls&#8217; hostels.</p>
<p>&#8220;The above circular was issued by the Provost of Abdullah Hall and not by any senior university official. Even then,we have asked the provost to withdraw the above circular so as to remove even an iota of doubt regarding the sincerity of our intentions,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ali also refuted media reports claiming that use of Internet and social networking websites was banned in the university&#8217;s hostels.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was quite shocked to read media reports alleging that we have banned the use of Internet and social media for girls. This is a total fabrication as in fact we are in the process of implementing a project under which every student of the university who resides in the hostel including girls will have a direct access to the Internet facilities in their rooms,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>The Acting Vice Chancellor expressed unhappiness saying the media reports had distorted the image of our institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no question of our trying to impose any  retrograde ban,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Ali also added,&#8221;ever since a new administration assumed charge at AMU about a year back,we are leaving no stone unturned to modernise and revitalise the entire edifice of this historic institution.</p>
<p>He said during the first year,the main effort was to get rid of all unlawful and mischievous elements who had in the past brought a bad name to this institution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are also moving on the fast track for upgrading and modernising the academic system to take this institution to the very top in the country. During this process,we appear to have stepped on many toes and perhaps we have to pay the price for having disturbed the vested interests,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In April,AMU vice-chancellor Lt Gen. (retd) Zameeruddin Shah had,in an open letter to students,instructed male students to wear sherwanis when they came to meet him. The university had also asked women students to dress according to the customs and traditions of AMU.</p>
<p>Women students who do not abide by the new restrictions would be fined Rs 500,the notice had said.</p>
<p>Residents of Abdullah Hall are allowed to go out to shop or meet their guardians on Fridays and Sundays. They may have male visitors on designated days,but cannot bring them inside the hostels. Even before the new ban on visiting cinemas and restaurants,Aligarhs main market,Centre Point,situated down the road from Abdullah Hall,was out of bounds for the women.</p>
<p>Abdullah Hall provost Dr Ghazala Parveen had said she was not conservative,and the restrictions were precautions against indecent incidents.</p>
<p>It is all precautionary measures. The dress code is indicative; outside the hall,they can wear anything,but not inside. But they should be properly and decently dressed. I am a liberal and have no problem with the dress code but then they need to give an undertaking that if any indecent incident happens,I will not be held responsible, Dr Parveen had said. She said the restrictions on going to movie halls or restaurants were in place last year too. </p>
<p>The provost said the ban on more than one mobile phone was to prevent hostel residents from speaking to their boyfriends,and if any student wished to have a lavish lifestyle,she would have to leave.</p>
<p>I have ample proof when they had another phone whose number was not in our records,they used it to talk with their boyfriends. Even parents complained to us. And if any girl is interested in a lavish and luxurious lifestyle,she may take a room outside the hostel, Parveen had said.</p>
<p>Well known social activist Annie Raja described the new dress code for female students at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) as condemnable and utter nonsense.</p>
<p>Interacting with media here,Raja said: &#8220;This is nothing but curtailing the freedom of the girls. It is condemnable and utter nonsense.&#8221; (With PTI inputs)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147518&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>University of Pune (UOP) has signed a memorandum of understanding with a Germany-based pilot training and flight institute to offer a two-year postgraduate course in aviation starting September 1.</p>
<p>The course,which will award M.Tech (Aviation) degree for students with eligibility of BE or B.Tech,envisages on site aviation training at the institute&#8217;s facility in Germany for three semesters in addition to a six month study at the UOP&#8217;s department of technology.</p>
<p>The students returning to India after their on site training at the flight school in Germany- FFL- will be asked to undergo tests by Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to secure an Indian flying license. </p>
<p>Talks with DGCA on the proposal were in progress,said Vice chancellor of UOP Vasudeo Gade. The degree would also entitle the students to apply for a European flying license on approval from the German aviation regulator,he added.</p>
<p>Representatives of FFL including its chief executive officer Ulrich Langenecker were present on the occasion of signing of the MoU at UOP,who noted that the demand for trained pilots would increase considerably in view of the growing aviation industry,adding that the onsite training of UOP students in Germany will also involve soft skills,ground studies and team building activities.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate visas and work permits for the aspiring UOP students,the FFL has approached the German embassy in New Delhi to provide earning opportunities for them while pursuing their studies in Germany,the officials said.</p>
<p>Gade said the new M.Tech course will not only involve pilot training but also the engineering aspects to facilitate job opportunities in flying as well as ground engineering and allied services.</p>
<p>The UOP&#8217;s affiliation with FFL will add a new dimension to the university&#8217;s future vision,he said,adding the students will be undergoing an extensive 800 hours of flying exercises and will provide a trained manpower to the country&#8217;s aviation industry. The two-year course will have an estimated fees amounting to 70,000 euro &#8211; approximately Rs 55 lakh-in addition to the expenses on account stay in Germany.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147505&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With classes for the new academic session already started,Delhi University issued a ninth cut off list late Friday night to fill up a number of seats still lying vacant along with a notification to all colleges to complete their admission process by July 31.</p>
<p>Eight colleges issued the ninth cut off list for admission in Commerce course,while some others have asked students to directly contact them.</p>
<p>Indraprastha College reopened for admissions in the course with cut off at 94.75 per cent.</p>
<p>High first cut off list and marginal dips in subsequent lists have also led to admissions still being open in six colleges for the much-sought Economics course.</p>
<p>Apart from seats in general category,a sizeable number of seats reserved for SC/ST and OBC categories are also still lying vacant in various courses in different colleges.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,in a notification,DU Registrar Alka Sharma has asked colleges to fill up their seats in all categories and courses by July 31,beyond which admission will not be allowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colleges shall ensure that all seats for SC/ST and OBCs are duly filled by the candidates of the respective categories by lowering down the cut off for admission to the minimum prescribed level,&#8221; Sharma was quoted as saying in the notification.</p>
<p>The admission and payment of fees based on the ninth cut off list will take place on July 27 and 29.</p>
<p>A tenth cut off list will be issued before admissions close at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Classes for the new academic session began from July 24.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1147500&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid mounting tension over a controversial reservation policy introduced by Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission,Allahabad High Court today reserved its verdict on the issue and restrained the panel from conducting interviews for civil services exams scheduled later this month.</p>
<p>A Division Bench comprising Justice Laxmi Kant Mohapatra and Justice Rakesh Srivastava reserved verdict on a bunch of petitions filed by students opposing the new policy wherein caste-based quotas were brought into effect at the preliminary stage itself,unlike in the past when candidates were selected for reserved categories at the interview stage.</p>
<p>The court also directed that UPPSC &#8220;shall not conduct the interview scheduled to be started from 26.7.2013 till the date of delivery of judgement&#8221;.</p>
<p>The order was welcomed by those opposing the new policy,but resented by those in its favour. Students at Allahabad University,which has been converted into a virtual garrison by the district administration to prevent any outbreak of violence,were seen smearing each other&#8217;s faces with &#8220;gulal&#8221; and claiming that &#8220;the court&#8217;s gesture shows that the unjust and illegal policy will be nullified&#8221;.</p>
<p>Stray incidents of violence were reported from nearby Salori locality where police cane-charged a group of students,who raised slogans in support of the reservation policy and hurled stones at security personnel who asked them to maintain order.</p>
<p>The situation was,however,quickly brought under control and around 10 people were rounded up,police said.</p>
<p>The court,while reserving its judgement,questioned the UPPSC&#8217;s &#8220;haste&#8221; in bringing the new policy after being told that it was &#8220;passed by voice-vote after a member of the Commission brought forth the proposal&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1145092&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Demanding a four per cent relaxation in cut-off marks for admission in Delhi University for students passing Class XII exam from city schools,Delhi BJP today slammed the Sheila Dikshit government for &#8220;doing nothing&#8221; in the last 14 years to address the problem of shortage of colleges in the city.</p>
<p>Delhi BJP president Vijay Goel said around 54,000 seats for undergraduate courses are available in Delhi University colleges annually,out of which,only 30 per cent seats go to students passing out from Delhi schools.</p>
<p>Addressing a students&#8217; gathering at Viveknanda Mahila College in East Delhi,Goel said a whopping 1.3 lakh students clear class XII exam annually from schools in Delhi and most of them are left in lurch as they do not get admission in Delhi University colleges.</p>
<p>Holding Delhi Government responsible for the situation,he said not a single college has been set up by it in the last 14 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are 54,000 seats available in DU colleges for undergraduate courses. During the last 15 years,not even a single college has been opened by the Congress government while the number of students passing out from Class XII in Delhi schools is no less than 1.3 lakh,&#8221; Goel said and claimed that all 28 Delhi government run colleges have been opened by the BJP government.</p>
<p>The BJP leader demanded a four per cent relaxation in cut off marks for students passing class XII exam from Delhi schools and announced that party&#8217;s youth wing Bhartiya Janta Yuva Morcha will spearhead a campaign to press for it.</p>
<p>In reflection of tough competition in getting admission in Delhi University colleges,the Ram Lal Anand College last month had declared a 100 per cent marks in its first cut off list for admission in its BTech in Computer Science course.</p>
<p>The Delhi unit of BJYM will hold a series of meetings of youths who have failed to get admission in DU colleges despite passing out from Delhi schools and &#8216;gherao&#8217; the Chief Minister&#8217;s residence soon to protest her government&#8217;s inaction to address the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than 30 per cent of DU&#8217;s seats for undergraduate courses have gone to students who passed out from Delhi schools. There is a huge gap in number of students passing out class XII and the number of seats taken by these students in DU. Most of them are left in lurch.</p>
<p>&#8220;A 4 per cent relaxation in cut off marks for the students from Delhi will help more students from the city to get admission,&#8221; Goel said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only way to reduce the gap is to increase the number of colleges substantially,start evening classes in morning colleges and open branches/chapters of prestigious colleges in DU in the surrounding areas of Delhi so that students applying from other states in the DU  may not have to come all the way here.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would also help  increase available seats in DU for Delhi students,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Underlining the need for adequate focus on issues concerning the youths,he said BJP would try to channelise the power of youngsters to make Delhi a better city.</p>
<p>&#8220;We understand the importance of youth power and would like to channelise their raw energy into making Delhi a better and safer city.</p>
<p>&#8220;But for that,we need to address some issues concerning them,primary being,the issue of higher education at affordable fees within the city,&#8221; Goel added.</p>
<p>&#8220;To deal with issues concerning youth holistically,the Delhi BJP has already issued an agenda for the youth in the Capital and it is committed to implement it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Addressing the gathering,Delhi BJYM President Guarav Khari said,&#8221;The youth of Delhi have to suffer because of inaction of the Congress government. Today even after scoring 90 per cent and more marks,Delhi students have to struggle to get admission in a DU college.</p>
<p>&#8220;The BJYM will press for a wider debate on preference for Delhi students in all DU colleges. If required there should be reservation of seats for students from Delhi schools in not only DU but also in other universities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The BJYM will expose the Congress&#8217; failure to address the problems and issues concerning youth in the capital through rallies,public meetings,protests,demonstrations and online campaign,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1141715&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an unprecedented scenario,general category seats for popular courses in top colleges remained open in the sixth cut-off list put out by Delhi University colleges late Saturday.</p>
<p>Around 36 colleges offering Honours courses in Arts and Commerce subjects under the four year undergraduate programme will hold admissions in the sixth cut-off list. As far as science colleges are concerned,only eight colleges are open for general category admissions. However,these include main campus colleges like Ramjas and Hindu.</p>
<p>For BTech courses,four colleges have declared a sixth cut-off list. This includes Ram Lal Anand College for BTech (Computer Science). The college had announced a cut-off of 100 per cent for a certain section of students falling under the general category. The sixth cut-off list for the course is 93.5-98.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Hansraj,Ramjas,Gargi and SGND Khalsa are among the 17 colleges that are going to hold the sixth round of admission for Commerce. At Hansraj,the cut-off for Commerce is 96.5-98 per cent in the sixth list.</p>
<p>English,on the other hand,is open at seven colleges,including Kirori Mal and Ramjas. At Ramjas,the cut-off for the subject has fallen to 88.5-94.5 per cent. The college,however,has filled its OBC category seats in the subject.</p>
<p>Kirori Mal too has lowered its cut-off for English by .5 per cent in the sixth list. It now stands at 98.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Economics will also up for grabs in at least 13 colleges. One among them is Miranda House,which has set cut-off at 95.75-96.25 per cent.</p>
<p>Among the science courses,Ramjas is open for Physics and Chemistry in all categories. For Physics,the cut-off for general category students stands as 93.33 per cent,while Chemistry will require general category students to have secured 91 per cent. </p>
<p>According to the principal of a South Campus college,the admissions for general category admissions have remained open in the sixth list owing to some withdrawals. </p>
<p>We have a few seats left in general category. So,admissions had to be kept open in the sixth list. But we hope to fill our seats in the sixth round, the principal said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1141598&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite four rounds of undergraduate admissions,general category seats in popular courses were up for grabs in main campus colleges in Delhi University even in the fifth list that was announced on Wednesday. </p>
<p>Colleges such as Hansraj and Kirori Mal had seats available in courses such as commerce and English,unusual for the fifth list according to the trends in the last two years are taken into account.</p>
<p>At Hansraj College,while the general category cut-offs have seen a marginal dip,popular courses such as English,commerce,computer science,chemistry and electronics will see a fifth round of admissions. </p>
<p>English cut-off for general category students at Hansraj stands at 90.25-95.5 per cent. Similarly,commerce cut-offs fall in the 96.5-98 per cent range.  Another North Campus college,Kirori Mal,has general category seats available in commerce and english. </p>
<p>The college,however,has not changed the cut-offs from the fourth list. Students seeking admission to the Commerce course at the college need between 96-96.24 per cent while English requires 90-94 per cent.</p>
<p>Ramjas College,on the other hand,has seats available for English,with the cut-off ranging from 89-95 per cent for general category students. Other courses open for general category include political science at 91.5 to 95.5 per cent,chemistry at 91.33 per cent,zoology at 88 per cent and Sanskrit at 55-57 per cent.</p>
<p>Among South Campus colleges,Venkateswara College will hold general category admissions for commerce and economics. At 95.75 per cent,the commerce general category cut-off has seen a dip of 0.25 per cent. Economics cut-off has also been reduced by 0.25 per cent and stands between 95.5 to 96 per cent.</p>
<p>Except history,Lady Shri Ram College has closed general category admissions for all courses. The cut-off for history has slipped from 94.25 to 93.75 per cent.</p>
<p>Other off-campus colleges have also kept these courses open in the fifth list. </p>
<p>At College of Vocational Studies,the commerce cut-offs have seen a dip of 0.5 per cent from the fourth list and stands at 92.75- 96 per cent. Similarly,economics cut-off stands at 92.75-94.75 per cent  a drop of .5 per cent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,sections opposing the four-year undergraduate programme under the Save DU campaign,have raised the issue of high cut-offs and the admissions at some colleges being marred by chaos.</p>
<p>For the first time in the history of Delhi University,eligible candidates,with marks above cut-offs,have not been given admission,and parents and students have been forced to run from pillar to post, a statement issued by the group said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1140305&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chief Minister Narendra Modi will interact with students at Fergusson College in Pune on Sunday.</p>
<p>Ahead of his visit,Modi has invited on his Facebook page views from youths across the country on what they think went wrong in our nation that such a trust deficit has been created.</p>
<p>I will share some of the selected opinions of students during the event at Fergusson College. Youngsters can post their ideas and opinions as a comment to this post. I would love to hear ideas on how to bridge this gap, he wrote on his page.</p>
<p>After his elevation as the chairman of BJPs election campaign committee,this will be Modis second event involving youths,the first being Young Indian Leaders Conclave 2013,which was held in Gandhinagar on June 29.</p>
<p>The slogan for the Sunday event is,Youths are not just the new age voters,but they are also the new age power.</p>
<p>Modi has often been emphasising that more than 35 per cent of voters in India today are young. </p>
<p>Earlier,Modi had addressed students at Sri Ram College in New Delhi. 	</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1139940&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the 46 months he served as the Vice-Chancellor of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI),Najeeb Jung,who was sworn in as Delhis 19th Lieutenant-Governor on Tuesday,collected only Rs 46 as salary. </p>
<p>Registrar and former finance officer of Jamia Shahid Ashraf said Vice-Chancellor Jung only accepted a token amount of Re 1 per month as salary.</p>
<p>Jamia sources said the rest of his salary  subtracting provident fund and other deductions was contributed to a fund called Abba Endowment Fund set up in the name of a father figure in his life. </p>
<p>The fund,instituted by Jung,provided scholarships to benefit and uplift the students from the weaker sections of society in general and the Muslim community in particular. </p>
<p>A day after his appointment as L-G was announced by the Presidents office,Jung said the university has managed to do some good work with the fund.</p>
<p> My target was to touch </p>
<p>Rs 1 crore before I left. Obviously,that has not happened  the fund has collected Rs 30 lakh so far. But even if Im not here,I have found people who are willing to add to that amount, Jung said. He still has about a year left in his tenure as vice-chancellor.</p>
<p>The fund gets its name from one Abdullah fondly called Abba in the Jung household and is said to have served three generations of the family. The Jung family has been living in the capital since 1842 and Abdullah joined them in 1938,sources said.</p>
<p>Jung said there were many in the private sector,including his friends,who were willing to contribute to the Abba Fund. Interestingly,many of them are not Muslims. I hope to reach that amount (Rs 1 crore) soon, he said. </p>
<p>The scholarship awarding committee comprises the Pro Vice-Chancellor (Chairperson),the Dean of Students Welfare,Finance Officer,and Secretary to Vice-Chancellor (Convenor). Dean of Students Welfare Tasneem Meenai said the fund provides scholarships to students who could not go to university as they were not able to pay their fee and other such cases.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1139767&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Plagued by abysmally low student strength and steady rate of dropout,133 government-run primary schools are facing the threat of closure in Kendrapara district of Odisha. These schools thrive on paper only with exceedingly poor enrollment which has necessitated shutting down these institutions. </p>
<p>The Education department has decied to close down 49 primary schools after the issue of poor enrollment was reviewed at a high level meeting recently. As per the prescribed yardstick,133 schools were found to have a student strength of less than 25. However,it was decided to run 84 schools as these were disadvantageously located,District Project Coordinator of Sarva Sikhya Abhiyana,Nirmal Kumar Das,said.</p>
<p>Teachers get &#8216;undeclared&#8217; holiday as students do not turn up. The schools to be closed would be merged with nearby government-run schools in terms of students. The teaching staff would also be accordingly shifted,said an official. Every year there has been consistent decline in roll strength in almost all the schools. As the department claims,1.62 lakh students are enrolled in 1900 government schools.</p>
<p>The overall enrollment (1.62 lakh) figure is being believed to be on a higher side. Bogus enrollment has become the order of the day. It has double advantage. With increased roll strength,teachers manage to cling on to their choice posting without being disturbed. Besides the MDM quota and other students friendly schemes are a bonus with bogus student&#8217;s quota grabbed by concerned teachers.</p>
<p>As children are better taught in nearby schools,parents have stopped sending their wards to these schools,they added. For all practical purpose,the primary education here has lost its sheen. Disillusioned parents repose little faith in the much touted free education,quipped Dr Basudev Das,noted educationist. For obvious reason,the focus is steadily shifting towards private public schools for qualitative education,Das said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1139046&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is still hope for students aspiring to get admission in Delhi University as a number of colleges issued a fourth cut off list today with Commerce and Economics still at offer.</p>
<p>The drop in the cut off,however,was not very significant for the elite colleges.</p>
<p>The much-sought Hindu College still had admissions open for Commerce,Economics,Sociology,Chemistry and Botany even though there was not much drop in their cut off.</p>
<p>Seats for popular course Commerce are still available in over 20 colleges,most of which are off-campus colleges.</p>
<p>Hansraj,Gargi,Hindu,Kamala Nehru and Kirori Mal were among the top colleges to still have seats available for the course.</p>
<p>In Hansraj,admission can still be taken in Economics at 96.25 per cent,while it is open in Hindu at 96.5,at Sri Venkateswara between 95.75 to 96.25,and at Kamala Nehru between 90.5 and 92.5,among them.</p>
<p>English too is available at colleges like Hansraj,Miranda House,Kirori Mal and Ramjas among others.</p>
<p>With withdrawals from some courses in different colleges,fresh cut offs in the list have reopened admissions.</p>
<p>For students of the SC and OBC categories,admissions would still be open as most of the colleges are yet to fill in the quota.</p>
<p>However,colleges like Lady Shri Ram (LSR) have closed admission for most courses. Except History,admission for all courses for the popular girls college was closed in the general category.</p>
<p>Science courses were mostly closed with only six colleges open for admission for the Chemistry course. Some colleges are still offering B.Tech in Computer Science in the fourth cut off list.</p>
<p>Notification of fifth admission list by the colleges if any will be issued on July 11.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1138758&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At a time when the UK is mulling hefty visa cash bond raising concerns here,France today announced a slew of India-specific measures easing visa norms for those wanting to pursue higher education,a move that is expected to increase the inflow of Indian students to that country. &#8220;There is no competition between the UK and us. We have our own visa policy,they (the UK) have their own visa policy,&#8221; French Ambassador to India Francois Richier said here.</p>
<p>France,he said,is not challenging anybody but has introduced a number of measures to enable Indian students to study in his country. &#8220;It is about opening our arms and hearts for Indian students by facilitating their stay,not only in their visa area but other things like training,taking care of jobs when they are back in India. It is a package thing,&#8221; Richier told PTI.</p>
<p>The French envoy said that since France shares a genuine partnership with India,it has chosen to open its frontiers even wider to Indian students. He said that following the visit of French President Francois Hollande in February this year,a number of measures have been taken to facilitate the issuance of visas for Indian students,the creation of a &#8220;France-India&#8221; network as well as an increased number of scholarships offered by the French Embassy and its corporate partners.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate travel to France for all Indian citizens who have studied in France,Richier said that as of July 14,all Indian citizens who have graduated from a French higher education institution subsequently applying for a tourist or business visa for a trip to France,will be given a visa with a long period of validity &#8211; up to five years if the studies in France were at the Master or PhD levels.</p>
<p>Asked if it was a general policy applicable to all foreign students,he said the new visa measures have been taken at the Embassy level and is applicable to only Indian students.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1137642&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Delhi University (DU) setting high cut-offs once again,students scrambled for seats on the first day of admissions. Colleges held out hope,saying several courses might see a second list. </p>
<p>Ram Lal Anand College,which kept the cut-off for BTech in Computer Science at 95-100 per cent,admitted 86 students for 630 seats. </p>
<p>Vijay Sharma,Ram Lal Anand principal,said,According to university rules,the cut-off for students who have not studied science in Class XII should be five per cent higher than those who have. We have followed these rules&#8230; The actual cut-off should be seen as 95 per cent. </p>
<p>Admitting 120 students against its sanctioned strength of 750 on Day One,Lady Shri Ram College said students could expect a second cut-off list for English,Journalism and Philosophy. </p>
<p>Political Science and BTech in Psychological Sciences received good response. There are two more days left to see which courses will have a second cut-off list, Kanika Khandelwal,spokesperson of the college,said. </p>
<p>Miranda House filled 20 per cent of its 1,001 seats on the first day. Despite the high cut-offs,we saw good response for English,Sociology,Physics and History, Pratibha Jolly,principal of Miranda House,said. But Computer Science,which will be offered for the first time in the college as an undergraduate course,received lukewarm response. Jolly said the college would come out with a second cut-off list for nearly all courses. </p>
<p>At Shri Ram College of Commerce,almost 50 per cent seats in both Commerce and Economics were taken on the first day. We will be bringing out more cut-off lists, SRCC principal P C Jain said. </p>
<p>Ramjas College principal Rajendra Prasad said,We have to wait for another day to decide whether we will put out a second list. </p>
<p>Shriya Arora,who scored  93.4 per cent in Class XII,is seeking admission at Sri Venkateswara College where the cut-off for Bachelors with Honours in Political Science is 91 per cent. My first preference is North campus,so I will wait for the cut-off to go down, she said. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1134800&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first cut-off list of Delhi University for its undergraduate courses has once again touched the 100 per cent-mark,with Ram Lal Anand College,a rank outsider,this time putting the ceiling at maximum for admission to its BTech (Computer Science) course.</p>
<p>In 2011,the 100 per cent cut off for B.Com (Hons) at prestigious Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) had sparked a major outcry,prompting the then HRD Minister Kapil Sibal to intervene and ask the Vice Chancellor to look into the issue.</p>
<p>If the first cut off issued late last night is of any indication,admission for the new four-year undergraduate programme in DU will not be any easier for aspirants as the cut-offs for the various courses remained high.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the first cut-off list of Delhi University for 2013: </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Goa government has announced the formation of an education advisory council to study and resolve the vexed issue of medium of instruction (MoI) in primary schools across the state.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar,who is also Education Minister,would chair the Council,which will decide on the issue within three months.</p>
<p>Parrikar told reporters yesterday that the Council will have eminent educationists,who will also advice the government on effective implementation of Right to Education (RTE) Act. Goa had witnessed protests in past with a section of people demanding that Konkani-Marathi should be the MoI,while another quarter wanted that English should be MoI.</p>
<p>The Chief Minister said the Council,which is formed under section 34 of the RTE,will decide on the issue,which has been staring at the Goa government since last two years.</p>
<p>Then Congress-led government faced strong criticism after it gave grant to 137 schools of English medium. The Parrikar-led BJP government,after coming to power in March 2012,continued with the same policy inviting the wrath of Konkani-Marathi protagonists.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1133551&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carrying forward its legacy,28 out of the 30 students of &#8216;Super 30&#8242; institute have cracked the prestigious IIT entrance examination,results of which were declared today. &#8216;Super 30&#8242;,a brainchild of noted mathematician Anand Kumar founded in 2002,provides free of cost IIT coaching to students belonging to economically weaker sections of the society. The students are also provided with free fooding and lodging.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 28 students of Super 30 who cleared the IIT-JEE (Advanced) are all children who belong to deprived section of the society,&#8221; Kumar said. &#8220;Many a time my family had to go without food,&#8221; said an emotional Rampyare,a labourer from Uttar Pradesh whose son Bhanu made it to the IITs with the help of &#8216;Super 30&#8242;. Pranav Kumar from Samastipur,son a landless farmer,was also among the 28 lucky students along with Ankit from Hajipur,who lost his father last year in a road mishap,and Abhishek Kumar,whose father is a mechanic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somehow,I got to know of Super 30 and managed to clear its screening test. Here,I seemed to have found my new father,as Anand Sir and his family looked after me in such a way that I never felt like being away from home,&#8221; Ankit said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1132156&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state registered a rise by around two per cent in the success rate in the Secondary School Certificate (SSC,Class X),with 83.48 per cent of the students who appeared for the February-March 2013 exam,as compared to last years 81.32 per cent. Students who achieved distinction and first-class also increased significantly this year.</p>
<p>The results were announced by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) online at 1 pm Friday. </p>
<p>This year,14,99,276 candidates,including 6,95,541 girls appeared for the examination of whom 12,51,528 cleared the examination. </p>
<p>The success rate of girl students is 84.9 per cent,somewhat better than boys performance which was 82.24 per cent. A total of 2,32,619 repeater candidates also appeared for the examination,of whom 68,643 (29.51 per cent) passed. The number of candidates scoring distinction increased by more than 40,000 this year. Number of candidates securing first-class also showed a similar rise of 40,000-plus.</p>
<p>MSBSHSE chairman Sarjerao Jadhav said it was the first time in the recent history of the Board that SSC examination results are out by June 7. We made efforts to ensure results are declared early. The extended result dates used to have a cascading effect on junior college admissions and eventually led to shrinking of the first term of Class XI. This academic loss can now be avoided, he said.</p>
<p>Among the nine divisions of the Board,newly formed Konkan division topped with a success rate of 93.79 per cent. Kolhapur division was second with 90.36 per cent,Mumbai division followed with 88.92 per cent.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1126548&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andhra Pradesh is set to sign an MOU with the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology to tap its vast resources to help give the state&#8217;s educational system a face lift,the state&#8217;s information technology and communications minister Ponnala Lakshmaiah said here today.</p>
<p>The minister said the finer details are being worked out and the memorandum of understanding (MOU) will be signed within a few months.</p>
<p>The MOU will help tap the edX platform and open courseware of the prestigious institute located in Boston,to develop alternative learning mechanisms in the wake of serious dearth of qualified teaching professionals,Lakshmaiah said.</p>
<p>The proposed partnership will help Andhra&#8217;s small and rural colleges to have access to the expensive labs using the iLabs technology of the MIT. The tie-up will also help in the development of utilisation of Open Software Interface Definitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The MIT faculty was pleasantly surprised to learn that Andhra Pradesh has about 700 engineering colleges and assured their cooperation in skill development,&#8221; the minister said.</p>
<p>Lakshmaiah said the global potential of electronic hardware industry is estimated at USD 2.4 Trillion by 2020 and the demand for the Indian market that stood at USD 45 Billion is expected to touch USD 400 Billion by 2020.</p>
<p>To explore this market,India&#8217;s first electronic manufacturing cluster is to be set up in Hyderabad,the minister said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1125312&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Admissions to Delhi University will begin Wednesday as the campus unrolls a new four-year format for its undergraduate courses. Most colleges said they expect the cut-off percentage to rise this year.</p>
<p>Hindu College principal Pradyumn Kumar said: The cut-off percentages in the first list are expected to be higher than last year,especially for popular courses like Economics,Commerce,Physics,Chemistry and English. Some North Campus colleges might fill seats after the first list. Off-campus colleges will have second and third cut-off lists.</p>
<p>On the trend in cut-off percentages,Kumar said: The cut-offs have seen a steady rise in the past three years. Students have been getting high marks in Class XII. For instance,this year,more than 44,000 students got above 90 per cent in their Board exams.</p>
<p>Students applying to courses like Economics and Commerce can expect the first cut-off percentage to be around 96 to 98 per cent. In Science courses,it will be above 95 per cent,Kumar said.</p>
<p>In 2012,the first cut-off percentage for BCom (Honours) at Hindu College was 96.25 to 99.25 per cent as opposed to 95.5 to 99 per cent in 2011. Economics (H) at the college required 95.75 to 99.25 per cent in 2012 as opposed to 95.5 to 98.5 in 2011. </p>
<p>Jaswinder Singh,principal of SGTB Khalsa College,said: Since the percentage of marks obtained by students in Class XII has gone up,the cut-offs will increase by 1 to 3 per cent this year. There is no reason to panic,as apart from the North Campus colleges,DU has a large number of off-campus colleges.</p>
<p>Given that colleges have been instructed to admit all students who make the cut-off,leading to over-admission,Shri Ram College of Commerce had requested DU to look at alternative ways of admission to limit the student intake. </p>
<p>Kumar said this can be one of the reasons why cut-offs remain high in the first list.</p>
<p>To take care of the problem of over-admission,colleges take precautionary steps and keep cut-offs high in the first list, he said.</p>
<p>Off-campus colleges,too,maintain that the cut-offs will go up by a notch or two.</p>
<p>The first cut-off list is partly conjectural and partly based on the cut-off percentage of previous years. One can expect colleges like SRCC,Hindu,LSR to fill seats in the first two lists, Vijay Sharma,principal of Ram Lal Anand College,said.</p>
<p>P C Jain,principal of SRCC,said,It is not possible to predict the cut-off percentages at this stage. A clearer picture will emerge only once the registration process ends.</p>
<p>In the first list,the cut-off for BCom (H) at SRCC touched 100 per cent in 2011. However,the percentage saw a marginal dip in 2012,with the cut-off for the course at 98.5 per cent for general category.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voicing concern over the level of participation of minority children in higher education,a committee has favoured setting up of model degree colleges in 90 minority-concentrated districts with full central assistance to the states.</p>
<p>&#8220;One college may be established in each such district which may offer courses in science,humanities and commerce,&#8221; the Standing Committee of the National Monitoring Committee for Minorities Education suggested in its report presented to</p>
<p>the HRD Ministry recently.</p>
<p>The report emphasised on the need for an efficient system of data collection to know the actual situation of minority education in the country while noting that data of enrolment of minority children was not available.  	</p>
<p>The report merely referred to a study based on 2007-08 data which revealed that gross attendance ratio of Muslim minority was only 8.7 per cent as compared to 16.8 per cent in case of non-Muslims. </p>
<p>Quality of teaching being key for minority education,the report pressed for better incentives to teachers for promoting quality education in madrasas. </p>
<p>It said salary of graduate teachers under the scheme for promoting quality education in madrasas should be enhanced from Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000 and post graduate teachers from Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000.</p>
<p>Examination fee should be waived for madrasa students opting for examinations conducted by National Institute of Open Schooling and on passing out,they should be given a cash incentive of Rs 1,000 so that more students can be attracted to take the examination,it said.</p>
<p>Espousing the cause of education of minority girls,the committee recommended opening of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas in all districts where population of religious minorities is more than 10 per cent. </p>
<p>It suggested that preference may be given to blocks where there is a higher percentage of Muslims for opening model schools. </p>
<p>Noting that in a number of such schools,percentage of minority community students is &#8220;insignificant&#8221;,it suggested the HRD Ministry issue advice to the state governments that &#8220;minority community girls should be preferentially admitted to adequately address the purpose of such schools&#8221;. </p>
<p>The committee expressed regret that only 454 of the 3,501 Balika Vidyalayas in operation have enrolment of more than 20 per cent Muslim children.</p>
<p>On the issue of uplift of minority education in general,the committee strongly advocated that at least 10 per cent of the proposed 2,500 model schools (250 schools) should be reserved for religious minorities. </p>
<p>This apart,it suggested that two schools on the lines of Navodaya Vidyalayas may be opened in each of the 90 minority concentrated districts.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; help of local NGOs may be taken to attract minority children so that the benefit of these schools can be accrued to the local minority community,&#8221; it said. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1123975&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India&#8217;s prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and Indian Institute of Management (IIM) could mark their international debut with the government considering a proposal to set up one such institution in Qatar.</p>
<p>To take this proposal forward,HRD Minister M M Pallam Raju is expected to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Saturday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike earlier days when Class X results led to sleepless nights for students,the Central Board of Secondary Educations (CBSE) decision to introduce grades per subject and cumulative grade point average (CGPA) in 2010 has been a boon for students. That showed on Thursday when the results of the CBSE All India Secondary School Examination (AISSE) were declared,with many students bagging the perfect CGPA 10.</p>
<p>Thursdays results are historic for the board as the CBSE,for the first time,allowed students to choose between exams conducted by the board or their respective school. </p>
<p>This year the pass percentage for the CBSE Panchkula region comprised of Punjab,Haryana,Himachal,Chandigarh ,Jammu and others increased to  99.45 per cent from 98.08 per cent in 2011-12.  </p>
<p>Talking to Ludhiana Newsline,R J Khanderoa,CBSE regional officer,Panchkula,said: The passing percentage has increased which is a good sign. </p>
<p>Girls performed slightly better than boys with a 99.63 passing percentage as compared to 99.30 per cent of the boys passing the Class X exams. </p>
<p>In Ludhiana city,Green Land Senior Secondary Public School on the Jalandhar Bypass and Sacred Heart Convent School in Sarabha Nagar have the most number of students with a perfect score of CGPA 10. While 160 out of 517 students got the CGPA 10 in Green Land School,52 of 78 students achieved the feat at Sacred Heart Convent. </p>
<p>Around 73 out of 360 got the CGPA 10 at Kundan Vidya Mandir,Civil Lines; 49 out of 241 at Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School,BRS Nagar,and 44 out of 71 students got CGPA 10 at Green Land Convent School in Dugri. </p>
<p>Both the DAV schools in the city had encouraging results with 25 per cent of their students getting the perfect CGPA 10. At DAV Public School,BRS Nagar,74 out of 295 students achieved the feat while </p>
<p>73 out of 292 students did the same at DAV Public School,Pakhowal road. </p>
<p>Around 52 students from a total 300 achieved the perfect score at Guru Nanak Public School and so did 42 students at BCM Arya Model Shastri Nagar,42 out of 401 from BCM,Chandigarh Road,and 36 out of 256 from Bhartiya Vidya Mandir,Kitchlu Nagar. </p>
<p>Further,27 students from Ryan International,22 students each from Spring Dale Public School and Guru Nanak International,7 from Tagore Public School and 4 from GRD Academy also secured the CGPA 10. </p>
<p>It was,however,heart-breaking for students who missed the CGPA 10 by just a point or two. Aakriti,who got 9.8 CGPA said: Had the margin been bigger,it was another case but missing top rank by just 0.2 per cent is really disappointing. </p>
<p><b>Father school clerk,son topper</b></p>
<p>It was a proud moment for the parents of Aman Sharma,a student of Kundan Vidya Mandir who got  CGPA 9.6 in his Class X exams. His father Ravi Sharma works as a clerk in the same school while mother Parveen is a homemaker. I am grateful to my school and especially Principal maam who provided all books and exempted me from the tuition fee which made it easier for me and my parents, Aman said. He has decided to opt for the non-medical stream as he wants to be a software engineer.  I dont want my son to be clerk and with the schools support I am sure he wont be, his beaming father said.  </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1122922&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rucha considers herself  to be the privileged one</p>
<p>Rucha Shah scored 97.2 per cent in CBSE Class XII (Non-medical) examinations. Student of Udgam School for Children,Thaltej,she aspires to become an engineer in biotechnology. She is the only daughter of a businessman while her mother is a management consultant.</p>
<p>Certainly,I am happy though I was expecting to score this percentage. Engineering in Biotechnology has intrigued me as it requires knowledge of both Science subjects as well as Mathematics and I want to make a career in this field, said Rucha.</p>
<p>Being the only child,she said,With more benefits,it has some disadvantages too. One gets all the attention and do not have to worry about sharing everything. At the same time,company of a sibling is missed. Her mother,Kairavi,whom she considers her best friend,said,I can say that she is the privileged child.</p>
<p>Aditi feels not much of a difference </p>
<p>A student of DPS Bopal,Aditi scored 96.8 per cent in Humanities and 100 in Psychology. Eagerly waiting for her Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) expected this Friday,she wants to pursue a degree in Law.</p>
<p>In our entire family nobody is in this profession and if you ask me,I am too scared even with the mention of courts. So,this is entirely her own decision with our complete support, said her father Ashwani,who is an IIMA alumnus and runs his own management consultancy firm. Aditis mother Rashmi is a housewife. With an extended family of cousins,I hardly felt that I am the only child, said Aditi.</p>
<p>Dhruvi wants to become an inspiration</p>
<p>With 94 per cent in Commerce,Dhruvi Shah,a student of Udgam School for Children,Thaltej,wants to excel in business and management. It is a general perception that females cannot be good managers and are not good businesswomen. I want to break this myth and also inspire all those parents as well as girls that no career or profession is gender restricted, she said. She draws her inspiration from her mother Kitika,who is a manager in a tourism company for last 13 years and her father Neeraj who runs a textile business. Business Administration and Economics are two subjects that interests me, she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1121601&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A day after CBSE announced the results for Class XII examination,government school toppers were still taking time to allow the news to sink in on Tuesday. Most say they battled adverse conditions at home to achieve their academic dreams and now want to work towards a brighter future.</p>
<p><b>Ankit Saini</p>
<p>(Commerce,97.4%)</p>
<p>Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya,Dwarka</b> </p>
<p>Both my parents started crying when I told them I had topped the Class XII exam, says this years topper among government schools in Delhi. </p>
<p>Fighting the financial constraints at home,Ankit scored 97.4 per cent with full marks in economics,99 in accountancy,98 in mathematics and 95 each in English and business studies.</p>
<p>Ankits father was paralysed six years ago and his mother works as a domestic help to support the family. Ankit derives inspiration from his grandfather  a teacher in a government school. </p>
<p>He told me that I should study commerce and has been supporting me since, he says. He scored a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 9 in Class X.</p>
<p>The second of four brothers,Ankit lives in a rented accommodation in Shahbad Mohammadpur village,Dwarka. His older brother,Ravinder,studies at Hans Raj College.</p>
<p>My teachers helped my confidence. They always told me that Id be in the papers one day, says the 17-year-old,who wants to enrol for B Com (Hons) at Shri Ram College of Commerce.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p><b>Lalit Larka </p>
<p>(Science,96.2%)</p>
<p>SV (co-ed) School,Paschim Vihar</b> </p>
<p>The youngest of five siblings,Lalit wants to make a difference in the society by becoming a doctor. He has taken the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for admission to medical colleges in India and is hopeful of getting a seat.</p>
<p>He topped the Science stream and is ranked second in the state among toppers from government schools. Lalit scored 99 in chemistry,97 in biology and 95 each in English,physics and mathematics.</p>
<p>Son of a tempo driver,Lalit lives in Mundka. My father always encouraged me to work hard, he says.</p>
<p>His principal,Lalit Kumar,proud of his performance. This is the first that someone has scored this high and we have had a topper, Kumar says.</p>
<p>Lalilt is grateful to teachers. My teachers are very good and they always gave their 100 per cent, he says.</p>
<p>uuuuu</p>
<p><b>Moomina Sheikh </p>
<p>(Arts,95.2%)</p>
<p>Government Girls Senior Secondary School,Shakti Nagar</b></p>
<p>Jovial and confident,Moomina says she expected to top as she had studied hard and done well in the exams.</p>
<p>Moomina scored 99 in economics,96 in home science,95 in political science,94 in English and 92 in history.</p>
<p>With an aim of becoming a civil servant,Moomina wants to pursue a Bachelors in Arts. She has read about DUs four-year programme in newspapers,but has not attended any open house yet.</p>
<p>Daughter of a factory worker,Moomina says the current conditions in the city,especially crimes against women,have motivated her to become an IAS officer. When I become an IAS officer,I will increase protection for women, the 17-year-old says.</p>
<p>She loves reading Prem Chand and is also a Bollywood fan. I like comedy and music, she says.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1121886&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paras Sharma of a Delhi school and Sopan Khosla from Jabalpur are among the all-India toppers in the Class XII CBSE exams results of which were announced today. </p>
<p>Ankit Saini of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya topped among students in Delhi governments schools.</p>
<p>Paras of Lancer Convent Senior Secondary School in Outer Delhi&#8217;s Rohini topped the exams all over India scoring 99 per cent in Commerce stream. </p>
<p>Sopan Khosla from DPS,Jabalpur,in Madhya Pradesh also scored 99 per cent in Science stream. </p>
<p>According to Delhi government,Saini scored 97.4 per cent and was the over-all topper in the national capital among government-run schools in the capital. </p>
<p>Lalit Lakra of SV school in Paschim Vihar was the topper in Science with 96.2 per cent while Momina Sheikh of Shakti Nagar and Diksha of Nangloi topped in Arts stream with 95.2 per cent and Taruna wit 92.8 per cent topped the vocational stream in Delhi government schools. </p>
<p>A happy Paras,who wants to pursue economics in his higher studies,said he did not expect 99 per cent though he was sure he would score above 97 per cent. </p>
<p>Asked why he chose Commerce,he said &#8220;after Class X,I joined a coaching to know more about my interests and I realised that I was not comfortable with science. I thank my parents for the support they gave after I took this decision.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;I love studying and followed a time-table. If you study seriously for two-three hours,you can crack any examination,&#8221; he said. He said he would like to go to St Stephens or Sri Ram College of Commerce to pursue higher studies. </p>
<p>Apoorva,another student who scored above 97 per cent,wants to pursue to CA from Delhi. &#8220;I feel great&#8230;I was a bit nervous. I was happily shocked when I saw the results,&#8221; she said.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Appointment of teachers in primary schools on ad hoc basis by various state governments without following proper qualification criteria today drew flak from the Supreme Court which said that such policies are spoiling the entire education system and future of the country.</p>
<p>A Bench of Justices B S Chauhan and Dipak Misra expressed strong disapproval of such a system and said it was &#8220;shocking&#8221; that it can be pursued even after the implementation of Right to Education Act.</p>
<p>&#8220;A populist principality cannot spoil the future of the the country. We want to know qualification of teachers,&#8221; the Bench said while hearing Gujarat government&#8217;s plea on a case pertaining to appointment of &#8220;Vidya Sahayak&#8221; in primary schools in the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you bring such policies when there is Article 21A. It is shocking. There are such appointments in UP also. These Shiksha Sahayaks (helpers) are Shiksha &#8216;shatrus&#8217; (enemies),&#8221; the Bench observed asking the state government to place details relating to qualification and appointment of such teachers.</p>
<p>The Bench noted that ad-hoc appointment of primary teachers are done in many states which provide them less than one-forth salary given to regular teachers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we have implemented Article 21A,can we allow such system? Our concern is quality of education and we are very serious about the kind of education we are imparting,&#8221; it said adding,&#8221;We spoil the entire education system by appointing ad-hoc teachers who do not have proper qualification&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1118214&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I cant say how happy I am. I am ecstatic! says Simran Kanuja,who is the national ICSE topper. A student of St Marys School,Pune,Simran was confident of her percentage,but definitely did not expect to be a topper. I expected 98 per cent,but never thought I would be the topper,let alone national topper. </p>
<p>I cant say how proud my daughter has made me today. The first thing I did after I came to know her score was go to the nearby Gurudwara. Her high scores are the result of her hard work as well as Gods blessings, said Jaspreet Kanuja,Simrans mother. </p>
<p>The family originally hails from Indore,but had settled in Pune several years ago. My husband is still at work. When Simran called him up,he was delighted to her hear the news. After all,this is the first time anybody in our family has topped nationally. I mean this is one of the best things kids can do to make their parents happy, Jaspreet said as she fumbled for the right words to express her delight. Simrans father works as an engineer at a private company in Pune.</p>
<p>Simran scored 98.4 per cent in her board exams with cent per cent marks in both Maths and Computers. My lowest marks were in Hindi. I scored 92. But who cares, said Simran in a jubilant mood. Apart from studies,Simran also practises Hindustani Music.</p>
<p>My dad is an engineer. My elder sister is in her first year of engineering at Cummins College. I want to be like them. I want to become a software engineer. My aim in life is to get admitted to the Indian Institute of Technology for Computer Science Engineering, said Simran. </p>
<p>Once my dad comes home,we will all go out and celebrate over dinner. who has been bombarded with phone calls from friends are relatives, she says as she struggles to attend phone calls of her friends and relatives calling up to congratulate her.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1117353&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Results Southern region fares best,says Board chief; in Delhi-NCR,ICSE topper scores 97.5%,two jointly top ISC with 98.75%</i></p>
<p>Staying consistent with the norm,girls have outperformed boys in the ICSE (Class X) and ISC (Class XII) examinations,the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination said as it announced the results for the two classes on Friday.</p>
<p>More than 1.4 lakh students took the CISCE Class X exam and 64,043 students sat for the Class XII examinations in 2,590 schools across the country. </p>
<p>Girls not only fared better than the boys in the written examination,but even their pass percentage was better than that for the boys. In India,the pass percentage for girls was recorded at 98.78 per cent while that for boys was 97.73 per cent in Class X. In Class XII the pass percentage was 96.66 per cent and 93.33 per cent for girls and boys respectively. </p>
<p>Students of Class X,studying in CISCE schools abroad,scored cent per cent marks and 98.31 per cent of the boards Class XII students abroad have passed the ISC examination.</p>
<p>Three girls from Maharashtra topped the ICSE exam,sharing the same percentage. Anika Aggarwal,and Simran Khanuja of St Marys School,Pune,and Manasi Arora from Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School,Mumbai,scored 98.4 per cent. Bhuvaniya Vijay from St Josephs Academy,Dehradun,topped the ISC exam with 99 per cent marks.</p>
<p>The ICSE examination was conducted in 64 written languages while the ISC examination was conducted in 50 written languages. </p>
<p>CISCE Chief Executive Gerry Arathoon said the Southern region had fared the best in the country with a pass percentage of 99.66 per cent for Class X and 98.28 per cent for Class XII.</p>
<p>In Delhi-NCR 2,400 candidates appeared for the Class X exam and 996 candidates for Class XII exam. At 99.63 per cent,girls beat boys in terms of pass percentage in the capital as well. </p>
<p>SC and ST candidates in Delhi also secured a 100 per cent pass percentage. Among the special cases,736 dyslexic candidates took the two exams and 32 of them scored above 90 per cent.</p>

<p>Always ranked second,Holy Angels student finally makes it to the top</p>
<p>Sixteen-year-old Shivanshu Chaudhary,from Holy Angels School,Sahibabad,has always been fascinated by supercars on television. When I was in Class VI,I would spend hours just watching television and not study so much. Maybe that is why I always ranked number two, he said.</p>
<p>Four years later,he told himself that the battle must be won and topped the ICSE examinations with 97.5 per cent. His scored 100 in computers,99 in Mathematics,98 in social science and 92 in English.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Una Condron</p>
<p>Vision is key to the pursuit if scientific advancement. The vision for the UCD Science District is to host a community of ground-breaking scientists and engineers,expert in their core disciplines and working together in a world-class environment to provide innovative solutions to global problems. A core objective is the strategic integration of science with related disciplines including Agri-Food,Biomedicine,Engineering,and Information and Communications Technology (ICT)  all of which UCD are have an international reputation for. This overarching approach will serve to reinforce Irelands economic prosperity and pre-eminence in science and related disciplines.  The new Science Centre is intended to be a transformational resource for Irish Science. It will act as a highly visible,high quality and inspiring showpiece and resource at a university,National and International level. The proposed centre for excellence will reinforce UCDs ability to shape the Irish agenda. The centre will provide facilities,which will both attract and generate the highest level students,graduates and staff in the fields of Science and Engineering. Attracting the very best Indian students and researchers to our world-class facilities is a key objective of the UCD College of Science. The new facilities will not disappoint</p>
<p><b>UCD College of Science District in Numbers</b></p>
<p>* 2 Million Square Feet</p>
<p>* 2,000 Scientists</p>
<p>* 5,200 Science and Engineering Students</p>
<p>* 350 Industry partners</p>
<p>* 40 Campus Companies</p>
<p>Science in UCD covers core and applied disciplines including biological,chemical,geological,mathematical,physical and computer sciences as well as finance,actuarial sciences,meteorology and biopharmaceutical sciences. Increasingly big questions require answers that draw on a multitude of skills often situated at the interface of disciplines.  For this reason UCD adopts an interdisciplinary approach,which connect knowledge across boundaries and breakdown academic silos.  Research questions addressed by academics from the UCD College of Science,look at green energy and the environment,biomedical research,complex numerical systems,nanotechnology,sensors and the interface of biology and technology.</p>
<p><b>Why Science in UCD?</b></p>
<p>UCD,ranked in the top 1% World Universities per 2012 QS Rankings (ranking 130) is one of the oldest universities in Ireland. Established in 1854,UCD is Ireland&#8217;s largest and most international university (with over 25,000 students of which over 5,500 are international from over 122 countries around the world). This combined with its status as Ireland&#8217;s leader in postgraduate education (over a quarter of all graduate students in Ireland study in UCD) has proven it to be the most popular university for Indian students looking to study at university level in Ireland. </p>
<p>UCD offers the most broad and diverse Science programme in Ireland.  The College offers 25 undergraduate pathways and in excess of 20 taught masters pathways,in addition to numerous research programmes to PhD level. UCD College of Science graduates are in great demand in science-based employment both in Ireland and abroad,and are equally sought after in other areas where there are requirements for rigorously trained,numerically competent and analytically proficient graduates.  Many UCD graduates continue their studies in leading institutions throughout the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The much-awaited results of classes X and XII for the session 2012-13 conducted by Indian Certificate Secondary Education (ICSE) are most likely to be declared after 3 pm on Friday.</p>
<p>Making it easy for the students,the details of the results will also be made available through short service message (SMS). To get the results on mobile phones,the students have to type their index number like ICSE T6758010 and send it to any of the numbers: 58888,51818,56263 and 5676750.</p>
<p>From the Tricity,150 students appeared for class XII ICSE exams while in case of class X,a total of 1,500 students took the exams.</p>
<p>However,the results of classes X and XII conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) are likely to be declared by May 20. However,the regional office of CBSE here in Panchkula also made it clear that if the said results were not out by May 20,then by May 25,the results of both the classes would be out one after another.</p>
<p>In an attempt to help the students to get their results easily on their mobile phones,the CBSE is working on a mechanism where some numbers will be flashed on its website and students through SMS can send their roll number on those numbers to get details of their marks.</p>
<p>Talking to Chandigarh Newsline,CBSE regional director R J Khanderao said,Preparations of results are under process. Most likely the results will be out by May 20,and if this date is missed then by May 25,we will try to declare the results.</p>
<p>Asked about the SMS service,he said that some numbers would be flashed on the website on the day of the results. Students could message their roll numbers and they would get an instant reply.</p>
<p>As many as 29,475 students took classes X and XII exams at 39 exam centers located in Chandigarh,Mohali and Panchkula. As per the official data,in the tricity,a total of 11,966 class X students and 17,509 students of class XII sat for the examination.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1116908&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conceding to the longstanding demand of civil service aspirants,the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is mulling to put online the scanned copies of answer sheets of the candidates writing the prestigious examination.</p>
<p>The Commission,which conducts the annual examination to select candidates for IAS,IPS and IFS among others,is in discussion with the Ministry of Personnel over the matter. </p>
<p>&#8220;The UPSC is considering to upload answer sheets of candidates on its website. The matter is at the consultation stage,&#8221; a Ministry official said.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Commission,at present,does not put online scanned copies of Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) answer sheets of the candidates.</p>
<p>However,it has been providing the answer sheets from the year 2012 onwards on specific demands,after the entire examination process gets over.</p>
<p>Official said the Commission will first start with uploading scanned answer sheets of civil services preliminary examination and then will go for uploading mains exam answer copies.</p>
<p>The preliminary examination is based on objective type questions while the mains has subjective questions. </p>
<p>&#8220;The decision,if agreed upon by all the stake holders,will add to the credibility of the whole selection process,&#8221; the official said.</p>
<p>The Civil Services examination has three stages  preliminary,mains and interview.</p>
<p>The DoPT is also working on reducing delay in issuance of offer letters to the successful candidates.</p>
<p>The Ministry has taken up the matter with all other concerned ministries&#8211; Ministry of Home Affairs for appointments in Indian Police Service (IPS),Ministry of</p>
<p>Environment and Forest for Indian Forest Service (IfoS),Ministry of External Affairs for Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and Ministry of Finance for Indian Revenue Service (IRS)&#8211;among others.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will ensure there is no delay in sending offer letters to the candidates,&#8221; the official added. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1116645&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Making it clear that the Centre will not come in the way of DU from introducing the four-year undergraduate course,the government today said it will look into the concerns expressed by some sections but the momentum generated towards its implementation should not be derailed.</p>
<p>Any decision on differing the programme by a year will be left to the Delhi University to decide as it is an autonomous institution,the government clarified.</p>
<p>We should not be seen as dictating them or question their wisdom. If they feel comfortable to go ahead,we don&#8217;t want to come in the way, HRD Minister M M Pallam Raju told reporters here.</p>
<p>His statements came a day after Minister of State for HRD Shashi Tharoor spoke on the same lines at the Google Hangout programme here.</p>
<p>Raju said the concerns expressed by dissenting groups have been discussed at length with DU Vice Chancellor Dinesh Singh.</p>
<p>The VC has assured that things are going in the right direction,he said to persistent queries if his Ministry plans to intervene on the issue.</p>
<p>Raju said there would always be resistance to changes in the country and that students need not be alarmed.</p>
<p>We definitely don&#8217;t want to derail the enthusiasm and momentum generated and certainly do not want to impinge on the academic authority and independence of the executive council of the university&#8230;About the concerns expressed,we are giving it deep thought and scrutiny and ensure it is addressed, he said.</p>
<p>He,however,noted that the concerns were limited to the speed with which the programme was being implemented and the omissions of some key elements of the course but not for the new scheme per se.</p>
<p>The new programme will entail awarding a diploma if a student exits after two years,a bachelor&#8217;s degree after three years and a bachelor&#8217;s degree with honours or a B Tech degree on completion of four years.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1114122&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Delhi High Court today sought the response from the Delhi University on a PIL challenging the implementation of the varsity&#8217;s proposed four-year undergraduate programme in its present form.</p>
<p>Issuing notice to the university,a bench of Chief Justice D Murugesan and Justice Jayant Nath asked the university to file an affidavit by May 15.</p>
<p>The counsel for the varsity accepted the notice and told the court that several other issues pertaining to the proposed four-year undergraduate programme have been addressed by the academic council.</p>
<p>He also said the grievances raised in the PIL,filed by Sambhavana,a registered society,have also been considered.</p>
<p>DU is to implement the four-year undergraduate programme in next academic session beginning July this year.</p>
<p>In its PIL,Sambhavana has said if the four-year undergraduate programme with multiple degrees is introduced in present form,the students with vision impairment will suffer irreparable loss as they will have to study subjects like mathematics from which they are exempted.</p>
<p>The society,which works for the welfare of differently-abled students,said when the recommendations for the curriculum of programme were made,the concerns of the people with visual impairment were not taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The plea said,Students with visual impairment are purely exempted from studying Science and Maths after class-VIII in some cases and after class-X in most of the cases.</p>
<p>In case the existing approved programme is implemented,such students shall not be able to meet the requirements of the foundation course in the first year of the four-year undergraduate programme which contains a bouquet of 11 mandatory courses,including Building Mathematical Ability and Science and Life.</p>
<p>The plea has sought the court to direct the university to introduce a bridge course programme for Maths and Science for students with vision impairment so that they can also be given a level-playing field to pursue the foundation course as prescribed in the first year of the four-year undergraduate programme with multiple degree.</p>
<p>A large number of students with vision impairment seek admission in Delhi University every year. They cannot be deprived of studying the foundation course on an equal basis with other students. Therefore,a provision of the bridge course should be followed by the foundation course in second year of the said programme, the plea said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1113098&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The widespread adoption of tablets,mobile applications,social networks and digital content is having widespread effect on students around the world. Because of this,classrooms are set to go through a revolutionary change,especially the way students will learn and teachers will pass on information. </p>
<p><img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/05/samsung-students.jpg" align="left" vspace="4" border="0"></a>With this in mind,Samsung Electronics,in partnership with Modern School,Barakhamba,launched the a joint initiative to improve student learning with easy-to-use immersive technology for a digital classroom. </p>
<p>The advanced solutions for this next generation classroom was developed in collaboration with the school and SRI-Bangalore,the Samsung R&amp;D Center in Bangalore. </p>
<p>Samsung provided Modern School with a solution package consisting of 42 Galaxy Note 10.1 units and a 65-inch interactive whiteboard. The solution gives the teacher the ability to lead interactive lessons and real-time group activities through screen and content sharing features. The technical support for the Samsung School solution will be given by SRI-Bangalore while the course content has been worked on by the school itself. </p>
<p>The school is also free to partner with content providers to design the digital course content,while SRI will ensure smooth implementation and technical support.  </p>
<p>Students today are digital natives. As they embark on their learning journey,they expect interactive software and content, said Hyoil Kim,vice president,Enterprise Business Team at Samsung India. This level of interactivity can only be achieved if the education sector focuses not only on devices that motivate students to be active participants in their own education,but solutions and content that increase collaboration and networking in the learning environment.</p>
<p>When asked about the project,Lata Vaidyanathan,Principal,Modern School,Barakhamba,said,We want our students to experience new,interactive ways of learning and have them engage better with their teachers and enhance their overall learning experience and retention,</p>
<p>The Samsung School solution has already been used in several Korean schools as a pilot project,and is currently being implemented in more than 20 schools around the world,from Africa and Asia to Europe and North America.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1114491&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/05/aru-galgotia.jpg" align="left" vspace="4" border="0"></a>Anglia Ruskin University UK (ARU) have announced a new arrangement in collaboration with Galgotias University in Greater Noida,which will to make an accredited engineering undergraduate programme accessible to more Indian students.</p>
<p>As per the arrangement,students will study a three-years B Tech Civil Engineering programme at Galgotias University and transfer to the third year of a BEng Civil Engineering at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8221;While a three-year undergraduate degree course from a UK university can cost between Rs 48-59 lakh,which includes tuition fees,accommodation and subsistence,under the ARU-Galgotias agreement a student can study the third year of his or her course at around Rs 14 lakh at ARU,&#8221; said Professor Michael Thorne,Vice Chancellor of Anglia Ruskin University.</p>
<p>On successful completion of the third year,ARU will award them a BEng Civil Engineering,which will immediately give them Incorporated Engineer status with the Institution of Civil Engineers,the association which qualifies professionals engaged in civil engineering,Thorne added. </p>
<p>This means that students can work towards chartered status at one-third of the cost  the cost for completing the third year at ARU. Students can then go on to achieve full chartered status by completing a relevant postgraduate programme.</p>
<p>Over the last three years 2009-2012,approximately 3000-4500 Indian Engineers enrolled at Universities in the United Kingdom to study postgraduate programmes each year. However,very few of them succeed in gaining work experience related to engineering in the UK. One of the ways of improving their chances to do this is to gain &#8216;Chartered Engineer&#8217; status. </p>
<p>&#8221;An essential requirement for this is that they should have an undergraduate qualification from an institution that is accredited by one of the accrediting bodies,&#8221; said Thorne.</p>
<p>Anglia Ruskin University offers a full range of postgraduate programmes relating to civil engineering and engineering management. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1110554&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even as opposition to the implementation of the four-year under-graduate programme in Delhi University gathers momentum,most departments and faculties have approved the new syllabus.</p>
<p>Under the format for the four-year programme,a student has to study 11 foundation papers and two papers on Integrating Mind,Body and Heart. Over the four years,a student will appear for 20 papers,including two research papers,in the major discipline. There will also be six papers of minor discipline and four applied papers.</p>
<p>The empowered committees,set up especially for charting out the syllabus,have already drawn up the course for the 11 foundation papers. The departments concerned are now working towards making the syllabus for the disciplines and applied courses.</p>
<p>Almost 99 per cent of the syllabus is ready and passed in the faculties and departments. Two departments  history and sociology  are yet to submit the new curriculum. All procedures for getting the four-year courses on track will be over by the second week of May, Director (South Campus) Umesh Rai said.</p>
<p>Certain departments have also approved the syllabi for discipline and applied courses. These include English,Economics,Psychology,Philosophy,Computer Science,Commerce and Microbiology.</p>
<p>More than 80 per cent of teachers have been involved in the curriculum formation of the four-year under-graduate programme. A few teachers did give their dissent. However,one should not look at the dissent in a negative light,as different views were expressed during these meetings. The number of teachers who approved of the curriculum was greater. In History department,a general body meeting of teachers was held,during which a resolution in favour of the four-year programme was passed despite several notes of dissent, Rai said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,a few Economics teachers have written to the department head alleging that the Committee of Courses (CoCs),which passed the four-year under-graduate curriculum is faulty and illegal. They said that some names figured on the committee list too often and the seniority by rotation was not adhered to. </p>
<p>The letter has been signed by 15 teachers from Shri Ram College of Commerce,Miranda House,Hindu and Ramjas.</p>
<p>The Faculty of Arts,which approved the curriculum on April 26,also saw teachers giving their dissent. Signed by 15 teachers,the dissent note said the courses were passed without proper deliberations about the academic reasons for the shift to the four-year format. </p>
<p>The structure of the proposed four-year under-graduate programme has not been discussed in the Faculty before being adopted by the Academic Council&#8230;. The departments have been directed to make the syllabi for the courses in less than 15 days. Teachers,therefore,have been compelled to prepare courses and syllabi within an unreasonable time constraint, the letter said.</p>
<p>Moreover,staff councils of some colleges have also opposed the implementation of the four-year programme. </p>
<p><b>Under new four-year programme</b></p>
<p>A student will study 11 foundation papers</p>
<p>2 papers on Integrating Mind,Body and Heart</p>
<p>A student will appear for 20 papers,including 2 research papers</p>
<p>Will also have 6 papers of minor discipline and 4 applied papers</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1108914&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legendary Mathematics wizard Shakuntala Devi,dubbed as the world&#8217;s fastest &#8216;human computer&#8217; and who made complex mental calculations as a child prodigy,died at a hospital here today following respiratory problems.</p>
<p>Devi,who has enthralled fans with her prowess for decades,was 83.</p>
<p>&#8220;She passed away at Bangalore Hospital,&#8221; Shakuntala Devi Educational Foundation Public Trust Trustee D C Shivadev said. Doctors declared her dead at 8.15 AM,he said.</p>
<p>Devi was hospitalised a couple of weeks ago for critical respiratory problems,Shivadev said. &#8220;She developed heart and kidney problems later,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>A household name in India,Devi cast a spell adding a 16-digit number with another one and multipliying the result with an equal array of numbers almost instantaneously,finding the cube root of the resultant and pops up with an answer in just about the time taken for a wink.</p>
<p>Devi,who had no formal education and who simply picked up reading and writing,had the ingenous ability to tell the day of the week of any given date in the last century in a jiffy.</p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s gift. A divine quality,&#8221; is how Devi had once felt of her unique distinction that began showing visibility since the age of three. She has been quoted as saying that none in her family showed any signs of the same head for figures. &#8220;Not even remotely,although my dad was a stage magician.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rated as one in 58 million for her stupendous mathematical feats by one of the fastest super-computers ever invented&#8211;the Univac-1108&#8211;,Devi believed in using grey cells to silicon chips.</p>
<p>Born on November four,1939,Devi figured in the Guiness Book of World Record for her outstanding ability and wrote numerous books like &#8216;Fun with Numbers&#8217;,'Astrology for You&#8217;,'Puzzles to Puzzle You&#8217;,and &#8216;Mathablit&#8217;.</p>
<p>Hailing from a simple orthodox Kannada Brahmin family,Devi&#8217;s father was a circus performer who did trapeze,tightrope and cannonball shows. He had rebelled against becoming a temple priest.</p>
<p>Devi was also an astrologer and gave remedies purportedly based on date and time of birth.</p>
<p>It was while Devi was playing cards with her father at the tender age of three that he found his daughter&#8217;s calculation abilities. It turned out that she beat him not by sleight of hand,but by memorising the cards.</p>
<p>At the age of six,she demonstrated her calculation skills in her first major public performance at the University of Mysore and two years later,she again proved herself successful as a child prodigy at Annamalai University.</p>
<p>However,despite apprehensions in some quarters,Devi did not lose her calculating ability when she turned adult like other prodigies such as Truman Henry Safford.</p>
<p>In 1977,Devi extracted the 23rd root of a 201-digit number mentally. In the same year in Dallas,she competed with a computer to see who gives the cube root of 188138517 faster and she won.</p>
<p>On June 18,1980 she demonstrated the multiplication of two 13-digit numbers 7,686,369,774,870 x 2,465,099,745,779 picked at random by the Computer Department of Imperial College,London. She answered the question in 28 seconds flat.</p>
<p>This event is mentioned in the 1995 Guinness Book of Records.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do children dread mathematics?&#8221;,she was once asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the wrong approach. Because it is looked at as a subject,&#8221; pat came her reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mathematics is life,you have math in everything,right from time to your date of birth to the food you eat and the air you breathe,&#8221; she states. The right age to train children in mathematics is six,says Shakuntala,who sparkled at three.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1105620&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Land has been identified for the Dehradun campus of IIM,Kashipur,Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna said today.</p>
<p>Bahuguna,who held a meeting with a team of officials from IIM,said a campus of the premier business school in the city would be of great benefit to residents.</p>
<p>Noting that a lot of industries would come up across the state in the near future,he said the youth would benefit from industrialisation only if they were technically well-equipped and skilled.</p>
<p>Lauding the progress made by IIM,Kashipur,the Chief Minister said its campus in Dehradun would make it easier for working people in the city and adjoining areas to get a degree in MBA.</p>
<p>Bahuguna also gave his approval for construction of an auditorium and a hostel at IIM,Kashipur,saying a plan of action had been prepared to develop institutions of higher and technical education in the state.He directed the Principal Secretary (Power) to provide a power feeder to IIM,Kashipur.</p>
<p>Bahuguna assured IIM authorities that he would write to the Railway Minister requesting him to launch a Jan Shatabdi express on Delhi-Moradabad-Ramnagar-Kashipur route for better connectivity. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1101996&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In another warning,the school education department issued a notice to Jennifer Dias,principal of St Xaviers School at Dhobi Talao,on April 8 to immediately step down or face consequences. </p>
<p>In an earlier notice on February 11,the department had told the school management that Dias could not continue as it had not approved her appointment to the post of principal. The notice said there were several shortcomings in the proposal by the management for her appointment. </p>
<p>In a swap at the top in 2010,Dias,principal of St Marys,was transferred to St Xaviers and Father Pinto,principal of St Xaviers since 1998,was shifted to St Marys. </p>
<p>The education department said the two Jesuit institutes were run by different managements/trusts and government rules allowed transfers only between schools run by the same management. </p>
<p>It said the schools should have made fresh appointments and termed the swap illegal. </p>
<p>St Xaviers challenged the order in Bombay High Court (HC),which directed the education inspector (south zone) to take a decision in accordance with law. </p>
<p>In the latest notice that follows the HC order,the education department said in reply to its previous notice,the school management said it had filed a writ in HC justifying the appointment.</p>
<p>The court has neither passed an interim order nor has it directed the department to allow Dias to continue. Dias should step down with immediate effect, said Babasaheb Mane,education inspector of south zone. </p>
<p>He said,We rejected the proposals,but the school managements still appointed Dias and Pinto. We will not approve salary grant applications and other important documents signed by Dias. We have authorised another senior teacher of the school,so that students do not suffer. </p>
<p>Dias could not be reached despite several attempts. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1101759&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) has decided to offer legal studies as an elective subject from the coming academic session for students of class XI and XII. </p>
<p>The Board has written a letter in this regard to schools asking them to submit their expression of interest,officials said. </p>
<p>According to the letter,the subject is being offered as a pilot course on first-come-first-serve basis to around 20 schools in class XI from the academic session 2013-2014. </p>
<p>&#8220;It can be offered as an elective subject with any combination of three other electives and a language,&#8221; the letter said. </p>
<p>The aim is to provide exposure on various systems of law such as common law,civil law,Hindu law,Islamic law,among others,and to help students form an understanding of rights,duties and various categories of liability principles which form the bedrock for an understanding of law. </p>
<p>The move,which would prove a boon for legal aspirants,comes against the backdrop of UGC also deciding to introduce a one-year LLM programme in universities from academic year 2013-14. </p>
<p>According to CBSE,legal studies will comprise units such as historical evolution of Indian legal system,civil and criminal courts and processes,theory and nature of political institutions,nature and sources of law,family justice system,arbitration and tribunal adjudication. </p>
<p>It will also include human rights in India,international context and legal profession in India. </p>
<p>The proposal is to introduce one module in Class XI and a second module in Class XII. </p>
<p>CBSE hopes the subject will also help aspiring lawyers develop and understand the essential features of the Indian Constitution,including the role and importance of fundamental rights. </p>
<p>It will also provide exposure to structure and operation of courts,concept of precedent in judicial functioning,the process of legislation and basic principles of statutory interpretation. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1099903&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To get aspiring business leaders from foreign countries join their courses,IIMs are now trying to get accreditation from two global bodies and the authority to award degrees rather than diplomas in business management.</p>
<p>&#8220;Considerable progress has been made towards enabling the IIMs to award degrees rather than diplomas. Though the PGDM of the IIMs is very well recognised in industry,a degree would help in strengthening the reputation of the IIMs internationally,&#8221; IIM Kolkata&#8217;s outgoing director Shekhar Chaudhuri said.</p>
<p>The Ministry of HRD is already considering giving the IIMs the authority to award degrees through an Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>The authority to award degrees will provide tremendous academic flexibility to the IIMs to develop a variety of programmes that are not feasible today,he said.</p>
<p>The IIMs have so far been awarding two-year post-graduate diploma in management (PGDM) which is equivalent to an MBA.</p>
<p>The elite chain of B-schools have also been working for the last four-five years to get themselves accredited by the Association of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).</p>
<p>Stating that they are hoping accreditation early next year,Chaudhuri said they have also decided to get another accreditation from the Association of Master of Business Administration (AMBA) in sync with the international trend of having triple accreditation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our long term goal is to get full time international students to join our PGP (Post Graduation Program). Accreditation by AACSB and AMBA would help in that endeavour,&#8221; Chaudhuri said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1098871&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cholakkodan Aysha,hailed as the brand ambassador of Kerala&#8217;s universal literacy mission,passed away at her residence at nearby Kavannur.</p>
<p>Aysha,80,had been keeping indifferent health for some time and breathed her last yesterday,family members said. She is survived by six children.</p>
<p>An &#8216;icon&#8217; of Kerala&#8217;s successful literacy campaign which set a model for the entire country,Aysha had declared that Kerala has achieved total literacy on April 18,1991,at a big public meeting in Kozhikode,in the presence of then Chief Minister E K Nayanar.</p>
<p>Hailing from an educationally and economically back wardvillage,Aysha inspired thousands of women,especially from the Muslim community in the area,to become literate.</p>
<p>After acquiring basic reading and writing skills by attending literacy classes,she later passed the seventh standard equivalent examination due to her studious efforts.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1098160&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crucial meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education,expected to discuss issues such as a national testing agency,began today with HRD Minister M M Pallam Raju stressing the need for focusing on expansion,equity and excellence in education.</p>
<p>Raju emphasised on a participatory approach in which the Central and state governments,academics and autonomous institutes should join hands for a greater cause of education in the country.</p>
<p>Focus should be laid on the need for focusing on expansion,equity and excellence in all levels of education, he said at the meeting attended by state education ministers,university vice-chancellors,heads of different education boards and academicians.</p>
<p>The Central Advisory Board of Education is expected to deliberate on the need for a national testing agency,which will conduct a host of national level examination such as UGC Net,GATE,AIEEE and IIT Main.</p>
<p>According to officials,the centralised body could be created through a special purpose vehicle and it would not be binding for the different examination bodies to join in it.</p>
<p>The agency could be on a voluntary basis,officials said.</p>
<p>Apart from reviewing the implementation of the Right to Education and ICT in higher education,the meeting would also discuss the proposed education commission,the setting up of which was announced by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his speech on Independence Day in 2011.</p>
<p>A draft note has already been prepared about the contours of the proposed body as well as the terms and reference</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1096597&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aiming to enhance academic and research partnership with US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology,India today proposed exchange of scientists with MIT on flexible terms and widening the scope to include industrial research.</p>
<p>Science and Technology Minister S Jaipal Reddy said the scope of the present collaboration in area of biotechnology with MIT can be increased to include other areas of mutual interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an ongoing partnership with MIT,particularly in the area of biotechnology. I propose the exchange of scientists from India to MIT and from MIT to India on highly flexible terms,also an understanding between CSIR and MIT,&#8221; he told reporters here after addressing the Rai Foundation Luncheon Talk organised by ASSOCHAM.</p>
<p>Reddy said that MIT&#8217;s collaboration with Indian institutions will enhance the research base for both the countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important for us to note that original research in India is still almost completely funded by the government. We have real talent in these government funded laboratories. We appreciate that. I think we will strengthen our collaboration</p>
<p>with MIT,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The function was attended by MIT&#8217;s President Dr Rafael Reif who is visiting India to explore opportunities for academic and research collaborations. Lord Swaraj Paul was also present on the occasion.</p>
<p>Asked about any particular area of research India is interested in promoting with MIT,Reddy said,&#8221;Right now,as I said,collaboration is going on in the field of biotechnology. It can be extended to other areas such as industrial research.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reif told reporters he is open to collaboration with the Indian institutions,both in public and private sectors.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1094911&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Civil Services (Main) examination will be held in November or December this year and applications for it will be called in August or September,according to a notification issued by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).</p>
<p>UPSC,which conducts the prestigious examinations to select IAS,IPS and IFS officers among others,has in a recently issued public notice dropped the mandatory English language paper from the main test.</p>
<p>It has also restored the earlier practice of two qualifying papers,the marks obtained of which will not be counted for ranking.</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers on Indian languages and English will be of matriculation or equivalent standard and will be of qualifying nature only. The marks obtained in these papers will not be counted for ranking,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>UPSC had on March 5 issued a circular giving more weightage to English language. The move had led to an uproar inside and outside Parliament forcing the government to keep it in abeyance on March 15.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may also be noted that there is no change in the pattern of Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination,which will be held on May 26,2013,&#8221; it said. The last date for filling online application for Civil Services preliminary examination is April 4.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1094901&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Aligarh Muslim University has done away with the provision of allowing students short of attendance to appear in annual examination provided there are medical grounds. The university has decided that 75 per cent attendance would be compulsory for appearing in the annual examination from the next academic session. </p>
<p>The university took the decision after nearly 60 students,led by AMU student union leaders,created a ruckus on March 23,demanding relaxation for students who have not been allowed this year to appear in examination as their attendance was below 65 per cent. Their attendance was short even after getting 10 per cent relaxation on medical grounds. Five persons were injured in that incident of violence and stone pelting on campus. Agitated students had allegedly attacked the car of Vice-Chancellor Lt Gen (Retd) Zameer Uddin Shah. </p>
<p>A 75 per cent attendance is compulsory for appearing in the annual examination. But university had been giving relaxations up to 10 per cent to those students who submitted medical certificates. Now that relaxation would not be given, said AMU spokesperson Rahat Abrar. </p>
<p>The V-C on Thursday issued an open letter to students,stating that 75 per cent attendance will be compulsory from the next academic session and medical certificate will not be accepted. Shah said that he believed medical certificates in most cases were fake. He said that he had no objection to peaceful protests but blocking of roads and locking university gates will not be tolerated and students indulging in such illegal acts will be punished. He urged the students to keep the so-called student netas in check,or he will be compelled to use corrective measures which,being the guardian of the students,he did not want to use.</p>
<p>The V-C said that he had resolved not to order closure of AMU or permit police on the campus,unless things went absolutely out of control or life and property were threatened. Shah stated that his resolve had been tested by indiscipline of office bearers of the students union and there was an attempt to attack his car when he was leaving office on March 23.</p>
<p>The V-C lamented the cowardly behaviour that some students allegedly showed in the Kennedy Hall by shouting and blowing whistles in the dark and said such behaviour was seen in third-rate cinema halls. He urged students to observe proper decorum.</p>
<p>It was the second open letter of the V-C to students within a fortnight. In his letter on March 15,he had stated that a katta (country made pistol) culture was prevalent on the campus and unauthorised goondas were staying in the university halls.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1094762&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid a nation-wide controversy,the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has withdrawn changes suggested by it in civil services mains examination,dropping mandatory English language paper requirement.</p>
<p>UPSC,which conducts the prestigious examination to select IAS,IPS and IFS officers among other,issued a corrigendum on Tuesday restoring the earlier practice of two qualifying papers in any Indian language and English,the marks obtained on which will not be counted for ranking.</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers on Indian languages and English will be of matriculation or equivalent standard and will be of qualifying nature only. The marks obtained in these papers will not be counted for ranking,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The aim of papers on Indian language and English is to test the candidates&#8217; ability to read and understand serious discursive prose,and to express their ideas clearly and correctly,the corrigendum said.</p>
<p>There will also be separate papers on &#8220;ethics,integrity and aptitude&#8221; and &#8220;essay&#8221; of 250 marks each for the candidates taking the mains examination. The paper on ethics,integrity and aptitude will include questions to test candidates&#8217; attitude and approach to issues relating to integrity,probity in public life and his problem- solving approach to various issues and conflicts faced by him in dealing with society.</p>
<p>The aspirants will be required to write an essay on a specific topic and in their own choice of language. Under the earlier controversial norm put forth by the Commission,a language would be allowed as the medium of examination only if a minimum of 25 candidates wanted it. &#8220;It may also be noted that there is no change in the pattern of Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination,which will be held on May 26,2013,&#8221; UPSC said. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1094331&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Only 26 per cent of 6,027 MBA students in 96 management colleges across the state managed to clear all the papers of their first semester examinations held in January this year. These colleges are affiliated to the Gujarat Technological University (GTU) that also takes care of engineering and pharmacy institutes as well.</p>
<p>However,the remaining 74 per cent of students,who received ATKT (allowed to keep term) for having failed in one to four subjects,were promoted to the second semester. According to university authorities,they were promoted to the next semester under a policy in most of the Indian universities though it has come under criticism from some quarters.</p>
<p>The university officials,in private conversation,admit that this is not a good trend in management education who are excepted to take up challenging assignments after completion of their degrees. But they say this is the trend all over the country excepting a few well-known management institutes.</p>
<p>But Vice-Chancellor Akshai Aggarwal tried to make light of the results by saying that the pass percentage in six,out of seven subjects,was from 63.7 per cent to 88.4 per cent. It was only in Quantitative Analysis paper involving mathematical calculations that 51 per cent of the students failed,bringing down the overall pass percentage to merely 26 per cent.</p>
<p>University officials said most of the students having received ATKT or failed in one to four subjects were from colleges in mofussil towns where there was no proper arrangement of teachers and libraries. Officials said the performance of students in cities like Ahmedabad,Vadodara and Surat was,however,satisfactory.</p>
<p>Aggarwal said there was acute shortage of teachers in management institutes located in smaller towns.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1094004&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Management students can find new perspectives in Pune-based Hemant Karadikars book,Lead to Regenerate.</i></p>
<p>Thinking through case studies and imagining how they would deal with situations at work is a common task for management students. So picture this: Anil,a young man in your office,is shy and rarely participated in discussions. He is not entirely comfortable conversing in English and his colleagues often ignore him. What would a manager do in this scenario? </p>
<p>Hemant Karandikar tells the rest of the story. One day,Anil approached me and pointed to me the test set-up he had put up. He had discovered some major flaws in our system. I brought our other team members together and showed them what Anil had achieved. This changed their perception of Anil. Karandikar might sound like a natural leader,but his talent for solving problems and getting the best out of everyone comes from 30 years of managerial and consulting experience at firms such as Tata Power and Philips; experience that he now intends to make accessible to every aspiring leader. </p>
<p>In his new book,Lead to Regenerate,Karandikar has compiled lessons,case studies and scenarios on topics such as innovation,business strategy and people management. The book is based on my experiences and also of the many people I worked with, says Karandikar. </p>
<p>The book is currently being used as a teaching tool at a university in the US. In India,it is available online and will soon be available at bookstores also. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1093231&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>City educationists and counsellors talk about how students can plan judiciously for examinations.</i></p>
<p>Sweaty hands,frown lines,hurried discussions in corridors and frantic dashes to the teachers room  college exams are impending and there are telling signs of it everywhere. While some students panic habitually,others develop cold feet thinking how they would get through,and add to it the constant pressure of parents,teachers and peers  the combination is nothing less than deadly. </p>
<p>Ashish Kulkarni (name changed),a student of Neville Wadia Institute of Management Studies (NWIMS),knows the feeling only too well. He suffered a mild heart attack days before his exam last year and had to be admitted to Ruby Hall. Recalling the incident,Anuradha Sarkar,IT head and course coordinator of MCM program at NWIMS,says,When we went to meet him in the hospital,Kulkarni said he wont be able to write the exam. However,I motivated him and suggested that he should at least try to write the theory exam and later give practicals,so that he doesnt lose a year. Sarkar arranged notes and assignments of other students to help Kulkarni. He wrote the exam,and scored fairly well, she says. </p>
<p>Sarkar adds that over the years,she has seen many students getting stressed out ahead of exams. I tell them to make their own notes while studying,as it gets them in the habit of writing. Another advice is to make a column besides their notes and jot down key points,so that during revision,they just need to take a look to know what the answer should be. Going through question banks is also very helpful, she says. </p>
<p>Sandeep Meshram,associate professor and head of training and placement cell in College of Engineering Pune (COEP),has also seen many students getting stressed during exams,to the point that they are unable to perform even what they know the most. He raises the red flag to skipping meals and sleep before the exams. Students do that often and then collapse out of exhaustion in the examination hall, he says,emphasising the need to maintain a daily routine that includes time for studies as well as leisure. </p>
<p>Counselor Hassini Krshna advocates a simple tip that works very well: plan ahead and avoid discussing with friends right outside the examination hall. </p>
<p>Psychotherapist Parul Khona says,About a week ago,a student approached me saying she was unable to concentrate on studies,which was,in turn,causing a lot of stress. The problem was that she had been grounded by her parents,who wanted her to spend the entire day with books. That is not a solution at all. According to Khona,the only way to deal with stress is to create a timetable depending on the syllabus and the number of hours. There is an alarming trend of college students gulping down strong black coffee. It damages the system and messes the hormonal balance, says Khona. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1093230&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teaching and non-teaching staff from several private institutes have not been getting their salaries for the past few months. </p>
<p>Meanwhile,the institutes claim they are yet to get their dues from the Social Welfare Department (SWD). They claim that they are running on losses,with dues of some institutes going up to Rs 100 crore.</p>
<p>A professor from one of the Sinhagad institutes said,We have not been getting our pay since November. Even one month without pay is difficult. It has been four months now,and we are yet to receive any money. Recently,we got a proposition from the college,asking us to apply for a personal loan against our pending salary with a maximum limit of Rs 5 lakh on each of us. The college has said it will pay the EMI. But we are worried.</p>
<p>Admitting that they have been unable to pay the salaries since November,the Sinhagad education society said they have made alternative arrangement for their staff.</p>
<p>Yes,we have asked the teachers to take a personal loan from Central Bank of India. Our education society has entered an agreement with the bank where we will pay the interest. Almost 90 per cent staff have already availed this facility and only 10 per cent remain. They too will get their salaries within four to five days, said MN Navale,founder-president,Sinhgad Technical Education Society.</p>
<p>However,the teachers are worried that taking the personal loan will mean being tied to the institution for the next three years. The college has not yet shown any written agreement with the bank. We have just been told that they will give the EMI on our loans,but what if they dont? asks a professor from Sinhagad institute. Another thing is what about the three years re-payment period of the loan document. What if we want to leave the institute? Will the college still pay back our loans? </p>
<p>Responding to such a query,Navale said,We will pay the EMI on pending salaries even if the teacher wishes to leave the institute. We have been facing delay in payment from SWD for the past three to four years. Currently,an amount of Rs 1,12.5 crore is pending with the SWD. Last year,we filed a writ petition in court regarding this. It was repeated this year too.</p>
<p>Executive director MIT group of institutes Rahul Karad said,Fee is the main source of income of any institute. Only when we get full fee will we able to pay our staff. Reserved category students do not pay any fee,as the government is supposed to reimburse their fee. But if the reimbursement of scholarships for reserved category students do not come on time,the institute is left to fend for itself. MIT group of institutes have over 45 crore fund pending with the SWD which has made paying the staff literally a struggle.</p>
<p>But this is not the first time SWD has failed to provide funds on time. The worst-affected are the smaller private institutions,who have no other way of getting funds. For the past two years,we are facing the same problem. We too had entered an agreement with the Bank of India in the past,but this time even that arrangement could not be worked out. We have not been able to pay the teachers since February. The department is saying that the funds will be available only in July. An amount of Rs 4.5 crore is pending with the department, said RP Joshi,director of PVG college of Engineering and Technology.</p>
<p>When contacted,assistant commissioner of social welfare department MM Atram said,I look after the reimbursement of fee,belonging to SC and ST,and as far as that is concerned,83.57 per cent of the fee has been reimbursed to colleges. Out of the budgetary allocation of 875.15 crore,716.30 crore has been released. The problem lies with the OBC fee reimbursement.</p>
<p>When contacted,joint director of SWD Sadanand Patil,who looks after the VJNT and OBC category,said,We have disbursed the amount received by us from the budget to district officer Ravindra Patil Kadam. There is also a 40-crore balance left after disbursement. So I do not know why there is still a fee reimbursement problem. </p>
<p>Despite repeated attempts,SWDs Additional Commissioner Ravindra Kadam Patil was unavailable for comments. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1093338&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Demanding the release of their long-pending salaries,regularisation of jobs and implementation of regular pay scales,teachers from various districts of Punjab gathered in Ludhiana and protested against the state government on Sunday.</p>
<p>The teachers were covered different government schemes like Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA),Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS). They took out their protest from Dana Mandi to Mini-Secretariat.</p>
<p>The teachers under CSS were particularly agitated as their salaries have not been released for the past one year.</p>
<p>Deedar Singh,president,Teachers Union Punjab,under whose leadership the 6-km-long protest march was carried out,said,The government is simply not listening to our pleas,and they cannot even imagine how a teacher runs his/her home without salaries. We want the state government to immediately act on our list of demands.</p>
<p>He added that despite meetings with the chief minister and the other authorities on March 2 this year where they were promised fulfilment of their demands like inclusion of CSS teachers under the Education Department within a week and formation of a policy to regularise SSA/RMSA teachers in 15 days,the teachers in actual had got nothing but just promises. </p>
<p>The teachers also demanded implementation of regular pay scales for SSA/RMSA primary and upper primary teachers from the beginning of financial year 2013-14.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of cases against 59 teachers during Bathinda protest in 2012 and six-month maternity leave are among the other main demands of the teachers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1092770&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The University of Oxford has been forced to review its post-graduate admissions policy after it was accused by a student of discriminating against the poor.</p>
<p>Damien Shannon,26,had sued St Hugh&#8217;s College at the world-renowned university,for &#8220;selecting students on the basis of wealth and excluding those not in possession of it&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;St Hugh&#8217;s College and Damien Shannon are pleased to announce that they have resolved the dispute between them,and that the court proceedings in Manchester County Court are at an end with immediate effect,&#8221; the university said in a statement issued yesterday.</p>
<p>It will now re-examine the policy under which its colleges select students on their ability to prove they have the up-front resources to pay tens of thousands of pounds for both tuition fees and living expenses.</p>
<p>&#8220;On completion of the review,recommendations will be put to the University&#8217;s Council and the Conference of Colleges for consideration. It is anticipated that the process will be completed by September 2013,&#8221; the university statement added.</p>
<p>The review will help counter allegations of elitism at one of the world&#8217;s best known educational institutions,which prides itself on promoting academic merit.</p>
<p>Shannon had been unable to take up his offer at the university last year after it found he did not have 12,900 pounds living costs.</p>
<p>In an email to students,St Hugh&#8217;s College said the college and the History Faculty of the University of Oxford have jointly made available to Shannon a place on the one-year MSc in Economic and Social History,the course for which he originally applied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both parties have agreed to pay their own costs and no moneys have changed hands,&#8221; it read.</p>
<p>St Hugh&#8217;s,the alma mater of Myanmarese leader Aung San Suu Kyi,had claimed in court papers that the test of a student&#8217;s financial health was in place to ensure students were able to complete their courses without suffering financial difficulty and anxiety.</p>
<p>It said in its defence that the inability to meet the financial guarantee,which was formalised across the university in 2010,did not fall &#8220;disproportionately within&#8221; the lower socio-economic groups.</p>
<p>However,the director of graduate admissions at Oxford University had to apologise to the judge hearing the case after erroneously claiming that other universities had the same admissions practices.</p>
<p>It is believed negotiations between Shannon and the university&#8217;s lawyers and admissions office started last month and were finalised on Friday.</p>
<p>The legal action was revealed by the &#8216;Observer&#8217; in a report earlier this year,which also found that around 1,000 students a year turn down post-graduate places won at Oxford because of the high financial demands involved. This amounts to 15 per cent of the 7,500 students offered a place,according to the admissions office.</p>
<p>Hazel Blears,the former Labour cabinet minister and Shannon&#8217;s constituency MP for Salford and Eccles,said she hoped the case would lead to a fairer policy and establish means-tested scholarships for students from less affluent backgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damien has worked incredibly hard in pushing for this because,like me,he believes that insisting students must prove they have 13,000 pounds towards living costs is deeply unfair,especially for those from poorer backgrounds,&#8221; she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1092450&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Government is committed to providing 4.5 per cent job reservation to backward Muslims and trying to expedite the matter pending before the Supreme Court,Minority Affairs Minister K Rahman Khan said today.</p>
<p>Addressing National Editors&#8217;s Conference here,Khan said the reservation for backward Muslims was a promise made by Congress in its election manifesto.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had said in our manifesto that we will provide reservation to backward Muslims as per the Karnataka and Kerala mode of quota within quota. In both the states,it has been upheld by the courts.</p>
<p>&#8220;After the Andhra Pradesh High Court order rejecting it,the matter is now before the Supreme Court. We are trying to expedite the matter. We are committed to it,&#8221; Khan said.</p>
<p>The decision taken by the Union Cabinet on December 23,2011 and latter notified aimed at carving out a sub-quota of 4.5 per cent for minorities within the 27 per cent reservation for OBCs.</p>
<p>The decision was based on the recommendation of Rangnath Mishra-headed National Commission for Religious and Linguistic Minorities and taken a few months before the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.</p>
<p>Khan also rejected the charge that the recommendations of Sachar Committee were not implemented fully and said 69 of the 72 recommendations out of a total 76 of the committee have already been implemented while work is in progress on other three including setting up of an Equal Opportunity Commission,National Data Bank and Diversity Index.</p>
<p>Admitting lack of speed in implementation of schemes and shorcomings in their monitoring,the minister said he is going to &#8220;revamp&#8221; the entire monitoring system. </p>
<p>Khan said he is striving to bring in non-official members,including those from NGOs,in distict and state-level monitoring committees as administrative officers hardly have time for such exercises.</p>
<p>The minister also put the blame on states for poor implementation of some of the schemes saying they do not submit utilization certificates in time.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the financial year 2013-14,the earmarked budget for the Ministry is around Rs. 3511 Crore. We have already set our priorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of this,among various development and welfare programmes,the Ministry intends to spend Rs. 1250 crore on Area Development in 710 Minority Concentration Blocks and 66 Towns and Rs. 1770 crore on scholarship programmes,&#8221; Khan said.</p>
<p>He said his ministry is in the process of formulating a scheme for skill development of minorities. &#8220;The Ministry intends to intervene to help workers engaged in growth-oriented sectors to become part of the larger market network,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the Budget this year,among other initiative,a sum of Rs. 100 crore has been allocated to Maulana Azad Education Foundation for providing medical aid to minorities. The scheme is being formulated to cover critical ailments. The modalities to release the funds are under consideration,&#8221; Khan said.</p>
<p>Regarding the ministry&#8217;s ambitious proposal for setting up five central universities under the aegis of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation with focus on minorities,Khan said &#8220;an expert committee of prominent educationists,headed by a former UGC Chairman,was constituted which has submitted its final report to the Ministry of Minority Affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The report is under examination in the Ministry,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said the bill regarding the setting up of Equal Opportunity Commission is in final stages and has been sent to the Law Ministry.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1092429&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 1,000 students in four medical and dental colleges affiliated to the Gujarat University have decided to move the court against the universitys decision to hold its own entrance tests for admission to over 125 seats of post-graduate degree and diploma courses on April 28.</p>
<p>The students decision comes after the university authorities on Thursday clearly told them that there was no other alternative than to conduct its own entrance test because of the delay in the Supreme Court verdict on petitions challenging National Eligibility Entrance Test (NEET) conducted by the Medical Council of India ( MCI).</p>
<p>NEET,which is a common entrance test for admissions to post-graduate degree and diploma courses in medical and dental institutes across the country,was conducted between November and December 2012. Over 1,000 students from medical colleges affiliated to GU were among over one lakh students reported to have appeared for the NEET.</p>
<p>Under NEET,50 per cent PG seats are reserved for the students of the state where the colleges are located and the rest of the seats are under national quota. The new system was introduced to improve the standard of PG medical and dental education in the country.</p>
<p>However,some private college managements in Rajasthan,Maharashtra and some of the southern states challenged MCIs decision in the Supreme Court. The apex court ordered MCI not to declare NEET results till final decision.</p>
<p>According to GU authorities,the apex courts verdict was expected by the end of January 2013. But,there is no judgment in the case so far and the matter is still pending.</p>
<p>Pro vice-chancellor Dr Mukul Shah,when questioned over students opposing the university announcing to conduct PG admission tests,said the varsity had decided in favour of the students.</p>
<p>Shah explained that the last date for admission in PG courses was June 30 in all the medical colleges across the country and if SCs verdict did not come at least two months prior to the last date,it would not be possible to complete PG admissions and there were chances of the university having zero academic session for PG classes in 2013-14.</p>
<p>This,he said,would jeopardise the career of students and the government hospitals associated with the medical colleges would also not get resident doctors,thus hitting the health services.</p>
<p>That is why we have decided to conduct our own entrance tests, said Dr Shah,adding,the apex court had not restrained from conducting entrance tests,but only asked not to declare results.</p>
<p>He said the university would wait for the SC verdict. We will cancel our entrance tests if the apex court approves NEET. In case of delay,we will request the court to allow us to carry out admissions as was done previously so that students don\&#8217;t suffer, said Shah.</p>
<p>But one of the students leading the agitation and opposing the university decision,said it was not possible for students to prepare again at such a short notice for one of the toughest examinations.  We prepared for over nine months to appear for the NEET and now we are being asked to take another exam, said the student.</p>
<p><b>PIL against railway line by APSEZ rejected</b></p>
<p>The Gujarat High Court Friday dismissed a public interest litigation (IPL) that was objecting to a railway line that was being laid down by Adani Port &amp; Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) at Mundra in Kutch.</p>
<p>The PIL was moved by the sarpanch of Luni village near Mundra. The court dismissed their PIL while holding that the grievances ventilated by the petitioners could not be considered as public interest litigation.</p>
<p>The petitioners had contended that the authorities of APSEZ had been laying a 77-km long railway line in the region which had disturbed the natural flow of a river in the region. </p>
<p>They also contended that the APSEZ authorities had built parallel walls on either side of the railway track and it has divided the villages into two parts.</p>
<p>The petitioners demanded that wherever the railway line had disturbed the natural course of the river,there should a bridge and that the parallel walls on either side of the railway track be removed. They also demanded a direction to the development commissioner to find out if the railway line was laid as per the rules.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1092306&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four days after the UT Education Department said more than 400 seats under the EWS category in the entry-level classes were vacant in 48 private schools  over 336 seats in 35 private educational institutes and more than 54 in 13 minority schools  the city-based 35 unaided private schools on Friday declared that that they did not have any vacancies under the EWS quota,and said they wont admit any student unless and until the department clarified a few norms regarding the implementation of the RTE Act.</p>
<p>This,when 60 applications pertaining to admission under the EWS quota in private schools were received at the Government Model Senior Secondary School,Sector 19,on Friday.</p>
<p>The decision of private schools came after the Independent Schools Association (ISA) held its general body meeting at Vivek High School,Sector 38.</p>
<p>The schools said if the UT Administration wanted them to implement 25 per cent EWS quota under the RTE Act for pre-nursery and nursery classes then it should ask the Union Ministry of Human Resource and Development to issue a separate notification in this regard. Also,the administration should give in writing that they would reimburse the expenditure incurred on the EWS students by the private schools.</p>
<p>Furthermore,the schools also said the education department should clarify whether they have to implement 15 per cent EWS quota as per their 2005 notification or 25 per cent as mentioned by the RTE Act.</p>
<p>As per the UT Administration 2005 notification,private schools can charge a nominal fee from EWS students,preferably the same as is charged from the students of government students.</p>
<p>The ISA also referred to the Delhi High Court judgment,dated February 19,which read that it is the right time for the Government to consider the applicability of Right to Education Act to the nursery as well&#8230;. Hence,we only observe that to avail the benefit of the Right to Education Act to child seeking (admission) for nursery school as well,necessary amendment should be considered by the State.</p>
<p>ISA president H S Mamik said,The UT Education Department is asking us to imsplement the Act,but they failed to reimburse an amount of over Rs 84 lakh incurred by us on EWS students in the last two years. We are filing a case against them in the Punjab and Haryana High Court shortly.</p>
<p>Let the EWS families submit applications,we are not admitting any of them, he added.</p>
<p>When contacted,Director Public Instructions (Schools) Upkar Singh said,Our endeavour is to implement RTE Act in letter and spirit. We have to give equitable justice to all our stakeholders.</p>
<p>However,slamming the Education Department,Sangita Vardhan of Vatsal Chaya,an NGO,said she failed to understand how the authorities could pressure the private schools to fill the EWS seats when they failed to admit students to government schools.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1092304&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>BankBazaar.com CEO Adhil Shetty explains ways one can make strategies for childs education</i></p>
<p>Planning for a childs education is an important financial goal in a persons life,which goes along with other important targets like childs marriage and your retirement. As a parent,it is natural for you to seek the best for your child. But remember the best is always expensive. Hence,planning for childs education in advance assumes great significance in financial planning,as it is concerned with your childs future. Lets look at a few important things to consider while you plan for your childs education.</p>
<p>Plan the place and time of education: Children today are smart enough to decide the type of education they want. However,as a parent,you must plan your childs future well in advance. One must decide if he wants his child to go abroad for his education or not. Also decide if you want to plan for his graduation or post-graduation. If you wish to send your child abroad for graduation as well as post-graduation,you should plan for both,as the cost can be pretty expensive. Determining these factors is very important for your next step of planning.</p>
<p>Cost of funding childs education: This is another variable which you must try and estimate with reasonable accuracy. After deciding where and when you would want to plan your childs education,you should determine how much it is going to cost you in present day term. Although this step is pretty simple,difficult part would be to estimate what it is going to cost you when your child is ready for his graduation/post-graduation. Remember that predicting inflation in school fees is much more difficult than predicting inflation for other expenses. This is because schools generally increase fees in bulk every 2-3 years,making average annual inflation numbers much higher than normal. Study historical trends and take an average annual inflation,more on the conservative side. You can apply this inflation number on present day costs and estimate how much it will cost in that particular year of study. Apart from school fees,you must also factor in other expenses like food,accommodation and other expenses. Estimate your total cash outflow and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Insure yourself sufficiently: If there is a sudden death of the breadwinner of the family,childs education plan suffers in most cases. This is because the family does not have sufficient insurance back-up to support education,as there may be other important priorities. Ensure that you have insured yourself adequately,considering all your financial goals,including your childs education. Take a simple term plan and do not opt for fancy products which promise your childs future,as these may prove to be costly and not that useful from an insurance perspective.</p>
<p>Make smart investments to build the corpus: When you have determined how much corpus you will need for your childs education,you must start to save to achieve this goal. To determine which kind of investments you must invest in to build this corpus,you should consider the number of years left for the goal. Generally short term goals are not funded by gold and equity. So if you are left with less than three years to fund your childs education,you must avoid these two investments and invest in debt and fixed income products. If the goal is about 3-10 years away from the present day,you can consider investing 50%-60% in equity,about 20% in gold and the remaining in debt instruments. Similarly if your childs education is more than 10 years away,you can consider investing 75% in equity,10%-20% in gold and the remaining in debt instruments. When you invest in equity,look at 3-5 good quality,highly rated mutual funds as these are far safer than direct equity investments. Remember not to dip into these investments to meet other goals,unless there is an emergency.</p>
<p>De-risk your portfolio when the goal is near: You must de-risk your portfolio when you are close to the time of your childs education. This means you must shift from high-risk investments like equity and gold,to safer investments with relatively lower risk,like fixed deposits and safe debt mutual funds. This can be done when the goal is less than three years away,in a systematic manner and not in one shot. The main purpose of de-risking your portfolio is to make sure your gains are not eroded due to the volatility and that the planned amount is available at the time it is needed.</p>
<p>Start today: Delaying savings is one of the main reasons of getting lower gains in your portfolio. Irrespective of your childs age and the time left for your goal,you must start investing for it today itself. The earlier one starts saving and investing,lesser the amount needed on a monthly basis to achieve the same corpus.</p>
<p>You can easily meet your childs education expenses by planning in advance,following simple steps and start investing at the earliest to achieve this goal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1092048&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The English essay paper of 100 marks in the 2013 UPSC Civil Services Main Examination,which raised a nation-wide controversy,has been dropped and the earlier practice of two qualifying papers in any Indian language and English restored,government said today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The English component (of 100 marks) from the Essay Paper will be dropped and the status quo ante of two qualifying papers of 300 marks each in any modern Indian language and in English  shall be restored,&#8221; Minister of State for Personnel V Narayanasamy said in the Lok Sabha.</p>
<p>In a statement on the issue,he said the essay paper would now be of 250 marks to be written in the medium or language of the candidate&#8217;s choice.</p>
<p>Bowing to all-round pressure in Parliament,government on March 15 had kept in abeyance the recent controversial notification of the UPSC,giving more weightage to English in these exams.</p>
<p>As before,the candidates would be allowed to use any one language from the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution or English as the medium of writing the examination,he said. </p>
<p>The controversial conditionality imposed by the Union Public Service Commission that language would be allowed as the medium of examination only if a minimum of 25 candidates wanted it has been dropped,Narayanasamy said. </p>
<p>Further,he said that a candidate would be allowed to take up literature as an optional subject &#8220;without the conditionality of having to do his/her graduation in that language&#8217;s literature.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Minister said these decisions were taken after the government took into account the views expressed by MPs in Parliament,representations on the notification and consultation with different agencies.</p>
<p>The government had kept the UPSC notification in abeyance after the two Houses of Parliament witnessed repeated uproar and adjournments,with members terming the notification as &#8220;unconstitutional&#8221; and demanding its rollback. They had also sought action against the UPSC chief and others responsible for the action,which they said went against regional languages. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1091360&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The admission for the new four-year undergraduate programme of Delhi University are expected to be based on cut-off percentage,which are established on the Class XII marks of the students,and the choice of major discipline of an applicant.</p>
<p>While the final admission criteria is yet to be decided,university officials said the existing system of cut-off percentages is expected to be retained for the July admissions.</p>
<p>The decision was among those discussed at a meeting of the committee constituted by Vice-Chancellor for framing of guidelines for admission,examination and time-table to be followed in the next academic session.</p>
<p>The committee also recommended increasing the number of seats in each discipline.</p>
<p>Virender Bhardwaj,a member of the committee and teacher at Shivaji College,said: The Delhi University is known for its Honours courses and this is going to be enhanced under the four-year programme&#8230;. In the four-year format,each student will get the opportunity to complete an Honours  baccalaureate with honours in the major discipline or a BTech degree  if he/she studies for four years. </p>
<p>The university had earlier decided to do away with the Programme courses under the four-year format.</p>
<p>Talking about the increase in the number of seats in the major discipline,Bhardwaj said,The seats of Programme courses in each college will be distributed among major disciplines,which the college will offer.</p>
<p><b>Honour roll</b></p>
<p>n   Under four-year format,admission based on the major discipline </p>
<p>n   Student can study 20 papers in major discipline over four years</p>
<p>n   Student will take six papers in a minor discipline</p>
<p>n    Student can leave a course after two,three or four years </p>
<p>n   A student who exits a course after two years will be an Associate Baccalaureate</p>
<p>n   Those leaving after three years will be Baccalaureate</p>
<p>n   After four years,a student will either get Baccalaureate with Honours in major or BTech degree </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1089732&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the four-year undergraduate programme set to be introduced from July,Delhi University is mulling over merging several undergraduate courses for students taking admission in the new session. </p>
<p>These primarily include BA (Hons) Journalism and BA (H) Mass Communication; and BA (H) Business Economics,Bachelor of Business Studies and Bachelor of Finance and Investment Analysis.</p>
<p>The idea is to do away with specialisation at the undergraduate level. Umesh Rai,director,South Campus,said,An undergraduate student should have broad knowledge of various subjects. Specialisation in subjects should take place at the postgraduate level. </p>
<p>Talking about the problems that plague undergraduate courses in subjects like Polymer Science,Microbiology,Business Economics,Rai said,If one looks at the Zoology department,for instance,there is no paper in Systems Biology which is in great demand. </p>
<p>With the new measure in place,university officials said,students seeking admission in Journalism and Mass Communication courses will not find themselves confounded with multiple names for the same course. We noticed that the modules in Journalism (H) and Mass Communication papers are almost the same. To keep the rigour of the discipline alive and to meet the needs of the market,we decided to alter the syllabus and to have a single degree, said Sangit Ragi,Deputy Dean (Academics). </p>
<p>While five colleges including Lady Shri Ram,Kalindi,Delhi College of Arts and Commerce offer BA (Honours) Journalism,Indraprastha College has a similar course called BA (Honours) Mass Media and Mass Communication. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1089352&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Holding that the recent changes made by UPSC in the civil services main exams are against the interest of aspirants from rural areas,Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has urged his counterparts in others states to raise the issue with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Chouhan wrote a letter to all the state Chief Ministers yesterday raising the issue of the recent decision of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) to prepare merit list of the civil services main examination by adding the marks scored by the candidates in English language,official sources said today.</p>
<p>Chouhan said in the letter that such a decision was against the interest of the aspirants from rural India and small towns having very limited competency in English language,they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I humbly request all of you to raise the issue of preparing civil services examination merit list considering the marks scored in English language with the Prime Minister,&#8221; Chouhan said in the letter.</p>
<p>He said that knowledge of any particular language should not become the criterion for selection process. The candidates should be encouraged to express themselves in any Indian language,along with a qualifying level examination of English language.</p>
<p>Since independence,efforts were being made to give civil services the status of the representative service,which resulted in the current situation where candidates belonging to poorer and deprived classes,too,were able to participate</p>
<p>in the civil services,he wrote in the letter. </p>
<p>The Chief Minister further said that in the last three decades,candidates having rural background and those belonging to weaker sections have secured their due place in the All India and other allied services.</p>
<p>However,while introducing reforms in the examination pattern,one has to keep in mind the limited scope available to the candidates having deep knowledge and natural competencies acquired through education because of language barrier,Chouhan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Though in the globalisation period,necessity to know English language is increasing but capabilities and skills can be acquired through continuous training and knowledge,&#8221; Chouhan said.</p>
<p>The UPSC should focus on selecting candidates on the basis of their intellectual capabilities and interests as that will only create candidates having maximum capabilities,the Chief Minister added. </p>
<p><b>UPSC circular to count English marks decried</b></p>
<p>Patna: The Union Public Service Commission move to count marks of English subject (optional) in the civil services mains examination was today decried by Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi who said it would hurt the prospects of aspirants from rural background.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the UPSC(mains) examination where even five marks make huge difference to chances of 250 to 300 aspirants,the Commission&#8217;s circular to count marks of the English optional subject will prove to be detrimental to the prospects of those candidates hailing from rural and regional background in the Hindi heartland and other regions,&#8221; Modi said in a statement.</p>
<p>A number of candidate from rural areas &#8211; many of them children of rickshawpullers and labourers used make it to the civil services examination with high ranks and qualify for the posts of the IAS,IFS and IPS officers. But now their prospects will be decisively affected if English (optional) marks was added in the mains examination,he said.</p>
<p>The UPSC&#8217;s circular was,however,a bonanza for aspirants hailing from big cities and towns with convent school backgrounds.</p>
<p>Terming the circular as &#8220;divisive and aimed at creating class divide in the society&#8221;,Modi urged the Centre to intervene and direct UPSC to withdraw it and  maintain status quo.</p>
<p>The UPSC&#8217;s circular has also drawn the wrath of other states and regional leaders who have demanded a rollback. </p>
<p>&#8220;A civil servant shall not only identify the problems of his area,he should also be able to effectively communicate the same to his higher authorities,so that a solution can be found,&#8221; Nigavekar said over phone from Pune on the panel&#8217;s recommendations.</p>
<p>When asked whether the new pattern will virtually block the entry of aspirants who have obtained education in Indian languages,he said recommendations were made keeping in mind the existing structure of country&#8217;s education and no</p>
<p>&#8220;expertise&#8221; over any particular subject was stressed upon.</p>
<p>Noting that English is a global language required for effective multi-level communication,Nigavekar observed that some changes become imperative towards working in a global environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;By no way I am underestimating any regional language. But you know,in the present day scenario,the global boundaries have disappeared and language has become the unit of currency. It is the light and sound of communication,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot shut down our window towards the changes of the world and at the same time,we should not get thrown away from our culture. This is what Gandhiji had in his vision,&#8221; Nigavekar said.</p>
<p>When told that countries like China and Japan have made progress without laying stress on English,he said this phenomenon existed nearly a decade ago and now they too are seeing the language as a tool to deal with global competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,these days,you ask students to express themselves in a concise manner,be it be in any language,most of them will fail in doing so,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The students,however,have protested the new pattern,claiming that it dents prospects of those who have undergone education through state education boards,where English is not much emphasised upon.</p>
<p>Ranvijay,a journalism post-graduate who left his job to prepare for the exam,claims the new pattern will shut the door for Hindi-medium students.</p>
<p>&#8220;Testing English abilities is fine. But why add their marks in the merit list? Earlier too the English paper was there,but it was of qualifying nature. Wasn&#8217;t it enough to judge the communication skills,&#8221; asks Amarendra,a Ph.D researcher at the Jawaharlal Nehru University. PTI AGL ZMN</p>
<p><b>Narendra Modi slams changes in UPSC exam,alleges anti-Gujarati bias</b></p>
<p>Ahmedabad: Describing the recent changes in UPSC exam pattern as &#8220;a language bias&#8221; against Gujarati,Chief Minister Narendra Modi today demanded that Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh should intervene and reverse the changes.</p>
<p>In a letter to the Prime Minister,Modi opposed the decision to scrap the regional languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decision would ruin the dreams of thousands of candidates from Gujarat,&#8221; he said,seeking that PM take a remedial step.</p>
<p>&#8220;A candidate will not be able to write the essay in Gujarati or in any other language. He has to now compulsorily write it in English or Hindi,&#8221; Modi said.</p>
<p>If a candidate has graduated in any of the approved regional languages,then he should be able to write all the papers (except Section-2 of Paper-1 on English comprehension and précis) in that language,Modi said.</p>
<p>He described the new rules as a &#8220;language bias&#8221; against Gujarati,because a large number of students in the state attend Gujarati medium schools,and can not be as proficient in English or Hindi as they would be in Gujarati.</p>
<p>A large number of candidates from the socially or financially backward classes,including those from tribal communities,belong to this disadvantaged section,whose chances would be spoilt due to the new rules,he said. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1088566&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amid strong criticisms from the Opposition,the Maharashtra government today said educational institutions holding back scholarship amounts disbursed for students from other backward classes will be dealt with seriously.</p>
<p>Replying to a discussion through a calling attention notice on malpractices in this regard by educational institutions and pending disbursements,social justice minister Shivajirao Moghe said,the government will take strict action against such institutions.</p>
<p>The Opposition members criticised the state government over its failure to curb such malpractices during the discussion.</p>
<p>Initiating the discussion,Nana Patole (BJP) hitting out at the government for delays in disbursing scholarship amounts,said that the government was playing with lives of several lakh students.</p>
<p>While Moghe refuted the charges,he acknowledged that the state government was yet to disburse Rs 759 crore towards scholarship fees and said that the government had so far distributed Rs 1,157 crore for the same.</p>
<p>Moghe assured the House that the government will raise at least 50 per cent of the pending demand through supplementary grants or by making budgetary provisions for the next fiscal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will distribute this amount before October,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>BJP legislator Devendra Fadanvis,however,said the government had earlier decided that the amount will be distributed by March.</p>
<p>Suggesting that the delay in disbursement could be a deliberate attempt on the part of some state officials and functionaries,Fadanvis asked the government to look into the matter.</p>
<p>The Leader of Opposition Eknath Khadse later alleged that his own daughter,who is studying in a medical college,was a victim of such delay.</p>
<p>Jitendra Avhad (NCP) and Praniti Shinde (Cong) also criticised the delay in disbursements. Later on,Opposition legislators staged a walkout over the issue.</p>
<p>Moghe said that the scholarship amount disbursed by the state was the highest in the country. He said that the government provided scholarships to 10.75 lakh students last year and will serve 11 lakh students this year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1087640&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Terming as retrogade and highly discriminatory the recent UPSC notification on regional langauges,Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa today said they appeared to be calculated to bias the system against Civil Service aspirants from non-Hindi speaking regions.</p>
<p>In a strongly-worded letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,she said the four major changes announced by UPSC would adversely affect the interests of students from Tamil Nadu,particularly those from rural backgrounds.</p>
<p>I apprehend that these retrograde changes brought in by the UPSC without adequate consultation with state governments are undemocratic and unilateral and will have the effect of unfairly denying the youth of Tamil Nadu their fair chance of representation in the Civil Services,and ultimately,hamper the governance of the country.</p>
<p>I urge you to intervene in the matter and prevail on the UPSC to reconsider these invidious,unfair and discriminatory changes made in the scheme of the Civil Services Examination, she said.</p>
<p>Referring to the changes,she said the new stipulation that the Main Examination including optional papers can be written in Tamil only if the candidates had studied in that medium up to the graduation level denies them the opportunity to write the examination in their mother tongue Tamil.</p>
<p>She pointed out this,however,did not apply for those who wished to appear in Hindi medium. While both Tamil and Hindi were in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution,the UPSC move clearly &#8216;discriminates&#8217; against not just Tamil speaking,but against all candidates from the non-Hindi states,she said.</p>
<p>This is violative of Articles 14 and 16 of Constitution of India and places such candidates at a disadvantage compared to those students writing the examination in English or Hindi.</p>
<p>She also criticised the change pertaining to choosing literature of a language as optional paper,minimum requirement of 25 candidates for writing the examination in a particular language and inclusion of an English composition and précis writing section as an evaluated portion of Essay paper instead of qualifying English.</p>
<p>The changes made by the UPSC are invidious,discriminatory and militate against the federal nature of our polity and the Constitutional equality bestowed upon regional languages like Tamil&#8230;. These changes clearly infringe on the Right to Equality in Public Employment enshrined in Article 16 of the Constitution of India, she said.</p>
<p>Jayalalithaa&#8217;s arch-rival and DMK chief M Karunanidhi had yesterday written to the Prime Minister opposing the UPSC notification scrapping regional language paper,describing it as an attempt to impose Hindi.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1087506&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Country&#8217;s premier Intelligence Bureau (IB),entrusted with internal security related matters,is facing shortage of over 8,000 personnel due to unavailability of suitable candidates among others,Government said today.</p>
<p>&#8220;As against the sanctioned strength of 26,867 personnel in IB,at present 18,795 personnel are available with a total of 8,072 vacancies (30 per cent),&#8221; Minister of State for Home Affairs R P N Singh told Lok Sabha in a written reply. </p>
<p>The vacancies have accumulated in the bureau as a result of the implementation of the organisation scheme of the government (2001-2006),which imposed a ban on direct recruitments in all the ministries or departments. The scheme was further extended upto 2009,he said.</p>
<p>However,the government gave exemption for operational posts in IB during 2006-07. At the same time,over 6000 new posts were also sanctioned by the government during 2008-12 under various scheme to strengthen intelligence apparatus. </p>
<p>&#8220;This has resulted in the accumulation of vacancies despite the concerted efforts to fill up direct recruitment quota posts,&#8221; Singh said.</p>
<p>About 1,500 posts of deputation quota could not be filled up &#8220;due to unavailability of suitable officers&#8221;,the minister said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bureau is conducting the direct recruitment for various posts on a regular basis since 2008. However,induction has been staggered in view of the available training</p>
<p>capacity and cadre management consideration. </p>
<p>&#8220;Further,actual induction figures are much less than the selected candidates as large number of selected candidates do not turn up for joining the Bureau,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Singh said availability of inadequate number of qualified candidates through the Staff Selection Commission in the ministerial cadre has also resulted in 600 vacancies.</p>
<p>The government has also detected five instances of impersonation last year in which FIRs were lodged in concerned police stations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recruitment process in the Bureau is open and transparent and Bureau has taken various measures to ensure fairness in the selection process,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><b>Bihar govt mulls arming BPSC with recruitment of professors</b></p>
<p>(PTI) With more than 3000 posts of professors of various categories lying vacant in different universities in Bihar,the state government today said it would bring an</p>
<p>amendment bill in the current budget session itself to entrust state public service with recruitment job.</p>
<p>Replying to a short notice question of Awdesh Kumar Rai (CPI),Education minister P K Shahi admitted more than 3000 posts of Assistant Professors,Associate Professors and Professors were vacant in different universities for over five years.</p>
<p>Intervening in the issue,Parliamentary Affairs minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav said concerned over the situation,the state government has decided to make an amendment in the Bihar University Act to entrust Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) with the responsibility of recruitment of professors.</p>
<p>Going into details,the Education minister said the state government dissolved University Service Commission in 2006 as it was not functioning properly and vested power in the Chancellor to make recruitment through Vice Chancellors.</p>
<p>Pointing fingers over &#8220;faulty&#8221; recruitment of VCs and pro-VCs by the outgoing Governor Devenand Konwar,the Education minister without naming the governor said since there was no transparency in the recruitment by the Chancellor the process of recruitment of professors further got effected.</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and two other senior ministers have demanded probe against Konwar in the light of complaint raised by Congress MLC Jyoti during his address to joint session of Legislature on February 18 last.</p>
<p>The matter triggered verbal duel between Parliamentary Affairs minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav and Leader of Opposition Abdul Bari Siddiqui.</p>
<p>Siddiqui asked the government,how the educational work was being carried for over 5 years without required strength of teachers and does this not indicated that education system has crumbled in the state,in reply Yadav said the situation had deteriorated during previous RJD rule.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1086938&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the new session scheduled to begin in a couple of months,the Delhi University administration has set March 20 as the deadline for developing the curriculum for the four-year undergraduate courses. The vice-chancellor has sanctioned a sum of Rs 2 lakh to each department and Dean (Academics) for this purpose,according to a notification issued by the Finance Officer on Monday. </p>
<p>Most departments have held a few meetings for making the syllabus. Tentative names of papers to be taught have been decided. However,the curriculum content and the credit to be given for each paper is still being worked out, Umesh Rai,Director of South Campus,said. </p>
<p>In a letter to all departments issued on March 5,the university administration mentioned certain imperative measures to be adhered to while creating courses for the four-year programme. </p>
<p>According to these guidelines,the syllabi of applied courses,minor and major discipline papers should ensure that fundamental ideas and principles come across in a clear,easy and trans-disciplinary or inter-disciplinary manner to the student. </p>
<p>The letter also asks departments to lay emphasis on project work and awarding of internal assessment marks on the basis of student presentations. Apart from stating the number of lectures required for every paper,the university administration has also asked them to identify very precise reading material that is easy to access. </p>
<p>Students face a lot of difficulty in getting access to reading material. One of the suggestions of the Task Force was to make it easier for students to get reading material. Two categories of reading material  essential and desirable readings  were suggested. The idea is that the university might be able to put up essential readings on the website, Sangit Ragi,Deputy Dean (Academics),said.</p>
<p>Special attention has been given to Hindi medium students who face difficulty in get reading material. The department must identify (wherever applicable) reading material in Hindi. The department must (wherever applicable) start the process of creating reading/support material in Hindi, the letter said. </p>
<p>The heads of departments were told that the university has no option but to prepare Hindi reading material, Umesh Rai said. </p>
<p>The university is working on uploading chapters of books for various subjects and considering recording lectures and posting them on the internet so that students can access them easily, Rai added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1086582&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the four-year undergraduate programme set to begin from July,Delhi University has brought about a change in the nomenclature of courses. </p>
<p>Under the existing system,a student can choose an Honours course in a subject of his/her choice or  a BA/BSc/BCom Programme or Pass courses. </p>
<p>Under the Programme or Pass courses,students get to study multiple subjects during the three years of their undergraduate degree. </p>
<p>But since the four-year undergraduate courses have the option of multiple exit points,the degree a student receives will depend on the number of years the student spends on the course and his/her choice of subjects. </p>
<p>Thus,under the four year degree system,a student who exits the course after two years will be an Associate Baccalaureate.</p>
<p>If he/she opts out of the course after three years,the student will be a Baccalaureate. </p>
<p>On the completion of four years,the student will either get a Baccalaureate with Honours in his/her major discipline subject or a BTech degree. </p>
<p>Delhi University Vice-Chancellor Dinesh Singh said the reason behind this change was to do away with the distinction between various disciplines. </p>
<p>&#8220;We want to convey the idea that this kind of distinction between disciplines is not always healthy. If a student who has taken physics as his major discipline also studies six papers in history,which is his minor discipline,what degree do you give him  BA or B Sc? We changed the nomenclature to do away with this confusion, he said.</p>
<p>Though the university is yet to finetune the new system,officials said they were planning to award Baccalaureate degrees to humanities students and BTech degrees to science students.</p>
<p>Talking about the idea behind giving a BTech degree,a senior university official said,There are hundreds of private colleges which offer BTech degrees,some of which are not recognised. Why shouldnt a student who has spent four years on an undergraduate course in Delhi University get a BTech degree? </p>
<p>With the emphasis on inter- and trans-disciplinarity,students of the four year courses will have to study 11 foundation courses. </p>
<p>These courses will cover a variety of subjects like information technology,governance and citizenship,geographic and socio-economic diversity,language and literature,science and life,mathematical ability,history,culture and civilization,environment and public health. </p>
<p>Apart from the major discipline in which a student is admitted,he/she will also study six papers in another subject  the minor discipline. </p>
<p>In addition to these two subjects and the 11 foundation courses in a range of disciplines,he/she can also study another discipline as an applied course. </p>
<p>University officials said that the admission to the four-year undergraduate programme will not see a departure from the existing admission policy. </p>
<p><b>Name change</b></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Universities are &#8220;dying a slow and painful&#8221; death in the face of utilitarian policies of the state and aggressive commercialisation of higher education,eminent educationists said today. </p>
<p>Highlighting the challenges faced by universities today,a group of educationists revisited fundamental questions regarding the concept of universities,at a seminar organised by Delhi University Teachers&#8217; Association (DUTA) here. </p>
<p>Assessing the crisis in academic leadership,former Vice-Chancellor of Lucknow University,Roop Rekha Verma said excessive regimentation taking place in universities was threatening the concept of them being the nerve-centre of creativity and leadership. </p>
<p>&#8220;Regimentation occurs at the level of administrations that are run on the basis of vested-interests,as well as the governments&#8217; constant attempt to appropriate all forms of </p>
<p>decision-making,for their own benefits. There are too many examples of how perfectly vibrant universities have been sacrificed at the altar of cynical politics,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Expressing her discomfort over the drive towards Private-Public Partnerships,Verma said it would smother academic freedom and inclusivity within universities by virtue </p>
<p>of the conflict between public and private interests in higher </p>
<p>education. </p>
<p>&#8220;The current reforms are manifestations of recommendations made years ago by the Birla-Ambani Report on Higher Education which did not engage teachers and students in its deliberations on the future of Higher Education,&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>Agreeing with the view,astrophysicist Vinod Gaur said the &#8220;organic&#8221; concerns of teachers and students were largely being ignored by politicians and bureaucrats and would eventually affect the way universities&#8217; function. </p>
<p>JNU Professor Jayati Ghosh,while raising her concerns over the political dimension of reforms in higher education,said homogeneous standards of efficiency and resource </p>
<p>optimisation were choking universities of their vital resources essential for their growth. </p>
<p>&#8220;Teachers are being kept confined in a &#8216;guilt-complex&#8217; wherein they are being made to believe that their salaries and service-benefits are not commensurate with the quantum of work they do,&#8221; Ghosh said. </p>
<p>&#8220;Pseudo-theory of efficiency and discipline fundamentally denies teachers the opportunity to exercise their creativity and academic freedom,&#8221; she added. </p>
<p>Summing up the open-discussion,columnist and Delhi University Professor Apoorvanand said the fact that 4,000 teaching vacancies in the DU had failed to provoke an adequate and reciprocal public response showed that universities had gone somewhere wrong in attending to their relationships with its stake-holders. </p>
<p>Despite the general acknowledgement of grave difficulties threatening the survival of the university as an important and universal idea,teachers and students agreed that the event represented a timely intervention in the crisis which merit an intense collective search for alternatives. </p>
<p>Former Rajya Sabha member and ex-DUTA President O P Kohli also shared his views at the seminar along with DUTA office-bearers and elected members of the organisations </p>
<p>Executive Council. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1085037&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asserting that the linguistic concessions made by the UPSC are very much essential for giving more opportunities to all vernacular language students,the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday said it will raise the issue in the Parliament if the central agency authorized to conduct the Civil Services Examination closes this option for it will be anti-people and anti-development.</p>
<p>&#8220;The BJP always believes that the linguistic concessions made by the UPSC are very much essential for giving more opportunities to all vernacular language students and particularly this policy has benefitted the UPSC exams which are conducted in all vernacular languages that option should not be closed,&#8221; said BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that is closed,it will be anti-people,anti-development and that is why we will oppose it and we will raise this issue in this session of Parliament,&#8221; he added. The Shiv Sena has warned that it would disrupt the UPSC exams in Maharashtra if its demand to include Marathi in the syllabus was not met.</p>
<p>The UPSC has notified the new pattern,which will spare candidates from compulsorily qualifying other language papers like Hindi or any of the VIII Schedule languages,which includes Marathi. Earlier,candidates had to qualify in English and another language paper whose marks were,however,not counted for short-listing aspirants.</p>
<p>The new pattern,which is aimed at giving more emphasis on assessing general studies and aptitude skills of aspirants of country&#8217;s most prestigious exam,gives more weight to general studies and aptitude skills.</p>
<p>The UPSC has also introduced an English language paper,whose marks will count in final selection of aspirants for services like IAS,IFS,IPS,IRS and other sought after Central jobs. The civil services preliminary examination will be held on May 26 this year and the last date for filing online applications is April 4.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1084545&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hailing Swami Vivekananda for his contribution in the uplift of the masses,President Pranab Mukherjee today said his teachings can be the &#8220;guiding light&#8221;</p>
<p>for the challenges of ethics and morality faced by the society.</p>
<p>&#8220;The universality of Swamiji&#8217;s teachings holds great relevance in the modern world. Despite progress made by us,our society is confronted with issues challenging our ethics and morality. Swamiji&#8217;s teachings should be our guiding light in our path to the future,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Referring to the teachings of Vivekananda,the President said he felt that religion should be a weapon for self- transformation as well as transformation of the society.</p>
<p>&#8220;His Guru Shri Ramakrishna Paramhansa had taught him that service to man was service to God. Swamiji made this principle the basis of his social service programme,&#8221; Mukherjee saidinaugurating a seminar organised by Indian Council for Cultral Relations (ICCR) to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Vivekananda.</p>
<p>The President said Vivekananda was deeply troubled by theabject poverty of the masses and held that the country&#8217;s downfall was primarily due to suppression of the poor,who were also immersed in ignorance and superstition.</p>
<p>Addressing the gathering here,ICCR Chairman Karan Singhsaid Vivekananda shone like a meteor against the darkness and gave the message that truth is one though it could be called by many names.</p>
<p> He said,&#8221;At a time when the old is collapsing and the new is struggling,we need fresh inspiration like Swami Vivekananda.&#8221; Singh recalled struggle of the social reformer for the uplift of the marginalised,especially women. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1084541&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian Law Societys Law College,which was once considered at par with the National Law Universities in the country,is today grappling with a series of problems. </p>
<p>Starting from low placement record to lack of infrastructure,the ILS law college,students say,has failed to evolve with time. According to college Principal Vaijayanti Joshi,autonomy is the only way out.</p>
<p>ILS,in 2008,had seen 100 per cent placement. But since then,the scene has not been good. In 2009-10,out of 131 students registered in the college,only 76 got placement. The situation worsened in 2011-12,when out of 131 students,only 60 got placed. This year,out of 105 students registered,20 have been placed so far. </p>
<p>ONGC,which placed a student this year,reportedly complained that the standard of students have deteriorated. </p>
<p>However,the principal of the college refuses to believe that to be a fact. It can happen that one batch may not perform as good as the other. I had asked for feedback from the companies and ONGC didnt find the students up to the mark. It could be that their requirement was different and the students who appeared for the interview did not match their profile. Otherwise,I dont think our standards have gone down, Joshi said. </p>
<p>We are still one of the top 10 colleges in India in law education. But comparing ILS with national other law universities is not possible. We are affiliated to the University of Pune. Hence,there are inherent problems with the curriculum,examination and assessment process. We have to work within a framework and in spite of that we are considered good. National Law Universities (NLU) do not have to face such issues, said Joshi,adding,From the next year,we will move towards autonomy, Joshi added.</p>
<p>Agreeing with Joshi,the students said autonomy is what was keeping the potential of institute from not being utilised. When you compare students here with those in NLU,the potential is quite the same. But they have a better curriculum,their assessment is credit-based and a comprehensive course. They are like IITs for law, said David,a fifth year student of ILS.</p>
<p>According to Alex,another fifth year student,NLUs have one of the best infrastructure and libraries. The NLU libraries have the best collection of books. I am not saying the collection here is bad but cant compare them to NLU, he said. Secondly,the kind of exposure they get is massive. NLU is like a package where you get everything. NLUs also mostly place their students by fourth year which ILS doesnt, said Alex.</p>
<p>Funds are the biggest problem faced by the college today. We have all the potential to be the best. There are various things that a modern university needs like Wi-Fi connectivity in all classrooms,CCTV cameras for security and latest books and database on law. But all this costs a huge amount. Currently,we subscribe to one database. But in todays world we need to subscribe to more databases so that the students have plenty to read from and understand, said Joshi.</p>
<p>Talking about the curriculum and examination,Joshi said there is a need for both qualitative and quantitative change. Now the focus is on introducing more subjects and not how to teach them. Many important subjects like Private International Law are not yet taught whereas this is the need of the hour, said Joshi.  </p>
<p>Students now study only for marks. The same questions are repeated every year which they mug up from notes and give the exam. So for the college to excel,all these need to change, said Joshi.</p>
<p><b>New library floors lying unused for a year</b></p>
<p>In June 2012,ILS law college completed the work of two new floors for its library. But since then,the new library has been lying vacant as the occupancy certificate from Pune Municipal Corporation is yet to be received. </p>
<p>We have submitted all the certificates but we are having a conflict regarding the amount to be paid for obtaining the occupancy certificate. </p>
<p>The current library is cramped and does not have sitting facility for many students. So it gets crowded during exams,said students. We have 60,000 law reports and journals plus various other books to be kept once the new section comes up. The new library will also have huge seating arrangement. We hope to resolve the issue soon, Joshi said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1084290&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A common question format for mathematics and science will be introduced in class XI from the coming 2013-14 academic session to bridge the gap among different boards.</p>
<p>This means that the boards can fix a specific number of objective type,analytical or subjective type questions,though the content can vary from one board to another.</p>
<p>The development comes after a sub-committee set up by the Central Board of School Education in the country finalised the common design of the question paper in these subjects for the benefit of all member boards as part of government&#8217;s efforts to address issues relating to examination reforms.</p>
<p>However,introducing a common design of question paper in class XII would take some time as Minister of State for HRD Shashi Tharoor had said in Lok Sabha that the decision would depend on the feedback of the pilot of class XI and subject to the acceptance of all the state education boards.</p>
<p>Implementing a common design question paper was discussed at length at a committee in CBSE on June 28 last year following which the sub-committee was set up.</p>
<p>COBSE and the NCERT have already developed a common curriculum for mathematics and science,and almost all the boards have implemented it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1084031&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students appearing for their class XII board exams in Manipur were taken aback when they found answers printed on the back side of their question papers.</p>
<p>Hundreds of students were given question papers and blank answer sheets during the &#8216;engineering drawing&#8217; exam organised by the Council of Higher Secondary Education,Manipur (CHSEM),yesterday.</p>
<p>After some of the students pointed out the mistake,invigilators immediately collected the question papers back and soon the exam was cancelled.</p>
<p>CHSEM controller Sagolsem Kiran said they are surprised that answers of the questions were also printed on the question papers and it did not look like a printing mistake.</p>
<p>An enquiry into the incident has been ordered,he said adding that re-examination of the subject would be conducted on March 25 afternoon.</p>
<p>Arambam Thoithoi,secretary general of the Democratic Students&#8217; Alliance Manipur (DESAM) condemned the carelessness of the CHSEM authorities.</p>
<p>The students body demanded that full marks be given to students appearing in the exam instead of re-conducting the examinations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The incident has disturbed us. Now we have to prepare again for the same paper. We should not be made to suffer because of their mistake,&#8221; students said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1082487&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 20,000 colleges across the country would be soon connected through a video conferencing software which will enable students to attend lectures of well known faculties through online classes.</p>
<p>The decision by the central government was followed by a meeting recently between Higher Education Secretary Ashok Thakur and 60 vice chancellors of colleges and universities from across the country to acquaint them about the software &#8216;A-view&#8217;.</p>
<p>The software has been developed by Kollam-based Amrita University under the National Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology programme. </p>
<p>The e-learning platform would help in conducting live distance education classes by enabling trainers and teachers to reach out to multiple remote classes and participants using the Internet.</p>
<p>It would also address the shortage of highly-qualified and experienced teachers at institutes by providing all students and teachers access to the best teachers and</p>
<p>trainers. The software would provide a platform for social collaboration among teachers and students using information and communication technology,officials in the ministry said. 	</p>
<p>The programme would especially come as a boon for universities and colleges in remote places where getting good faculties is a challenge in itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;A-view is a very attractive programme especially for us here in the remote areas. We have around 100 colleges affiliated to us and they are all in remote places,&#8221; said</p>
<p>Bekington Myrboh,Pro vice chancellor of North Eastern Hill University in Shillong.</p>
<p>At present,about 450 universities including Mumbai University,NITTTR Calcutta,Pondicherry University,IIT Hyderabad are using the platform,connecting 2,000 colleges.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are running a programme known as &#8216;enlighten yourself every Saturday&#8217; and we telecast this programme to all colleges through A-view,&#8221; said Rajpal S Hande of University of Mumbai. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1082436&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When nine-year-old Chhabikul moved to Delhi with his father,he did not know that the move would spell the end to his schooling days. </p>
<p>Having studied at a primary school in his village till Class II,Chhabikul tried to get admission to a government school in Mehrauli. </p>
<p>However,with the school authorities asking him for various documents and informing him that language might pose a barrier for him,it was the end of his school days. Chhabikuls discouraged father engaged him in his waste picking business. A year later,the father-son duo were spotted on the streets by workers of Chintan,an NGO working on environment issues,especially waste-picking. </p>
<p>Conversations with the boy revealed that although he wanted to study,he could do so only in the afternoon,after finishing work . With the support of his father,Chhabikul started attending a school run by an NGO in 2006. He was later admitted to a government primary school in Pant Nagar. </p>
<p>Chhabikul is one of the many kids who owes his education to the efforts of Chintan.</p>
<p>His story highlights the involvement of children in the waste-picking business and the identity crisis faced by thousands of ragpickers in the city,most of whom have migrated from various parts of the country. </p>
<p>Since 1999,Chintan has been working with waste pickers by undertaking various recycling projects and programmes to promote education in this community. </p>
<p>Recognising these efforts,the United Nations ,through its Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) and in partnership with BMW awarded the third prize at the United Nations-BMW Intercultural Award prize to Chintan. </p>
<p>The award ceremony took place at Vienna on February 26 and was attended by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Apart from a sum of $15000,Chintan will also receive technical assistance for one year. </p>
<p>Bharati Chaturvedi,Director,Chintan expressed gratitude not only to waste pickers,but the migrants whose contributions make our urban experience richer.</p>
<p>The award which aims to identify the most innovative grassroots projects that encourage intercultural exchange around the world,received over 500 applications from 92 countries. </p>
<p>Most waste-pickers are migrants from states like West Bengal and Assam. Apart from a sense of non-acceptance that the job entails,the move to the city creates a strong sense of alienation among them. We work with them to ensure that they get Aadhaar cards or ration cards. It gives them some kind of identity and sense of belonging, an employee at Chintan said. </p>
<p>The NGO has undertaken a detailed analysis of the waste recycling sector,waste management policies,waste-to-energy plants and their social impact on waste pickers. </p>
<p>The study by Chintan shows how families will be forced to engage more members in waste-picking with the result that children will end of spending less time on education &#8211; some might even drop out of school in order to pick waste. </p>
<p>The first impact of setting up of waste-to-energy plants in Delhi was seen on children. The drop out rate in schools have increased, the employee said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1081426&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several social outfits,including locals,have demanded establishment of a Kendriya Vidyala (KV) at Jeypore in Koraput district of Odisha.</p>
<p>Describing Jeypore as a cultural,educational and business hub of south Odisha after Berhampur,activists of various organisations have sent a memorandum to union minister for human resource development for establishment of a central school in the town at the earliest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though there are important installations and offices like income tax office,railway station,All India Radio,Doordarshan,office of senior superintendent of post offices,BSNL office,office of the Food Corporation of India and branches of several insurance companies and nationalised banks,Jeypore has so far been neglected with regard to opening of a KV&#8221;,the memorandum read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other central government offices and PSUs like Rice Research Centre,Vector Control Research Centre and NTPC also exist at Jeypore,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is discontentment among people in this tribal area due to absence of a KV. Being a backward tribal-dominated district,Jeypore deserve a KV&#8221;,said Susanta Adhikari,an activist of an organisation.</p>
<p>At present the district has two KVs one at the district headquarters town of Koraput and the other on the premises of Naval Armament Depot (NAD) under defence sector at Sunabeda. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1079384&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The standing committee of the IIT Council which meets in Mumbai on November 5 is expected to recommend raising tuition fee of undergraduate programme from Rs 50,000 to Rs 90,000.</p>
<p>The development comes as an empowered task force is still considering the details for implementation of the Kakodkar Committee which had recommended last year a steep hike of Rs 2-2.5 lakh per annum from the existing Rs 50,000.</p>
<p>As the task force is in the process of deliberation,the proposal for raising the fee by Rs 40,000 per annum would be taken up by the directors as an &#8220;interim measure&#8221;,sources said.</p>
<p>The Kakodkar Committee constituted by the Council of IITs had suggested the four-fold increase in tuition fee to help IITs attain financial independence.</p>
<p>The IIT Council had given in principle approval to the recommendation to be implemented from 2013,with the then HRD minister stating that the extra burden would be &#8220;paid back&#8221; by students once they are employed.</p>
<p>While the empowered task force is deliberating the issue,the group of directors of IITs,in the meantime,at a meeting in February considered the proposal for tuition fee hike,the matter of which would come before the standing committee on November 5,the sources said.</p>
<p>The meet is also expected to take up the issue of periodic peer review of IITs as per the recommendation of the Kakodkar Committee.</p>
<p>The committee had stated that the government should,through the IIT Council,exercise its prerogative over the IIT by invoking the power of the visitor every five years so that the achievements and governance of the IITs is reviewed by a committee.</p>
<p>This would ensure transparency and accountability to the government and the public. The government can take any corrective step based on this report without impinging on its autonomy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1025358&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission (MPHRC) has recommended the state government to pay a compensation of Rs 5,000 each to four girls who were made to stand for four hours as punishment for not doing homework by a government school teacher in Burhanpur district recently.  </p>
<p>The recommendation to pay this sum to the four students was given by MPHRC&#8217;s Acting Chairman Justice A K Saxena yesterday following a complaint in this regard,official sources said today.</p>
<p>The class 12th students were punished by teacher Razia Bano for not doing their homework during which they were not even allowed to drink water or answer to nature&#8217;s call. The girls had to be admitted to a hospital because of this. </p>
<p>The MPHRC recommended to give training in child psychology to teachers so that they are sensitive to the needs of their pupils. </p>
<p>The Commission has issued a showcause notice to the woman teacher under section 16 of the MPHRC Act and observed that even today the teachers believed in the old method of giving homework to students and it appears that they have been unable to adapt to modern day methods.</p>
<p>The Acting Chairman also wrote that there was a time when teachers were treated as their ideals by students but this is gradually fading from the society. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1025265&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Citing &#8220;serious apprehensions&#8221; raised by various stakeholders including state governments,a Parliamentary panel has rejected a Bill which seeks to provide a mechanism to regulate standards of health education in the country.</p>
<p>In its report,the Standing Committee on Health said that following apprehensions expressed by various stakeholders on effectiveness of National Commission for Human Resources for Health Bill,2011,it is asking the Health Ministry &#8220;to consider all shades of opinion and all the suggestions and bring forward a revised comprehensive Bill before Parliament.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Committee recommends that the Ministry may withdraw this Bill and bring forward a fresh Bill&#8230;,&#8221; the report submitted to Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari here yesterday said.</p>
<p>The Committee supported the stand of the state governments that the legislation does not give representation to states.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;the composition of the Commission gives no</p>
<p>representation to the states. The Committee agrees with the viewpoint put forth by the state representatives that the states play a vital role in delivery of health care and</p>
<p>medical education. States are well versed with existing medical education capacity and know their future requirements better,&#8221; the report said asking the government to keep the interests of the states in mind while redrafting the bill.</p>
<p>It said several stakeholders have raised &#8220;serious</p>
<p>apprehensions&#8221; on various provisions of the Bill and</p>
<p>effectiveness of various bodies that are proposed to be</p>
<p>established under the Bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some stakeholders favoured strengthening of the existing Councils rather than overarching body as proposed in the Bill.</p>
<p>The Committee notes the concern expressed by the</p>
<p>Councils&#8230;The Committee feels that these apprehensions need to be appropriately addressed by the Government in the Bill,&#8221; said the report.</p>
<p>The Bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on December 22 last year and referred to the Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;In view of the apprehensions expressed by various</p>
<p>stakeholders,the Committee felt that the Bill in the present</p>
<p>form cannot be recommended,&#8221; the report said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1024603&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>India&#8217;s SP Jain School of Global Management will open its first Australian campus,costing AUD 54 million (Rs 301 crore),in Sydney in December.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new AUD 54 million campus for one of India&#8217;s leading post graduate business schools is set to open in Sydney on December 1,2012,&#8221; Premier of New South Wales Barry O&#8217;Farrell said in an official statement.</p>
<p>The NSW government and its education community which has been keen on deepening educational links with Indian side announced stronger ties with the SP Jain School,said the release issued by the state government.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Farrell said the investment is significant as it is the first Indian school to be set up in Australia with its own fully-fledged campus.</p>
<p>&#8220;This multi-million investment by SP Jain in a new Sydney campus will further enhance NSW&#8217;s reputation globally for excellence in education,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;NSW Trade &amp; Investment in Sydney and our NSW Government trade office in Mumbai have also been working closely with SP Jain to support the establishment of the new Sydney campus,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>SP Jain ranks in the Financial Times list of the world&#8217;s top 100 business schools and is the only foreign university to be formally accredited by the Department of Education and Communities in NSW,O&#8217;Farrell said,adding that the institution has a partnership with the University of NSW to enable student exchange between MBA programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;India is a vital market for Australian companies,and the establishment of an SP Jain Sydney campus will help fulfil the need for graduates well versed and capable of operating in Australia&#8217;s target markets,&#8221; O&#8217;Farrell said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian students account for more than 10,000 enrolments across all sectors in 2012 or around six per cent of total international student enrolments in the state,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The campus is expected to see a cohort of around 50 undergraduate students and 95 masters students,with numbers set to increase substantially in the coming year,he said.</p>
<p>The Premier also announced during his trade mission in India that international students will receive discounts on public transport,as part of ongoing efforts to promote the State as a world-class location for international education.</p>
<p>Eligible international students will receive discounts for public transport travel discounts of up to 35 per cent.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Farrell is on his second official trip to India in 12 months. During the one-week trade mission he is slated to visit Mumbai,Hyderabad and New Delhi and meet senior government officials,business leaders and investors. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1024027&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students who have passed out  class XII will get a chance to participate in CBSE course  committees which are reconstituted every three years. </p>
<p>Based on the performance and in consultation with the  schools,CBSE will nominate students to these committees. </p>
<p>CBSE is confident that the student-nominees will actively  contribute towards the development of its courses. </p>
<p>It also considers the involvement of students in framing  the syllabus essential since the nominees will have a clear  understanding of the prospects of the subject along with the  limitations. </p>
<p>&#8220;We wish to make the courses and syllabus more inclusive  and application-based. Since the course and syllabus prepared  by committees is to be followed by students,we will hear  their voice. I am sure the inputs given by the students will  help designing the courses better,&#8221; said CBSE chairman Vineet  Joshi. </p>
<p>CBSE has Course Committees for all its courses including  vocational subjects. The committee discusses,debates, collects various inputs and ideas related to subject  disciplines and reviews them to suit the needs of its  students,parents and society. The course committees comprise professors from  universities,NCERT experts,teachers and subject experts from  Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghatan,private and public schools and working teachers. </p>
<p>Joshi said CBSE is keen to understand the trends among  students regarding the scope of the major subjects it offers  as well as their link with university/vocational degrees  in India and abroad. </p>
<p>This will help improve the continuous and comprehensive evaluation-based educational system initiated by the Board.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1022776&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Representatives from over 50 US universities will</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gone are the days when tuition classes meant a pokey classroom crammed with students and a teacher writing incessantly on a much used black board. The new age tuition class is all about well lit and air-conditioned rooms,white boards and projectors,with most courses available online too.</p>
<p>With 62 centres across the country,Aakash,one of the leading brands in the arena of coaching classes,has 10,000 students in its distance learning programmes and above 60,000 in its regular classroom programmes using its online services. We are the only coaching institute which has successfully launched tablet-based programs for medical,engineering and junior level entrance exams in India with 590 students already using it. Similarly,the coaching services through Airtel Digital TV (that anyone can subscribe if they have a Airtel Dish TV connection) and that cost just about Rs 7 per day. Currently,around 2,000 students are using it, says Aakash Choudhry,Director,Aakash Educational Services Ltd. </p>
<p>Online systems also have a huge following among Indian students residing abroad and who want to appear for competitive exams in India. I came back from Saudi Arabia in October last year. The nearest coaching class is very far from where I stay. Hence,I opted for online services, said Ammar Haque from Kondhwa,who is preparing for medical entrance exams. </p>
<p>Paul Varghese,who studies in Class XI in Netherlands,too,has opted for online classes. Paul wants to come back and write the engineering entrances here. Online coaching is the only way he can prepare, says Mary Jacob,Pauls grandmother.</p>
<p>FIITJEE,another giant in the business,too,has gone online for many of its applications. All details regarding competitive exams are sent to the students through SMS alerts. We also have an online cell for the students. Besides,all our exams are conducted on OMR sheets. The student is given a user ID and password,which is also shared with their parents. Once the exam is over,our technical team takes over and by evening the marks of students,their ranking,the top marks and the average class score is updated on the website, says Nikhil Bhatnagar,Admission Manager,FIITJEE.</p>
<p>This modernisation story is,however,not limited to the big players in coaching businesses that have pan-India presence. We use PowerPoint presentations and projectors to make them understand the concept as children learn better when they see visuals. We have been using OMR sheets for a long time now and the results are uploaded on our website within two days, says Anuradha Bhagurkar,manager of the Pune branch of Vidyasagar,one of the oldest coaching classes in the city. </p>
<p>But she still gives the traditional method some brownie points. Teaching is also a lot about student-teacher interaction. By looking at their faces,a teacher knows if the student has not understood the concept,even if he doesnt say so. Plus,in online you can only replay what has been said,while in classrooms we explain if the student has a doubt, Bhagurkar adds.</p>
<p>Students too are divided over which is the better method. Teaching should be a combination of visuals and the traditional methods. In subjects like mathematics,a teacher is a must. But in a subject like biology and chemistry,visuals too play an important role, say Amey Patil and Navin Urs,both Class XII students. </p>
<p>Also,if the content is available online,we can repeat a portion till the time we understand it. But in a classroom,students are mostly shy and prefer not to ask questions to avoid fellow students sniggering at us, say Sagar Toshniwal and Avinash Dole,also students of Class XII.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1020272&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delhi University (DU) has proposed to make a few classes for sports compulsory as part of its four-year undergraduate programme that will be introduced next year. DU Sports Council chairman Prof. C S Dubey said one or two classes for sports every week could be made compulsory for students of the four-year under-graduate programme. </p>
<p>We are working on a sport-for-all policy. A student will get around 16 weeks in one semester. During that period,two classes every week will be reserved for sporting activities. The modalities have to be worked out and the proposal has to be approved by the vice-chancellor and the Academic Council, Dubey said. </p>
<p>The idea,university officials said,was to encourage students to take up sports. Sports will be part of a students curriculum. Apart from sports quota students,others can get training in any sport for which coaching is available in his college. Based on his level of performance,students will get credit points for his degree, he said. </p>
<p>He said a committee has been formed to look into the proposal. There were around six committees that were set up around December last year, he said. </p>
<p>Dr Meera Sood,secretary of the Delhi University Sports Council,said: Three committees had been set up to look at the nature of fitness tests,the marking criteria and on the admission procedure for sports quota.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1020182&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Government is in the process of liberalising norms and doing away with archaic rules for establishment of new medical colleges across the country to meet the ever growing demand of doctors.</p>
<p>According to sources,the Ministry of Health has asked the Medical Council of India (MCI),apex medical education regulator,to rationalise and redefine its norms for setting up medical colleges and do away with rules that add little value to education but lead to higher cost of education for students.</p>
<p>&#8220;The norms governing medical college establishment need to be reworked. We have asked the MCI to redefine and rationalise them to enable new medical colleges to come up. We plan to add atleast 6,000 new MBBS seats in the next year. New norms need to reflect today¿s needs,&#8221; a top Health Ministry official said.</p>
<p>Among norms under scanner are the requirement of vast spreads of land for colleges and compulsory auditoria,playgrounds,classrooms,libraries and labs of vast dimensions.</p>
<p>Also proposed is easing of norms for hiring of faculty by allowing adjunct faculty so as to reduce the high cost of medical education.</p>
<p>It is proposed to allow colleges to come up as multi- storey buildings comprising compact facilities of labs and libraries under new dimensions which the MCI will specify in place of old impractical ones.</p>
<p>The government is keen to add at least 6,000 to 7,000 new MBBS seats in the coming year to help reduce the doctor-patient ratio which is a poor 1:2,000 currently.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are planning to ease norms for land requirement by allowing managements to set up medical colleges in multi- storeyed buildings instead of as huge unwieldy complexes spread over acres as is the current norm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keeping in view the shortage of land,multi storeyed buildings can especially be allowed around cities where health facilities are much required and land availability minimal,&#8221; MCI officials said.</p>
<p>There is also a plan to ease conditions on auditoria and playgrounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;College auditoria are used twice or thrice a year for cultural functions and convocation. We are proposing to allow managements to sign MoUs with private parties outside to enable them to hire auditoria on need.</p>
<p>&#8220;They can list such partners to us and we can relax the norms on auditoria,&#8221; Council officials said.</p>
<p>They added that playgrounds and huge libraries were not critical requirements for medical colleges and need not be retained as mandatory requirements to set up new colleges.</p>
<p>Ministry official said,&#8221;We have asked the MCI to concentrate on improving the quality of medical education rather than concentrating on such things like creation of facilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The revisit of norms is rooted in the escalating cost of medical education due to archaic norms which are compulsory but difficult to comply with.</p>
<p>The MCI has already set up a sub-committee to evolve fresh norms and the matter has also been listed for discussions in the upcoming November 2 meeting of State Health Ministers and Secretaries.</p>
<p>Ministry officials added,&#8221;We have also asked the MCI them to speed up inspections fresh cases by December and come up with fresh norms also by that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The MCI has already received 120 applications for setting up fresh medical colleges and 65 for expansion of existing medical colleges.</p>
<p>Earlier,the MCI had allowed government medical colleges to set up twin or split campuses across the country.</p>
<p>However,private medical colleges have only been allowed to have twin campuses within a radius of 20 kms in five states including Bihar,Chhattisgarh and MP with poor health parameters.</p>
<p>The MCI has also reduced land requirement for setting up new medical colleges from the current 25 acres to 10 acres in case of government and private medical colleges in the said five states with low health parameters and the four metros,besides five &#8216;A&#8217; Class cities.</p>
<p>The Government has also added three new cities of Jaipur,Pune and Lucknow among these &#8216;A&#8217; Class cities recently.</p>
<p>The sources also said the MCI is working towards allowing the government to set up new medical colleges inside district hospital complexes so that fresh heavy investments on land can be saved.</p>
<p>Easing of norms for private medical colleges in this respect is also being worked out.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1020070&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After days of a relay hunger strike,Delhi University teachers today walked barefeet in a match in the campus to protest the government&#8217;s reform agenda which they said would make education inaccessible for the common man.</p>
<p>The teachers under the banner of the Delhi University Teachers Association are sitting on a relay hunger strike for 11 days.</p>
<p>The DUTA has been protesting the way the affairs of the University were being conducted and alleged they were being sidelined from matters of academic importance by the Vice Chancellor who is &#8220;imposing&#8221; the reform agenda on the varsity.</p>
<p>The agitating teachers say the new &#8220;half-baked&#8221; reform measures were in line with the HRD Ministry&#8217;s agenda of ushering in private money in education sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DUTA maintains that the government&#8217;s aggressive promotion of private interests and FDI in higher education betrays the tall claims it has been making on the Right to Education,&#8221; said a statement today.</p>
<p>The teachers walked on the streets sans their shoes and were also joined by some students and non-teaching staff members on the &#8216;barefoot march&#8217; as they hummed the revolutionary songs of Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>The DUTA has alleged the VC had failed to acknowledge them as a democratic representative body of teachers and refused any meeting with their office bearers to hear their grievances. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1018782&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is a matter of serious concern that not a single Indian university figures in the list of top global institutions,underlining the fact that a lot still needs to be done on the front of higher education,Planning Commission member B K Chaturvedi said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In his speech at the 31st convocation of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gorakhpur University,Chaturvedi warned against a possible demographic disaster if country&#8217;s vast youth population was not equipped with proper knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>If we do not emphasise adequately on the need for excellence in skill and knowledge,this surplus young population would become a demographic disaster, he said,adding that India will have a surplus youth manpower of over 47 million by 2020.</p>
<p>Chaturvedi said no Indian varsity figured in the recently released list of top-200 universities across the globe,neither do they find any place among top institutions in BRICS countries.</p>
<p>On economic front,he said if the country continues to grow at the same pace,it will improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>If our country continues to grow at current pace,the quality of life will improve substantially in coming years,</p>
<p>On this occasion,many as 189 students of session 2011 and 2012 were honoured for their academic achievements and a total of 77 students,including 53 girls,were awarded gold medals.</p>
<p>Pragati Kushwaha,a Master of Science (M.Sc),grabbed 9 gold medals for her performance.</p>
<p>In his address,Vice Chancellor PC Trivedi announced commencement of various new courses in the university.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1018662&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Shortly before midnight,hundreds of students had collected at the university circle where some students,after attending the community dinners at different halls of residence,began celebrating by carrying out stunts on their motorcycles on the main road, Senior Superintendent of Police Piyush Mordia said.</p>
<p>Hundreds of cheering youth went on overdrive and some reportedly jeered at families who were returning from the campus after attending the community dinners,and harassed bystanders,he said.</p>
<p>This led to an altercation between the revellers and the police. When the situation worsened,the police lobbed tear gas shells and used mild force to disperse the mob,which had started pelting stones at them,he said.</p>
<p>At least a dozen people,including the university&#8217;s proctor,were injured in the ensuing clash.</p>
<p>More than 65 motorcycles reportedly left behind by the revellers have been seized,Mordia said.</p>
<p>We will be using these motorcycles to identify the members of the mob and will also be taking help of the video clips of the entire incident which is in our possession, he added.</p>
<p>An AMU spokesman said the institution&#8217;s authorities had taken a serious view of the incident.</p>
<p>The university authorities have taken a very serious view of last night&#8217;s incidents and strong action will be taken against the guilty. We have received inputs that a number of anti-social elements from outside the campus had mingled with the students and played a mischievous role, a spokesman of the AMU said.</p>
<p>A senior member of the teaching staff on the condition of anonymity said there were rumours circulating on campus since the past several days that some anti-social elements might provoke tension at the university.</p>
<p>Top university officials were also holding an emergency meeting to take stock of the situation.</p>
<p>Police and Rapid Action Force have strengthened their presence in the university campus to prevent any further incident.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1018589&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After QS and Times Higher Education published their rankings of universities across the world,higher education has become the subject of fierce debate in India. The highest ranking institutions from India are the IITs,but even these do not figure in the top 200. The general refrain  why does no Indian university find a place among the top global universities?</p>
<p>Unfortunately,given our present policies on higher education and our institutional dispositions,high rankings for Indian universities is a distant dream. To begin with,only take a look at the key features of the top global universities. Highly ranked universities are research intensive; some have a long and distinguished history of research,others,mostly in Asia,have raised their research standards in the last 20-30 years. Almost all the top universities are comprehensive. Not only do they teach and research the humanities,social sciences and natural sciences,they also have very strong programmes in engineering,medicine,law and management. These universities admit students at the undergraduate and the postgraduate levels and are committed to excellence in undergraduate education. </p>
<p>None of the Indian universities fulfil these criteria. We either have institutions with hundreds of affiliated/ attached undergraduate colleges,like the Universities of Delhi,Calcutta,Bombay,Pune,or institutions like the Jawaharlal Nehru University,which only teaches postgraduate courses,or stand-alone institutes like the IIMs,which specialise in teaching management courses,and the national law schools,which only teach law. Then there are a large number of research-only institutes,which contribute almost nothing to teaching. </p>
<p>Compared to global trends,our record in developing comprehensive universities is abysmal. For the 11th five-year plan,the government announced new initiatives in higher education,which included setting up 16 new central universities and 14 world class universities (these are still on paper only),8 IITs,20 IIITs,7 IIMs,and so on. Why did we shy away from seeding comprehensive universities with both undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses,and both liberal and professional courses? The stark reality is,in contrast to the global model,the dominant model of education in India separates liberal and professional,undergraduate and postgraduate,research and teaching. </p>
<p>The fragmentation of education into specialised institutes is justified by some as they feel universities are too unwieldy. However,this fragmentary approach is inimical to the idea of generating new knowledge by creating interfaces between traditional boundaries. If we want to improve our higher education system,we need to put our faith in comprehensive universities,mount a major effort in the improvement of undergraduate education,develop competent faculty at all levels of education and create the right ambience for research in at least some of the existing universities,the IITs and the newly set up IISERs. </p>
<p>We should make it national policy to stop opening new research-only institutes,except in technology intensive areas like space and nuclear energy. The mandate for institutes of higher learning should be both teaching and research. The IITs have the best chance of making the top grade at the global level as science and technology are the key areas in which nations will compete. A recently released report by the department of science and technology shows that India contributes only 4.25 per cent to global research in engineering,compared to 16.4 per cent by China. The government therefore needs to support industry-IIT research in areas that will be key to Indias future economic growth. To meet the demand for quality faculty,every year we need to pick the best 200-300 engineering graduates and sponsor them for doctoral work in the best technology schools around the globe. This approach has been used by Japan,Korea and China with great success. </p>
<p>Faculty development needs to be extended to the traditional universities. Around 200-300 students need to be sent abroad every year for doctoral work in areas like computer science,IT,bioinformatics,quantitative genetics,applied mathematics,econometrics,nuclear physics,education and other areas that are of contemporary importance and suffer from a faculty shortage. </p>
<p>All developed countries with a  strong university culture have a well-established competitive grant system for funding research. The National Science Foundation in the US and research councils in the UK are good examples. These agencies fund projects comprehensively,that is,all the expenditure on administration and utilities is taken care of. In India,we have a reasonably competitive funding system. Funding for R&amp;D has been raised by the government,scholarships for PhD students have increased,there are new schemes like INSPIRE to attract young students to science. However,all the government departments providing grants through a competitive system are over-bureaucratised,multiple schemes are floated and no effective proposal tracking systems exist. The concept of comprehensive funding has not been implemented. But worst of all,different ministries keep adding new research institutes under their tutelage rather than working on an effective and rapidly moving competitive grant system for the universities and institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>Reforms are urgently required at the university level to encourage research. Faculty with research projects should be given full charge of managing their projects,including the finances of the project. Universities should only develop general guidelines for purchases. Vice-chancellors and directors should spend their time raising funding for the universities and implementing reforms rather than signing files related to the research projects. </p>
<p>Strengthening undergraduate education is vital. All the undergraduate degree courses in natural sciences,humanities and social sciences need to be of four-year duration  bringing them on par with the so-called professional degrees. Poor mathematical and computational skills and low language proficiency are major weaknesses in our undergraduate degrees</p>
<p>All the new Central universities,if they desire to make a mark at the global level in future,should teach undergraduate courses and have four-year honours degrees. Integrated four-year BSc-B.Ed and BA-B.Ed degrees will be most useful in producing teachers for schools. With the right to education being implemented,lakhs of competent teachers will be required in schools. The three-year BA/ BSc degrees can be retained,but with equal emphasis on knowledge and skills to make students ready for jobs in the manufacturing and services sectors. The number of exams for admission into universities and institutes needs to be reduced drastically. In the last eight years,a host of committees have given many pertinent recommendations on academic reform; these need to be implemented without further delay. </p>
<p>Education and research will receive much higher allocations in the 12th plan. That is the good news. It is time we develop policies and the institutional will to compete with the best. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Gujarat High Court slams provision,says it can be used as vendetta tool by faculty members.</i></p>
<p>The Gujarat High Court on Wednesday ruled that students of Gujarat National Law University (GNLU) will no longer need to compulsorily obtain two marks for goodness before getting a hall-ticket for end-semester examinations. </p>
<p>The court observed that the provision can be used as a vendetta tool by faculty and turn the institute into a circus.  </p>
<p>According to GNLUs continuous examination and end-semester examination rules,Only those students who have secured a minimum passing 40% marks in continuous evaluation and have obtained two marks in Goodness are eligible to appear in the end-semester examination.  </p>
<p>Quashing this,Justice K S Jhaveri observed in his judgment that the rule can be a tool in the hands of the Faculty Members,which could be used by them at their own whims and caprice.</p>
<p>Such discretionary power in the hands of the Faculty Members would make the atmosphere of the College like a Circus where everything would be under the command and control of the Faculty Members and the students would refrain from sharing their point of view in the classroom with the fear that if their viewpoint annoys the Faculty Member,it would come against them at the time of awarding the marks, the court observed.</p>
<p>Such discretionary power is against the spirit of education, Justice Jhaveri added.</p>
<p>The judgment was passed an a petition by nine students challenging various examination rules under which they were detained. </p>
<p>Further observing that university authorities acted in a discriminatory and arbitrary manner by applying the examination rules differently to students of the same batch,Justice Jhaveri cited an example; appears from the record that on June 23,2012,the respondents had published a list of 58 students on the Website of the University who were detained from promotion to the next academic year. </p>
<p>However,subsequently,the names of 21 students were removed from the said list on the ground that they had secured additional marks during re-evaluation or were granted Goodness marks or were successful in the subsequent examination, the court observed.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1018397&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[U.S. sanctions against Iran's central bank prompted a slide in the rial's exchange rate.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1018198&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twice in less than a year,Neda&#8217;s ambitions to study outside her native Iran have been wrecked by the collapse of the country&#8217;s currency.</p>
<p>She and thousands of other students have watched helplessly as Western sanctions,and the abolition of a government policy that helped students meet their costs,have made a foreign degree so expensive as to be nearly impossible.</p>
<p>With the support of her parents,Neda was first set to go to northern Cyprus in January to study communications. But U.S. sanctions against Iran&#8217;s central bank prompted a slide in the rial&#8217;s exchange rate that month,putting the $1,500 per semester tuition out of reach of her upper middle class family,an indication of how the squeeze is affecting even the well-off.</p>
<p>I had been accepted to the school and everything was ready to go,said Neda,27,speaking to Reuters by telephone from Iran. But when foreign currency became so expensive,I had to cancel my plans.</p>
<p>Neda then planned to go abroad for this year&#8217;s autumn semester. But the sanctions,imposed over Iran&#8217;s disputed nuclear programme,triggered another plunge.</p>
<p>The currency lost about a third of its value against the U.S. dollar in 10 days in September and October as the sanctions cut Iran&#8217;s hard currency earnings from oil exports.</p>
<p>Neda now says she will remain in Iran for the time being.</p>
<p>This term especially my parents were encouraging me to go before things get any worse in Iran,said Neda,who like others interviewed for this article did not want her full name used because of the political sensitivity of the situation.</p>
<p>Isolated</p>
<p>Around 35,000 Iranian students are believed to be studying abroad this year,according to government figures,providing the economy with important skills and maintaining a link between the country and the rest of the world as it becomes increasingly isolated internationally.</p>
<p>Iranian students have continued to go overseas in the last several years even as relations between Tehran and the governments of their host countries have deteriorated. Many top officials have attended universities abroad. Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Mohammad-Javad Larijani,head of Iran&#8217;s human rights council,was at the University of California.</p>
<p>Places at Iran&#8217;s top public universities,determined by a national entrance exam,are extremely competitive and lucrative fields such as medicine are difficult to get into.</p>
<p>Studying abroad for those whose families can afford it can be a different avenue to earning a prestigious degree,putting students in line for the best jobs when they return home.</p>
<p>But the Iranian government,moving the economy onto an austerity footing in the face of sanctions,appears increasingly to view foreign study as a luxury that can be sacrificed.</p>
<p>In a move to preserve its foreign exchange reserves,the government announced last month that most students abroad would no longer be able to buy dollars at a subsidised government reference rate of 12,260 rials.</p>
<p>That forced many to seek hard currency in the open market,where it costs about 34,000 rials to buy a dollar.</p>
<p>We have the capacity to educate students inside the country,and except when it is urgent,there is no need for our foreign exchange to exit the country,Economic Minister Shamseddin Hosseini said on state television in September.</p>
<p>At the end of last year,Iran had official foreign reserves of $106 billion,according to the International Monetary Fund. Their current level is a secret,but some analysts estimate they may have dropped by several tens of billions of dollars as the sanctions cut Iran&#8217;s oil income.</p>
<p>Even if the coffers are emptying,some argue that subsidising young people to study abroad is not all that expensive for the government.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Education official,Hassan Moslemi Naeini,estimated in October that around $335 million sold to students at the subsidised rate would provide for their needs,arguing that this is a tiny percentage of Iran&#8217;s total foreign exchange expenditures,the Mehr news agency reported.</p>
<p>Destroying the Dream </p>
<p>The policy shift has devastated the budgets of Iranian students around the world and their families at home.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t even focus on my studies because every second I&#8217;m calculating how much the dollar is now and how much it will be tomorrow,said Reza,22,who is studying medicine in Hungary.</p>
<p>He was able to get hold of hard currency at the government rate to pay his $14,000 tuition this year,but fears that if the rial falls any further,he will be forced to abandon his studies and return to Iran.</p>
<p>My motivation is my family. My father arranged things for me so that I was able to come here and achieve my dreams. But because of this situation,I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ll be able to reach them,he said.</p>
<p>The number of Iranian students in Kuala Lumpur has also dropped in recent months,and normally bustling Iranian restaurants in the Malaysian capital are now empty,said Siavash,32. He is pursuing a business degree in Malaysia at a cost of around 6,500 ringgit ($2,130) per semester.</p>
<p>Malaysia,with its relaxed visa policy for Iranians,has attracted thousands of students and businessmen in recent years. As of 2010,more than 70,000 Iranian nationals were living in Malaysia,according to Iranian foreign ministry figures.</p>
<p>We had a neighbour who came this year to start her classes. She came with so much hope and her whole family was proud,Siavash said. She left just last week. She sold her belongings and went back to Iran.</p>
<p>Several students said they felt betrayed by the change in government policy,and do not believe the central bank does not have sufficient reserves to sell them cheap dollars.</p>
<p>Reza pointed to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#8217;s September trip to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly,which generated controversy when it was revealed he travelled with a delegation of more than 100 people.</p>
<p>There has also been public disgust over claims in parliament that 750 luxury cars have been imported illegally this year with cheap dollars,which are supposed to be used for vital goods such as food and medicine.</p>
<p>Why are they providing exchange for luxury cars and not for students who just want to study? Reza asked. These students want to go back to Iran and serve their country.</p>
<p>Politics</p>
<p>Some students complain that the rial&#8217;s impact on their lives shows the sanctions have inflicted the most damage on young,middle-class,Western-oriented Iranians &#8211; a group which the U.S. and European governments should want to help.</p>
<p>These sanctions are levied against the government but the government is not affected at all,said Ahmad,an Iranian graduate student in Belgium.</p>
<p>Only the people and society feel these pressures.</p>
<p>There are signs that the students&#8217; plight is adding to public discontent with Ahmadinejad,however. More than 2,000 Iranians studying abroad signed a letter to him protesting at the government&#8217;s policy toward students,the opposition news website Kalame reported in October.</p>
<p>A few dozen family members of students abroad demonstrated in front of the central bank last week and delivered a letter to officials inside,an organiser of the protest said.</p>
<p>The government has so far shown little sign of compromising,though officials recently indicated students would be able to buy dollars at a new foreign exchange centre which serves importers of basic goods. Dollars sell there for around 25,000 rials,but businessmen have already complained of shortages.</p>
<p>Some Iranian students say the currency crisis has caused them to wonder whether they should return to Iran at all.</p>
<p>When I left Iran,I swore I would go back,said Hasan,who came to the United States in 2011 to study industrial engineering on a university scholarship. Now it is less likely that I will return. There is no stability.</p>
<p>Neda said if she manages to save enough money from her job as a photographer,she will try again to pursue her studies abroad,where she says the universities are better in her field than the ones at home.</p>
<p>Before,I wanted to go abroad to study and come back to Iran,she said. But with the situation how it is right now,I would prefer to go to any other country.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1018198&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has issued a circular to affiliated schools across the country to immediately discontinue use of rare plants and animals for teaching.</p>
<p>The circular dated October 9 reads,No school will keep exhibits of animals or plants listed under any schedule of Wildlife Protection Act,1972. </p>
<p>CBSE warned inspections would be carried out by its regional officers and legal action initiated against defaulting schools under the said Act,which makes offences non-bailable.</p>
<p>Under Wildlife Protection Act,no school can keep specimen of listed plants or animals. The list includes pitcher plants,corals,frogs,snakes,birds,reptiles,sharks,starfish, guinea pigs,rabbits,ducks,hamsters and white mice and their parts,including skeletons,bones,foetus,feathers and skins. </p>
<p>We instructed schools to discontinue use of rare plants and animals and not to keep live animals as exhibits in labs twice before,once in November 2010 and later in May 2012. However,it has been brought to our notice that some schools are still using prohibited animals and plants. We have also received complaints about schools keeping live animals in captivity for study. This time legal action will be taken, said a senior CBSE official from Chennai region (which covers Maharashtra). </p>
<p>No school can display live animals without Central Zoo Authority permission.</p>
<p>CBSE has asked schools to use alternative teaching aids such as models,photographs and videos. </p>
<p>We have instructed all schools to use virtual images and models, the official said. </p>
<p>Several companies in India have introduced software to conduct lab experiments through simulation. There is absolutely no need to kill animals and plants when we can conduct experiments with the help of the internet and computer graphics, Deepshikha Srivastava,principal of Rajhans Vidyalaya in Andheri,said.</p>
<p>She said,Preservation of animals is important but imparting knowledge to students is also important.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recruitment activities in India witnessed a significant uptrend in September driven by growth in major sectors such as IT,retail,healthcare and engineering,according to a survey.</p>
<p>The Monster.com&#8217;s employment index,a monthly gauge of the country&#8217;s online job demand,rose by 6 points (3.12 per cent) to 132 in September,from 126 points in August.</p>
<p>On an year-on-year basis,the index level has risen by 9 per cent from 121 points recorded in September 2011,jobs portal Monster.com said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recent developments in the Monster Employment Index India reflect a relatively encouraging trend driven by growth in major sectors  like IT,Retail,Healthcare,Engineering and Construction,&#8221; Monster.com (India/ Middle- East/ South East Asia) Managing Director Sanjay Modi said.</p>
<p>A sectoral analysis showed that even amid tough economic conditions,hiring continued in areas including IT,IteS,engineering,financial services,automobile,telecom healthcare,travel and media.</p>
<p>The survey cautioned however that employers are adopting a cautious path while making new recruitments. &#8220;Growth rate continues to remain in the single-digits indicating a continued cautious sentiment,&#8221; Modi said.</p>
<p>The employment index is an indicator of monthly online demand for jobs. It is based on a real-time review of employer job opportunities culled from a large,representative selection of online career outlets,including Monster India.</p>
<p>In September,online job availability improved in as much as 26 of the index&#8217;s 27 industry sectors. It declined in the oil and gas category.</p>
<p>The month saw an increase in demand for technically qualified professionals in software,hardware,customer service,engineering,finance,business development,HR,healthcare,logistics,hospitality,legal and arts/creative field.</p>
<p>Of the 13 cities under review,Mumbai,Hyderabad,Chennai,Pune,Kolkata,Chandigarh,Kochi,Baroda,Coimnatore saw an improvement in online demand for jobs. In Bengaluru and Jaipur,the demand remained unchanged while it decreased in the rest. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1017506&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The government has set up a panel to look into the remuneration practices of top managements at loss-making companies amid concerns over fat pay packages being doled out to senior executives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The committee,set up by the Corporate Affairs Ministry,would primarily focus on executive pay practices at loss- making companies. It would also study the prevailing</p>
<p>remuneration trends at other firms,&#8221; a senior official said.</p>
<p>Some specific cases have recently come to light,where loss-making firms in sectors like aviation and infrastructure space have given sizeable pay hikes to their CEOs and other senior executives.</p>
<p>While rules are already in place for top management pay restrictions at loss-making companies,the Ministry would use the panel&#8217;s recommendations to better understand the existing trends and take the necessary actions.</p>
<p>The loss-making companies currently need the government&#8217;s approval for paying remuneration to their top-management executives,subject to certain ceilings and conditions.</p>
<p>In recent times,concerns have been raised about corporate governance issues over exorbitant pay packages of top executives,such as CEOs and executive directors.</p>
<p>Generally,compensation of senior executives are linked to the overall performance of the company. However,there have been instances where entities,despite making losses,have given handsome pay packets to the top management personnel.</p>
<p>The panel has been set up at a time when the government is looking at various ways to boost the overall corporate governance level in the country.</p>
<p>A panel,set up by the Ministry and chaired by eminent industrialist Adi Godrej,recently suggested various steps to improve the overall corporate governance culture.</p>
<p>The committee has recommended adoption of 17 guiding principles to underpin the system of corporate governance. These cover various aspects such as the responsibilities of independent directors and the functioning of a company&#8217;s</p>
<p>board.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1016624&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kerala-based NGO Mahatma Gandhi Foundation (MGF) has proposed to set up a free school to instruct citizens on the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and their duties to the nation.</p>
<p>Named as School of rights and duties,the facility would offer three-month courses to the candidates on the rights guaranteed to them by the Constitution and the duties expected of them as responsible citizens,MGF Chairman Ebi J Jose said.</p>
<p>A study conducted by MGF has found that a majority of people are not sufficiently aware of their Constitutional rights. This results in exploitation of the majority by a privileged minority. If citizens are properly instructed of their rights,they could,to a great exetent,resist exploitation, Jose said in a release on Friday </p>
<p>Similarly,it is important for responsible citizens to be conscious of their duties to the nation. In our formal educational syllabus,these basic issues are often not given due importance. Ours is a modest beginning to overcome these lacunae, Jose,also director of the venture,said.</p>
<p>Even many of those young persons who choose political and social careers were not adequately aware of these aspects and this was the cause for lack proper perspective in their approach,he said.</p>
<p>Jose said the MGF planned to start the course at Kottayam on January 26,2013,on the Republic Day of the nation.</p>
<p>Before finalising the syllabus and the course structure,views of public would be felicitated on the webesite schoolorindia@gmail.com,he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1015851&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two key Centre-sponsored education schemes are riddled with rampant corruption in BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh,Opposition Congress alleged.</p>
<p>Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rajiv Gandhi Shiksha Mission (RGSM) have become a den of large-scale corruption,Chhattisgarh Congress spokesman Anand Shukla said.</p>
<p>The Congress-led UPA government had given Rs 678.63 crore to the state in 2010-11 under SSA,the Centre&#8217;s flagship programme for universalisation of elementary education. However,this fund is being misused by the BJP government,he charged.</p>
<p>Under RGSM,festivals are organised to create interest for education among children. At these festivals,children are provided temporary shelter and food. But these things are not happening in Chhattisgarh,Shukla claimed.</p>
<p>There is also a provision under RGSM to provide drinking water facility in schools. But rampant irregularities have been reported in implementation of this provision,the Congress leader alleged.</p>
<p>In Bastar district,hand pumps were set up in 1,312 primary schools at a cost of over Rs 12 crore. However,these hand pumps are now out of order,he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1015828&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Schools may miss Oct 31 deadline,GSHSEB says they need faster Internet connection.</i></p>
<p>Filling up online registration forms for Class X board examination has become an arduous task for thousands of schools across the state as submitting just one form sometimes takes hours,reportedly due to slow servers of the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB).</p>
<p>The board has made it compulsorily for schools to fill online registration forms (on <a href="http://www.gseb.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gseb.org</a>) of students who will take the March 2013 examination. The schools have been given one month to complete the process,beginning October 1. </p>
<p>But many schools are likely to miss the deadline,as a result of which GSHSEB has said it may extend the last date.</p>
<p>Out of the 12,000-odd schools,so far only 2,600 have managed to submit forms of around a lakh students,said state education board officials. An estimated 10 lakh students are expected to take the board examination in the state next year.</p>
<p>So far,we have been able to fill forms of just three students out of total 300. Extremely slow servers have made it nearly impossible for us to complete the task by October 31, said the principal of a leading school in Vadodara,requesting anonymity.</p>
<p>Many other schools have a similar complaint. We tried filling up forms in the daytime,then at night and even early in the morning. But it does not make any difference as the servers are slow all the time, said principal of another school.</p>
<p>GSHSEB education secretary N M Mehta,however,said the capacity of three servers maintaining the data was fine and sound. In many cases,a school deputes five people on as many computers to fill forms,which jams the traffic. The schools are required to use the latest version of computers and faster Internet connection to speed up the process, he said.</p>
<p>The board has provided each school with an index number and a password to sign into the website and fill up the forms. But due to slow servers,even logging into the website takes time,teachers said.</p>
<p>The second step,that of school registration,takes even more time,they claimed. </p>
<p>Once registered,schools can access student registration form where every single detail of a student has to be filled,and his photograph and signature can be uploaded. This takes hours,and is highly frustrating, said a teacher.</p>
<p>Once the forms are filled,school principals have to approve them one by one. After the approval,the schools have to enter bank details about the examination fee.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1015706&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parental involvement is a more significant factor in a childs academic performance than the qualities of the school itself,new research has found.</p>
<p>The research was conducted by researchers from North Carolina State University,Brigham Young University and the University of California,Irvine.</p>
<p>Our study shows that parents need to be aware of how important they are,and invest time in their children  checking homework,attending school events and letting kids know school is important, said Dr. Toby Parcel,a professor of sociology at NC State and co-author of a paper on the work. </p>
<p>Thats where the payoff is, he stated.</p>
<p>The researchers evaluated data from a national representative study that collected information from more than 10,000 students,as well as their parents,teachers and school administrators.</p>
<p>Specifically,the researchers looked at how family social capital and school social capital pertained to academic achievement. Family social capital can essentially be described as the bonds between parents and children,such as trust,open lines of communication and active engagement in a childs academic life. </p>
<p>School social capital captures a schools ability to serve as a positive environment for learning,including measures such as student involvement in extracurricular activities,teacher morale and the ability of teachers to address the needs of individual students.</p>
<p>The researchers found that students with high levels of family social capital and low levels of school social capital performed better academically than students with high levels of school social capital but low family social capital.</p>
<p>In other words,while both school and family involvement are important,the role of family involvement is stronger when it comes to academic success, Parcel said.</p>
<p>The paper is published online in the journal Research in Social Stratification and Mobility. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1015317&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>The university expelled 10 students on ragging charges for one year</i></p>
<p>A day after expelling 10 senior students from its hostel,the Allahabad University (AU) administration today expelled them from the university on ragging charges for one year. It was also decided not to allow them hostel accommodation as and when they enroll in any course after the expiry of the one-year period. </p>
<p>The incident of ragging had occurred on October 3 at A N Jha hostel.</p>
<p>A statement issued by the AU said: The students found guilty of ragging charges are expelled for one year. In future,if they enroll in any course,they would not be allowed accommodation in any of the hostels.</p>
<p>Three of the 10 expelled students were pursuing post-graduate courses,while the remaining were second and third year students in different bachelos courses. AU PRO,Prof P K Sahu,said: A special meeting of the Proctorial Board was held to take a decision in the matter. No other issue was discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p>Although the incident of ragging had occurred on October 3 evening,it had come to light when a bunch of first year students had approached media organisations past Monday midnight.</p>
<p>A day later,the University authorities had swung into action expelling the accused students from the hostel. However,they claimed that there was no delay in taking action on their part.</p>
<p>The junior students had given written complaints against the senior students alleging physical abuse and mental harassment. The warden of A N Jha hostel had issued show cause notices to the accused students. A report was subsequently forwarded to the Proctor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,a case on the basis of a report forwarded by the Proctor has been registered at Colonelganj police station under different sections of the Uttar Pradesh Anti-Ragging Act 2010. Investigations in the case are on.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1015208&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Over 6,700 applicants; many even from Chandrapur,Gondia,Gadchiroli,Buldhana</i></p>
<p>The number of applicants for preparatory training at the Ambedkar Competitive Examination Centre (ACEC),Yashada,peaked to over 6,700 this year taking a big leap from the 904 received in 2006 when it was established. </p>
<p>The centre in Pune trains aspirants for the UPSC civil service examination. Another trend noticed this year is that there are a lot of applicants from Chandrapur,Gondia,Gadchiroli,and Buldhana districts.</p>
<p>According to officials at the ACES run by the Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (Yashada)  the apex administrative training institute of the state government  there has been a consistent increase in aspirants trying to get into the academy that imparts preparatory training to students from the economically weaker sections,mainly scheduled caste (SC),scheduled tribe (ST) and minorities. </p>
<p>In its year of inception,the academy received 904 applications for 60 seats. No applications were invited for the next two years. In 2009 the centre received around 2,000 applications,which grew to 3,500 in 2010 and 5,162 in 2011. This year,for the 70 seats,there are over 6,700 applicants.</p>
<p>This year we saw a jump of over 1,500 applications from last year. This not only shows how the academy is getting popular but also indicates how more and more students are opting for UPSC, said Nitin Mane,training co-ordinator,ACEC. </p>
<p>What is interesting is that a considerable number of candidates from districts like Gadchiroli,Gondia and Chandrapur have applied this time. Earlier,the applicants were largely from western Maharashtra, said Mane. </p>
<p>The centre has received 75 applications from Chandrapur,36 from Gondia,32 from Gadchiroli,101 from Buldhana and 104 from Parbhani.  Sanjay Chahande,Director General of Yashada,attributed this to increasing popularity of the centre. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1015184&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The masters degree programme in law (LLM) will now be of one-year duration instead of two years.</p>
<p>The University Grants Commission (UGC) has given its nod its in regard. The aim behind the move is to stop best legal minds from going abroad to pursue similar programme in less time and retain the best talents in the field.</p>
<p>According to the prevailing system,a student has to spend at least seven to eight years after intermediate to gain a masters degree in law.</p>
<p>The UGC had set up an expert committee under N R Madhava Menon,founding Vice-Chancellor of National Law School of India University,Bangalore to examine the proposal. The committee endorsed the move and recently submitted its report to the UGC.</p>
<p>The committee was set up after the HRD Ministry had backed recommendations made by the HRD Ministry&#8217;s round table on legal education in 2009.</p>
<p>Only India,Bangladesh and Pakistan impart two-year LLM. The duration had led to students taking up masters programme in universities abroad,said UGC acting chairman Ved Prakash.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1014909&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students from India have out-numbered their Chinese counterparts in US by a decent margin when it comes to pursuing master&#8217;s degrees in Science,Technology,Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields,an official report for the year 2009 has revealed.</p>
<p>According to the figures tabulated by the Department of Homeland Security for the National Science Foundation in 2009,India was the top sending country for STEM and graduates enrolled in master&#8217;s degree programs and represented 56 per cent of all STEM students seeking master&#8217;s degree in 2009.</p>
<p>In fact,Indian graduate students studying engineering and computer science led in master&#8217;s degrees. Students from China were placed second at 15 per cent and were more evenly distributed across STEM fields,with the exception of engineering.</p>
<p>The remaining top eight sending countries accounted for a total of 13 per cent of all foreign students seeking master&#8217;s degrees in STEM fields in 2009,less than that of China,said the Congressional Research Service (CRS) in its recent report.</p>
<p>But when it comes to Doctoral degrees,Chinese students took the first position,as the report discloses.</p>
<p>In terms of doctoral degrees,China sent the most STEM students in 2009,making up 35 per cent. Chinese PhD students were almost half of all foreign nationals in mathematics and physical sciences and roughly a third of all foreign nationals in the other STEM fields (except psychology and the social sciences). Doctoral degree students from India represented 16 per cent of STEM doctorates in 2009,it said.</p>
<p>The number of full-time graduate students in science,engineering,and health fields who were foreign students (largely on F-1 non-immigrant visas) grew from 91,150 in 1990 to 1,48,923 in 2009,with most of the increase occurring after 1999,it said.</p>
<p>The report further mentions that out of the four STEM options it is engineering which has been the most attractive for students. About 40,000 graduate degrees were awarded to foreign STEM students in 2009,with 10,000 of those going to PhD recipients,it added.</p>
<p>The report also sheds light on the number of Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs),who were employment-based principal immigrants,for the decade 2000-09 and attributes 44 per cent (2,97,668) of the total 6,76,642 to STEM occupations.</p>
<p>Of all of the LPRs reporting STEM occupations (2,97,668) over this decade,52 per cent entered as professional and skilled workers, it said.</p>
<p>STEM graduates seeking LPR status are likely to wait in line to obtain LPR status. Those immigrating as professional and skilled workers face wait times of many years,but those who meet the criteria of the extraordinary ability or advanced degrees preference categories have a much shorter wait, the CRS report said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1014663&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peeved over denial of facility to appear at the written examination for a job in the prison department,angry aspirants resorted to violence and damaged a government vehicle here today,police said.</p>
<p>About 1,400 candidates had qualified for the written test for recruitment of 85 posts of warders under 12 jails in Baripada circle spread over four districts &#8211; Mayurbhanj,Keonjhar,Bhadrak and Balasore.</p>
<p>The examination was to be held here today at reserve police ground but due to inclement weather,jail authorities shifted the venue to Baripada College in Bhanjapur area of the town and accordingly informed the candidates,superintendent the circle jail,Baripada,Prakash Chandra Sahu said.</p>
<p>After being informed by the principal of the college Anupama Nanda that there was facility for accomodating only 400 students,the jail authorities suggested her that the furniture from the examination hall would be removed and candidates would appear the examination sitting on the floor.</p>
<p>They also informed the students that the examination would start at 3 pm,he said.</p>
<p>However,the authorities were caught off guard before the commencement of the test as the number of candidates turned up for the purpose was over 3,000 against 1,400 who had qualified</p>
<p>Besides,the college had only one entrance and sufficient staff was not deployed to identify the qualified students for written test leading to a chaotic situation.</p>
<p>Even as the authorities were busy to find a solution to the imbroglio,the aspirants went berserk and resorted to stone pelting and damaged the official vehicle of the DIG of prisons in Odisha K B Nayak.</p>
<p>Armed police rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control,Sahu said adding no one was injured in the incident.</p>
<p>The jail authorities declared the written test for the day as cancelled,Sahu said.</p>
<p>A new date would be announced later.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1014352&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Intensifying their protest against alleged irregularities in the admission process of Aligarh Muslim University,aspirant-students today said they would not &#8220;reappear&#8221; in an admission test that they have already &#8220;qualified&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the aspirants,Faizan Khan,even began an indefinite hunger strike here today.</p>
<p>For the past one week,admission seekers have been holding a sit-in protest outside the Vice Chancellor&#8217;s office protesting against irregularities in the admission test for PhD students in the faculty of commerce.</p>
<p>The VC,Retired Lt. General Zameer Uddin Shah had on Friday night suspended the Chairman of AMU&#8217;s Commerce Department following the submission of the report by a three-member inquiry committee on the alleged irregularities.</p>
<p>In a memorandum addressed to the University¿s Visitor,about three dozen admission seekers have pointed out that they have been forced to intensify their stir because they are being asked to &#8220;reappear&#8221; in an admission test,for which they had qualified,&#8221;for no fault&#8221; of theirs.</p>
<p>A spokesman of the protesters today said &#8220;why should we be penalised for the shortcomings of the members of the university&#8217;s administration&#8221;?</p>
<p>The spokesman said the inquiry had confirmed charges levelled by the students but &#8220;holding a readmission test is not fair to us. We will continue our indefinite dharna and hunger strike till our demands are met&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1014297&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The government on Tuesday said it would examine batting maestro and Rajya Sabha member Sachin Tendulkar&#8217;s proposal to integrate sports with the education system.</p>
<p>Union Human Resources Development Minister Kapil Sibal said Tendulkar spoke to him about the issue and he had asked him to make a presentation.</p>
<p>This morning,I received a phone call from him (Tendulkar). Let me look at the presentation. The ministry does not decide on the curriculum,it&#8217;s either NCERT or CBSE. After we receive the presentation,we will send it to NCERT and CBSE and see how to take it forward, he said.</p>
<p>He was responding to a question by reporters on Tendulkar expressing his desire to work closely with the government to integrate sports into the education system.</p>
<p>The cricket icon,in a letter to Sibal last week,has stressed on honing the potential of the younger generation and nurturing their talent,observing sports is being neglected in educational institutions.</p>
<p>Tendulkar&#8217;s suggestions include a roadmap for complete overhaul of the sports infrastructure at the university and college level,according to a senior HRD Ministry official.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1014234&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Must consider race as factor in admissions,or minorities will be underrepresented:University<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1014106&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US Supreme Court on Wednesday is set to hear arguments on whether colleges and universities can continue to favor minority candidates in admissions policies. Given that the court in 2003 approved such policies,its decision to take up the issue again suggests it may be looking to cut back on affirmative action.</p>
<p>The case before the court was brought by Abigail Fisher,a white woman who says the University of Texas denied her admission because of her race,in violation of the US Constitution&#8217;s equal protection guarantee. The university says it must consider race as a factor in admissions,or minorities will be underrepresented on its campuses.</p>
<p>Several factors are tipping the scales against affirmative action this time around: For starters,the makeup of the court has become more conservative in the past nine years. Seven states have banned affirmative action,while polls show the US public has grown increasingly opposed to racial preferences.</p>
<p>The court often takes up cases to resolve conflicts between two or more federal appeals courts &#8211; but no such conflict exists here,which could mean the court is looking to reexamine its own precedent. In agreeing to hear the case,the justices brushed off an argument by the University of Texas that the court need not take up the matter,since Fisher has already graduated from another school.</p>
<p>One likely supporter of affirmative action,Justice Elena Kagan,has recused herself. She gave no reason,but it is likely she decided to step aside because she worked on the case in her previous job as US Solicitor General.</p>
<p>That leaves eight justices to hear the case. Four conservatives,Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia,Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito,are expected to reject the University of Texas program. The fifth conservative,Anthony Kennedy,is often thought of as a swing vote. He has voted with the conservative wing on this issue in the past but has also acknowledged a need for racial diversity on campuses. A 4-4 tie would affirm the lower court,which rejected Fisher&#8217;s challenge.</p>
<p>A broad ruling by the court could wipe out affirmative action programs in the 43 state school systems that still allow racial preferences,as well as those at thousands of private colleges and universities. The court could also rule narrowly and disallow only the Texas program,or it could approve the Texas approach.</p>
<p><b>How Texas does it</b></p>
<p>The University of Texas fills most of its entering class of freshmen using a policy that grants automatic admission to in-state s t udents in the top 10 percent of their high school class. For the remaining slots,it considers an applicant&#8217;s race as one of many factors to improve diversity.</p>
<p>That approach stems from the university&#8217;s fraught experience with affirmative action and its efforts to maintain diversity on campus. I n 1996 a federal appeals court barred state universities in Texas,Louisiana and Mississippi from considering race as a factor when admitting students. That ruling,Hopwood v. Texas,caused minority enrollment at the University of Texas to plunge,with the number of black students falling by 40 percent,according to the university.</p>
<p>Marlen Whitley,a corporate lawyer in Houston who is black,says the effects of that decision were plain to see. Whitley was an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin when the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals handed down the Hopwood ruling. When he then entered the university&#8217;s law school,the third-year class,whose members were admitted before the Hopwood decision,included 25 to 30 African Americans,he said. In the class ahead of him,the first to enter after Hopwood,there were four black students,and in Whitley&#8217;s class there were eight.</p>
<p>There were barely enough students of color to fill up one row of one of the lecture halls in the law school,said Whitley,one of 14 former student body presidents to file a brief for the University of Texas.</p>
<p>In response to the shrinking minority student population,the state legislature enacted its top 10 percent law,which took effect in 1998. Because Texas high schools tend to be each dominated by one racial grouping,depending on their location,the law effectively ensured that top minority students from their schools would gain entrance.</p>
<p>In 2003 the Supreme Court handed down its Michigan decision,which allowed the University of Michigan Law School to continue to consider race as one of many qualities that make an applicant more desirable.</p>
<p>Then,two years later,based on the Supreme Court ruling in the Michigan case,Texas colleges started using race as a factor to admit students who weren&#8217;t chosen because they fell in the top 10 percent of their classes. For this group,the university considers race alongside a host of other factors such as extracurricular activities,family background and work experience.</p>
<p>In the current case,Fisher&#8217;s claim that the Texas program is unconstitutional rests o n the legal argument that,under the Equal Protection Clause,universities can use race only if there is no other way to improve diversity. Fisher argues that the top 10 percent law is sufficient for boosting racial diversity.</p>
<p>The University of Texas counters that the top 10 percent plan does not bring in enough minority students and that it needs to use race as a factor as it fills the rest of the class. It said the race-based process was responsible for 20 percent of all African American students and 15 percent of all Hispanic students admitted in 2008,the year Fisher was seeking admission.</p>
<p><b>Race neutral admissions</b></p>
<p>Some opponents of racial preferences argue in a friend-of-the-court brief in the Texas case that the experience of California,where affirmative action is banned,shows that universities can maintain diversity with race-neutral methods.</p>
<p> California voters amended the state&#8217;s constitution in 1996 to bar state universities from considering race in admissions. In response,the University of California adopted a program similar to the first prong of the Texas program,offering places to the top 9 percent of graduates from each state high school.</p>
<p>California has also sought to increase minority enrollment by reducing its reliance on standardized test scores and emphasizing other criteria such as low family income and being the first in a family to attend college. It also expanded its outreach efforts,working with schools in disadvantaged neighborhoods to better prepare students for college.</p>
<p>These efforts worked and minority enrollment at University of California schools is higher now than before the state banned affirmative action,said Richard Sander,a law professor at UCLA who filed a brief in the case along with Professor Stuart Taylor,a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank.</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees that the measures in California have been sufficient. T he University of California itself filed a brief in support of the University of Texas,saying the number of black students at its most selective campuses has not fully recovered from the ban on affirmative action.</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court decides to take race out of the equation entirely,the number of African American,Hispanic and Native American students at state universities would drop precipitously,said Lee Bollinger,who was president of the University of Michigan at the time of the 2003 case and now is president of Columbia University in New York City.</p>
<p>Columbia is among dozens of selective private colleges that have filed briefs in the Fisher case,saying their racial diversity will suffer if the Supreme Court says race cannot be a factor in admissions. They argue that it is not possible for private institutions like Columbia and Harvard,which draw applicants from all over the country,to implement a percentage plan like the ones in Texas and California.</p>
<p>That argument could sway the Supreme Court to issue a narrow ruling that voids only the Texas program. But the court,more conservative than when Justice Sandra Day O&#8217;Connor wrote the University of Michigan decision in 2003,could reject race-based policies altogether.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor predicted that as universities grew more diverse,the need to consider race in admissions would expire in 25 years. She has since retired,and her replacement,Justice Alito,has opposed racial preferences and could help bring an earlier end to their use.</p>
<p>The focus of both sides during the oral arguments scheduled for Wednesday will likely be Kennedy,who voted against affirmative action in 2003,though he did not take as hard a stance as his conservative colleagues. In a dissent from the majority opinion that upheld racial preferences,Kennedy accused the majority of being too deferential to the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Were the courts to apply a searching standard to race-based admissions schemes,that would force educational institutions to seriously explore race-neutral alternatives,he wrote.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1014106&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wanting &#8220;visible impact&#8221; of the affirmative action for employment of SCs and STs in private sector,the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office today asked the industry chambers to set time-bound targets and directed the Commerce Ministry to build a database for clarity on figures.</p>
<p>The PMO reviewed progress on the issue at a meeting chaired by the Prime Minister&#8217;s Principal Secretary Pulok Chatterjee and attended by representatives of chambers FICCI,CII and ASSOCHAM besides various ministries. </p>
<p>&#8220;In the meeting,progress was reviewed on affirmative action for SCs/STs. It was noted that some progress had been made in adopting the Voluntary Code of Conduct and running skill development and vocation education programs to improve the employability of weaker sections,&#8221; a PMO statement said. </p>
<p>The meeting decided that &#8220;there is scope to ramp up these initiatives and scale up the activities and coverage for there to be a visible impact and recognition of ongoing efforts&#8221;.</p>
<p>While referring to the actions taken by the three chambers,it was noted that &#8220;a lot of effort is being made but it is still sporadic and scattered&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was suggested that each industry chamber could work out a five-year vision voluntarily which could guide the annual action plans,the statement said,adding,&#8221;This would give an idea of the long term path and where they aim to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meeting felt that &#8220;a lot of work has been done in the area of affirmative  action but not captured well&#8221;,it said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A database also needs to be built up and shared with the Government. It was decided that Secretary (DIPP) would set up a system to collect quarterly data from the three chambers and build a database on Affirmative Action for Scs/STs,&#8221; the statement said. </p>
<p>At the meeting of Coordination Committee on Affirmative Action,industry chambers were requested to focus on certain geographical areas and leverage on similar other government programmes.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven districts identified as having 47 per cent population of Scs/STs as per the 2011 census could be adopted by industry associations,the statement said. </p>
<p>&#8220;Skill development is a national priority and focus should always be on the weaker sections of the society so as to enable them to avail the benefits of government programmes,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Pointing out that there is a huge demand for coaching for competitive examinations,especially in the rural areas,the meeting was of the view that this demand could be addressed by fixing quantifiable targets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conducting coaching classes is a very good idea for the SC/ST population and weaker sections,it was concurred,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>It said the PMO officials appreciated the work being done by the industry associations to promote the employment of SCs/STs and other disadvantaged groups and thanked the coordinating committee members for their suggestions. It was noted at the meeting that FICCI has adopted Sonbhadra district of Uttar Pradesh which has more than 47 per cent population of SCs/STs.</p>
<p>Two initiatives have been undertaken by FICCI recently  two skill development training centres were opened and an employment centre would also be opened soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In keeping with the demand of job aspirations of NET or Ph.D qualifiers,UGC has launched a dedicated academic job portal enabling candidates to register and create their profile online.</p>
<p>The portal &#8212; <a href="http://www.ugc.ac.in/jobportal" rel="nofollow">http://www.ugc.ac.in/jobportal</a> &#8212; would facilitate the employers to search and browse academic profile of candidates available on it and register and post the job vacancies on this portal so that candidates can apply against the vacancies,said UGC officials.</p>
<p>The HRD Ministry had also strongly advocated for such a website taking in view of the aspirations of the prospective candidates and higher education institutes for an academic job site.</p>
<p>&#8220;This portal is going to serve the two constituencies namely the job seekers and employers. While it will help students create their academic profile and bring them to the notice of the universities,colleges and other potential employers,it will also enable the employers to post their job vacancies for talent hunt,&#8221; UGC acting chairman Ved Prakash said in a letter to the vice chancellors.</p>
<p>Asking them to popularise the initiative,he requested the universities to consider uploading of job advertising of their universities for academic positions.</p>
<p>The portal will also provide browsing,searching,filtering of academic profiles created by qualified candidates on a number of parameters.</p>
<p>In addition,universities and other institutes as employer can also verify the NET qualified candidates through the same interface,the UGC official said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1013728&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad has made it to the list of top five B-schools in The Economist ranking in the Asia-Australasia region. The weekly newspaper has ranked the institute as the fifth best B-school in the region in its full-time MBA ranking 2012 list,moving up from its previous ninth position. </p>
<p>The B-school has also been ranked 56th in the global list,a jump from the previous 78th position,and remains the only B-school from the subcontinent to make it to the ranking,which includes 100 institutes from across the world.</p>
<p>However,significantly IIMA has been given a score of 0 (out of 100) in the international diversity score,meaning no one from outside the region study full-time course there.</p>
<p>The Indian Institute of Management at Ahmedabad is reckoned to be the leading business school in the subcontinent and also the toughest in the world to get into (over 700 people apply for every place). It has close links with industry and with state and national authorities and is increasingly international in attitude. The IIM has a good research base and an active involvement in management development in a number of important fields, The Economist reports. </p>
<p>The newspaper has also ranked the institute first in the world in terms of numbers of jobs three months after graduation and jobs found through the careers service.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1012806&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>University and college sports persons who bring laurels to the country in national and international events will be provided free education till the highest level,the government said today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any sports person,who brings laurels to the country,will be given free education up to the highest level,&#8221; HRD Minister Kapil Sibal told reporters here following approval of guidelines in this regard.</p>
<p>As per the guidelines,financial assistance will be reimbursed by UGC to the university concerned.</p>
<p>The university concerned will make &#8220;special efforts&#8221; in terms of completion of syllabus and attendance of the sports person due to loss of class,according to the guidelines.</p>
<p>This step would bring a big relief to sports persons like Unmukt Chand,captain of India&#8217;s World cup-winning under-19 cricket team,who had his share of ordeals regarding lack of attendance till the Delhi University Vice Chancellor had stepped in.</p>
<p>The HRD Minister also announced starting a national level university cricket league and university level hockey league to promote sports in a big way in campuses.</p>
<p>The cricket league would be played among eight top universities in T-20 format from among those who qualify through a zonal competition. Similarly,the hockey league will be played among top eight teams selected through zonal competitions.</p>
<p>NDTV is launching this initiative with Association of Indian Universities (AIU).</p>
<p>An organising committee chaired by the HRD Minister has been set up for the purpose comprising representatives of UGC,AIU,NDTV,Vice Chancellors of several universities,NDMC,Hockey India and eminent persons in the sports arena.</p>
<p>NDTV co-chairperson Prannoy Roy said the initiative is aimed at revitalising sports at the university level and promised to make it a &#8220;high quality&#8221; event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw gold medallist really start at the university level and we thoughT recognising sports at universities and fitness is very important&#8230;we will make sure it is high quality and encourage university students participate,cheer their teams,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The best eight cricketing teams will play matches at Jamia grounds here. Likewise,the hockey matches will be played here on astro-turf. NDTV will be telecasting the matches.</p>
<p>The Organising Committee,AIU and NDTV entered into an agreement yesterday to crystallise the collaborative effort of organising the UCL and UHL in a professional manner.</p>
<p>On successful organisation of the league in cricket and hockey,the concept may be extended by AIU to other sporting events in the University system,Sibal said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1012508&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite initial glitches and over 100 hacking attempts,more than 54,000 medicos have registered online in two days for the first common entrance test for all post-graduate courses in medical colleges in the country for 2013-14.</p>
<p>The National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for postgraduate (NEET-PG) courses,applicable for admission to 20,000 PG medical seats in 350 medical colleges,is being held between November 23 and December 6 this year.</p>
<p>The rush witnessed on the first day of opening of online registration brought about technical glitches as candidates of NEET complained of not being able to log on to the website while experts fended off 120 hacking attempts at the website.</p>
<p>While candidates complained of the website &#8216;crashing&#8217; for a few hours during registration yesterday,NBE officials claimed there was no such thing and said there were attempts of hacking. They also attributed the sudden rush to panic created by coaching centres.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some users may have experienced problem as candidates across the country tried to login at the same time&#8230;. There were also 120 attempts to hack the website and we had to activate many fireballs,&#8221; NBE director Bipin Batra told PTI.</p>
<p>Denying any website crash,Prometric,appointed by NBE to conduct the computer-based NEET-PG,said problems faced by students may have been due to heavy rush.</p>
<p>More tham 54,000 medicos had registered till 5 PM today after the registration process started on Thursday.</p>
<p>The registration and scheduling for the exam will remain open until November 12,while voucher sales are available from October 4 10.</p>
<p>The first computer-based NEET-PG test,being conducted by National Board of Examinations (NBE),will be held at selected test centres across 33 cities.</p>
<p>The NBE is separately holding a CET,the eligibility-cum- ranking examination for entry to various PG courses in modern medicine under it from November 17 to 20,online registration for which is being held from October 1 to November 12. NBE also announced additional 4,000 seats for its CET this year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1012497&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students of Jamia Millia Islamia,Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University marched to the offices of the Union Human Resource Development Ministry in Central Delhi in protest against the fee hike in Jamia. They also demanded students union elections in the university.</p>
<p>This is part of our Save Jamia campaign against the administrations attempts to impose an astronomical fee hike and curb the democratic rights of students, one of the protesters said.</p>
<p>Students from JNU and DU joined the protest in a show a solidarity as the protesters demanded that fee hike should be rolled back. </p>
<p>The administration has managed to take such arbitrary decisions because there is no students union in the university over the past six years, a Jamia student said.</p>
<p>The administration had justified the fee hike,citing new projects such as a laboratory at AJK Mass Communication Research Centre that needed money to execute.</p>
<p>The protesters have alleged that more than 35 students have been issued showcause notices for participating in a peaceful sit-in in Jamia a few days ago. Representatives from the administration have threatened the students, they said in a statement on Thursday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1012202&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delhi University (DU) has drawn up an evaluation schedule for the semester examinations to be held in December,following complaints of large-scale discrepancies in this years results. </p>
<p>The schedule,already up on the universitys website,states that evaluations have to done within four-six days after the examination process is completed. </p>
<p>For instance,the examination for the course   Environmental Issues of India will be held on November 20 and evaluation must be completed between November 23 and November 28.</p>
<p>The new schedule was proposed after the English department had to postpone its MA admission this year because of the delay in declaring the BA final-year examination results.</p>
<p>Then,the university attributed the delay to the change in the academic calendar,which forced the administration to conduct the examinations in May. </p>
<p>In September,students and parents discussed the delay in the results with DU Vice-Chancellor Dinesh Singh. He assured that results would be declared within three weeks after the semester examination in December. </p>
<p>University teachers said they support the idea of faster evaluation,but quality of assessment should not suffer.</p>
<p>Abha Dev Habib,a teacher in Miranda House,said: Around 500,000 answerscripts have to be checked. If a person is checking 70-80 sheets  per day,there is bound to be some error. </p>
<p>Students seem to agree. Nikita Rohilla,a third-year BCom (Honours) student in Daulat Ram College,said the quality of evaluation should not be compromised. </p>
<p>My second-year results came out on August 14. Despite the delay,there were problems with the marksheet. I was marked absent in one paper,though I sat for the examination, she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1012201&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a major relief to a meritorious student &#8220;deliberately&#8221; failed by a faculty member,the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has held that she was fit and received the gold medal after scoring high marks in a retest conducted by Nagpur University. </p>
<p>The court dismissed a petition filed by another student who had challenged Juhi Bhandge&#8217;s inclusion in the list of gold medallists on the ground that she was failed in the first semester of her LLM examination.</p>
<p>Juhi had clinched as many as 11 prizes including gold medals in the 2010 convocation.</p>
<p>During her viva-voce exam for LLM course,S B Narnaware,working with NU&#8217;s Post Graduate Teaching Department (PGTD) of law,allegedly having some grudge against her,refused to allow her to appear in exam citing reason of poor attendance. She was subsequently declared failed in semester exam.</p>
<p>Juhi then approached the Board of Examinations (BoE) of the University which constituted a panel under Law Faculty Dean Ashok Pawde in its meeting of February 2,2010. The panel found that she had indeed recorded more than 75% attendance and severely reprimanded Narnaware.</p>
<p>Pawde panel in its report submitted on July 17,2010,termed Narnaware&#8217;s act as &#8220;most arbitrary exercise of power by a teacher while denying genuine opportunity to a student&#8221;.</p>
<p>S L Deshpande,working in same department as Narnaware,then took Juhi&#8217;s viva-voce exam and declared her passed.</p>
<p>NU then declared revised results giving her 1129 marks</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1011901&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>US and British universities continue to dominate in academic excellence but Asia is catching up fast,said an influential education rankings report.</p>
<p>The California Institute of Technology kept its top spot in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2012-2013,which also saw the University of Oxford rising two positions &#8212; ahead of Harvard &#8212; to jointly share second place with Stanford University.</p>
<p>The United States retained the overall number one spot with 76 of its universities securing a place in the top 200 institutions,followed by Britain.</p>
<p>The University of Cambridge slipped one place to seventh while the Imperial College London held on to the eight spot.</p>
<p>France has seven institutions in the top 200 compared to five last year.</p>
<p>A closer analysis of the rankings,however,showed many US and British institutions losing ground in contrast to Asia.</p>
<p>Universities in China,Singapore,Taiwan and especially South Korea witnessed a surge in performance in what was described as evidence of a power shift from the West to the East.</p>
<p>Dirk Van Damme,head of the Innovation and Measuring Progress Division at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),said: &#8220;Academic excellence is gradually shifting away from the 20th-century centres. The US and the UK still dominate the absolute summit,but they face a severe loss of total position in the top 200 list.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranking system warned of Britain slipping into global mediocrity within a generation due to funding cuts,higher tuition fees and rising global competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Outside the golden triangle of London,Oxford and Cambridge,England&#8217;s world-class universities face a collapse into global mediocrity,&#8221; Phil Baty,editor of the Times Higher Education rankings,said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huge investment in top research universities across Asia is starting to pay off. And while the sun rises in the East,England faces a perfect storm,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The Times used 13 performance indicators to evaluate more than 700 universities including on research,teaching,knowledge transfer and international outlook. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1011790&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two students of Faculty of Commerce of M S University were allegedly stabbed by another student of the same faculty outside Unit Building after a tiff over filling exam forms on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>The scuffle took place around 3.15 pm when students were standing in a queue to submit their forms for ATKT (allow to keep term) for first year of B.Com. Victims Jaimin Patel and his friend Darpan Desai were attacked by one Deepak Jha and his friends after Patel accidentally crushed Jhas toes while standing in the line,Sayajigunj police said. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>A student challenged the rule which says that the permissible age limit to contest elections shall be calculated as on the date of nomination. Otherwise,the age as on the date of commencement of academic session is taken into consideration for all purposes,he said</i></p>
<p>The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court today stayed the elections of Lucknow University Students Union (LUSU),which were scheduled for October 15. </p>
<p>A bench comprising Justices Uma Nath Singh and Virendra Kumar Dixit passed the order on a petition of Hemant Singh,a student,who challenged the rule which says that the permissible age limit to contest elections shall be calculated as on the date of nomination. </p>
<p>His counsel Prashant Singh Atal said ordinarily,the age as on the date of commencement of academic session is taken into consideration for all purposes. But,as a result of this rule,the petitioner had become overage to contest the election. </p>
<p>The petitioner sought a direction to Lucknow University to consider his candidature for contesting the students union election by calculating his age as on the date of commencement of academic session. </p>
<p>Other universities,including Delhi University and Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna University,Dehradun,have considered the age of the candidate as on the beginning of the academic session, Hemant said. </p>
<p>The Lyngodh committee had recommended that elections should be held within 6 to 8 weeks from the date of beginning of the academic session. LUs academic session started on July 16 but the election notification was issued on September 25,nine days after the recommended eight weeks time. On September 27,I gave a memorandum to returning officer N K Pandey and others,but no action was taken, said Hemant. </p>
<p>The notification for election has been issued after eight weeks,and thus,the petitioner has stood disqualified to contest the election only on the ground of being overaged which should ordinarily be calculated as on the date of commencement of academic session, said the bench. </p>
<p>In the interest of justice the LUSU polls scheduled for October 15 as notified on September 25 needs to be stayed till the next date of hearing, the court stated.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1011764&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At least 50 students of different Delhi University (DU) colleges,who are currently on an educational tour to Rajasthan,have fallen ill in Jaisalmer,officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They are part of 900 students on an educational train trip on the Gyanodaya Express,organised by the university.  </p>
<p>Professor C S Dubey,Chairman of Core Committee of Gyanodyaya,said around 50 students had fallen ill. There were around 50 students who had fallen ill. To reach the border in Jaisalmer,the students had covered a distance of around 200 km by bus. By the time they returned to the camp,they were exhausted. Some of them fell ill. Even though we have a doctor on board the train,an Army doctor was called. Most of them were dehydrated and were given glucose. All of them have recovered and are looking forward to the remaining part of the journey, Dubey said.</p>
<p>The students are camping in the Sam area,around 40 km from Jaisalmer. The group reached Bikaner on September 30 and were in Jaisalmer on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Several university officials said almost 200 students were taken ill. </p>
<p>A hospital official in Jaisalmer said it is suspected that the food they had on Tuesday night was contaminated. The students started vomiting and complained of abdominal pain on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Seventy of them were hospitalised,while 150 others were given primary treatment in Jawahar Hospital on Wednesday, a hospital source said.</p>
<p>This is the second Gyanodyaya Express trip organised by the university. The group comprises mostly NSS and NCC cadets,while around 30 physically challenged students are also part of the September 26 to October 5 trip.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1011562&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students of Panjab University Students&#8217; Union (PUSU) protested outside the Vice-Chancellor&#8217;s office on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The protesters rued that even though three weeks had passed since the PUCSC elections were conducted,students were yet to see any student-friendly decision being taken by the new students&#8217; council.</p>
<p>They demanded construction of a large reading hall with a sitting capacity of 1,000 in the girls&#8217; hostels. The procedure to pass the proposal of construction should be brought in at the earliest as it will eventually solve the problem of lack of sitting capacity at the AC Joshi Library,and also will be a boon for the girls residing in university hostels.</p>
<p>They also demanded renovation of washrooms and toilets in boys&#8217; hostels,and revival of M Phil in the Hindi Department. Sanjeev Sharma,PUSU working president,said,These are basic issues which the authorities must address as soon as possible,and the students&#8217; council should also take up the matter&#8221;.</p>
<p>Senior PUSU leaders,including chairperson Jeevanjyot Chahal and party incharge Sumit Goklaney,were also present.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1011556&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Touted as countrys largest university,the Lovely Professional University (LPU) situated at Jalandhar in Punjab has launched what it claims as countrys largest high-tech campus library. </p>
<p>This nine-storey Central Library,with real equidistant approach for all the 25000+ students,has been erected spaciously on 1.5 lakh sq feet covered area,housing a rich collection of varied knowledge enhancing material. More than 1,02,846 text books,reference books,journals,magazines,audio,videos,CD-ROMs,research reports,online databases,data analysis software,in different areas and branches of all study-disciplines,are made readily available for its users,at present. </p>
<p>LPU Chancellor,Ashok Mittal informed that the knowledge center library is connected to research block which will make it very convenient for the researchers to utilize its strength. There are also separate group discussion rooms for students and staff members,which will provide all users an opportunity to explore world of knowledge in an environment of pin drop silence. </p>
<p>Ashok Mittal added that LPU wanted to develop reading habits amongst the students so that they become research oriented. Illustrative,the library is open 24/7 and has all basic facilities like cafeteria,washrooms,cloak room,xerox facility,Wi-Fi internet connectivity,reference service etc. All students and teachers,who join the University,automatically become its members. </p>
<p>The library is RFID enabled,where all the books have RFID tags,laced with multiple exits and entries,guarded by RF Gates. One step ahead,library has system for self check-in and check-out,where students can return the books,without any intervention of library staff. Also the software for this allows the students to check books,anywhere from the world; and,a request can also be made to hold the book for issuance. </p>
<p>Another unique feature is online resource-center with 400 computer terminals. Ashok Mittal said that this has been specially planned,as more information is readily available on internet,from where one can make extensive search. This can greatly help to generate information on-line and also to make access for on-line journals. Also,library being Wi-Fi enabled,the students can carry lap-tops too. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1011407&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court today directed the Centre and state governments to provide basic infrastructure,including drinking water and toilets,in all schools within six months.</p>
<p>A Bench headed by Justice K S Radhakrishnan fixed the time limit and asked the governments to take steps to provide the basic facilities in schools across the country.</p>
<p>The Bench said that all its previous directions pertaining to providing infrastructure should be implemented within the time frame fixed by it.</p>
<p>On October 18 last year,the apex court had directed all states and union territories to build toilets,particularly for girls,in all government schools.</p>
<p>The court passed the order on a PIL seeking its direction to Centre and state governments to provide basic facilities of drinking water and toilets in schools.</p>
<p>The apex court had earlier stated that it was imperative that all schools provide toilet facilities,as empirical researches indicated that wherever toilet facilities are not provided in schools,parents do not send their children (particularly girls) to schools.</p>
<p>The court had also observed that not providing the infrastructure was a violation of the right to free and compulsory education of children guaranteed under Article 21-A of the Constitution. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1011291&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A US university professor was taken into protective custody after he took off his clothes in front of the class and started shouting at the students.</p>
<p>A call came in to the local police dispatch centre &#8220;about a man in the Michigan State University Engineering Building shouting in the hallway&#8221;,a statement posted on the university website said.</p>
<p>&#8220;MSU police responded and took the man,a university professor,into protective custody and transported him to a local hospital,&#8221; the ABC News quoted the University website as saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one was injured and the professor is not being charged with a crime,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>Students posting on social media named the professor,but the university spokesman did not confirm the man&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>A student from the university posted a photo on a social media website with the comment &#8220;My math teacher just stripped naked during class and was arrested! Go MSU!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in Calc 1 at Michigan State University,and my teacher was always pretty eccentric,but today he went overboard. Half way through class he started screaming at us,swearing left and right,&#8221; said a student.</p>
<p>&#8220;He then started slamming his hands on the window and pressing his face against it,still screaming. Eventually he walked out and down the hallway to the end,all while screaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;He then came back into the classroom and took off his clothes,except for his socks. You know someone&#8217;s crazy when they leave their socks on lmao. At this point everyone in class ran out. We were literally scared for our lives. The police took about 15 minutes to get here and during this time he continued walking around screaming,&#8221; the student said.</p>
<p>According to the university,the school&#8217;s counselling centre &#8220;has reached out to students who may have witnessed the incident to offer any support they need.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1010880&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has asked a Gondia-based college management to conduct a fresh probe against three lecturers before terminating their services.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a travesty of justice if these employees,who have rendered continuous service for 13 to 14 years should not be granted protection,&#8221; a division bench of Justices Vasanti Naik and Arun Chaudhari observed before disposing of their petitions yesterday.</p>
<p>The court asked Wainganga Bahuudeshiya Vikas Sanstha,which runs Rajiv Gandhi Mahavidyalaya in Sadak Arjuni in neighbouring Gondia district,to conduct a fresh inquiry against the lecturers  Rajkumar Bhagat,Anil Gaikwad,and Diwakar Kamble ¿ and put them under suspension instead of terminating them from service till the probe is completed.</p>
<p>The judges also set aside the orders of University and College Tribunal,Nagpur,terminating the services of the lecturers while granting liberty to the management to conduct an inquiry against them and complete it within a year.</p>
<p>The college management was also told to pay the lecturers subsistence allowance during the suspension period. </p>
<p>The three lecturers were charge-sheeted by the management for alleged acts of misconduct and departmental inquiry was instituted. Subsequently,they were terminated from service.</p>
<p>They filed appeals before the tribunal which held that university&#8217;s permission was not required for terminating them.</p>
<p>It also ruled that they could not be confirmed in the service since they did not possess NET/SET (national eligibility test/ state eligibility test for lecturership) qualifications,as made mandatory by the UGC.</p>
<p>Both sides then moved the Nagpur bench filing five petitions against each other.</p>
<p>A single-judge bench then ruled in the lecturers&#8217; favour stating that the university&#8217;s prior permission was required before terminating the services of services.</p>
<p>Both sides then filed petitions in the High Court.</p>
<p>It would be a contradiction of sorts if the services of teachers are allowed to be terminated without prior permission of the university,as required by Statute 53 (3).</p>
<p>It would also lead to an anomalous situation wherein on the one hand the state government deems it fit to protect the services of teachers till their retirement despite lack of NET/SET,and on the other hand the management is allowed to terminate their services without university&#8217;s prior permission,&#8221; the judges observed.</p>
<p>Citing a GR of October 18,2001,the judges said it was not possible to apply the NET/SET norms mandated by UGC in an abrupt manner in the state and to expel the lecturers who do not possess NET/SET qualification.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are around 6,000 lecturers appointed between September 19,1991,and December 11,1999,in all the state universities without NET/SET qualification.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1010847&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s good news for students appearing for the Class X and XII examinations conducted by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) in March next.</p>
<p>The council,which runs around 2000 schools across the country,has decided to reduce the examination fee by over 50 per cent in the next examinations</p>
<p>&#8220;We have decided to reduce examination fees from Rs 2100 to Rs 1000 this time&#8221;,said CISCE chairman Jose Aikara.</p>
<p>&#8220;The council had increased the examination fees as it required funds for various purposes. The council has decided to cut the amount from next year for the benefit of students&#8221;,he said on the sideline of a function here.</p>
<p>About 1.60 lakh students in Class X and 80,000 students in Class XII examinations had appeared last time. The number of candidates for both the examinations was expected to increase this time,he said.   </p>
<p>Aikara said CISCE had already introduced the common syllabus at the higher secondary level. The students would appear for the examinations in 2014 as per the common syllabus designed as per the suggestions given by experts. </p>
<p>The syllabus in Mathematics,Chemistry,Physics,Biology and Commerce had been changed as per suggestion by experts. The government wanted that the students would appear in the examination in 2014 in uniform syllabus across the country.</p>
<p>He,however,said CISCE would maintain its identity from others adding a few more subjects in some courses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Extra courses which are relevant to the students and will help them in the all India joint entrance examinations for the professional courses have been added&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said the CISCE had made the English language subject more difficult than CBSE keeping an eye on the future examinations of the students and aspirations of the parents.</p>
<p>On advantages of CISCE course,he claimed it was recognized by many foreign countries,including UK and students were not required to clear the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) to study abroad.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1010330&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CBSE chairman Vineet Joshi said replacing the numbers game with grading system in schools has brought down cases of suicide by students who could not obtain good marks in exams.</p>
<p>The suicide rates by students has come down considerably in the last three-four years after grading system was put in place,Joshi said.</p>
<p>He said in the marks system,students and teachers were only focussed on getting good marks,whereas the grades system would ensure overall development of all students.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1010270&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The presidents post in the elections to the Allahabad University Students Union (AUSU) went to Dinesh Singh Yadav of Samajwadi Chhatra Sabha (SCS),the student wing of Samajwadi Party. The AUSU elections were held after a gap of seven years on Saturday.</p>
<p>The post of vice-president went to Shalu Yadav of All-India Students Association (AISA),affiliated to Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) (Liberation). Abhishek Singh alias Michael,who is at present lodged in jail for allegedly opening fire at another candidate Abhishek Singh alias Sonu on July 16,bagged the post of general secretary. Michael and Sonu both were earlier booked under the Gangster Act. </p>
<p>The Congress-backed National Students Union of India (NSUI) fared badly ending up in fourth and fifth positions on all the main posts.</p>
<p>The counting of the votes amid presence of senior district administration and police officials continued through the night and ended at 5 am today. The oath taking ceremony will take place on Monday. </p>
<p>According to the university election officials,Dinesh Singh garnered 2,543 votes beating his nearest rival Sonu,who managed 1,491 votes,to become the AUSU president. Abhyuday Tripathi of NSUI got 896 votes,ending up at fifth position. AISAs Shalu Yadav,who secured 2,596 votes,defeated her nearest rival Alok Kumar Singh (1,671 votes) of SCS to become the vice-president. NSUIs Prabhat Kumar Singh finished at fifth position with 756 votes.</p>
<p>The general secretarys post went to Michael,an independent candidate,who got 1,836 votes. His nearest rival,SCSs Raghvendra Yadav,lost by only 44 votes. NSUIs Vikas Tiwari ended up at fourth position with 1,049 votes.</p>
<p>Daya Shankar Yadav,who had fought independently,became the joint secretary,while Dev Mani Mishra bagged the cultural secretarys post.</p>
<p>Although the university authorities claimed that everything possible was done to follow the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations during the elections,there was open use of posters,pamphlets and other publicity material,interference of political parties,and candidates with criminal backgrounds were also in the fray. Election Officer (AU),Prof B N Singh,said: If one is talking about cleaning the entire system,one person or an official cannot do anything on his own. Everybody will have to pull together in one direction. However,in so far as fulfilling responsibilities are concerned,we have left no stone unturned.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1010217&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of the 40 students in Delhi Universitys meta-college course,BTech in Humanities,many have excellent marks that could have guaranteed admission in almost every course in the university.</p>
<p>On her way to class,which started last week,Pallavi Tirkey told Newsline that she got 95.5 per cent in Class XII and secured a seat in English (Honours) in St Stephens College. </p>
<p>But the idea of studying a subject for three years seemed daunting. I studied Humanities in Class XII. The meta-college course,I felt,will give me the freedom to study a range of subjects. I do not have to follow a restrictive syllabus. I can design my own degree, she said. </p>
<p>Like her,Divyansh Dev shifted to BTech in Humanities despite securing a seat in English (Honours) in Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College. I want to make a career in business journalism. While journalism aspirants opt for English (Honours) or Mass Comm (Honours),I felt the meta-college course is more suited for me. I can study Economics as well as Journalism and English at the same time, he said. </p>
<p>The current education system is based on rote learning. This meta-college course,with its emphasis on hands-on training,attempts to subvert the existing system. For instance,we are planning to form a co-operative and start our own canteen. This will be one of the projects of the course, Divyansh said.</p>
<p>There are others like Vikalp Kumar,who had taken admission in BA Programme in Dyal Singh Evening College last year. I chose BA Programme because I could study four subjects in one course. However,the attitude of the faculty was discouraging. The course was not intellectually stimulating, he said. </p>
<p>So,Vikalp switched over to the meta-college programme despite losing a year in the process.</p>
<p>Teachers at Cluster Innovation Centre (CIC),where classes for BTech in Humanities are held,said the teaching method is quite different from the traditional system.</p>
<p>Dr Jagdish N Sinha,who taught modern Indian history in Rajdhani College before joining the CIC,said: I have been jolted out of an intellectual lethargy. The course does not require us to just lecture students,but to talk and seek reactions from them. </p>
<p>Dr Sukrita Kaul,the course co-ordinator,said: Keeping in mind the emphasis on interaction,the classroom has been arranged differently,too. The seating arrangement is circular instead of the teacher facing the students in the usual set-up. </p>
<p>Kaul admitted that it did take some time for the students to get comfortable with the system. A lot of unlearning had to be done, she said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1010130&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Centre does not appear to be inclined to meet the demand of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to name the proposed Central University at Motihari after Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p>An indication to this effect was given by HRD minister Kapil Sibal when he said no such institution has been named after any leader so far.</p>
<p>Kumar had asked the Centre to name the Central University at Motihari after Mahatma Gandhi as the place has been karambhoomi of the father of the nation.</p>
<p>The Centre,which sanctioned two universities at Motihari and Gaya,had decided to name them as Central University North Bihar and Central University South Bihar respectively.</p>
<p>The decision to set up the two Central Universities was taken by the Centre following the prolonged slug-fest between Bihar government and the HRD Ministry over the location of the Central University in the state.</p>
<p>While the HRD had proposed a Central University at Gaya,the state government had insisted that it should be setup at Motihari.</p>
<p>Kumar in a letter to HRD Minister Kapil Sibal had said since Motihari has been karambhoomi (work place) of Mahatma Gandhi it would be proper to name the university after him.</p>
<p>He had suggested the university be named either as &#8216;Mahatama Gandhi Central University&#8217; or &#8216;Bapu Central University&#8217;.</p>
<p>Sources in the HRD Ministry,however,said they would examine the suggestion of the Parliamentary Standing Committee which will examine the Central Universities (Amendment) Bill for setting up two Universities in Bihar.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1009647&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Pranab Mukherjee has asked Vice Chancellors and educationists to imbibe Nobel laureate poet and writer Rabindranath Tagore&#8217;s spirit of universalism and pluralism.</p>
<p>Mukherjee made these remarks during an interaction with a group of intellectuals at the Raj Bhavan last evening after receiving a briefing on higher education scenario in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>The President called upon them to not just achieve high standards but also maintain them on a sustained basis.</p>
<p>Mukherjee said he has asked the Union Minister of Human Resource Development to convene a conference of Vice Chancellors of Central Universities so that problems affecting higher education in the country can be discussed in detail.</p>
<p>Complimenting the gathering for their contribution to higher education,he reminisced how the first Prime Minister of the country Jawaharlal Nehru had once said that if given an option,he would choose the job of Chancellor of Vishwabharati University over being the Prime Minister of India.</p>
<p>Recalling his days in Shantiniketan,the President called upon intellectuals to imbibe and implement in their university the spirit of universalism and pluralism that Tagore expounded. The President also said a country like India with a billion plus population had no option but to deal with the dual challenges of quantity and quality simultaneously.</p>
<p>Governor N N Vohra apprised the President about the rapid growth of higher education in the State in recent years with the establishment of many new universities and colleges.</p>
<p>The participants put forth several suggestions,including the need to emphasise upon quality of teaching and research,the importance of equipping students with required skills to enhance their employability as well as identifying core areas of excellence for each university.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1009197&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reacting to the sharp decrease over the last few years in the number of international students studying in MS University,the universitys authorities are planning to reach out to students in West Asia and African countries to try and get them to join various courses being offered here.</p>
<p>The university is in the process of finalising a deal with a Jordan-based agency to rope in foreign students from as many as 19 countries in West Asia and Africa,and hopes to see their number rising from around 27 currently to 150 within a year,and to 300 in three years.</p>
<p>Students from countries such as Jordan,Egypt,Lebanon,Syria,Iraq,Sudan,Libya,Qatar,Kuwait,Bahrain,Saudi Arabia,Oman,Iran,Yemen,UAE,Morocco,Tunisia,Turkey,and Palestine will be roped in to join courses at MSU.</p>
<p>Out of the roughly 35,000 students enrolled in the university,only 27 belong to foreign countries. The number of such students was 40 three years ago,university officials said. </p>
<p>The university boasted of a sizable number of foreign students in the 1980s and 1990s,but the number came down because of complications involved,such as in seeking admission and getting a students visa. To ease the admission process,we are planning to enter into an agreement with a Jordan-based agency,and hope to see a large number of foreign students at the campus in different faculties, director of the International Affairs Cell,Sharad Bansal told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>The university officials said that this will be a major step towards internationalising the university,which already runs a host of student and faculty exchange programmes with different foreign universities. </p>
<p>Other than specialised courses offered by the faculties of Fine Arts and Performing Arts,the students from abroad will also be encouraged to join courses offered by the faculties of Science,Arts and Commerce,among others,Bansal said.</p>
<p>The agency will advertise about the university and courses on offer here as our official representatives to the nineteen countries. The agency will also carry out the entire admission process,which includes providing them our admission forms,paying fees,arranging student visa,among others, he said.</p>
<p>According to the letter of intent received by university authorities,the MSU will not pay anything to the agency for the service.</p>
<p>University registrar and in-charge of communication cell Amit Dholakia said the university will also propose the setting up of a separate hostel for the students from abroad. The number of foreign students at MSU is much lower than many other universities in India,but we are seriously considering bringing back students from abroad, he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1009036&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India has teamed up with software-maker Punflay to offer free of charge,the company&#8217;s &#8216;virtual frog dissection&#8217; application to science classrooms in schools and universities,a PETA release said today.</p>
<p>&#8220;PETA India is eager to help universities and other schools take the lead in teaching biology using humane and modern methods&#8221;,PETA India Science Policy Adviser Dr</p>
<p>Chaitanya Koduri said.</p>
<p>Punflay&#8217;s &#8216;virtual frog dissection app&#8217; available for desktops,laptops,Macs,iPads,netbooks and interactivewhiteboards,simulates dissection with life-like graphics that </p>
<p>offer a bloodless field,colour differentiation and clarity that cannot be achieved with animal dissection.</p>
<p>The move comes after new guidelines were issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the University Grants Commission (UGC) to replace animal dissection in life-sciences education,under pressure from animal rights activists led by PETA.</p>
<p>However,the decision has drawn criticism from biology teachers,who fear that the ruling will hamper anatomy lessons,producing a generation of researchers without</p>
<p>appropriate laboratory skills.</p>
<p>The rationale for the ban on animal testing has perplexed teachers such as Birendra Nath Mallick,a neurobiologist at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.</p>
<p>For instance,UGC guidelines say that because anatomical knowledge has been expanded through advances in other branches of biology,there is now &#8220;an over-emphasis of learning of anatomy as laboratory exercises&#8221; &#8211; a view that Mallick finds &#8220;very myopic&#8221;.</p>
<p>The commission also says that its decision is based on a concern over biodiversity loss,but Mallick,says,he is not aware of any data specifically linking species extinction with the use of animals for dissection.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1008799&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Indian offshore engineering research and development (ER&amp;D) services market is expected to reach USD 37-45 billion by 2020 and create over one million jobs,software industry body Nasscom said today.</p>
<p>This exponential growth is a result of flexible business models,short product life cycles and decreasing time to market,Nasscom President Som Mittal said at the two-day Engineering Summit 2012 at Pune.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian ER&amp;D service has played a pivotal role in accelerating innovation and is establishing India as a design and innovation hub,&#8221; Mittal said,adding that incremental growth will be driven by newer verticals and markets.</p>
<p>ER&amp;D exports are estimated to be USD 10.2 billion,growing year-on-year at 14 per cent and comprising 15 per cent share of the IT-BPO exports.</p>
<p>Mittal said the domestic Indian ER&amp;D market is expected to add to future growth with infrastructure,automotive,aerospace and energy as well as increasing focus on promoting local manufacturing.</p>
<p>&#8220;To further build on this leadership position,the industry needs to pursue continued efforts to build a high-calibre R&amp;D pool by instilling relevant research aptitudes and capabilities,both from educational and training perspective,&#8221; Mittal added.</p>
<p>While the ER&amp;D services industry has been growing by leaps and bounds,certain challenges exist and and require immediate redressal.</p>
<p>&#8220;India needs to sustain its cost competitiveness and fill its absence of linkages to manufacturing capabilities. Also,lack of a formal innovation policy and supporting ecosystem will pose a threat to the budding ecosystem. Collaborative</p>
<p>action is required to ensure future growth,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>India is now an emerging epicentre of the global ER&amp;D market with more companies exploiting its supply base for future growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is important for major stakeholders of this industry &#8211; Indian Government and trade associations to ensure the growth trajectory of the industry and moving it to the next</p>
<p>level of product development,&#8221; Mittal said.</p>
<p>The theme of the summit is &#8216;Engineering Innovations for a better world&#8217; and has focus on key verticals including automotive,robotics,construction,heavy engineering and</p>
<p>telecom. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1008749&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delhi&#8217;s Vasant Valley school has left behind Valley School Bangalore and the city&#8217;s Shri Ram School to emerge as the best day education institution for children in a country-wide survey that also figures two other schools from the capital in the top 10.</p>
<p>The survey featured opinions of over 3,000 parents,teachers,and educationists spread across 21 cities who were asked to rate 443 of India&#8217;s best known schools on 14 parameters.</p>
<p>While Vasant Valley emerged as the best,Valley School Bangalore was rated as the second best day school in the country,pipping last year&#8217;s topper Shri Ram School to the third spot,also shared by Cathedral and John Connon School,Mumbai.</p>
<p>The poll by EducationWorld-C fore asked respondents to vote among the 443-odd schools in three categories  day,boarding and international schools,and the parameters included besides academic reputation and infrastructure the quality of extra curricula and sports education as well as friendliness to the disabled and competence and welfare of the faculty.</p>
<p>Besides Vasant Valley and Shri Ram School,two other Delhi schools featured in the top 10 &#8212; DPS,R K Puram (Fifth) and Springdales,Dhaula Kuan (Seventh).</p>
<p>Sanskriti school and Mother&#8217;s International which were in the top 10 category in the last year&#8217;s survey were missing from the lead this year.</p>
<p>On the list of boarding schools,the Rishi Valley School,Chittoor retained its top spot while The Doon School,Dehradun was rated as the second.</p>
<p>Indus International School,Bangalore and Dhirubhai Ambani International School,Mumbai were the top two schools in the international school category,according to the survey.</p>
<p>The researchers say the results indicate a tilting towards institutions that are ready to offer new and experiment pedagogies to make the experience of learning more friendly to children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within parent and teacher communities,there&#8217;s new awareness that school education should be an engaging,joyful and life skills development experience for children.</p>
<p>&#8220;Therefore,so-called alternative schools which profess holistic,new pedagogies have become more popular and have moved up the tables,&#8221; says Premchand Palety,founder-chief executive of market research agency C Fore (Centre For Forcasting and Reserach). </p>
<p>Among the other top 10 day schools that emerged in the survey are Step by Step,Noida,Sulochanadev Singhania School,Thane,and Centre for Learning Bangalore,among others.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1008746&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A total of 120 Indian School Certificate Examination (ICSE) schools in Punjab,Haryana and Chandigarh have come under the scanner of the Board for alleged non-compliance of various provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act,non-submission of annual accounts to their respective governments,non-payment of salaries and not responding to official communications of the Board. </p>
<p>While 92 of these are from Punjab,26 are from Haryana and two from Chandigarh. This information was provided by the ICSE to the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Wednesday during the resumed hearing of a PIL seeking directions to private schools not to increase the fees beyond a permissible limit and increase the same by informing their respective education boards and state governments. </p>
<p>The schools,which are not complying with the provisions of the Right to Education Act,the Council proposes to issue showcause notices for withdrawal of their affiliation&#8230; reads the affidavit filed by Gerry Arathoon,Chief Executive and Secretary with Council for the ICSE. </p>
<p>According to ICSE,23 affiliated schools have not submitted their annual accounts to the state government. Moreover,22 private schools have failed to respond to the letters of the council seeking information regarding submission of annual accounts. While seven schools from Punjab and Haryana were not complying with the provisions of the Act,64 schools were not paying salary as per the affiliation guidelines and state government norms,it added. Also,there are four schools that have failed to respond to the letters of the Council and not given any information regarding the salaries paid to its teachers and employees. </p>
<p>The case will come for resumed hearing on October 8.  </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1008603&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) has written a letter to the Universitys Chancellor,the Vice- President of India,regarding the low representation of teachers from the university campus to the Senate and requested him to nominate more university professors.</p>
<p>The letter says that out of 36 ordinary fellows to be nominated by the Chancellor,at least 18 teachers from the university campus should be nominated to the Senate for the next term.</p>
<p>The letter mentions that the Senate has 91 ordinary fellows as its members. It includes ex-officio members,and the members elected from various constituencies. Of the total 47 elected members,the teachers of the PU campus are only five,including the PUTA president. In the present constitution of Senate,the representation of teachers from university campus is very less. As a result,university campus teachers do not get their due representation in the Syndicate,Board of Finance and other important bodies.</p>
<p>PUTA president Khalid Mohammad said,Panjab University has one of the most experienced and efficient faculty in the country. They have immediate and better understanding of weaknesses and strengths of the university. Panjab University teachers have served and are currently contributing to different scientific,technical and literary bodies at the national level. Many of them are on the advisory committees of the state governments and Central ministries.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1008450&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Delhi University administration and the teachers association seem to be deadlocked in a never-ending game of one-upmanship.</p>
<p>Days after the Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) announced that it will launch an indefinite relay hunger strike to protest the sidelining of teachers in matters of policy making,the administration sends a letter to principals asking them to deduct salaries of teachers who participated in a earlier day-long strike.</p>
<p>The letter from the Deputy Registrar to Deans,Heads of Departments and College Principals,described as illegal by DUTA refers to the August 28 strike organised by DUTA.</p>
<p>Just after the strike was announced in August,the varsity administration had written to principals,asking them to cancel leaves and invoke &#8216;no work,no pay&#8217; and maintain attendance records of teachers during work-hours.</p>
<p>The latest letter is a follow up of that order and asks principals and deans to implement that order.</p>
<p>DUTA is expectedly outraged at the development.</p>
<p>This letter smacks of the arrogance and authoritarianism which have become the hallmark of the current University Administration. Since the teachers&#8217; service conditions are well-defined in the University Ordinances,the Vice Chancellor has no authority,not even under emergency powers,to take any such action, said a statement.</p>
<p>It pointed out at a recent decision to cut salaries of non-teaching staff members.</p>
<p>The same objections apply to the recent decision to cut the salaries of DUCKU members. This absolutist mode of functioning befits a feudal king and not the chief academic and executive officer of a modern educational institution, it said while calling on to college governing bodies to safeguard the right of their teachers to participate in democratic action on legitimate issues.</p>
<p>At a General Body meeting on Sunday,DUTA had decided to intensify the stir against the varsity administration and agreed to launch a relay hunger strike beginning October 10 to protest against the way decisions were being made in the varsity.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1008077&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ten days after the results of Delhi University Students Union elections were announced,members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) on Tuesday took out a march in the university to protest against the administration for the police lathicharge on students on September 15. </p>
<p>They also demanded that action be taken against the election officer for the alleged rigging of the DUSU polls. </p>
<p>DUSU elections,this year,saw National Students Union of India winning the top three posts  president,vice-president and secretary  while the post of joint-secretary saw a tie between ABVP candidate Vishu Basoya and NSUI candidate Raveena Choudhary. </p>
<p>A delegation from the university met the students and a memorandum,demanding an inquiry into the election process and the setting up of a high level committee for the purpose,was submitted. </p>
<p>ABVP state secretary Rohit Chahal said if the university fails to act against the election officer,ABVP will adopt an aggressive approach to push its demands. </p>
<p>ABVP also filed three petitions on these issues in the High Court on Tuesday. </p>
<p>We are demanding that action be taken against the violators of the Lyngdoh Committee guidelines. While the university has set up a fact-finding committee,no report has been submitted by the committee till now. We have filed a case in this matter, Chahal said. </p>
<p>Prior to the polling date,all four candidates of both NSUI and ABVP had been issued show-cause notices for violating Lyngdoh Committee guidelines by using printed paper during campaigning. </p>
<p>A three -member committee has been set up by the Delhi University to look into the issue. </p>
<p>ABVP has also filed a petition in the High Court regarding the manner in which a decision was reached for the post of DUSU joint-secretary. </p>
<p>Initially,the university officials had said it will follow the election commission guidelines for breaking the tie. However,last-minute changes were made to the guidelines and the election office said that the Vice-Chancellor has used his emergency powers and decided that the term will be divided between the two candidates, Chahal said. </p>
<p>A draw of lot was held to decide who will hold the post first. The draw result should have held to decide who would hold the post for the whole term, Chahal said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1007896&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The allure of Indian B-schools,barring the top 25,is fading and the employability of management graduates is on a decline,says an expert.</p>
<p>Recruitment avenues for management graduates are on a decline,considering the fact that the economy is growing at the lowest pace in nine years,besides the financial sector is also witnessing sluggish growth rate.</p>
<p>Moreover there are serious questions being asked about the quality of some B-schools (barring the top 25) and their pass outs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number of management schools and engineering colleges in India is somewhere around 10,000 &#8211; 12,000 and there are serious questions about the employability of the graduates coming out of some of those institutions (barring the top 25),&#8221; IIT Delhi,Professor and Head (retd) Department of Management Studies,Rajat K Baisya said on the sidelines of an event organised by SkillTree.</p>
<p>In late nineties India&#8217;s management education sector saw a boom period as the number of business schools multiplied in no time. But this situation is starting to deflate as people are realising that expensive courses in these kind of schools would not guarantee them a well-paid job.</p>
<p>In the last five years however,the number of MBA seats in India has grown almost four fold ¿ from 94,704 in 2006-07 to 3,52,571 in 2011-12 resulting in a five-year compounded annual growth rate of 30 per cent,but their employability rates have fallen.</p>
<p>According to another expert who did not wish to be named new management colleges neither have proper infrastructure nor proper faculty and their quality of education is also not as per the requirements of the industry.</p>
<p>According to a recent MBAUniverse.com &#8211; MeriTrac employability study 2012,which covered 2,264 MBAs from 29 cities and 100 B-Schools,beyond the Top 25,only 21 per cent are employable.</p>
<p>The previous study of 2007 by MeriTrac had placed employability index at 25 per cent.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1007737&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>University of Mumbai is trying hard to change its mindset to meet new challenges in the rapidly expanding higher-education sector. The university is reaching out to alumni to get funds for some of its ambitious plans. All seems to be falling in place under Vice-Chancellor Rajan Welukar in the last almost two years. The veteran academician spoke to The Indian Express on a variety of issues,including the controversial removal of a book from the English graduate course under political pressure. Excerpts:</i></p>
<p>P VAIDYANATHAN IYER: Is there a disparity between the functioning of state and central universities? If yes,is this disparity in terms of financial resources? </p>
<p>RAJAN WELUKAR: Central universities were established by an Act of Parliament. All central universities are campus universities,they are not affiliating universities. Affiliating institutes are limited in number and are conducting colleges. Recently,a decision was taken by Government of India to establish 15 new central universities and the grants they have received are not less than Rs 400-w500 crore. In contrast,state universities have not got development grant,they only get salary grant. No development grant has come from the state government. If you really want development,communication has to be there. For example,we want to have a sub-campus of Mumbai University in Thane where the infrastructure cost alone is Rs 400 crore. Similarly,infrastructure cost of another planned school of engineering on Kalyan sub-campus is Rs 600 crore. You cannot compare central and state universities. </p>
<p>P VAIDYANATHAN IYER: Have you generated money for the sub-campuses? </p>
<p>RW: We are sending proposals to different agencies and trying to donations with the help of alumni. We are meeting people and trying to convince them that the Thane centre will be good for Thane city. Thane Municipal Corporation has given us land for the project. Further,we have received Rs 35 crore from an alumnus for a convention centre on our Kalina campus. When I joined University of Mumbai,I found that Mumbai does not have an international convention centre where conferences,seminars,talks and other mass enrollment events can be organised. We have already identified five-and-a-half acres on the Kalina campus. Through this project,we will earn money which can be used for development of the university. </p>
<p>MIHIKA BASU: An RTI query has  revealed MU has not been successful in attracting grants from industry/alumni like the IITs. Any specific plans in this regard? </p>
<p>RW: We have specific plans for Thane,Kalyan and Ratnagiri projects and we are going to industry and alumni with them. Mumbai University has received Rs 70 crore in the last two years from industry/alumni,which is the highest ever for the university. </p>
<p>SANDEEP SINGH: Is Mumbai University seeking funds from corporate houses? </p>
<p>RW: We are meeting a lot of corporates and making presentations. We are planning to invite people and explain them what we want to do in the university academically,with infrastructure and what resources we need. </p>
<p>DIPTI SONAWALA: Is there a skill gap? What is Mumbai University doing to address the mismatch between industry requirements and what is taught in classrooms? </p>
<p>RW: Yes ,there is a skill gap across the country. We are starting a soft-skill programme for teachers and students in remote and tribal areas. We started developing a module with Yashwantrao Chavan Academy of Development Administration (Yashada) last year through which we will train two-three teachers every year. The teachers,in turn,will impart skill-based training to students. We are also starting community colleges with Coca-Cola Limited. Forty colleges in rural and tribal areas will participate in this. Of these,four community colleges will be selected to be sponsored. They will get two years training and will be absorbed by Coca-Cola after that. We are also going to other companies for similar initiatives. We have been approached by some from the construction industry. To give students a chance for vertical mobility,we are offering a one-year degree programme. Further,we have a tie-up with Deakin University,Australia,through which training will be given to our Board of Studies members on curriculum design and ways to integrate skills. </p>
<p>DIPTI SONAWALA: Do you think students are opting for shortcuts when it comes to project work and outsourcing it? How can this issue be addressed? </p>
<p>RW: Yes,this is a problem and students are outsourcing project works. This shows a lack of sincerity and maturity. They fail to understand they may not get such opportunities while working and they will have to perform. I think the problem here to some extent is the teacher-student ratio. There are less number of teachers,so proper scrutiny is not done. </p>
<p>BHARAT SUNDARESAN: Do you think our country is ready for an open-book exam and questions based on case studies? </p>
<p>RW: The open-book system has more difficulties and it will also be difficult for teachers to set question papers. If your concepts are clear,you dont need to read a book. We will have to first bring about changes in our school education. There is no communication between school education and higher education. Hence,continuity is missing. </p>
<p>SUKANYA SHETTY: We dont have full-time,qualified teachers for professional courses. Instead,we have visiting faculty. Is there a quality check? </p>
<p>RW: In a huge system like ours,this becomes a difficult job. Nonetheless what we are trying to do is to attract young intellectual capital. The moment that happens,things will change. In the next academic year,we are starting a training institute. We are trying to bring in more practical component and creating open-education resources. We are starting with economics,maths and management. Content development is the most difficult part. </p>
<p>SAGNIK CHOWDHURY: How challenging is it to keep politics separate from academics in a place like Mumbai? For example,the episode of removing Rohinton Mistrys book Such a Long Journey from the syllabus after Yuva Senas protest? </p>
<p>RW: Politics has to be kept out of education,it has no role in academics. As far as removing the book from the syllabus is concerned,it was not because of any political party but because experts felt the book should be removed. The issue was misunderstood by people. </p>
<p>SWATEE KHER: What is your stand on the Lyngdoh committee report on elections in the university? </p>
<p>RW: I am of the opinion that the youth should be given an opportunity to participate in decision-making. They need to be empowered. While taking a decision,the government has to take into consideration all incidents that took place in the past due to elections and ensure such incidents do not occur again. I strongly believe politics should not come to the campus. When there are vested interests,malpractices start. </p>
<p>SWATEE KHER: Do you think providing autonomy to colleges will reduce MU burden to some extent? </p>
<p>RW: We should not think from the point of view of burden. Freedom will give colleges better exposure,which they cannot get otherwise. It should be given with a view to achieve improvement. Currently,seven colleges have autonomy and in three years,20 other colleges affiliated to MU may get autonomy. </p>
<p>P VAIDYANATHAN IYER: What explains the significant slip in MU global ranking? </p>
<p>RW: There is an ongoing debate across the world on the issue of ranking institutes. The parameters and factors on which universities and institutes are ranked should be uniform. The kind of intellectual capital Harvard University can get with its operative budget,I am sure even premier Indian institutes such as IIT Bombay cannot,and thus there is a vast difference. Since there is no uniformity in ranking parameters,people are debating whether institutes should be ranked at all. </p>
<p>MIHIKA BASU: MU has been grappling with paper leaks and rumours of paper leaks. Do you have a concrete plan to prevent such situations during the October exams? </p>
<p>RW: We are using technology in the process of conducting exams. We are sending question papers to exams centres through web-links and password-protected CDs. We dont know since when this is happening. Just that this time we caught people and everyone came to know of it. We are preparing question banks for all subjects and randomly,we will select one question paper from that. We are staring with professional programmes and will slowly move to conventional arts,commerce and science. </p>
<p>DIPTI SONAWALA: Citing workload,teachers have raised a hue and cry about the MU decision to have nine paper sets instead of three. Hows the university dealing with it? </p>
<p>RW: I dont see any workload increasing due to this method. According to me,it is exactly like the functions of brain. Brain does not accept change. Whenever you try to bring in changes in the system,this is bound to happen. But one has to remember change is mandatory and survival is optional. If they want to survive,they will have to accept the change. </p>
<p>AAKRITI VASUDEVA: The results of revaluation are mostly delayed,do you have any concrete plan to check delays? </p>
<p>RW: This year,we have declared most of the revaluation results on time and for next year,we have a plan. We will scan answer papers,so the moment a student applies for a photocopy of his/her answersheet,we can provide it to them in no time through email or other means. However,the process may take a year as it needs approval of various bodies. </p>
<p>DIPTI SONAWALA: There are almost 300 colleges where posts of principals are vacant or there are no full-time principals. What do you think is the problem? </p>
<p>RW: This is not just the problem of Mumbai University and its affiliated colleges,but institutes across the country. One thing I have observed is that many people do not want to take additional responsibilities for the same salary. The criteria of qualification too is a factor. Besides,many people do not want to go to rural areas. </p>
<p>SHARVARI PATWA: Does the university have a strong placement programme? </p>
<p>RW: The focus has to be on the subject of learning,not placements. </p>
<p>MANASI PHADKE: Are there chances of colleges misusing the internal evaluation introduced by the university? What is the university doing to check such malpractices? </p>
<p>RW: Not all colleges,but we have found cases where colleges have generously awarded marks to students. We identified such colleges and sent our representatives there. Now,we are looking at how we could deal with this issue. Internal assessment is in the interest of students and if something is in the interest of students,we have to do it. In doing so,we may face some problems,but we should find ways to resolve them. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1006902&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maker of low cost Aakash tablet,Datawind,today said it has started supplying the new version of the tablet to IIT Bombay and it is likely to be launched in October.</p>
<p>&#8220;Supplies are on to IIT Bombay. In the next few weeks,it should be launched. I do not have the exact date,but HRD Minister (Kapil Sibal) has said he wants to launch on the anniversary date which is October 5,&#8221; Datawind CEO Sunit Singh Tuli said.</p>
<p>The launch will depend on the Minister&#8217;s schedule,but it is not very far from now,he added.</p>
<p>Tuli said Datawind has started supplying the next version of the low cost tablet,Aakash 2,to IIT Bombay since the last one month and a half. However,he refused to disclose other details.</p>
<p>Sibal had earlier said that new version of Aakash tablet would have a better battery with a three-hour battery backup,a capacitive touch screen among other new features at the same price.</p>
<p>Datawind had won the tender for making and supplying Aakash tablets for price of around USD 49 per unit. Apart from this order,the company has also received orders for 55 lakh more from general customers.</p>
<p>Datawind CEO said the company has cleared most of the pre-paid bookings and will now start focusing on supplies for the non-paid bookings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of 55 lakh orders,4 to 5 per cent were pre-paid bookings. May be in a week or 10 days,all the pre-paid will be done. Then we will focus on pre-bookings. We are giving them offers to upgrade to Android 4.4 version,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Datawind is delivering around 1,500 to 2,000 tablets each day,being assembled within the country as well as outside,Tuli said.</p>
<p>He added that company is in talks with channel partners to sell products across country,but it will first focus on the pre-booking order that it has.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1006749&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bihar,Uttar Pradesh,West Bengal and six other states having literacy levels less than the national average will get enhanced Central share under the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan programme,with the Planning Commission approving a proposal to this effect.</p>
<p>These states will be getting funds in the ratio of 75:25 as against the existing ratio of 65:35.</p>
<p>Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand will also be included along with the northeastern states where funding is in the 90:10 ratio,HRD Ministry officials said.</p>
<p>The proposal has to be vetted by the National Development Council before coming into effect.</p>
<p>The average national literacy level as per the 2011 census stands at 74.04 per cent,whereas literacy level of Bihar is 63.8 per cent and Uttar Pradesh is 71.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Odisha has 65.9 per cent literacy,while Rajasthan has 67.1 per cent,Jharkhand has 67.6 per cent and Madhya Pradesh has 70.6 per cent literacy.</p>
<p>Several states,including Bihar and Uttar Pradesh,had in fact been clamouring for enhanced Centre&#8217;s share arguing that they are unable to pump their share of resources for the programme.</p>
<p>SSA is the government&#8217;s flagship programme for achievement of universalisation of elementary education in a time-bound manner,as mandated by the 86th Amendment to the Constitution,making free and compulsory education to children of 6-14 years age group a fundamental right.</p>
<p>The programme seeks to open new schools in those areas which do not have schooling facilities and strengthen existing infrastructure through provision of additional classrooms,toilets,drinking water,maintenance grant and school improvement grants.</p>
<p>Expenditure under the SSA increased to Rs 38,000 crore in 2011-12 from Rs 32,000 crore in 2010-11 and Rs 21,000 crore in 2009-10.</p>
<p>Since its introduction in 2000-01,nearly three lakh elementary schools have been opened under SSA and 20 lakh teachers&#8217; posts have been sanctioned.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1006685&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pointing to the absence of any Central Act or other statutory body to regulate the fee structure in CBSE schools,Madras High Court ruled that state government has the &#8220;bounden duty&#8221; to see the fee collected by these schools are commensurate with the facilities provided and see that they do not indulge in &#8220;profiteering&#8221; or charging capitation fees.</p>
<p>Disposing of a batch of petitions,a division bench,comprising Justices R Banumathi and R Subbiah,in a common order said,&#8221;there has to be a mechanism to check the private schools from charging exorbitant fees.&#8221;</p>
<p>A batch of petitions by schools across Tamil Nadu recognised under CBSE/ICSE regulations had challenged the applicability of Tamil Nadu Schools (Regulation of Collection of Fee) Act,2009  (Tamil Nadu Schools Fee Act,2009) to CBSE/ICSE Schools and the fee determined by School Fee Determination Committee on the ground that it is vitiated by arbitrariness.</p>
<p>The court also held that CBSE schools and ICSE schools are &#8220;private schools&#8221; within the meaning of Section 2 (j) of Tamil Nadu Schools (Regulation of Collection of Fee) Act,2009 and the provisions of  the same are applicable to both categories.</p>
<p>Holding that the ultimate object of the T N Schools Fee Act,2009 was to regulate the collection of fee by schools in Tamil Nadu,it said,&#8221;Excluding the CBSE Schools and ICSE Schools from the ambit of the Act would defeat the object of the Act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under Section 7 of the said Act,the Committee has the power to determine the fee and verify whether the fee collected by CBSE schools was commensurate with the facilities provided,the bench said. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1006352&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The two candidates who tied for the post of joint secretary during the recently concluded DUSU elections will hold the office for half term each,Delhi University announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>NSUI candidate Raveena Choudhary and ABVP nominee Vishu Basoya tied for the joint secretary post with 13,164 votes each.</p>
<p>DU had announced a draw of lot to decide on the candidate. A notice issued by Chief Election Officer for DUSU polls Prof. C S Dubey said the guidelines set by Election Commission of India for tied seats will be followed  the result will have to be declared by a draw of lot.</p>
<p>The university said Basoya will be holding the post from September 20 to March 5,Choudhary will be DUSU joint secretary from March 5 to August 15.</p>
<p>This give each candidate a term of five and a half months.</p>
<p>ABVP did not agree with the decision to divide the term and claimed that the university had not adhered to the rules. </p>
<p>The draw of lot was meant for deciding who will hold the post. But changes were made last-minute,and the term was divided. It was stated that the draw will decide who will take charge first. We will get an order from the court on this issue, ABVP State Secretary Rohit Chahal said.</p>
<p>While both candidates were asked to be present for the draw of lot,Basoya could not turn up because of his health condition. He was injured allegedly in police lathicharge after ABVP members protest against the DUSU polls results on September 15.</p>
<p>The top three posts of the union were won by NSUI.</p>
<p>Basoya wrote the Chief Election Officer that he came to know about the draw of lot while he was in the hospital. He also referred to the demands put forth by ABVP. </p>
<p>On Monday,ABVPs presidential candidate Ankit Dhananjay Choudhary had submitted a memorandum to university V-C,demanding fresh election and another inquiry into the lathicharge.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1005688&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been a four per cent increase in the number of candidates appearing for the Common Admission Test this year as compared to last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CAT 2012 registration window ended at midnight on September 19 with 2.14 lakh registered CAT aspirants,exceeding last year&#8217;s registrations of 2.05 lakh,&#8221; said a statement issued by Prometric,partnering IIMs in conducting the test.</p>
<p>It said that female candidates constitute 28 per cent of registrations,as compared to 27 per cent last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Registration numbers have increased over last year,which is a positive indication that PG management programmes at IIMs and other B-schools that accept CAT scores,still offer an attractive future to many aspirants,&#8221; said CAT 2012 convenor S S Kumar.</p>
<p>And similar to previous trends,the cities in which the highest numbers of candidates have chosen to sit for the test are New Delhi,Bangalore,Mumbai,Hyderabad and Pune.</p>
<p>CAT 2012 will be held between October 11 and November 6.</p>
<p>It will have two sections &#8212; the first will focus on quantitative ability and data interpretation and the second on verbal ability and logical reasoning.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1005533&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ekal Vidyalays or one-teacher schools,a novel cost-effective education support system,has come to the aid of nearly 11 lakh students across the country. </p>
<p>The schools,set up by Friends of Tribals&#8217; Society (FTS),primarily aims to eradicate illiteracy in rural areas,particularly among tribals,and facilitate access to primary health,child care and gainful self-employment for economic and social empowerment.</p>
<p>There are 38,120 such schools across 23 states with 10,76,691 students having benefited from their various educational programmes,FTS National Convenor Sajjan Bhajanka said.</p>
<p>Bhajanka said Ekal Vidyalays function at villages either under tree shades or in open spaces or in man-made structures. </p>
<p>The schools run a four-pronged programme to make the tribals healthy,strong and gainfully employed. The programmes are: primary education,health care education,development education and empowerment education.</p>
<p>A tribal youth from the village or a neighbouring village is engaged to function as the &#8216;Acharya&#8217; or teacher of the school.</p>
<p>&#8220;The teacher is also provided with necessary teaching aids to run the school for three hours a day at a time convenient to the students,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>A student has to spend three years in such a school the syllabus of which comprises seven subjects. After completing the three-year stint,a child will get admission to Class three or four of a formal primary school.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teachers are motivated during training to guide the students to develop awareness about personal hygiene,health care,village sanitation and to free them from vices like alcohol consumption,&#8221; Bhajanka said. </p>
<p>Bhajanka said that besides education,Ekal Vidyalays disseminate information about health hazards and preventive measures through community participation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The emphasis is on hygiene,sanitation,nutrition,first aid,maternal and child care and information on common diseases prevailing in the local area,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Acharyas are also given medicines to be distributed among children and their parents. </p>
<p>The teachers also provide information on various income-generating programmes to make the villages self-reliant by utilising the local resources for small projects like</p>
<p>vermiculture,tree-plantation,vegetable plantation,water management and animal husbandry. </p>
<p>The schools also educate villagers about various government schemes meant for their benefit,particularly the modalities of using the Right to Information Act.</p>
<p>The medium of instruction is usually in the local dialect.</p>
<p>Bhajanka claimed that over the years programmes initiated by Ekal Vidyalays had shown a positive impact by instilling Indian values among the young,eradication of drinking habits,mutual cooperation,greater interest in education,greater awareness about hygiene and cleanliness and striving for self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>In the Northeast,Ekal Vidyalays have their presence in about 3,060 villages,convenor of FTS&#8217;s Guwahati chapter Pawan Kumar Agarwal said.</p>
<p>He said that recently 90 schools had started operating in Majuli,the world&#8217;s largest river island,and by 2015 more than seven thousand Ekal Vidyalays were likely to be opened by FTS. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1004827&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Students of Chennai-based private SRM University have bagged third position at an international design competition in the field of aviation and space tourism held in the US.</p>
<p>A team of eight undergraduate students from the Department of Aerospace Engineering won a cash prize of USD 1,000 in the Undergraduate Team Space Transportation Design Competition 2011-12 organised by American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) recently,university officials said.</p>
<p>The space vehicle named &#8216;NAVSHITIZ VAHAK  the carrier of new horizon&#8217; has been designed to orbit at a distance of around 370 km from the Earth.</p>
<p>The design conceptualised by the students reduces cost of launch and cost of space tourism considerably,SRM University Vice-Chancellor M Ponnavaikko told reporters. </p>
<p>The eight-member team comprised Sweety Prakash Pate,Anku Aravind,Jeevraj Hejmady,Joel Alex Roy,Rishabh Bana,Rajdeep Chowdhuri,Ravi Shakya and Sarnavi Mahesh. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of 22 students of BA Programme in Lakshmibai College,who have failed to clear one paper in their third-year examination,has accused the institute and Delhi University of not willing to re-check their answerscripts or even listen to their case. </p>
<p>Shruti Gupta,one of the students,said she got an essential repeat  in other words,failed  in the Business Data Processing theory paper despite getting good marks in the practical examination. </p>
<p>She and the others from her batch have asked the authorities to allow re-checking of their papers,but they were allegedly told that the mandatory period for seeking re-evaluation was over. </p>
<p>Students alleged that an hour was wasted during the exam on May 7 after they were given a wrong question paper. The correct paper was provided an hour later,they said. </p>
<p>Initially,we were given a paper on financial accounting with the code C111. The code should have been C211. After an hour when the correct question paper was given to us,we found two questions being set from topics that were not part of our syllabus. We spoke to the teachers and the principal,but nothing was done, Gupta said. </p>
<p>She claimed to have secured highest marks in the paper in her previous exams,but failed in the third year. This has become a big hurdle for me as I was planning to take admission in BEd in Kurukshetra University, she said.</p>
<p>Officials at the universitys Examination Branch said not all students have failed. They have the right to apply for re-evaluation. If they have already done so,their papers will be corrected by other teachers. If they secure more marks after the re-check,these will be put on their marksheets, an official said.</p>
<p>But the students said they had gone to the vice-chancellors office on August 21,but no action has been taken until now. </p>
<p>Anil Kumar Sharma,father of Kanika Sharma,said: When I asked the d,I was told to go to the Dean of Examination Branch. There,officials told me that nothing can be done because the timeframe for re-evaluation of papers was over. </p>
<p>Though she failed in the final-year of her graduation,Kanika has managed to get a provisional seat for an MBA degree in a college that she doesnt want to name.</p>
<p>The fees for her MBA course is around Rs 2.5 lakh. Despite financial constraints,she was able to take admission. But she must submit her original documents within six months. Or else,her admission will be cancelled, her father said. </p>
<p>She got first division in the first and second-year exams of her graduation. However,the third-year result in one paper will affect her career, he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1004031&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishads strike,alleging foulplay in the recent Delhi University Students Union polls where its rival NSUI emerged victorious,didnt affect classes in most colleges on Monday.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1004029&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishads (ABVP) strike,alleging foulplay in the recent Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) polls where its rival NSUI emerged victorious,didnt affect classes in most colleges on Monday.</p>
<p>Rupak Kumar,a final-year student of Political Science (Honours) in Kirori Mal College,said there was no disruption,except for a short period in the morning. Around 10 am some students entered our class and asked us to leave the college. They were shouting slogans against the vice-chancellor and DU administration. Classes resumed once they left, he said.</p>
<p>Pooja,a BCom (Honours) student of Kirori Mal,said: We were in class when these students came. But our teacher locked the door and the classes continued. </p>
<p>Security was tight in all the colleges affiliated to DU. The stretch from Chhatra Marg to Kranti Chowk near Ramjas College was kept out of bounds for vehicles for over an hour as precautionary measure to prevent protesters from creating trouble,police said.</p>
<p>DCP (North) S Pillai said: Around 200 personnel,including policewomen,were deployed on the campus. The Chhatra Marg stretch was closed following information that some protesters might try to take the road to enforce the bandh. </p>
<p>She said the strike ended peacefully. There was no report of untoward incident from any college, the officer said.</p>
<p>The ABVP called the strike alleging that the poll results,declared on Saturday,were rigged to favour the NSUI,which won the top three DUSU posts. The ABVP members had hurled stones at the DUSU office,tried to jump barricades and enter the counting centre,forcing police to charged them with lathis. </p>
<p>The ABVP on Monday pasted posters against DUs chief election officer.</p>
<p>Prof C S Dubey said: I am hurt to see the sentiments of some of these students. Instead of engaging in vendetta,they should concentrate on their career and studies. </p>
<p>Some protesters closed Central Library at Arts Faculty for a few hours during the strike. Many students were displeased with this. Parveen,a student of Khalsa College,said: I had urgent work at the library,but police did not allow me in because ABVP activists were holding a dharna outside the gate. When the gate was opened,the protesters closed the library. My whole day was wasted.</p>
<p>The ABVPs presidential candidate Ankit Dhananjay Choudhary,who lost to the NSUI,submitted a memorandum to the vice-chancellor to hold fresh DUSU elections.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1004029&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Protesting students of M Phil,who have been sitting on &#8216;dharna&#8217; for last ten days seeking exemption from admission test for different PhD courses at Aligarh Muslim University,have threatened to intensify their stir from tomorrow.</p>
<p>In view of the continuing standoff between the protesters and the University authorities,security arrangements at the campus have been tightened.</p>
<p>Vice-president Mohammad Hamid Ansari is scheduled to visit the AMU campus on September 24 and the district and University administration are trying to ensure that no untoward happening takes place at the campus.</p>
<p>Spokesman of the protesting students,Afaq Ahmad,today told newspersons that he would be starting an &#8220;indefinite hunger strike&#8221; against the alleged &#8220;irregularities and the high handed behavior of the University authorities&#8221;.</p>
<p>Afaq showed copies of earlier orders issued by the university,exempting M Phil students from appearing in admission tests in different doctoral courses.</p>
<p>He claimed,&#8221;all Central Universities have provided exemption to M Phil students in view of the fact that they have already gone through the process of appearing in an admission test while seeking admission to the course&#8221;.</p>
<p>The protesters said they have also written a letter to the President of India,who is also the Visitor of the University,claiming,&#8221;by depriving AMU students of securing admission in the doctoral courses by applying certain eligibility criteria,the University authorities were providing a deterrent for higher education.&#8221;</p>
<p>However,a spokesman of the AMU,while indirectly admitting that the University had earlier exempted students from appearing in the admission tests for doctoral courses,asserted,that the earlier exemption was &#8220;incorrect&#8221;.</p>
<p>The spokesman said this earlier exemption was in &#8220;violation of the University ordinances and once this matter came to light,we had to reverse our earlier decision&#8221;.</p>
<p>It was wrong to allege that the University was trying to discourage these admission seekers and with this objective &#8220;the University had yesterday issued a notification asking students to appear in a special PhD admission test to be conducted in October,&#8221; the University spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said this step would enable the students to pursue their academic careers &#8220;without any loss in their academic calendar&#8221;.</p>
<p>He said &#8220;the University cannot exempt any student from appearing in the PhD admission test because of the legal ramifications&#8221; following recent decision of the Allahabad High Court in a case pertaining to a similar matter.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1003861&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tension prevailed on the Osmania University (OU) campus on Monday after students clashed with police which lobbed teargas shells on protesters indulging in heavy stone-pelting.</p>
<p>Trouble started after scores of students under the aegis of Telangana Vidhyarthi Parishad tried to take out a procession from the OU campus to the state Assembly,demanding the state government declare September 17 as &#8216;Telangana Liberation Day&#8217;.</p>
<p>They wanted to commemorate the region&#8217;s freedom from the erstwhile Nizam rule.</p>
<p>Despite repeatedly being told that there was no permission for their rally,protesters argued with police and hurled stones at them near the NCC gate on the OU campus,a senior police officer said.</p>
<p>The students resorted to heavy stone pelting on police personnel after they were prevented from taking out a rally towards the Assembly, DCP(East Zone) Y Gangadhar said.</p>
<p>We clearly told them there is no permission for their rally in view of the ongoing monsoon session of the Assembly. The stone pelting is continuing and forces fired teargas shells to disperse the protesters, he said.</p>
<p>Police also took some students in preventive custody. </p>
<p>Angered over this,another group of students indulged in stone pelting,demanding immediate release of their colleagues.</p>
<p>The five-day monsoon session of Andhra Pradesh Legislature commenced here today even as the Hyderabad Police issued prohibitory orders around the AP Legislative Assembly/Council building for six days.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1003765&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[There will be no classes in Chicago public schools on Monday and Tuesday,affecting 350,000 students.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1003761&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The confrontation between Chicago teachers and Mayor Rahm Emanuel escalated on Sunday when their union extended a strike and the mayor said he would go to court to block the walkout,risking more friction within President Barack Obama&#8217;s political coalition as the Nov. 6 election nears.  </p>
<p>There will be no classes  in Chicago public schools on Monday and Tuesday,affecting 350,000 kindergarten,elementary and high school students.  </p>
<p>The showdown left in doubt a deal on wages,benefits and education reforms for 29,000 unionized teachers that negotiators thought they had struck on Friday to end the biggest labor dispute in the United States in a year.  </p>
<p>It also could widen a rift within the Democratic Party between education reformers such as Obama&#8217;s former top White House aide Emanuel,and organized labor,which the Democrats need to get out the vote in the election.  </p>
<p>Chicago union President Karen Lewis said some 800 union delegates met on Sunday and decided to consult with rank-and-file members before voting whether to end the walkout.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no trust (of the school district and mayor),Lewis said. So you have a population of people who are frightened of never being able to work for no fault of their own. Union delegates will reconvene on Tuesday to discuss the feedback from rank-and-file members,Lewis said. Parents should plan for their children to be out of school until at least Wednesday,she said. </p>
<p>No formal vote was taken during the meeting,but delegates were asked to stand up so that the leadership could get a sense of those for and against ending the strike,delegates said.  </p>
<p>A clear majority wanted to stay out. That&#8217;s why we are staying out,Lewis told a news conference after a three-hour meeting of the delegates.  </p>
<p>MAYOR CALLS STRIKE ILLEGAL  </p>
<p>Emanuel called the strike illegal and said he would go to court to seek an injunction to block the labor action.  </p>
<p>I will not stand by while the children of Chicago are played as pawns in an internal dispute within a union,Emanuel said,adding that the union walked out over issues that are not subject to a strike under Illinois state law.  </p>
<p>Emanuel&#8217;s gambit takes the dispute into uncharted territory. No injunction request has been filed in an Illinois educational labor dispute since 1984,when the state gave Chicago teachers the right to strike.  </p>
<p>Teachers revolted last week against sweeping education reforms sought by Emanuel,especially evaluating teachers based on the standardized test scores of their students.  They also fear a wave of neighborhood school closings that could result in mass teacher  layoffs. They want a guarantee that laid-off teachers will be recalled for other jobs in the district.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re still not happy with the evaluations. They&#8217;re not happy with the recall (provision),Lewis said of delegates. Before the meeting of delegates on Sunday,Lewis had called the agreement a good contract. But after the decision to extend the strike,she backtracked,saying: This is not a good deal. This is the deal we got. </p>
<p>Emanuel&#8217;s chief negotiator,School Board President David Vitale,said the union should allow children to go back to school while the two sides complete the process.  </p>
<p>We are  extremely disappointed that after 10 months of discussion reaching an honest and fair compromise that (the union) decided to continue their strike of choice and keep our children out of the classroom,Vitale said. </p>
<p>During the first week of the strike,opinion polls showed parents and Chicago voters backing the union,with some parents and students joining boisterous rallies. A key  question is whether the public&#8217;s support will waver as the strike drags on.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m very fed up and I&#8217;m very upset,said Crystal Blakeley,a single parent of a daughter in  second grade on the South Side of Chicago. Blakeley said she was paying for child care during the strike.</p>
<p>Candace Johnson,a barista at Starbucks,said she had been taking her 8-year-old son to the library on Chicago&#8217;s North Side. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to be as patient as possible,but the longer it takes,I don&#8217;t know what else I&#8217;m going to do with my child,she said after the strike was extended. </p>
<p>Former Chicago City Council member Dick Simpson said Emanuel may have made a mistake by going to court to block the strike. </p>
<p>If I were advising the mayor,I would have advised him to be patient for a couple of days,said Simpson,a political science professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. By waiting,Emanuel could have put the onus on the teachers if they rejected the contract later this week,Simpson said. </p>
<p>Both sides appeared to win some concessions,according to details of the tentative agreement released by the parties. </p>
<p>Emanuel compromised on the design of the first update of the evaluation system for Chicago teachers in 40 years. He agreed to phase in the new plan over several years and reduced the weighting of standardized test results in reviewing teachers. </p>
<p>Teachers won some job-security protections and prevented the introduction of merit pay in their contract.  </p>
<p>NATIONAL DEBATE</p>
<p>The Chicago strike has shone a bright light on a fierce national debate over how to reform failing inner-city schools. The union believes that more money and resources should be given to neighborhood public schools to help them improve. </p>
<p>Emanuel and a legion of financiers and philanthropists believe that failing schools should be closed and reopened with new staff to give the students the best chance of improving. </p>
<p>The agreement calls for a 3 percent pay raise for teachers this year and 2 percent in each of the next two years. If the agreement is extended for an optional fourth year,teachers get a 3 percent increase. The deal would result in an average 17.6 percent increase over four years,the district said. Chicago union teachers make an average of about $76,000 annually. </p>
<p>The deal could exacerbate the Chicago Public Schools financial crisis. Emanuel said the contract will cost $295 million over four years,or $74 million per year. </p>
<p>Debt rating agencies had previously warned that the new agreement with teachers could bust the school district budget and lead to a downgrade of its credit rating.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1003761&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[A study by the primary education department of Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) has revealed that a majority of students in the district carries a heavier bag to school than the prescribed norm.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1003552&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A study by the primary education department of Pune Zilla Parishad (ZP) has revealed that a majority of students in the district carries a heavier bag to school than the prescribed norm. </p>
<p>School bags of 232 students from 80 public and private schools in the district were weighed as part of the study undertaken by the research and evaluation department of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan being implemented through ZP. The schools represented urban,semi-urban,rural and tribal areas of the district. </p>
<p>The study showed that an alarming number of students as young as those in Class I carry bags as heavy as 5 kg and above. </p>
<p>As per the Childrens School Bag Act,2006,a school bag should not weigh more than 10 per cent of childs weight. </p>
<p>Pandurang Memane,extension officer,primary education department who carried out the project,said the average weight of the school bag increases as students move to higher grades. Carrying heavy school bags has an adverse impact on the health of students. These kids tote heavy bags twice a day. The problem is worse in rural areas where they have to walk a long distance to school. Many complain of back pain. They also face the risk of serious back deformities, he said. </p>
<p>According to the study,school bags in rural areas were heavier than those in urban and semi-urban parts of the district. </p>
<p>Students bring many books and other things that are non-essential. For instance,students in Class I need not bring a compass box and multiple notebooks but we found that a majority of them was bringing six to eight notebooks,all the syllabus books,compass boxes,workbooks,pads and water bottle. We even found broken toys in many school bags, said Memane. </p>
<p>The school bag of a girl studying in Class V contained 18 notebooks and all the seven syllabus books. Her bag weighed 7.2 kg  almost 25-30 per cent of her weight, said Memane. </p>
<p>As per a 2006 state government GR,Class I and II students should only be allowed to bring language and mathematics books and a 100-page notebook. For class work,they should use a slate. Students shoud not bring compass boxes,workbooks and digests,etc. </p>
<p>Students in Classes III to V should be allowed to bring books of other subjects and a few workbooks as needed. Compass box should only be allowed on days when its needed. </p>
<p>Students of Classes VI and VII should be allowed to bring books and notebooks as per the days schedule. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1003552&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court has said the government and private educational institutions should provide qualitative education to children and the eligibility criteria for appointment of teachers must be strictly adhered to.</p>
<p>A bench of justices B S Chauhan and F M Ibrahim Kalifulla said that life of democracy depends on a high standard of education which must be maintained at all costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a well-accepted fact that democracy cannot be flawless but we can strive to minimise these flaws with proper education. Democracy depends for its very life on a high standard of general,vocational and professional education. Dissemination of learning with search for new knowledge with discipline all round must be maintained at all costs,&#8221; the bench said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Education and particularly that of elementary/basic education has to be qualitative and for that the trained teachers are required. The Legislature in its wisdom after consultation with the expert body fixes the eligibility for a particular discipline taught in a school. Thus,the eligibility so fixed require very strict compliance and any</p>
<p>appointment made in contravention thereof must be held to be void,&#8221; the bench said.</p>
<p>The court passed the observation while adjudication a case pertaining to termination of job of a teacher who was not having requisite qualification.</p>
<p>&#8220;Provision of free and compulsory education of satisfactory quality to children from disadvantaged and weaker sections is,therefore,not merely the responsibility of</p>
<p>schools run or supported by the appropriate governments,butalso of schools which are not dependent on government funds,&#8221; the court said. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1003310&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The building of the institute in Talab Tillo area is dilapidated and could collapse at any time,which puts the safety of the students and staff at risk,SRS state president,Rajiv Mahajan,told reporters here. </p>
<p>&#8220;We express great anguish against the administration of Jammu University for not providing accommodation to the students and staff of Institute of Music and Fine Arts in New University Campus here and threaten to launch an agitation if the institute is not shifted immediately,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Jammu University administration had already made a proposal as per which the next session of the institute was to be held in the premises of the New University Campus,but nothing has been done about it,he claimed.</p>
<p>The SRS has taken up the issue time and again,Mahajan said,adding that he met then Vice Chancellor Varun Sawhney last year,who assured shifting of the institute within a short period. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1003069&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Delhi University is all set for the students union polls on Friday. Du officials said all arrangements were in place to ensure smooth polling. </p>
<p>Chief Election Officer Prof C S Dubey said the university officials on Wednesday had a meeting with police to step up security on polling day. We met the DCP and the Joint Commissioner of Police. We have also alerted all colleges to allow entry of students only on the basis of their identity cards. Moreover,CCTV cameras have been installed at various points on the campus and the footage is being monitored closely. Rapid Action Force personnel will also be deployed on the campus on voting day, Dubey said. </p>
<p>DCP (North) Sindhu Pillai said arrangements are being made to ensure that the electronic voting machines (EVMs) are not tampered with. Apart from providing mobile patrolling and emergency response vehicles,we will also provide escorts for EVMs from the polling centres to the venue where the counting will take place. Police personnel will accompany the university staff to ensure that no unauthorised person enters the polling centre, she said. </p>
<p>As many as 984 EVMs are going to be used in about 50 polling centres, returning officer Satish Kumar said. </p>
<p>Voting in morning colleges will be between 8.30 am and 12.30 pm. Voting will be held between 3 pm and 7 pm in evening colleges. Counting of votes will start at 8 am on Saturday. Traffic on Chatra Marg till Kranti Chowk will be closed till 2.30 pm on that day. </p>
<p>Voting will take place for the posts of the president,vice-president,secretary and joint-secretary of the DUSU.  Polls for electing representatives to the University Central Council will also be held at different colleges. </p>
<p>Colleges have also been asked to provide adequate facilities for students with disabilities. We have told college principals to ensure that polling booths are on the ground floor. They have also been asked to appoint volunteers from NCC and NSS to assist students. These students will not have to stand in queues, Bipin Kumar Tiwary,the officer on special duty at the Equal Opportunity Cell,said. </p>
<p>Last years DUSU polls saw the use of Braille stickers on EVMs so that visually impaired students could vote without assistance.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1002271&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Among cheers and slogans from students,presidential candidates for the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU) elections took to the stage on Wednesday evening to woo voters a last time before the code of conduct comes into force. </p>
<p>The issue of new students sleeping in dormitories and the living conditions on campus came up for debate yet again as most organisations questioned the the relevance of an interim union.</p>
<p>All India Student Association (AISA) candidate Om Prasad spoke about the achievements of the incumbent AISA-led union. In a first of its kind,gender sensitisation classes were held on the campus to create awareness against sexual harassment. The move was initiated by us, he said.</p>
<p>Om Prasad also spoke about the unions efforts in getting a written agreement from the administration about increasing merit-cum-means scholarships.</p>
<p>Student Federation of Indias (SFI) presidential candidate Kopal Singh countered AISAs claim and said the union did not do anything to address basic issues such as shortage of water on the campus. There is a need to harvest water on campus and make better use of the tree cover, she said.</p>
<p>Kopal Singh also spoke about the need to have a student member on the panel conducting viva-voce examinations for admissions   as was the practice till 1983  to ensure that no discrimination is possible. </p>
<p>Vinay Kumar from the All India Backward Students Forum (AIBSF) questioned the unions inability to implement the 27 per cent reservation for other backward classes in its entirety.</p>
<p>Candidate Khalid Khan from a lesser-known organisation,Campus Front of India (CFI),spoke on the need for organisations to address students issues that have been pending for more than five years. Organisations raise issues on occasions like these (the presidential debate) but do nothing to solve them, he said.</p>
<p>But the speaker who drew the maximum cheer from students was Independent candidate Abhay Kumar of the School of Social Sciences. He criticised AISA for not working for student issues on campus even though they have had been retaining four central panel seats since 2007.</p>
<p>National Students Union of Indias  Iqbal Singh urged students to reject the Left politics on campus and consider a secular democratic alternative. The organisation has been pressing for making the campus WiFi and for a placement cell for students.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1002262&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The admissions to engineering courses in Maharashtra would take place through the national-level Joint Entrance Examination from the academic year 2014-15.</p>
<p>The state cabinet today decided that Maharashtra would be a part of the new admission regime.</p>
<p>The standard 12th curriculum will be upgraded next year to bring it up to the standard of JEE,the cabinet decided at the meeting chaired by Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan.</p>
<p>For the admission purpose,scores of both the entrance exam and the std 12th exam would be considered on 50:50 basis.</p>
<p>JEE will have two parts &#8211; main and advance. Admission to engineering courses in the state-affiliated colleges will be on the basis of marks obtained only in the main part,the official statement said here.</p>
<p>While deciding the weightage of the std 12th exam score,only the marks in Physics-Chemistry- Mathematics (PCM) will be considered,though the student must have secured 50 per cent marks in aggregate.</p>
<p>State officials said the advantage of becoming a part of JEE admission system was that students would have to take only one entrance exam,which would suffice for IITs too. This would particularly help the students from rural areas,officials added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1001706&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The government has no intention to accreditate universities or institutes and the job would be done by professional bodies,HRD minister Kapil Sibal said here today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government has nothing to do with accreditation of universities and institutes for which a National Accreditation Authority Bill was tabled in Parliament,&#8221; Sibal told an interaction organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce here.</p>
<p>Sibal said although he had brought the legislation in the monsoon session,it was not passed in Parliament.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stakeholders do not share the vision. If political parties do not allow the Parliament to function,then how legislations will be passed ?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>He said that the gross enrolment ratio had increased from 12.4 per cent to 20 per cent at present.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to meet the target gross enrolment ratio of 30 per cent by 2020,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Calling for reforms in school and higher education,he said that there was need to change the examination pattern and also to change the way how a child learns.</p>
<p>The minister also warned private institutes duping students by adopting malpractices.</p>
<p>He said that the national knowledge network built at a cost of Rs 20,000 crore through the fibre optic network would connect all gram panchayats in 36 months. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1001611&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>As per the committee,poll grievances to be addressed in 24 hours but varsity takes three days</i></p>
<p>While the Panjab University authorities have been threatening to take action against the student bodies in case of violation of the Lyngdoh committee guidelines,they have not been following the rules themselves.</p>
<p>According to the Lyngdoh committee guidelines regarding the grievance redressal mechanism of the student elections,students can file complaints regarding the election procedure. Also,they have to be intimated in writing,within 24 hours of filing the complaint,whether it is dismissed or a hearing is called for the same. </p>
<p>However,Smriti Brar,who had filed a complaint on Saturday,requesting recounting of votes for the post of vice-president,did not receive any intimation regarding it till late on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Clause 6.8.4 of the Lygdoh report reads,Any student may file a complaint,with the grievance cell,within a period of three weeks from the date of declaration of results&#8230;The grievance cell shall act on all complaints within 24 hours after they are received by either dismissing them or calling a hearing. The report also mentions that if a complaint is not dismissed,then a hearing must be held. The grievance cell shall inform,in writing,or via e-mail,the complaining party and individuals or groups named in the complaint,of the time and place of hearing.</p>
<p>The complaint regarding re-counting of votes for the position of the vice-president was dismissed by the grievance committee at a meeting held on Tuesday,three days after it was filed. </p>
<p>All students were also not allowed in the meeting,though Clause 6.8.9 of the report says all grievance cell hearings,proceedings and meetings must be open to the public.</p>
<p>However,PUSU members alleged that two students,who wanted to hear the proceedings of the party,were not allowed to do so. The Dean Students Welfare,A S Ahluwalia,said,We cannot allow anybody to attend the meeting as their presence is not required there. Moreover,nothing is being done secretly and information about the decision of the meeting is given to everyone. The university re-opened today after the election so the committee could hold a meeting. </p>
<p>In October 2006,the Supreme Court had directed the immediate implementation of the recommendations of the Lyngdoh committee to frame guidelines on students elections in colleges and universities. It was implemented in most universities across the country,including Panjab University,for the elections in 2007.</p>
<p>DSW gives the go-ahead for DJ night after initial hiccups</p>
<p>While the PUSU has repeatedly been alleging that the PU authorities are helping the SOPU in winning the elections,the SOPU also seemed distressed by the attitude of the authorities. Senior leaders of SOPU went to the Vice-chancellor on Tuesday,seeking permission for holding a customary DJ night at the girls hostel. However,the V-C refused to give permission,stating that it would add to election expenditure and was not allowed as per guidelines by the Chandigarh police. The DSW,who was attending the election-related grievance cell meeting,was also called immediately to settle the matter.</p>
<p>SOPU leader Manoj Lubana said,The DJ night has been held every year after the elections and should be allowed this year as well. The authorities cant implement Lyngdoh guidelines throughout the year; they are applicable only during the elections.</p>
<p>Later in the evening,the DSW gave permission for the DJ night after listing out disciplinary measures to be followed during the party.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1001437&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With just a couple more days left for the Delhi University Students Union polls,canvassing by various students organisations is gathering momentum. </p>
<p>Most students organisations have divided themselves into groups of four to cover as many colleges as possible. While some parties organised street plays to create awareness about students issues,others roamed the campus,shouting names of their candidates and handing out pamphlets. </p>
<p>While such campaigning has caused some excitement among sections of the student community,most students did not seem too pleased. </p>
<p>Third-year students at Ramjas College felt that elections were a farce. Dhruv Munjan,who is pursuing BCom (H) from the college,said: The candidates do not have a clear agenda,but they are backed by powerful lobbies. We found the elections amusing in the first year,but soon realised it was a farce. </p>
<p>Voicing similar sentiments,Aayush Taiyal,another student of Ramjas,said: There is so much wasteful expenditure during elections with the printing of cards,pamphlets and posters. </p>
<p>Shivali Verma,a first-year student of English (H) at Hansraj College,said: The DUSU candidates came to our classes just once or twice and some have not even bothered to state what they would be working for. </p>
<p>Meanwhile,All India Students Association released their manifesto on Tuesday,asking students to vote for a radical change. </p>
<p>Condemning the money-muscle-caste based politics of other parties,AISAs presidential candidate Nikita Sinha said: Our aim is that the DUSU elections should be fought on students issues. Most parties make several promises before the elections,but,once they come to power,these are rarely fulfilled. </p>
<p>One of the demands of AISA ,which was also featured on the ABVP manifesto,was  that there should be a presidential debate. This demand was echoed by students too. There is a lot of difference in the manner in which elections are conducted in DU and JNU. Having a presidential debate in DU like the one in JNU will help students become informed voters, Dhruv said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1001258&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Guidelines for DUSU polls state that defacement of property will be punished with disqualification,criminal proceedings.</i></p>
<p>Candidates of Delhi University Students Union (DUSU) polls are supposed to follow several regulations during canvassing  the Lyngdoh Committee guidelines,the code of conduct as well as the Delhi Prevention of Defacement of Property Act. But instances of violation of rules abound these elections. </p>
<p>According to the Lyngdoh Committee directives,a candidate cannot spend more than Rs 5,000 on the election. They are also not allowed to use printed material for canvassing. </p>
<p>The Defacement of Property Act,stipulates that  whoever defaces any property in public view by writing or marking with ink,chalk,paint or any other material,except for purposes of indicating the name of the property owner,shall be punished. </p>
<p>A notice issued by the office of the chief election officer,DUSU polls,says any violation of these rules are liable to disqualification and criminal punishment. </p>
<p>Showcause notices over the use of printed material were issued by the election office on Monday to four candidates of ABVP and NSUI. </p>
<p>On Tuesday,too,three more candidates   two from the Nationalist Student Congress and one from Dr Ambedkar Missionaries Vidyarthi Association  were issued showcause notices for violation of rules. </p>
<p>The notice has asked these students to reply within 24 hours,failing which suitable action shall be initiated. </p>
<p>Complaints regarding the defacement of property,however,have not been received by the election office till now. </p>
<p>Chief election officer Dr C S Dubey said,We received complaints against NSUI and ABVP regarding printed pamphlets being distributed by them. However,no one has come to us regarding defacement of property. The university was approached by an NGO a few weeks ago regarding this. Following this,we realised that people did not know about the Defacement of Property Act and we put up the Act on the university website.</p>
<p>NSUI spokesperson Amrishpandey Ranjan said, This is an attempt by other parties to bring down our candidates who are strong contenders for the various DUSU posts. The printed material could have been produced by anyone in the name of our candidates. We are going to reply to the letter after taking into consideration the technical details of the clause. </p>
<p>Rohit Chahal,the state secretary of ABVP,also voiced similar views. We have told the election office that our party members have only used hand-made posters. We dont know who have been distributing printed pamphlets in our name.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1001255&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Sibal said internet is a great medium for the masses but is increasingly being used for terror activities.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1000968&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stressing on increasing partnership among educational institutes at the global level,HRD Minister Kapil Sibal today said the demographic dividend enjoyed by India should be exploited by foreign institutes to create a pool of skilled workforce.</p>
<p>&#8220;India is going to play a significant role in the years to come because the human resource is here. You have 400 million people under the age of 14 and when they grow up,you can imagine the unmatched workforce they will provide to the world. What we need to do is to empower them,&#8221; he said at an educational summit here organised by University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>In this context,he said that if the country is able to empower the children and give them quality education by 2020 by when the average age of an Indian would be 29,&#8221;they will really be able to provide the solution to the world. So India has an enormous role to play&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sibal said it is in the interest of the foreign institutes to come and train students in the country,with focus on skill development.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are graduating in BA and BA (Hons). What is their contribution to economic growth,&#8221; he wondered while pressing for skilling the graduates for the economic growth.</p>
<p>Noting that Internet is a great medium for the masses,Sibal,however,regretted the fact that it is increasingly being used for terror activities,for sale of spurious drugs and by children to watch porn content.</p>
<p>Emphasising on skilling the youths,Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar suggested setting up of skill varsity and labour. On disruptions in Parliament,she said,&#8221;At times these turbulences reach such extremes that concerns,with varying degrees of intensity,are widely expressed. Ordinary people would always fiercely guard this hallowed institution because they have stakes in it and would eventually prevail upon their representatives in the Parliament to run it smoothly.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1000968&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noting that values like wisdom and character should be inculcated among students,HRD minister Kapil Sibal said life skills should become the central focus of education.</p>
<p>In the present day context,it is not enough for teachers to merely give information and knowledge to students&#8230;human beings need wisdom. They need character. Life skills must become a central focus of educational efforts, he said.</p>
<p>Sibal was speaking at the golden jubilee celebrations of Central Tibetan Schools Administration (CTSA).</p>
<p>The minister said schools should provide an environment where a student can learn techniques of goal setting and how to deal with difficult situations in life.</p>
<p>He also emphasised on adopting new technologies to impart education in schools.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1000946&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alleging that the mushrooming private universities in Himachal had become a cover up for various illegal activities,the state unit of CPI(M) today sought provisions making it mandatory for these varsities to disclose details of their setup on their website.</p>
<p>&#8220;Several instances have come to light where the money in these private universities has been poured by anti-social elements. Investing money in these universities has become a safe haven for black marketeers and other notorious people,&#8221; CPI(M) leader and city Deputy Mayor Takinder Panwar said.</p>
<p>He asked the state government to make it mandatory for these institutes to upload all relevant details including the owners and financers,administration,courses,staff position,students and infrastructure on the website.</p>
<p>Panwar alleged these varsities have been opened either to siphon off money collected from the students or to grab the land and use it for commercial purposes later.</p>
<p>He asked the government to further strengthen regulatory provisions to effectively deal with the wrongdoings of institutes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1000185&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian Institute of Management,Ahmedabad,plans to launch 30 management books written by its faculty members over the next two years. The books will be published by Random House,which has already brought out seven books written by IIMA lecturers since November 2010 when it entered into a collaboration with the institute.</p>
<p>We will be coming out with 30 books on diverse management subjects in the next two years. Since 2010,seven books have been launched and 11 more are in the pipeline at present, said IIMA director Samir K Barua.</p>
<p>According to Random House,the seven books together have sold 50,000 copies since their launch. The institute is publishing these books with a black-cover jacket to differentiate them from other management books in the market.</p>
<p>We have sold over 50,000 copies across the seven-book series and there will be more in the series in 2013. This is a hugely successful collaboration that we plan to continue with IIMA, said Caroline Newbury,vice-president (marketing and publicity) for Random House Publishers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=999701&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid enhance the competitive skills of reserved category candidates,Indian Institute of Management Lucknow has decided to help such aspirants seek structured training through professionals for Common Admission Test (CAT).</p>
<p>&#8220;This exercise will help all the IIM&#8217;s to get quality students from the socio-economically deprived categories. It will also be an incentive for brilliant students from these categories to dream big,focus their energies in a constructive manner for socio-economic upliftment,&#8221; IIM-L Director Devi Singh said.</p>
<p>After many discussions,a workable road map evolved where it was decided that in the pilot phase around 40-60 promising students (belonging to SC/ST category) who are amenable to management studies from colleges around the state capital would be selected,he said.</p>
<p>They will be then groomed and coached for two-three months by some external professional agency which has an expertise in CAT training and IIM-L would pay for all expenses incurred in the form of fee of the trainers.</p>
<p>IIM-L will have no role in selection or training of these candidates and would neither have any influence on any CAT related process,Singh said.</p>
<p>For CAT 2012,IIM-L has selected Team Satyam as its preferred vendor to select and prepare a batch of 50 SC/ST candidates taking the test this year and also groom these candidates for the next stage of Post Graduate Programme in management admission process.</p>
<p>Initially this project would be restricted to Lucknow region (but the candidates can be from any where in India) for the purpose of easy monitoring and evaluation.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=999466&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Government today said there has been a reduction of 1,300 MBBS seats this year after the Medical Council of India did not give renewal permission to 12 medical colleges having as many undergraduate medical seats. </p>
<p>In a written reply in Lok Sabha,Minister of Health and Family Welfare Ghulam Nabi Azad said during the academic year 2012-13,11 post-graduate seats under the all-India quota at Safdarjung Hospital and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital here were surrendered by selected candidates.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa today strongly opposed introduction of a National Eligibility Entrance Test for admission to undergraduate and PG courses in dental colleges,saying such a move would hamper smooth implementation of reservation policy in these admissions.</p>
<p>In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,she said she came to know that the Dental Council of India has issued a gazette notification to this effect and recalled her government&#8217;s objection to such entrance tests for undergraduate and postgraduate medical courses.</p>
<p>Jayalalithaa said entrance exam for professional courses has been abolished in the state since 2007 after an Expert Panel found such exams put students from rural and lower socio-economic backgrounds at a disadvantage due to lack of</p>
<p>geographical and financial access to training centres.</p>
<p>Such entrance examinations result in the growth of expensive coaching centres,she said.</p>
<p>Noting that the state has been following 69 per cent reservation for Backward and Most Backward Communities and Scs and STs in professional courses,she said introduction of a National Eligibility Entrance Test would &#8220;create confusion and</p>
<p>litigation in the smooth implementation of this reservation policy both in undergraduate and postgraduate admissions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strongly protesting the move by the DCI,Jayalalithaa urged that the state may be exempted from the test and allowed to continue with its existing system for admission to undergraduate and postgraduate dental seats. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=999345&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>University Vice Chancellor Dinesh Singh made a strong pitch for revolutionising higher education at the first-of-its-kind academic congress at the varsity,but his detractors called the two-day event an exercise of &#8220;fraud&#8221; to push for his radical reform agenda.</p>
<p>Singh and members of the Left-dominated Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) has almost always been at contrasting positions over the last few months,and even a large gathering of academics and researchers to discuss education could not make the two sides see eye to eye.</p>
<p>With the Leftist bodies of teachers and students sending out a call of protest against the Academic Congress,the day began with a notice from the Proctor warning the teachers against holding protests or disrupting the conference.</p>
<p>The notice said that the academic congress is purely an academic event that is open through paper presentation and is designed to encourage this and help improve the university for its students.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are required to desist from the illegal activity that will disrupt the academic functioning of the University and damage the reputation of the university by disrupting such a prestigious event.</p>
<p>&#8220;The university shall take strict action in case you go ahead with any disruptive course of action,&#8221; it said. </p>
<p>The conference that was held amid tight security,meanwhile,saw tech czar Sam Pitroda and the Vice Chancellor himself,among others,calling for greater reform of the higher education model in the country and a &#8220;paradigm shift&#8221; in the way classrooms function.</p>
<p>DU&#8217;s own cluster of innovation centre became functional last year and the varsity has this year rolled out a four-year BTech in humanity course with exit options at the end of II and III year,laying ground for a four-year undergraduate programme that the university is planning to introduce from the next academic session.</p>
<p>&#8220;The university is an &#8216;idea&#8217; that needs to be developed in accordance with changing needs. An entire paradigm shift by redefining the way classrooms function and eradicating the burden of &#8216;scoring a degree&#8217; is the need of the hour so that our students don&#8217;t just study,but learn as well.&#8221; </p>
<p>Singh further stressed the need of inclusion of multimedia tools in the teaching methodology.</p>
<p>While the Vice Chancellor did not refer to the major reforms and new programmes he has personally taken an initiative in launching,but the protesting members of the  teaching fraternity said the two-day conference was aimed at promoting and propagating the four year programme,they are vehemently opposed to.</p>
<p>The notice from the Proctor notwithstanding,the teachers&#8217; groups assembled to protest though did not indulge in sloganeering.</p>
<p>The protesting members have alleged that the Vice Chancellor has gone about introducing new measures without regard for academic norms,statutory procedures and democratic practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Academic Congress is a fraud on the university community and an attempt to manipulate public opinion. </p>
<p>&#8220;It is also the first time that on important academic issues,the corporate sector and NGOs are being labelled as &#8216;stakeholders&#8217; and people like Sam Pitroda have been invited to inaugurate the congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;These &#8216;reforms&#8217; are part of the plan to facilitate entry of foreign and private universities to sell higher education for the highest profits,&#8221; a joint statement from the protesting bodies said. </p>
<p>&#8220;We are demanding a discussion of what happened to our other courses when this four year programme comes into force. We are demanding a comprehensive discussion,&#8221; said DUTA Executive member Abha Dev Habib. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=999259&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Supreme Court has directed the Union and the Delhi governments to ensure that from the next academic year,an MBBS aspirant seeking admission in a medical college on a Nominees of Government of India (NGOI) category seat takes the all-India entrance test to secure it.</p>
<p>A candidate under the NGOI category is one who belongs to a state or Union territory where there are no adequate medical colleges. They also include the children of the Defence or the paramilitary force personnel,who have sacrificed their lives or have been permanently disabled in wars or terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>A bench of justices A K Patnaik and Swatanter Kumar also held that no student under the NGOI category,who has failed the Delhi University Medical Entrance Test (DUMET),would be granted admission to a medical college here.</p>
<p>&#8220;We direct that from the academic year 2013-2014 onwards,the candidate applying for the seats reserved for NGOI have to obtain the minimum prescribed mark in the All India National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for admission to the MBBS course as provided in the amended MCI Regulations and the admissions will be made on merit&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We direct that with effect from academic year 2012-2013,no admission will be made to any of the seats reserved for NGOI in Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC),Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) and University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS) of any student who has failed in the Delhi University Medical Entrance Test (DUMET),&#8221; the bench said.</p>
<p>The apex court&#8217;s directions came on appeals filed by two MBBS aspirants against the Delhi High Court&#8217;s verdict,which had dismissed their plea challenging the NGOI category and the practice of exempting students under this category from taking the DUMET.</p>
<p>The bench also directed that &#8220;if there are vacant seats in the quota for NGOI in the LHMC and MAMC for the academic year 2011-12,the petitioners would be admitted against those vacant seats on the basis of their merit in DUMET 2011-2012 during the academic year 2012-2013.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Delhi High Court had rejected the MBBS aspirants&#8217; plea to quash the nominations and to issue directions to admit them in the academic year of 2011-12,saying the admission process for that session was already underway.</p>
<p>The apex court also directed that &#8220;the Central government will make a review of the government and private medical colleges which have been established in the meanwhile in the States/Union Territories to which seats are being allocated under the quota for NGOI.</p>
<p>It added &#8220;if they find that additional intake capacity for the MBBS course has been created in these States / Union Territories,the Central government will take a fresh decision on the number of seats in the MBBS course to be reserved for NGOI for these States with effect from the academic year 2013-2014.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=998893&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bombay High Court has directed the National Board of Examinations (NBE) to issue a post graduate degree certificate in Diplomate in National Board (DNB) to a doctor for General Surgery examination held in June 2011.</p>
<p>Admitting a petition,Justices D Y Chandrachud A A Sayed asked the NBE to issue DNB certificate to Dr Hindustanwala Mohammed Adnan Mohammed Mustafa within two weeks.</p>
<p>NBE said the results of petitioner for FCPS examination were declared only on April 23,2011. Hence,on the cut-off date for submission of the application form for DNB exam (which was April 7),the results had not been declared and the petitioner did not fulfill the eligibility criteria.</p>
<p>The petitioner has completed his MBBS and the one year compulsory internship. In May 2007,he took admission to the Fellowship of the College of Physicians and Surgeons (FCPS) degree course conducted by College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons.</p>
<p>The petitioner appeared for the examination in March 2011 and his results were declared on April 23,2011.</p>
<p>Thereafter he sought admission in DNB course and on June 22,2011,he was provisionally allowed to appear in the final theory examination in General Surgery,though his application was incomplete,for want of submission of a certificate of registration in the Indian Medical Register.</p>
<p>At that stage,a proceeding pertaining to derecognition of the College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons was pending before the High Court and the petitioner was informed that a final decision regarding his eligibility will be taken subject to the outcome of the proceedings which were pending.</p>
<p>The petitioner filed his certificate of registration in the Indian Medical Register. He was allowed to appear in the theory examination which he passed. On October 18,2011,he was allowed to appear in practical examination in Kolkata which again he passed. Thereafter,the petitioner appeared in DNB-CET super speciality in January 2012 in the surgical group and was declared to have qualified the examination.</p>
<p>Since the petitioner had received only online theory and practical examination results,he requested NBE to issue degree certificate for DNB in surgery which he had passed. As it was not issued,he moved the court.</p>
<p>The bone of contention arose from the submission of the National Board of Examination (NBE) that the petitioner was not eligible on the cut-off date,April 7,2011,as results for the FCPS examination were not declared until April 23.</p>
<p>The eligibility requirement in Clause 4.1(A) provides that a candidate must have passed the final examination in the MD/MS degrees on or before the last date of submission of the application form for DNB examination. Submission of such proof is treated as an essential pre-requisite. If a candidate does not do so,his case shall be rejected and fees forfeited.</p>
<p>When he submitted his application form,the petitioner did not have proof of having passed the FCPS degree course since his results were declared a fortnight after the cut-off date. Despite this,NBE provisionally allowed the petitioner to appear for the theory examination in General Surgery subject to his submitting the certificate of registration in the Indian Medical Register.</p>
<p>After the petitioner passed the theory test,he was allowed to appear for practicals. Thereafter,he was even allowed to appear for the super speciality examination in the surgical group which also he passed.</p>
<p>The court,however,held that at this stage,NBE cannot raise the plea that on the date of the submission of the application for DNB final examination,the petitioner did not fulfil the requirement of eligibility.</p>
<p>The judges said,&#8221;the petitioner has passed the qualifying examination though as indicated earlier his result was declared on April 23,2011. The fact that the petitioner had not submitted proof of the passing of the examination together with the application form was known to NBE inspite of which he was allowed to appear for theory and practical examination and thereafter for super speciality examination.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are of the view that the objection which has been raised by NBE lacks in substance. The petitioner has expended an enormous amount of time in passing the theory and practical examination in General Surgery as well as the super speciality examination and it would be a travesty of justice to now disregard those attainments on the ground that he has passed the examination on April 23,2011,&#8221; the judges said in their order delivered recently.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=998857&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Complaining that education sector in India is &#8220;pretty rigid&#8221;,tech czar Sam Pitroda today advocated the need for students to take up jobs along with studies,saying one cannot move ahead with a &#8220;19th century mindset&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In India that flexibility is needed. We can&#8217;t carry forward with the 19th century mindset,20th century process and 21st century needs,&#8221; Pitroda,the Advisor to Prime Minster Manmohan Singh,said.</p>
<p>Addressing the &#8216;Academic Congress&#8217; organised by Delhi University,Pitroda also found fault with the present system and demanded that the universities and colleges should be given freedom to award a student with a degree whenever they think the student is ready to be a graduate.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a need for theoretical and practical experiences and to achieve this students should also be allowed to work in their respective sectors of interest even while studying.&#8221;</p>
<p>Advising the need for a generational change to make education more accessible,he said the education system in the country is pretty rigid and the country needed expansion,equity and excellence so that the quality of education can be raised.</p>
<p>He said a number of education bills are stuck in Parliament and alleged that parties,unions and people with vested interest block  reforms in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who decides that it will take four years to get a degree? Why can&#8217;t we give freedom to the universities and colleges to give the degrees within two or three years,whenever they think the student is ready to be a graduate. Why a standard procedure of four years?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Pitroda said teachers are not needed for content generation and defining the content but they should be in the role of mentors. &#8220;To achieve this teachers training programme should be change. We need to re-define the needs of students and teachers,&#8221; he said. </p>
<p>Pitroda said the National Knowledge Commission (NKC) plan was to set up 40 new innovation universities with new ideas,which could offer degree in 2 to 3 years but now the government is talking of forming just 14 Universities or making desired changes in the existing universities.</p>
<p>He claimed the government is in no mood to change the education system,but it is students who should demand for change.</p>
<p>Claiming that Universities do not provide fertile ground for innovations,he said hardly any programmes for internships are conducted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Professors from outside are not called and Professors in the country do not do the researches,so it has become a chain where nobody wants to change. Innovation require collaboration.</p>
<p>Every University should have innovation centres,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said in the US &#8220;classes are held on sea,on railway stations. Why a teacher should take class in a room only,why not in garden or in a restaurant&#8221;.</p>
<p>Students learn more from each other than a teacher can teach them,he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Education should be provided in multiple languages along with local languages otherwise students will not be able to have overall development,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=998816&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[As the country celebrated Teachers Day on Wednesday,thousands of university and college teachers,principals of government and aided colleges as also students from all over the state demonstrated on the Gujarat University campus demanding filling up of vacant teaching and non-teaching posts.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=998641&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the country celebrated Teachers Day on Wednesday,thousands of university and college teachers,principals of government and aided colleges as also students from all over the state demonstrated on the Gujarat University campus demanding filling up of vacant teaching and non-teaching posts. They also demanded salaries to principals as per recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission. </p>
<p>Later,they submitted a memorandum to Governor Kamla Beniwal in this regard.</p>
<p>They also carried banners denouncing state education minister Ramanlal Vora. Some of the banners carried slogans like Shikshan Mantri; shame,shame,Samaan kaam,samaan vetan (equal pay for equal work) and Shikshan nu vyaparikaran band karo (Stop commercialisation of education).</p>
<p>P C Upadhyay from Gujarat State Principals Association told The Indian Express that though the state government had implemented the six pay panels recommendations for university and college teachers,principals and several administrative officers like registrars of universities were not covered.</p>
<p>The principals,he said,were getting a pay scale of Rs 37,400 per month while the recommended scale by the sixth pay panel was Rs 43,000. </p>
<p>It would also affect them after retirement as they would be getting less amount as pension,Upadhyay said,adding that college and university teachers had not been paid arrears of the salary as per the panels recommendations.</p>
<p>He said the association had taken up the matter with the government several times but nothing happened except the government giving hollow assurances.</p>
<p>The memorandum pointed out that the government was not giving permission to fill up vacancies caused due to retirement of teachers. It demanded that immediate permission be given to recruit teachers for these posts.</p>
<p>It said a large number of administrative staff vacancies,that included laboratory assistants in colleges,was not filled up for years and it hampered teaching works.</p>
<p>Claiming that 270 colleges were working on part-time basis at a consolidated monthly salary of Rs 7,500,they said this amounted to exploitation and demanded they all be regularised on full salary with immediate effect.</p>
<p>Among others who participated in the demonstration were Gujarat Rajya Adhyapak Mandal led by Digvijaysinh Gohil,Gujarat State College Management Association president Sudhir Nanavati and GU Teachers Association president J S Prajapati.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=998641&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Observing that improving quality of education is vital for building a strong nation,President Pranab Mukherjee today advocated application of new technology in curriculum development for all stages of education.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adaptation to and application of new technology should be an integral part of the curriculum development for all stages of education. New methods and teaching aids must equip the younger generations to learn more,explore more and contribute more to the society,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mukherjee,who himself was a teacher in his early days,said it was necessary to design appropriate learning experiences for students as learning processes has ceased to remain confined to classroom-based curriculum.</p>
<p>The President said teachers should also give themselves a new orientation and evolve an enhanced institutional capacity.</p>
<p>He said qualified and competent teachers,continuously renewing their capabilities and excellence through research,experimentation and innovation would be the nation&#8217;s strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must work for long term goal of setting performance standards and creating top class institutional facilities for innovative training and professional development of teachers,&#8221; Mukherjee said.</p>
<p>He was speaking on the occasion of the presentation of national awards to teachers on Teacher&#8217; Day here.</p>
<p>Mukherjee also reminded of his assertion made while assuming office as President that &#8220;education is the key alchemy that can bring India to its next golden age. Our motto should be: all for education and education for all&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=998248&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

to dearth of innovation in celebrating the day.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=998046&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Many students blame lack of enthusiasm owing </p>
<p>to dearth of innovation in celebrating the day</i></p>
<p>Most of the colleges in the city seem to have cut off themselves from the traditional enthusiam and fervour associated with Teachers Day. While students in primary and secondary schools are busy planning and preparing for the day,enthusiasm in colleges is conspicuous by its absence. As a matter of fact,many colleges treat the day as a holiday. </p>
<p>Students who have been organising programmes over the years to mark the day,say,that the response from students is not at all encouraging. Govind Shiurkar,a student  of College of Agriculture and co-ordinator of National Service Scheme (NSS),said,Every year we mark the day by inviting an eminent personality to address and guide students. But the response from the students is very poor. Since the function is orgnanised by NSS,we have to ensure that NSS volunteers attend the programme just to gather enough audience. Others students hardly attend the programme. </p>
<p>A second year student of Modern College of Engineering Pankaj Raut said the reason for low enthusiasm among students could be their busy schedule and load of assignments. </p>
<p>Students,who are otherwise busy attending classes and completing assignments,prefer to spend the day enjoying with friends rather than attending a boring lecture or take mock classes. I used to participate in Teachers Day celebrations very enthusiastically every year but now I prefer to use the day to either get some important work done or rest at home, said Raut. </p>
<p>A head of the department with University of Pune,who did not wished to be named,said earlier the department used to celebrate the day but it was discountiued owing to disinterest on the part of the students. Ideally,it is the students who need to plan and celebrate the day by organising a function to felicitate professors and non-teaching staff. Teachers themselves cannot arrange a function for their felicitation, he said. Many students blame lack of enthusiasm owing to dearth of innovation in celebrating the day. </p>
<p>The format of celebrations has remained same over the year. Playing the role of teachers on the day gets mundane when you have done the same throughout your school life. If the organisers can come up with some innovative ideas,more students will show interest, said Pravin Gandarde,an MBA student of University of Pune. </p>
<p>However,Akanksha Foundation,an NGO that works for welfare of children from low-income communities,has come up with an innovative concept to celebrate the day. The NGO plans to set up simple schools at shopping malls,bust stops and other crowded places with students armed with a blackboard and chalk inviting people to teach them. </p>
<p>Our message is simple. Use the time you spend in waiting constructively. Teach us, said Anandi Yagnaraman,director operations,Akanksha. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=998046&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>All students of this ideal school have trees named after them</i></p>
<p><b>Green school of thought</b></p>
<p>My tree,my protector&#8217; is what the primary school at Ghodegaon village,about 80 km from the city,preaches and follows. </p>
<p>Planting around 2,000 trees with villagers and pledging to protect the trees by naming them after individuals has got the school in Ambegaon taluka the Zilla Parishad ideal school award this year and its teacher.</p>
<p>The school surrounded by lawns and huge trees is the green spot of the village. With just 52 students from class one to four,its primary section has huge cut-outs of green initiatives and charts and models announcing the green movement.</p>
<p>Children aged 6-10 are taught rainwater harvesting,methods to grow flowering plants and water recycling. The effort by the school teachers is paying off. </p>
<p>When Kaveri and Shubam from class three show off the ten trees named after them,they know the trees will be &#8220;rakshaks&#8221; of the village. The children even tie rakhis to the trees,which they say are their family. </p>
<p>Ghodekar believes in catching them young. The teacher has 18 years experience,but he began focusing on creating environment awareness among his students 10-12 years ago.</p>
<p>The effort soon caught the attention of the gram panchayat,which extended monetory support. With 20 dedicated teachers and the support of the panchayat,the school has taken many learning initiatives. </p>
<p>&#8220;The focus is on students and this has helped them understand concepts better. Our many experiments have helped the children do well,&#8221; said Ghodekar.</p>
<p><b>Now,professionals moving towards teaching as full-time career</b></p>
<p>For most engineering and business administration graduates a career in their core industries is ideal but teaching as a profession is slowly becoming a trend as a lot of youngsters are taking it up as a career choice. The choices range from engineering to under graduate courses in science,commerce and arts.</p>
<p>Aspiring teachers say they find teaching more challenging as a profession. They can interact with youngsters on a personal level and can also continue with the research work in their own field.</p>
<p>Amol Deogadkar,26,who has recently started teaching at the MIT School OF Management College says he opted for the profession because it is interesting. Deogadkar is a mechanical engineer who holds two post graduate degrees one in Finance and the other in Operations Management. Even during my post graduate days I would help my friends and batchmates with their courses. After completing my course I wanted to take up teaching and now I plan to continue it full time, he says.</p>
<p>As part of the Teach For India campaign,youngsters take a break from their regular jobs and teach school children.  A lot of youngsters are veering towards teaching in colleges too. The initial salary is not very high for most of them,given that they begin as assistant professors but money is not a major factor for them. Deogadkar says,I am into my second semister of teaching undergraduate students. It takes a while initially but once you are established as a good professor it does not take long to climb up the success ladder.</p>
<p>Raju Roshan,an engineer who completed his masters in business administration is at present a visiting faculty at the DY Patil Centre of Management and Research,Chikli. He says,I teach statistics and it is a very fulfilling job. It is not just about teaching a subject but also about helping the students grasp the same better. In fact,my students come up with problems regarding the subject. Students find it easier to relate more to the young professors.</p>
<p>Roshan and Deogadkar have started working recently,on the other hand,Amruta Dixit and Pradyna Gaikwad have been in the profession for almost two years now. While Dixit is an MBA finance graduate teaches finance,Gaikwad is a B Sc Chemistry graduate and teaches HR at the MITSOM college. For both of them the profession is fun-filled and also lets them expand their own knowledge.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=998035&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>The petitioner,Amit Bhatia,an assistant professor with the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Lovely Faculty of Applied Medical Science claimed that the girl had been illegally allowed byPU to take part in the interview process</i></p>
<p>THE Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday issued notices to Panjab University on a petition filed by a man who has sought directions to quash the candidature of a girl related to an ex officer of the university for a staff vacancy. The petitioner,Amit Bhatia,an assistant professor with the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences in Lovely Faculty of Applied Medical Science claimed that the girl,Vandita Kakkar,had been illegally allowed by Panjab University to take part in the interview process. </p>
<p>Bhatias counsel,Advocate Saurav Verma,has alleged that allowing Kakkar in the interview process is against the universitys own rules and regulations. Bhatia also sought direction to the university to not declare the result of the selection process while his petition was pending. </p>
<p>Verma contended that in 2010 an advertisement was issued by the Registrar,Panjab University,Chandigarh for filling up of various vacancies and that Panjab University then extended the last date for submission of the applications forms to October 25,2010. He also pointed out that though the advertisement was issued in the year 2010,the selection process did not start then. In the year 2012,Bhatia was issued an interview call letter through which he was asked to appear before the selection committee on August 11. </p>
<p>Bhatia has alleged that the rules of appointment were tweaked only to accommodate Kakkar since she is the relative of an ex officer of the University. After the completion of the interview process,the petitioner came to know that the interview process was actually an eyewash and the final outcome of the interview process had already been decided &#8211; to appoint Vandita Kakkar to the said post and for whose accommodation the selection criteria,rules and regulations have been given a complete go-by. All this has been done in a most illegal and malafide manner just to accommodate a single ineligible candidate who otherwise cannot stand a chance before the petitioner, the petition reads. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=997881&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Telugu Desam Party president and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu was taken into custody by the Cyberabad police this afternoon as he led a road blockade at L B Nagar here demanding reimbursement of tuition fee in full for students of the backward classes in professional courses.</p>
<p>The Telugu Nadu Students Federation,the student wing of TDP,organised the protest against the dilution of the fee reimbursement scheme.</p>
<p>The TDP chief,who took part in the programme,slammed the Congress government for diluting the scheme and depriving students belonging to backward classes of higher professional education.</p>
<p>&#8220;This government lacks sincerity&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t want BC students to pursue higher professional education,&#8221; the Leader of Opposition alleged.</p>
<p>Chandrababu and the TNSF workers were taken into custody and led to Vanasthalipuram police station. They were later set free.</p>
<p>Notably,the Kiran Kumar Reddy government had decided to restrict the fee reimbursement to only those students who secured less than 10,000 rank in the Engineering Common Entrance Test after it lost a case in High Court over fixing a uniform fee structure in engineering colleges. The government did not get any immediate relief even in Supreme Court. </p>
<p>Fearing a backlash,the government clarified that the problem related to only 85 colleges and all students in the rest 602 private engineering colleges would be reimbursed the fee in full (Rs 35,000) under the convenor quota.</p>
<p>The opposition parties have,however,been demanding that the government reimburse the fee in toto without any restrictions.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Kiran Kumar Reddy announced that the government would take a final call based on the outcome of the case,pending disposal in Supreme Court.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=997755&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The government on Tuesday managed the passage of a key legislation in Parliament for creation of six AIIMS-like premier medical institutes across the country despite uproar by BJP members over coal allocation issue.</p>
<p>The passing of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (Amendment) Bill,2012,in the Rajya Sabha now paves the way for creation of six AIIMS-like premier medical institutes in Patna,Bhopal,Raipur,Bhubaneshwar,Jodhpur and Rishikesh.</p>
<p>The Lok Sabha has already given its nod to the Bill,which will replace an ordinance in this regard. The Bill will confer powers upon the Centre to establish AIIMS-like institutions by notification in the official gazette.</p>
<p>As the Upper House reassembled at 4 pm after three adjournments,Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad moved the Bill for consideration and passage.</p>
<p>Left parties had earlier blocked the government&#8217;s efforts to get the Bill passed without debate.</p>
<p>Even as BJP continued to raise uproar over allocation of coal blocks,Deputy Chairman P J Kurien took up the Bill and announced its passing by voice vote.</p>
<p>The six states in which the institutes were established had requested the Central government to make them operational urgently and to commence the academic session in September,2012, the Bill&#8217;s Statement of Objects and Reasons stated.</p>
<p>As the uproar continued,Kurien adjourned the House for the day.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=997686&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Voicing concern over poor levels of student learning,Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today pitched for continuous assessment of benefits derived by children through education besides tracking attendance.</p>
<p>Addressing &#8216;Teacher Awardees&#8217; on the eve of Teacher&#8217;s Day,Singh said the last eight years had seen a significant increase in enrolment of children in primary schools and a decline in the gender gap in elementary education.</p>
<p>&#8220;However,the poor levels of student learning remain a major concern. Therefore,as we move ahead we need a clear shift in our strategy from a focus on inputs,access and enrolment to what goes on in the classroom and the school,&#8221; Singh said.</p>
<p>He said there was a need to set up transparent and reliable systems for tracking attendance of children in a truly meaningful way.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time,we need to put in place a system of continuous assessment of the benefit our children are getting from their education. Participation of the community and parents would be essential in this process,so that they can be satisfied with the quality of teaching,&#8221; the Prime Minister said.</p>
<p>Singh said there was a significant reduction in socio- economic inequalities in access to education and a narrowing of the gap between SCs/STs,minorities and other social groups.</p>
<p>He said the government has substantially increased public spending on education since 2004-05. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister said education expenditure as a percentage of the GDP has increased from 3.3 per cent in 2004-05 to four per cent in 2011-12.</p>
<p>Per capita public expenditure on education has increased from Rs 888 in 2004-05 to Rs 2,985 in 2011-12,he said,adding that the enhanced outlays have helped in a massive expansion of the educational infrastructure and sanction of additional posts of teachers on a large scale.</p>
<p>Singh said teachers have to be an integral part of policy-making,governance and management,as also of day-to-day instructional strategies and decision making.</p>
<p>&#8220;The empowerment of teachers that includes real opportunity for them to share policy perspectives and decision-making will have to be the key component of the educational reform process,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said as teachers,the state looked to them to guide the children of the country in their quest for knowledge and truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through you,we aspire to build in our children a commitment to the values of democracy,and the values of equality,social  justice,freedom,secularism,and respect for human dignity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I urge you to develop in children independence of thought and action and the capacity for taking carefully considered decisions. Through you,our children should also develop a sensitivity to the well-being and feelings of others and also the ability to work and participate in the processes of social and economic change,&#8221; Singh said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=997657&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unmukt Chand,India&#8217;s U-19 World Cup winning team captain,is now ready to start his second year of college after a bitter stand-off with his St Stephen&#8217;s College in Delhi. Chand was denied promotion to second year BA course due to &#8216;insufficient attendance&#8217;. The Delhi University norms prescribe 33.3 per cent attendance for a student studying under the sports quota.</p>
<p>The situation is different closer home. Many top cricketers studying in different colleges in the city and the rest of the state say they have never faced problem due to low attendance. </p>
<p>Maharashtra&#8217;s Ranji team captain Rohit Motwani is pursuing his second year BCom from University of Pune via correspondence. &#8220;With my cricketing commitments,it becomes very difficult to attend college regularly. The correspondence course is simpler as I only have to appear for the final examination,&#8221; says the 21-year-old. College teachers say this trend is now followed by many cricketers. </p>
<p>Harshad Khadiwale,a regular in the Maharashtra Ranji team,is also pursuing a correspondence course in commerce from Pune University. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have to worry about assignments and I can study even on tour,&#8221; says the opening batsman. </p>
<p>S P College principal Dilip Sheth says the college does all it can to help sportspersons on its rolls. &#8220;We understand that these players cannot come to college everyday so we hold special classes for them,&#8221; says Sheth. &#8220;The college does not deny promotion in a majority of cases to sports quota students even if they do not possess necessary minimum attendance.&#8221; </p>
<p>Khadiwale who completed his Classes XI and XII from S P College says,&#8221;I was never denied permission to write exams even though my attendance was low. The college understood my problem and co-operated,&#8221; he says. </p>
<p>Left-arm spinner Akshay Darekar,who played for India A during their recent tour to West Indies,is a final year B Com student at Khalsa College in Mumbai. </p>
<p>&#8220;My college doesn&#8217;t expect me to attend lectures. They know that I am a professional cricketer and attending college regularly is not possible for me. At times,I have been allowed to take exams with only 15 per cent attendance,&#8221; says Darekar. </p>
<p>Dr Deepak Mane,director of UoP sports board,says the university has not prescribed any particular norms for minimum attendance and internal academic performance. </p>
<p>&#8220;At UoP,we take sports seriously and we conduct special examinations for sportspersons who cannot appear for their exams,&#8221; says Mane. &#8220;But the University expects the sportspersons to submit an application detailing the reasons for the absence so as to be considered for out of turn examinations.&#8221; Mane adds that the university has left it to respective colleges to conduct extra classes for such students.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=997511&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seeking admission under the sports quota,a chess player has moved Delhi High Court after being denied a seat because she couldnt clear a recently-instituted physical fitness test which mandated that she should be able to run a distance of 1 km in 6 minutes or 50 metres in 9 seconds.</p>
<p>A division bench of Acting Chief Justice A K Sikri and Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw on Monday reserved their order on the petition which was filed against Delhi University,its sports council and four colleges which come under the university.</p>
<p>Petitioner Chetna Karnani,a student of Sadhu Vaswani International School in R K Puram,submitted that she had been playing chess for more than seven years and had participated successfully in inter-school tournaments. She said she had applied to eight colleges in DU under the sports quota but was shocked to learn that for the first time the university had introduced a physical fitness test for each candidate.</p>
<p>The petition stated that under the earlier system,admission under the sports category was given on the basis of a points system which took into account representation at school-level as well as points awarded in trials for the sport held by the university. It said a general fitness category was never included as it was recognised that fitness could not be generalised across sporting disciplines.</p>
<p>Under the new system introduced in 2012,candidates are required to pass two of three fitness modules that test strength,endurance and speed,the petition stated. </p>
<p>During arguments,advocate Rajat Aneja,appearing for the petitioner,said that the university had earlier insisted only on game-specific fitness which varied for different sports. He argued that his client could not be placed under the category of an athlete as chess required mental faculties more than anything else.</p>
<p>I have certificates from the CBSE for chess tournaments which are on par with national level. The insistence on these tests is unreasonable for a chess player, Aneja argued for his client. The lawyer added that Gargi college in DUs south campus had already said it was willing to give his client admission if a court order set aside the physical test results.</p>
<p>Acting Chief Justice Sikri was also surprised at the level of physical fitness that the university wanted a chess player to display.</p>
<p>I understand that physical fitness leads to mental fitness but what are these requirements? You are saying that women candidates should run one kilometre in six minutes. Then for strength she has to do a standing broad jump of 1.15 metres. She is not playing a sport like football or cricket, the judge said.</p>
<p>The counsel appearing for the university contended that this was the base level of fitness for every sports candidate .</p>
<p>Even a chess player who is serious must have physical stamina. Chess matches go on for many rounds and if a player doesnt have physical endurance,they cant go past one or two rounds, the DU counsel argued. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=997440&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amidst much hand-wringing,the revocation of London Metropolitan University&#8217;s licence to admit and teach Indian and other non-EU students has caused a &#8220;high level of concern&#8221; in various countries from where students come to study in the UK.</p>
<p>LMU&#8217;s board of governors were scheduled to meet later on Monday to discuss the situation,while student and other unions expressed support to the international students affected by the licence revocation by the UK Border Agency due to &#8220;serious and systemic errors&#8221;.</p>
<p>The British Council,which has presence in various countries and is usually the first port of call for students keen to study in the UK,has reported a &#8220;high level of concern&#8221; after the LMU crisis hit international headlines.</p>
<p>Martin Davidson,Chief Executive of the British Council,said: &#8220;This situation at London Met could be hugely damaging to the UK&#8217;s excellent reputation overseas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our offices around the world are receiving a high level of concern and we are doing our best to explain the position and reassure students that the UK welcomes and values them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are making clear that this will not affect people with places in the UK &#8216;s other universities&#8230;Genuine international students make a huge contribution to the UK,academically,economically,and culturally. The UK is the second most popular study destination in the world for ambitious young people,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In China,from where the largest numbers of non-EU students come to the UK,a translation error by Chinese news agencies has reportedly dragged another London university,City University,into the LMU controversy.</p>
<p>City University has reportedly been wrongly named by China&#8217;s national state broadcaster as the university affected by the UK Border Agency&#8217;s decision to withdraw LMU&#8217;s licence. </p>
<p>The error has also been made in newspapers and magazines,reports here said.</p>
<p>There are fears that the error may already have damaged the City University&#8217;s reputation in China.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,protests have been planned and petitions launched online to support Indian and other international students affected by LMU&#8217;s licence revocation.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 universities across the UK are in touch with LMU to offer alternative places to the affected students. </p>
<p>Michael Banner,fellow of Trinity College,Cambridge,told BBC Radio 4: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t present a very welcoming picture on the face of it,not least because we know a lot of students on the surface have done nothing wrong. It&#8217;s a punishment for the university,but the people being punished are the students&#8221;.</p>
<p>Cambridge University Students&#8217; Union (CUSU) said the decision to revoke LMU&#8217;s licence was &#8220;disproportionate&#8221; and &#8220;must be challenged&#8221;.</p>
<p>Rosalyn Old,president of CUSU,said: &#8220;The Border Agency&#8217;s decision to revoke this licence and deport thousands of legitimate students is just one part of a dangerous agenda to discourage international students from coming to study in the UK&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a time when universities and their students are suffering under serious budget cuts,the Border Agency&#8217;s decision is a serious blow to the exceptionally diverse,international,academic community which makes UK Universities,including Cambridge,world class,&#8221; she added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=997251&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Favouring a change in the education structure,HRD Minister Kapil Sibal today asked parents to change their mindset and focus on vocational education for their children.</p>
<p>Launching a pilot project on &#8216;National Vocational Education Qualifications Framework&#8217; here,Sibal said,India is a country of youth. There is need to give them such education,which may get them good employment in future.</p>
<p>He said,parents will have to change their mindset in this regard and instead of normal education,they should see that their children get vocational education.</p>
<p>If someone has to work in automobiles,where is the need to teach him history? Those who want to pursue studies after schooling can do so,but those wanting to work should be professionally prepared to get work,Sibal said. </p>
<p>Emphasising on the need to change the structure of education in the country,he said that 100 community colleges will be launched soon.</p>
<p>Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that Haryana is developing into an education hub of international level. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=997138&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Government&#8217;s attempts for passage of a bill in Parliament for setting up AIIMS-like premier medical institutes across the country failed with Left members today raising objections in the Rajya Sabha for passing it without discussion.</p>
<p>After the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (Amendment) Bill,2012,was moved by Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare S Gandhiselvan for consideration and passage,members of Left parties were on their feet with some CPI-M members even entering the Well.</p>
<p>As BJP continued to raise uproar over allocation of coal blocks by entering the Well,CPI-M members P Rajeeve and K N Balagopal also entered the Well raising objections to the manner in which the government wanted the legislation to be passed.</p>
<p>The CPI-M and CPI demanded discussion on the Bill before its passing,while Prasanta Chatterjee (CPI-M) said his party will not allow any legislation to be passed in the Upper House without discussion. D Raja (CPI) spoke on similar lines.</p>
<p>As BJP members continued to raise slogans against the government and demanded resignation of the Prime Minister and cancellation of coal blocks,CPI-M added to the din by raising objections to the AIIMS Bill being passed without discussion.</p>
<p>Minister of State for Personnel V Narayanasamy then told the Left members that the Bill has already been passed in Lok Sabha. What is your problem?</p>
<p>The government had tried to get the legislation passed earlier during the day,but the Left thwarted the effort.</p>
<p>As the uproar continued,Deputy Chairman P J Kurien adjourned the House for the day.</p>
<p>The Bill,already passed by the Lok Sabha,will replace an ordinance which allowed the six AIIMS-like institutes to get operational from September in Patna,Bhopal,Raipur,Bhubaneshwar,Jodhpur and Rishikesh. The Bill will confer powers upon the Centre to establish AIIMS-like institutions by notification in the official gazette.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=997070&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over nine lakh students will be provided with free uniforms under the Atal School Uniform scheme,Himchal Pradesh Chief Minister Prem Kumar Dhumal today said. </p>
<p>Addressing a public meeting at Khundian in Jwalamukhi area of district Kangra,Dhumal said the cost to distribute uniforms free of cost to 9,28,365 students alongwith stitching charges at the rate of Rs 100 per dress had already been funded. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Atal Uniform Scheme has cost the state exchequer Rs 64 crore but it has proved to be a boon to the students and introduced uniformity among them,&#8221; Dhumal said. </p>
<p>Meanwhile,Dhumal said the state government had already cleared full arrears of revised pay for government employees,claiming that all sections of the society had benefitted during past 56 months of BJP-rule in the state. </p>
<p>Reiterating his charge that the UPA government was discriminating against the BJP- uled Himachal,Dhumal said the state government was still waiting for Centre&#8217;s nod for the release of Rs 4,000 crore,accrued to the state on account of state&#8217;s share in hydropower projects under Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB).  </p>
<p>He said that the issue of shifting the headquarters of Dogra regiment from Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh to Una in Himachal was still hanging fire. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=997011&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 350 Indian students are among nearly 2,600 non-EU students being offered places at various universities after the London Metropolitan University (LMU) was stripped of its licence to admit and teach international students last week.</p>
<p>A taskforce constituted to support current students at various stages of their courses is coordinating offers of places from universities in London and other places.</p>
<p>Some universities have offered to charge the same fees as LMU even though their fees are higher than LMU&#8217;s.</p>
<p>LMU lost its licence last week after UK Border Agency &#8216;systemic and serious errors&#8217; in the university&#8217;s recruitment of international students,including from India.</p>
<p>The action sparked concerns about the impact it would have on the UK&#8217;s standing in the international student recruitment market.</p>
<p>Indian students who had acquired student visas and were in the process of travelling to London to start their courses this month have been told to cancel their plans after the revocation.</p>
<p>The University of East London (UEL) has set up a hotline for LMU students,while others Middlesex University,University of Bedfordshire and De Montfort University have also expressed interest in accepting LMU students affected by the licence revocation.</p>
<p>LMU has closed its offices in New Delhi and Chennai,while the university has informed some of the affected new students that they could have fees refunded.</p>
<p>Leicester-based Dominic Shellard,vice-chancellor of De Montfort University,said he was happy to see if London Met students could be accommodated at his institution.</p>
<p>Shellard told the media: &#8220;Our offer to help is not about financial gain. That is why a consortium approach through the taskforce is important. It would scotch the notion that some universities are trying to cream off students&#8221;.</p>
<p>Shellard said the swift reallocation of students would ultimately benefit universities by limiting negative publicity across the world: &#8220;I could see from the TV this has caused huge anxiety to bona-fide,legitimate students left totally bereft&#8230; I think the biggest challenge is how to limit the damage caused to the reputation of the sector overseas&#8221;.</p>
<p>Catherine Downes,director of corporate marketing at UEL,said: &#8220;We had over 100 calls from both international and home students&#8230; We have now set up a dedicated hotline with specialist advisers able to help students. We are quite convenient (for London Met students) in terms of our location and there is also a good match portfolio-wise&#8221;.</p>
<p>Amit Kapadia,the executive director of the campaign group HSMP Forum said: &#8220;Such measures (licence revocation) only show that the basic British values of fair play and justice are being threatened by mindless actions of the government and the sparkling reputation earned at the recent Olympics and on-going Paralympics is now being smeared by the unfair and the horrible injustice suffered by these students&#8221;.</p>
<p>The LMU is likely to legally challenge the decision to revoke its licence.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=996727&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Against the backdrop of drought in various parts of the country,a proposal to raise the number of assured employment days under MNREGA from 100 to 150 will be considered by an Empowered Group of Ministers next week with an aim of benefitting the farm labour.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposal to increase work days under Mahatama Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee (MNREGA) scheme,will come up for discussion in the meeting of the empowered group of ministers (EG0M) on drought scheduled next week,&#8221; a source privy to the development said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Treating this year as a special case in view of drought declared in the four states,the inter-ministerial group would consider this proposal to provide relief to the rural population especially the farm workers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>MNREGA assures 100 days of work every year to each household in rural areas. Generally,people avail of the benefit under the scheme during the off-season of agriculture.</p>
<p>The government has provided Rs 33,000 crore to implement the scheme this fiscal,as against Rs 31,000 crore in 2011-12.</p>
<p>The EGoM on drought,headed by Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar,would also discuss other proposals such as a special package for protective irrigation to save orchard crops,the source said.</p>
<p>Monsoon deficit is 12 per cent so far and four-states  Karnataka,Maharashtra,Gujarat and Rajasthan &#8212; have declareddrought in more than 390 taluks.</p>
<p>In the last EGoM,the government had announced mitigation measures such as diesel subsidy,enhanced ceiling on subsidies on seeds and channelised funds under various schemes to boost drinking water and fodder supply for livestock.</p>
<p>The four states have sought relief funds to mitigate the impact of drought and the central teams have been constituted to visit these states to assess the situation,Pawar had informed Parliament last week.</p>
<p>Poor monsoon has affected sowing of kharif (summer) crops with total area lagging behind at 95.43 million hectare so far from 101.5 million hectare in the year-ago period. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=996662&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A group of non-teaching staff of the Indian Institute of Technology in Powai here have moved the Bombay High Court challenging the decision of Union Government to pay higher wages to the teaching staff of IIT.</p>
<p>Hearing the petition filed by H G Patil,B B Nare and other non-teaching employees of IIT,Justice Sharad Bobade and Justice Rajesh Ketkar last week asked the Central Government to file an affidavit in reply by September 13.</p>
<p>The petitioners argued through their lawyer Vishwasrao Deokar that although the third,fourth and fifth Pay Commissions had recommended parity in wages for non-teaching and teaching staff of IIT,the Centre had discriminated in the payment of salaries by paying teaching staff (junior engineers and technical assistants) higher wages.</p>
<p>In IIT,Powai,there are 46 non-teaching staff working as office assistants,stenographers,senior telephone operators and assistant registrars. They have demanded that they be given the same salary grade,which is given to junior technical assistants or junior engineers (teaching staff).</p>
<p>The petitioners claimed that prior to 1986,both teaching and non-teaching staff were getting same salaries. </p>
<p>However,in 1986,the Government gave higher pay scales to the teaching staff i.e. junior engineers and junior technical assistants.</p>
<p>Being aggrieved,the non-teaching staff filed a petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the order of the Government fixing different pay scales for teaching and</p>
<p>non-teaching staff. </p>
<p>On June 22,2008,the High Court had allowed their petition and quashed the order of the Government fixing different pay scales for both categories,teaching and non teaching staff. The Court also asked the Central Government to consider the demand of non teaching staff for parity in wages given to teaching staff.</p>
<p>As the Government did not consider their demand,a legal notice was served to them. The non teaching staff contended that as they did not get the same wages earned by the teaching staff,each employee suffered loss of Rs 5,400 per month.</p>
<p>They argued that although their nature of work differed from that of the teaching staff,the quantum and quality of work remained the same for both the categories.</p>
<p>On April 6 last year,the Central Government again put the teaching staff on higher pay scales. Being aggrieved,the non teaching staff filed a petition last month in the High Court seeking parity in wages and also demanded arrears since 1986.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=996649&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The judicial panel,set up by the Delhi High Court,has recommended that more than 60 schools have to refund the excess fees charged by them in 2009 without paying salaries to their teaching and non-teaching staff as per the Sixth Pay Commission.</p>
<p>A three-member committee headed by former Rajasthan High Court Chief Justice Anil Dev Singh,set up last year,has examined the financial records of 200 schools on a random basis out of total 1172 schools and submitted its first interim report before the bench of Acting Chief Justice A K Sikri and Justice Siddharth Mridul yesterday.</p>
<p>The committee said in its report that 64 schools &#8220;unjustly&#8221; increased fees and recommended that all of them refund the same with 9 percent interest to the parents.</p>
<p>As per the panel report,the group of Guru Harkrishan Public Schools,including the one on Purana Qila Road,Hargovind Enclave and Vasant Vihar branches,Guru Nanak Public School in Pushpanjali Enclave,Guru Teg Bahadur Public School in Model Town and others have to refund the extra fees with interest to the parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;The committee,therefore,recommends that the schools be directed to refund the increased monthly fee with effect from September 2008 till the date of actual refund along with the interest at the rate of 9 percent per annum. The school should also refund the arrear of fees recovered from the students along with the interest of 9 percent,&#8221; the panel said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the annual fee of the school is increased by about 10 percent every year,there would be a ripple effect in the fee for the years subsequent to 2009-2010&#8230;.,&#8221; the report also said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=996382&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One hundred seventeen medical students,who were granted admission in a private medical college in violation of law,were today directed by the Supreme Court to pay Rs 3 lakh each to the government.</p>
<p>Refusing to cancel their admission which was done in 2008,a bench of justices A K Patnaik and Swatanter Kumar directed the students to pay the amount which would be used for improvement of infrastructure and laboratories in government medical colleges.</p>
<p>The court also directed the Geetanjali Medical College and Hospital in Udaipur in Rajasthan to surrender 107 seats in a phase-wise manner which will be filled up by the students selected through common entrance test conducted by the state government.</p>
<p>&#8220;We,therefore,hold that each of the 117 students who have been admitted in the MBBS seats in the college will pay Rs 3 lakh to the state government on account of their admission in violation of the MCI regulations and the total amount received by the state government from the 117 students will be spent for improvement of infrastructure and laboratories in the government medical colleges of the state and for no other purpose,&#8221; the bench said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The college which was responsible for making the admissions in violation of MCI regulations will surrender 107 MBBS seats to the state government phase wise,not more than 10 in any academic year beginning from the academic year 2012-2013 and these surrendered seats will be filled up by the students selected in RPMT or any other common entrance test conducted by the state government,&#8221; the bench said. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=995477&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sports Minister Ajay Maken Thursday unveiled the exposure draft on National Physical Fitness Programme (NPFP),under which school children across the country will get marks for their physical fitness.</p>
<p>Maken said in order to ensure fitness amongst all school children,a system needs to be put in place that would assess and ascertain a child&#8217;s physical fitness from class V onwards.</p>
<p>Stating that the scheme needs to be motivational rather than coercive,Maken said,&#8221;The achievement of fitness by a child has to be rewarded in a manner similar to reward for academic achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the present proposal,marks and grades are linked to the academic performance and fruits thereof. It is felt that if fitness level is linked to academic excellence,it will</p>
<p>motivate the students and the parents alike,to strive for it.</p>
<p>After a comprehensive exercise,six basic components of physical fitness have been evolved,which are cardio respiratory endurance,muscular strength,muscular endurance,flexibility,explosive strength and body composition (percentage of body fat).</p>
<p>The programme envisages that every school going child studying in class V and above,should be evaluated on the above mentioned six components of physical fitness.</p>
<p>The top 10 percentage of gender wise performers shall be given an additional 3 per cent to the percentage obtained by him/her in academic disciplines.</p>
<p>Subsequently,performers between top 10 to 20 percentage will get additional 2.5 per cent,performers between 20 to 30 percentage will get 2 per cent,between 30 to 40 percentage will get 1.5 per cent and between 40 to 50 percentage will get</p>
<p>additional 1 per cent weightage in their marking,which may be converted into grades as per prevalent norms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim to bring about a change in the attitude among not only the children but general public. The programme can bring about a cultural change,&#8221; said Maken.</p>
<p>The student&#8217;s performance is accordingly graded and fed into the child&#8217;s &#8216;Assessment Card&#8217; and the school&#8217;s &#8216;Fitness Assessment Forms&#8217; as designed by the Lakshmibai National University for Physical Education (LNUPE),Gwalior.</p>
<p>It is proposed that six National Physical Fitness Awards may also be constituted and awarded by the President of India at the Annual National Sports Day function.</p>
<p>The awards may be in the category of Best Performing State,District and School as also for the State,District and School that has improved the most during the last one year.</p>
<p>Maken also said that he would like the programme to act as a talent hunt for youngsters,who could be groomed into future sporting stars of the country.</p>
<p>The draft exposure will be available in public domain for comments and suggestions from general public as well as stake holders for the next 30 days.</p>
<p>Consultations with the State Governments,Ministry of Human Resource Development and other stake holders will be undertaken,thereafter a committee of experts comprising representatives from the field of education,health and sports will be constituted to look into the suggestions and points that emerge out of discussion with stakeholders before it is being finalised.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=995371&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to ensure better health and and promote sports culture among kids,Sports Minister Ajay Maken today came up with a proposal under which school children will get marks for their physical fitness.</p>
<p>Currently marks and grades are linked to academic performance,but the new proposal seeks to give some weightage to physical fitness in schools all over the country.</p>
<p>While unveiling the exposure draft on National Physical Fitness Programme (NPFP),which is at a discussion stage,Maken said in order to ensure fitness among all school children,a system needs to be put in place that would assess and ascertain a child&#8217;s physical fitness from class V onwards.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Haryana government is likely to set up a university on a 215-hectare plot in Sector-68,Gurgaon.  </p>
<p>This is part of the draft development plan for Gurgaon-Manesar Urban Complex-2031 that was approved by the state-level committee of town and country planning at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The Chief Minister was informed about the proposed university and land earmarked for the purpose. </p>
<p>The draft plan for Gurgaon-Manesar was prepared for a projected population of 42.35 lakh by 2031.  </p>
<p>It says the status of about 1,179 hectare situated on the western side of Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway will be changed from industrial to agriculture zone. Any future change in land use for this area will be prohibited. </p>
<p>In Sector-68,about 50 hectare had been added to build affordable homes for low-income and middle-income groups. Moreover,seven new residential sectors,three small commercial belts and two industrial zones will come up in Gurgaon. </p>
<p>Another 50 hectare near Dhankot has been reserved for dairy farming and existing dairies in the city would be moved there.</p>
<p>The peripheral road of Sector 63-A and 67-A has been extended from Sohna road to National Highway-8. The existing Sohna-Gurgaon road will be widened,with a 50-metre green belt on both sides. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With students finding it increasingly difficult to get admission in city colleges due to soaring cut-offs every year,Delhi Government today decided to conduct an &#8220;in-depth study&#8221; to find a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>In a meeting,Higher Education Minister A K Walia instructed top officials of his department to take up the issue seriously so that students seeking admission,particularly in under-graduate courses,could be provided some relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Minister has directed to conduct an in depth study to ascertain the causes of problem and find a way out,&#8221; said a senior official.</p>
<p>Walia,who was given the Higher Education department in the cabinet reshuffle on Monday,specifically tasked Higher Education Secretary Lalmalswama to examine the issue.</p>
<p>The required marks for getting admission into city colleges are soaring high every year,making it difficult for students to get admission,particularly in colleges under Delhi University.</p>
<p>Underlining the need to take short term and long term measures to increase admission opportunities,Walia told the officials to improve infrastructure in certain professional colleges affiliated to the Indraprastha University which is under Delhi Government.</p>
<p>The Minister asked his department prepare a plan foe setting up of an East Campus of Indraprastha University,besides issuing instruction to explore possibility of opening new colleges under Dr Ambedkar University and increasing seats for undergraduate courses in existing departments. &#8220;This will help in addressing the problem,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The Minister said he will soon discuss the issue with Vice Chancellors of all state universities separately. Walia has also instructed the department to come out with an information brochure carrying all relevant information in respect of all state universities and deemed universities.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=994951&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
