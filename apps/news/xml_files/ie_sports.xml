				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Red Bull’s appeal against Daniel Ricciardo’s exclusion from the season-opening Australian Grand Prix will be heard by Formula One’s governing body on April 14, the International Automobile Federation (FIA) said on Friday.</p>
<p>The date of the Paris hearing of the FIA’s International Court of Appeal is the Monday before the Chinese Grand Prix, the fourth round of the season.</p>
<p>Ricciardo was disqualified from second place in his home race in Melbourne last Sunday after stewards ruled that the fuel flow rate in his car had not complied with the regulations.</p>
<p>Red Bull, world champions for the last four years, had argued that the flow meter provided by the governing body was inaccurate.</p>
<p>Should the disqualification be upheld, it will mean McLaren’s Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button are confirmed as the second and third placed finishers behind Mercedes’ race winner Nico Rosberg.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015860&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Masters champion Adam Scott was feeling ill when he arrived at Bay Hill. One majestic round with the putter made him feel a lot better on Thursday. Scott made five putts from about 20 feet or longer, two of them for eagle and one of them from off the green for birdie, and matched the course record with a 10-under 62 to build a four-shot lead in the Arnold Palmer Invitational.</p>
<p>The conditions were close to perfect. So was his work on the greens.</p>
<p>Ryo Ishikawa, who uses Bay Hill as his home course on the East Coast, birdied the 18th for a 65. John Merrick celebrated his 32nd birthday by reaching 8 under until a late bogey. He also shot 65. Both were 10 shots behind before they hit their first shot of the tournament.</p>
<p>Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano had his best round of the year with a 66. Brandt Snedeker and Paul Casey were among those at 67. They were all but forgotten with Scott’s 62 on the board.</p>
<p>Scott’s was the lowest round in 30 years at Bay Hill, and it was good enough to make a large gallery following Scott forget for a moment that defending champion Tiger Woods was absent because of a back injury. Andy Bean in 1981 and Greg Norman in 1984 were the only other players with a 62 at Bay Hill.</p>
<p>After watching Scott make another putt &#8212; this one from 20 feet for eagle on No. 4 &#8212; U.S. Open champion Justin Rose asked if Scott could get to No. 1 if he were to win at Bay Hill. The answer: No and yes. He couldn’t overtake Woods this week, but likely would go to No. 1 over the next few weeks if neither played.</p>
<p>Scott had reason to be mildly surprised by this round. For one thing, he had not been to Bay Hill in five years. Scott typically plays Innisbrook, but decided to mix it up. And he has some experience on the bag as Steve Williams caddied for Woods in six of the eight Bay Hill wins.</p>
<p>Scott said he was also coping with flu-like symptoms. “Just a bit under the weather,” he said. “I can’t complain.”</p>
<p>He is a believer in the adage, “Beware the injured golfer.” He lowered his expectations, concerned himself only with the next shot and was more concerned with his energy than feeling any nerves.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for him to realize it was going to be a special day, starting with a 20-foot birdie putt on the 10th to start his round. He got up and down from a bunker on the par-5 12th for birdie, made a 25-foot birdie putt on the 14th, and then rolled one in from 30 feet on the 15th from a collection area right of the green.<br />
Scott drilled a 7-iron into 35 feet on the par-5 16th and made that birdie. On the front nine, he hit a 3-wood into 20 feet on the par-5 fourth for birdie, and then hit a tough bunker from some 35 yards away to 8 feet for birdie on the par-5 sixth.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015861&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Svidler holds Vishy to draw while Levon catches up with win ahead of top-of-table clash today.<br />
</em></p>
<p>Viswanathan Anand blew his chances of staying in sole lead at the Candidates tournament when Peter Svidler salvaged an extremely uncomfortable Berlin Defence middle game for a draw. The result allowed Levon Aronian, half a point behind the Indian at the start of the seventh round, to catch up at the top of the table with a win over Sergey Karjakin.</p>
<p>Vladimir Kramnik too made up some ground, moving to within half a point of the leaders, but was lucky to come away with a win against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. The Russian appeared to have been heading for certain defeat until a few moves of the game getting over when Mamedyarov blundered away a relatively easy win. Veselin Topalov’s challenge more or less completely fell apart after his second loss in three rounds, this time to the lowest ranked player in the fray, Dmitri Andreikin. At the half-way stage, Anand leads with 4.5 points along with Aronian, while Kramnik is second, half a point behind.</p>
<p>Anand had an encouraging start with black, having Svidler go into a deep think as early as in the 15th move of the game. Anand opted for the Berlin Defence once more, and again, came up with an improvement on existing theory. White’s pawns on d4 and f2 were on their way to become permanent weaknesses amd Anand had the chance to pocket a pawn and force home the advantage with a pair of bishops in a position that was opening up.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage slips</strong></p>
<p>Anand decided to trade his queen for a rook, a minor piece and a pawn, but Svidler used his knight and shattered king side pawns to protect his king and tie down the lose ends in the meanwhile. The players signed the draw after 38 moves.</p>
<p>This was Anand’s fourth draw in a row and in at least two of these games, the Indian had opportunities to convert his advantage to a win. With one more round of games to go against each player, a slip up now will have Anand looking back at the stretch with a bit of disappointment. Still, Anand, the oldest participant in the tournament at 44 is also the only undefeated player. If he can continue his tournament form to get past Aronian in Saturday’s eighth round game without damage, he will have the time to reassess his strategy for the tournament later on.</p>
<p>Aronian simply outplayed Sergey Karjakin with black in another Spanish, not easing his grip on the game for any stretch of play. Karjakin finally gambled, hoping his queen and rook on the last rank would provide him enough play against Aronian’s king to eke out a draw. Aronian had the variation calculated and knew the danger was minimal. The Armenian’s pawns, by then, were too powerful to stop and Karjakin resigned after 53 moves.</p>
<p><strong>Kramnik’s lucky win</strong></p>
<p>Kramnik played a strange old game against Mamedyarov to be initially ahead in the Ragozin variation of the Queen’s Gambit Declined but he worsened his position trying to play aggressively. Mamedyarov, who has turned his tournament form around a bit with two wins in three games after early losses to Anand and Aronian, was holding up well. In a complex middle game, Kramnik had a pawn on c7, a step away from queening, as early as in the 32nd move, but Mamedyarov had enough counter play against the Russian’s exposed king. Soon, Mamedyarov had to defend against two of Kramnik’s pawns on the seventh rank, but he could not spot the right variation that gave him the win. Blundering repeatedly, he allowed Kramnik to promote his pawn and get the win which allowed him to stay in touching distance of the leaders. A loss would have put the Russian a point and a half behind with just seven rounds to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Andreikin came up with interesting moves and maneuvers in the Queen’s Gambit Declined to surprise Topalov who was playing black. An early deviation coupled with trotting his king over to a safe square allowed him to digest a pawn without much difficulty. Topalov resigned in 27 moves.</p>
<p><strong>Round seven results:</strong></p>
<p>Peter Svidler (3.5) drew with Viswanathan Anand (4), Sergey Karjakin (2.5) lost to Levon Aronian (3.5), Dmitri Andreikin (2) bt Veselin Topalov (3), Vladimir Kramnik (3) bt Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (3)</p>
<p>Round eight pairings: Aronian vs Anand, Kramnik vs Andreikin, Svidler vs Karjakin, Topalov vs Mamedyarov.</p>
<p>Standings after round 7: 1-2. Anand, Aronian (4.5), 3. Kramnik (4), 4. Svidler (3.5), 5-7. Topalov, Andreikin, Mamedyarov (3), 8. Karjakin (2.5)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015848&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>QUARTERFINALS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Barcelona vs Atletico</strong><br />
<strong>Real vs Dortmund</strong><br />
<strong>PSG vs Chelsea</strong><br />
<strong>Man United vs Bayern</strong><br />
<strong>To be played on April 1, 2 and April 8, 9.</strong></p>
<p>Manchester United’s already arduous season just got tougher. The English champions were drawn Friday to face Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarterfinals, pitting them against the defending champions and the favorites.</p>
<p>“I was thrilled that we were in the draw. In a lot of ways, it didn’t matter who we drew,” said Manchester United manager David Moyes, who has, personally, led United into the quarterfinals in his first attempt as United manager. “But we have pulled out the favourites.”</p>
<p>In the other quarterfinal pairings, Real Madrid will face Borussia Dortmund in a rematch of last year’s semifinal, Spanish clubs Barcelona and Atletico Madrid will meet for a spot in the next round, and Paris Saint-German will take on 2012 European champions Chelsea.</p>
<p>United and Barcelona will host the opening two matches on April 1, while Madrid and PSG are at home for their first legs on April 2. The return legs will be played on April 8-9.</p>
<p>Five-time champion Bayern will be looking to heap even more pressure on Moyes. United is a disappointing seventh in the Premier League and likely needs to win the Champions League to qualify for next season’s competition.</p>
<p>“Perhaps they are not in the best form, but they are still a top team,” said Bayern winger Arjen Robben, who scored a late goal to eliminate United from the competition at the same stage four years ago. “It’s a good draw, we play away first.”</p>
<p>Bayern, meanwhile, is unbeaten in 50 Bundesliga games under coach Pep Guardiola and leads second-place Dortmund by 23 points.</p>
<p><strong>Madrid vs Dortmund, Again</strong></p>
<p>Dortmund beat Madrid in the semifinals last year before losing to Bayern in the final at Wembley Stadium. But Madrid is unbeaten in 31 games in all competitions, and Cristiano Ronaldo leads the Champions League with 13 goals.</p>
<p>“When you repeatedly make the last eight you have to count on meeting one team often,” Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp said. “It could be an advantage that we first play in Madrid. It’s no time to raise the white flag yet.”</p>
<p>Three Spanish clubs reached the quarterfinals and at least one is guaranteed to play in the semifinals.</p>
<p>Although four-time champion Barcelona has excelled in the Champions League, the Spanish champions have had an irregular season at home and have yet to beat Atletico in three games — all have been draws.</p>
<p>“Being an opponent we know can be helpful or not. There won’t be any surprises,” Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes said. “They are a tough rival. We can’t allow any goals at home.”</p>
<p>For Chelsea, coach Jose Mourinho will need to come up with a strategy to stop Zlatan Ibrahimovic when the English leaders travel across the channel to face French champion PSG in the first leg.</p>
<p>Mourinho led Chelsea against PSG in the tournament’s group stage in 2004-05, when the Blues won 3-0 in Paris before a scoreless draw at home.</p>
<p><strong>Van Persie unlikely</strong></p>
<p><strong>MANCHESTER:</strong> Manchester United says striker Robin van Persie has been ruled out for about four to six weeks with a left knee injury. The Netherlands striker will miss the Champions League quarterfinals against Bayern Munich and could be sidelined for as many as six Premier League matches.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015822&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Arsene Wenger has the chance to ram Jose Mourinho’s words down his throat on Saturday when his Arsenal side travel to Stamford Bridge looking to snatch control of the Premier League title race from Chelsea. There would be no better way for Wenger to mark his 1,000th game in charge of Arsenal than to ruin Mourinho’s unblemished home league record as Chelsea boss after the Portuguese dismissed him as a “specialist in failure” last month. The mind games in this season’s engrossing Premier League title battle have been simmering in the background but it is on the pitch where points are won and lost and the outcome of this Saturday’s lunchtime derby could prove pivotal come May 11.</p>
<p>Chelsea appeared to have taken a vice-like grip in the title race until last weekend’s controversial 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa and wins for chasers Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City squeezed things up at the top of the table. Mourinho’s side still have a four-point lead over Arsenal and Liverpool, although they both have a game more to play, while fourth-placed City are six points back with three games in hand of Chelsea.</p>
<p>City are at home to bottom club Fulham on Saturday while surging Liverpool will be looking for a sixth consecutive victory when they go to a Cardiff City side fighting for survival.</p>
<p>Wenger branded Mourinho’s comments “silly” and “disrespectful” last month after the Portuguese coach had mocked the Frenchman’s eight-season trophy drought. “Am I afraid of failure? He is a specialist in failure. I’m not,” Mourinho said.</p>
<p>Wenger had sparked the exchange when he questioned Mourinho’s motives for saying his Chelsea side were “a little horse” in the title race with Manchester City a “jaguar”.</p>
<p>Arsenal appeared to be slipping out of contention after back-to-back away league defeats, but a grinding 1-0 win at north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur last weekend put them back in the mix for their first title since 2004 — the year Mourinho arrived in London calling himself the Special One.</p>
<p>Victory at Stamford Bridge, where Mourinho has never lost a league game, would put them within a point of the summit with a game in hand.</p>
<p><strong>Liverpool breezing</strong></p>
<p>Liverpool are still on a high after their 3-0 victory at outgoing champions Manchester United last week and will be expected to breeze past a Cardiff side that looks like being relegated after only one season in the top flight.</p>
<p>City’s defence, even without suspended captain Vincent Kompany, should be able to deal with a Fulham side running out of time to escape the relegation zone.<br />
Everton can jump above Tottenham into fifth spot with victory over relegation-threatened Swansea City on Saturday. Seventh-placed Manchester United will visit West Ham United while Tottenham host Southampton on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Hillsborough anniversary</strong></p>
<p>Matches across England will start seven minutes late over the weekend of April 11-14 to mark the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool fans lost their lives. The delay signifies the fact that the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest was abandoned after six minutes, at 3.06pm, following a deadly crush in the Leppings Lane End of Sheffield Wednesday’s ground.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitmishraapppm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015730" alt="Amit Mishra said Mahendra Singh Dhoni's tips were of great help as the skipper has always encouraged him to stay true to his strengths (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/amitmishraapppm.jpg" /></a> Amit Mishra said Mahendra Singh Dhoni&#8217;s tips were of great help as the skipper has always encouraged him to stay true to his strengths (AP)
<p>Leg-spinners might go for runs but that does not deter Amit Mishra from thinking about bowling an attacking line rather than trying to be a restrictive option for his captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not afraid of flighting the ball because I always think about taking wickets and not restricting the batsmen. I believe you can never succeed trying to stop the flow of runs instead of trying to take wickets. If you try to take wickets, you can put pressure on the batsman,&#8221; Mishra told reporters at post-match conference after<strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-live-cricket-score-arch-rivals-clash-in-high-voltage-icc-world-twenty20-opener/" target="_blank"> India thrashed Pakistan by seven wickets</a></strong> in their World Twenty20 campaign opener.</p>
<p>He said that Mahendra Singh Dhoni&#8217;s tips were of great help as the skipper has always encouraged him to stay true to his strengths. <strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-world-twenty20-quick-singles-when-the-toss-was-the-biggest-turn/" target="_blank">(Quick Singles: When the toss was the biggest turn)</a></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The captain (Dhoni) always tells me that I should try to spin the ball as that is my strength. He tells me that I have the ability to beat the batsman in flight. That&#8217;s how I got Ahmed Shehzad and Shoaib Malik out today. In T20 cricket, more variations you have, the more advantageous position you are in,&#8221; said Mishra who was adjudged man-of-the-match for his effort of 2/22.</p>
<p>The Haryana leggie felt staying positive during his prolonged period at the bench helped him perform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was never down on confidence when I was not playing. The key is to remain positive and I tried to shut out negative things. In our team, the good thing is that everyone is told to remain ready as anyone could be called. When you get your chance, you need to grab it with both hands,&#8221; he said.<strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/sports-gallery/icc-world-twenty20-walk-in-the-park-for-ms-dhoni-co/#bhuvneshwarap-2" target="_blank"> (Photos: Walk in the park for MSD &amp; Co.)</a></strong></p>
<p>Mishra said having done well against Pakistan in the last Asia Cup game also helped him a lot. <strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/icc-world-t20/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage: ICC World T20)</a></strong></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always a special feeling to perform against a side like Pakistan. I bowled well against them in the last Asia Cup and that also helped. There is always a pressure of playing against Pakistan but I would never say extra pressure. That is always there when you are representing your country,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He said that during his time at the bench, he has worked really hard to improve upon his fitness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have worked on my fitness during the gym sessions. However I don’t agree with the critics that I am slow through the air. I am still working on my bowling talking to the coaches, captain and the senior players.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mishra has played only two T20 Internationals but has an experience of playing more than 100 (117 T20 matches) in all, with bulk of them coming in the IPL.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, IPL has helped a lot to improve my bowling having competed with the best batsmen in the world. In fact, most of the talent in Indian cricket is coming through IPL as it is providing an ideal platform to the talented players,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015726&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[After getting things right at toss, India exhibited a clinical performance with the ball to outplay Pakistan.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015684&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dhoniapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015718" alt="India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in the ICC World T20 opener on Friday (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dhoniapm.jpg" /></a> India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in the ICC World T20 opener on Friday (AP)
<p>When Mahendra Singh Dhoni flipped the coin in the air, Mohammad Hafeez stood still, may be because of some superstition. He knew the importance of this spin, and didn&#8217;t look a happy man when &#8216;tails&#8217; it was. First, it was India vs Pakistan. Second, the dew was expected to play a role. <strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-pakistan-live-cricket-score-arch-rivals-clash-in-high-voltage-icc-world-twenty20-opener/" target="_blank">(Match Report: Spinners&#8217; day out)</a></strong></p>
<p>Without second thoughts, the Indian skipper asked Hafeez-led unit to bat on a pitch which had plenty of well-rolled dead grass. With three spinners &#8211; Ashwin, Jadeja and Mishra &#8211; in the playing XI,  batting first would have minimised their say on the match.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the case on Friday as MS Dhoni &amp; Co., after getting things right at the toss, exhibited a clinical performance, especially with the ball, to outplay arch-rivals in the ICC World Twenty20 opener. The spinners bowled their heart out, and used the minimal assistance to full effect.<strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/sports-gallery/icc-world-twenty20-walk-in-the-park-for-ms-dhoni-co/" target="_blank"> (PHOTOS: Walk in the park for MSD &amp; Co.)</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mesmerising Mishra</strong></p>
<p>Paucity of genuine leg-spinners comes into light when a four-over spell enthralls the billion viewers glued to the television sets and the many thousands cheering from the stands. The charming run-up, perfect pivot and an effortless release, they are a sight to behold! <strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/icc-world-t20/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage: ICC World T20)</a></strong></p>
<p>With Ashwin and Jadeja bowling in full flow, and Suresh Raina&#8217;s useful contributions in the warm-up fixtures, there were serious doubts on Mishra&#8217;s inclusion in the playing XI on Friday. The 31-year-old&#8217;s outings &#8211; 0/21 against Sri Lanka and 1/38 against England &#8211; in the warm-up leg didn&#8217;t make a good reading either.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mishrain.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2015723" alt="MISHRAIN" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mishrain.jpg?w=480&#038;h=482" width="480" height="482" /></a></p>
<p>In cricket, they say, you&#8217;re as good as you&#8217;re last knock or spell. Dhoni and the team management didn&#8217;t read too much into that and took a huge gamble &#8211; playing three spinners in conditions where dew plays a crucial role. Mishra didn&#8217;t disappoint his skipper as the leggie turned the game with his classical leg-spinners.</p>
<p>The way he beat Ahmed Shehzad in the air was a visual one can watch over and over again. They say only Shane Warne could do that. It is never easy to contain the opposition and pick wickets in this format of the game. Mishra did both as he returned with match winning figures of 2/22 in four overs.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Specialist</strong></p>
<p>Dropped from the ODI squad, Suresh Raina had his task cut out. Perform or perish.</p>
<p>With too many players warming the bench and knocking the door with impressive performances in the domestic circuit, the only way for Raina to re-cement his positions was by contributions in the middle. Impressive outings, both with  bat and ball, in the warm-ups announced Raina back in the scheme of things.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sureshrainaap1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2015724" alt="SureshRainaAP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sureshrainaap1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=516" width="480" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>The shots were coming, the feet were moving and the runs were flowing as the aggressive southpaw grew in confidence with every ball he faced in the middle. Coming into bat after his side was reduced to 65/3, Raina showed no signs of pressure and went about doing his job the way he does &#8211; by scoring brisk runs. A 28-ball 35, including four fours and a six, is only signs of things to come.</p>
<p>Add to this his ability to chip in with the ball and athleticism he exhibits on the field &#8211; he took three catches against Pakistan on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Nerves of steel</strong></p>
<p>Pakistan: 3/47 and India: 3/65. Both sides were in a similar spot of bother during their respective innings. But Pakistan never recovered, and India played with a mature head to seal the rubber in comprehensive fashion.</p>
<p>The way both sides approached the game was probably the difference. Dhoni&#8217;s initial jog to the middle spoke volumes about his readiness for the fixture. The intent was observed in the way he rotated his bowlers and placed attacking fields for them.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hafeezap1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2015725" alt="HafeezAP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hafeezap1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=344" width="480" height="344" /></a></p>
<p>It will be harsh to single out Mohammad Hafeez here as the Pakistan skipper, unlike Dhoni, didn&#8217;t get much support from the experienced campaigners in the unit. 3/47 is a disappointing read, but not something one can&#8217;t recover from. Had they played with a cool mind, they could have got those extra 20 runs to trigger some tension in the Indian dressing room.</p>
<p>No matter how well you bowl, defending a 130-run total requires a special effort with the ball, which doesn&#8217;t happen everyday.</p>
<p>All is still not lost for Pakistan, but they have very little time to recover from this loss, a loss against India.</p>
<p>Hafeez can well try a different posture at the toss as it will continue to have a say in the upcoming games of the 2014 edition.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015684&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/netherlandsapm.jpg" /></a> Netherlands celebrating after registering a stunning win over Ireland. (AP)
<p>The Netherlands qualified for the World Twenty20 main draw following a dramatic six-wicket victory over Ireland in a run-feast featuring a record 30 sixes in Sylhet, Bangladesh on Friday.</p>
<p>Stephan Myburgh and Tom Cooper hit 13 sixes between them as the Dutch chased down a 190-run target in just 13.5 overs to advance ahead of Zimbabwe and the Irish on superior net run rate.</p>
<p>Myburgh (63 off 23 balls) hit seven sixes and four fours and added 91 runs in just six overs for the opening wicket with captain Peter Borren (31 off 15).</p>
<p>The Irish bowlers had no respite despite the departure of Borren and Myburgh in quick succession as Cooper got the Dutch team close with six sixes and one four during a 15-ball 45.</p>
<p>The Dutch power hitting completely overshadowed the Irish pair of Andrew Poynter and Kevin O&#8217;Brien, who smashed 101 in 45 balls for the fourth wicket to take Ireland to 189 for four.</p>
<p>Earlier, Elton Chigumbura&#8217;s 21-ball 53 took Zimbabwe past the United Arab Emirates&#8217; total with 38 balls to spare and five wickets in hand.</p>
<p>Former Zimbabwe captain Chigumbura smashed six boundaries and three sixes to boost his team&#8217;s net run rate above that of Ireland.</p>
<p>Sean Williams took three wickets for 15 runs while Tendai Chatara and Sikandar Raza picked up two wickets apiece to restrict the UAE to 116 for nine wickets in their 20 overs.</p>
<p>All three teams finished with two wins in the qualifying stage but it will be Netherlands who join Sri Lanka, England, New Zealand and South Africa in Group One of the Super 10 stage.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015550&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The pair, now friends, had an intense rivalry as managers and did not speak to each other for five years after a match at Old Trafford in October 2004 ended a record 49 match unbeaten run by Arsenal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate Arsene in reaching this momentous landmark,&#8221; the Scot said in a statement issued on Friday by the League Managers Association ahead of Arsenal&#8217;s Premier League match at leaders Chelsea on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having also reached the same milestone at one club, I cannot emphasise enough the level of dedication, resilience as well as sacrifice required and for that I have for the utmost admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the years we enjoyed some fantastic battles and you could say we had survived together and respected each other&#8217;s efforts to play good football. I always enjoy watching Arsene&#8217;s sides &#8211; Arsenal play the right way,&#8221; added Ferguson.</p>
<p>Ferguson, who retired last year after 26 years at United, said playing against Arsenal always presented special challenges &#8220;that I burned many hours over the years thinking about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the biggest compliment I could give Arsene is that I could never be anything other than competitive with my rival for 17 years,&#8221; added the Scot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall this achievement once again shows what stability can bring to a football club and without doubt he has created a permanent legacy during his 1,000 matches with the club.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wenger, who was presented with a golden cannon by the Gunners on Friday, joins Ferguson as one of just four managers to reach 1,000 games with the same club in English football.</p>
<p>The Frenchman is the North London club&#8217;s most successful manager as well as the longest serving current boss in England.</p>
<p>Ferguson&#8217;s comments will also be welcomed by his successor and fellow-Scot David Moyes, who has come under fire for United&#8217;s poor showing in his first season in charge at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>Champions United are curre</p>

<p>ntly languishing seventh in the league, 18 points behind Chelsea. Arsenal are third, four points off the lead.</p>
<p><strong>Jose Mourinho admires Wenger&#8217;s perseverance</strong></p>
<p>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho took another sly dig at Arsene Wenger on Friday while expressing admiration for a rival he dubbed a &#8220;specialist in failure&#8221; only a month ago.</p>
<p>Speaking ahead of Arsenal&#8217;s visit to Stamford Bridge on Saturday, when their French manager marks his 1,000th game in charge, Mourinho said he would like to emulate Wenger&#8217;s longevity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I admire him and I admire Arsenal,&#8221; the Portuguese told reporters.</p>
<p>Mourinho being Mourinho, he could not resist a sting in the tail to the praise for a manager whose side have not won a trophy since 2005.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not possible to have 1,000 matches unless the club is also a fantastic club in the way they support their manager, especially in the bad moments and especially when the bad moments were quite a lot,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tribute is to say that I believe any one of us (managers) would love to have the same privilege with our clubs. Could I stay for 1,000 games? I would like to, but it&#8217;s very difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s even more difficult in modern football. If I can reach 500 with Chelsea it would be fantastic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mourinho is in his second spell at Chelsea, returning last June after a first stint that began in 2004 and ended in 2007 following a fallout with billionaire Russian owner Roman Abramovich.</p>
<p>In his first stint, the Portuguese won the 2005 and 2006 Premier League titles, the FA Cup in 2007 and the League Cup twice.<br />
Chelsea currently lead the league with a four point advantage over Arsenal and Wenger needs no extra motivation to beat them at Stamford Bridge after dismissing Mourinho&#8217;s comments last month as &#8220;silly&#8221; and &#8220;disrespectful&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015519&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viratkohlirainaapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015666" alt="Chasing a modest total, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina ensured that India reach home without much fuss (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viratkohlirainaapm.jpg" /></a> Chasing a modest total, Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina ensured that India reach home without much fuss (AP)
<p>India put up a thoroughly professional performance to thrash arch-rivals Pakistan by seven wickets in a one-sided opening group league encounter to launch their ICC World Twenty20 campaign in style.</p>
<p>At a packed Sher-e-Bangla Stadium, the Indian spinners did a commendable job in restricting Pakistan to a modest 130 for seven after electing to bowl. <strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/icc-world-t20/" target="_blank">(FULL COVERAGE: ICC World T20)</a></strong></p>
<p>Chasing the target, the Indian batsmen sent the opposition bowlers on a leatherhunt to canter home by seven wickets with nine balls to spare.</p>
<p>India thus maintained their clean slate against Pakistan in World Cup events as this is their fourth victory against the traditional foes in the marquee tournament of shortest versions. <strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/sports-gallery/icc-world-twenty20-walk-in-the-park-for-ms-dhoni-co/#bhuvneshwarap-2" target="_blank">(PHOTOS: Walk in the park for MSD &amp; Co)</a></strong></p>
<p>Two in-form batsmen Virat Kohli (36 not out) and Suresh Raina (35 not out) made useful contributions as they added 66 runs for the unbroken fourth wicket to finish the match in style.</p>
<p>Kohli hit four fours and a six during his 32-ball knock, while Raina&#8217;s runs came off 35 balls with equal number of boundaries and six. <strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/icc-world-twenty20-cant-remember-another-world-cricket-event-as-open-as-this-one/" target="_blank">(Harsha Bhogle: Can’t remember another world cricket event as open as this one)</a></strong></p>
<p>The victory also was a sweet revenge for India&#8217;s last over loss against Pakistan at the same ground in the Asia Cup less than a month ago.</p>
<p>Everything went right for the &#8216;Men In Blue&#8217; as they outbatted, outbowled and out-thought Pakistanis with Dhoni marshalling his resources really well.</p>
<p>After three quite overs, Rohit Sharma (24) decided to attack Junaid Khan as he cleared the short fine leg fielder for a boundary and slashed hard enough over point to get a six. The over got India 12 runs.</p>
<p>Not one to be left behind, Shikhar Dhawan (30), who had by then consumed 15 balls for his five, struck three boundaries. The first was muscled through square leg while the next was a tennis-bat like slap that went past the bowler and the third was a sweep behind square as another 12 runs came from the next over.</p>
<p>The 24 runs from the two overs got India on track and they didn&#8217;t have to look behind after that.</p>
<p>The shot of the match was Rohit lifting Umar Gul over long-on for a six. Ther 50 partnership came off 46 balls after which Dhawan perished.</p>
<p>Dhawan was finally done in by a short delivery from Gul which he tried to hook and the resultant skier was taken at deep fine leg by Saeed Ajmal.</p>
<p>Dhawan&#8217;s dismissal sparked a mini-collapse as trying to cut one from Ajmal that turned sharply from outside Rohit played on to the stumps.</p>
<p>Yuvraj Singh (1) was bowled even before his feet had started moving. The skiddy Bilawal Bhatti got one right in the blockhole as Yuvraj saw his off-stump dislodged before he could bring his bat down.</p>
<p>At 65 for three, Raina and Kohli joined hands. Raina started with a spanking square cut off Bhatti and pulled the bowler in-front of square for another four.</p>
<p>In between Kohli picked up Ajmal to deposit him into the deep mid-wicket stand.</p>
<p>Earlier, Indian spinners performed admirably to restrict Pakistan to the modest total.</p>
<p>India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni&#8217;s decision to field three specialist spinners &#8212; Amit Mishra, Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin &#8212; and bowl first on a slowish track was vindicated as the trio gave away only 63 runs between them in the 12 overs and also removed three Pakistan batsmen, thereby putting brakes on their scoring rate.</p>
<p>Mishra (2/22), Jadeja (1/18) and Ashwin (0/23) all got a bit of help from the track which had a bit of bite and turn on offer.</p>
<p>While Ashwin bowled round the wicket to deny the batsmen any room to chance their arms, Jadeja bowled wicket to wicket with the odd delivery turning away from the right-hander.</p>
<p>Mishra too was bang on target with his flighted leg breaks and varied the length of his deliveries and pace through the air.</p>
<p>Dhoni rotated his bowlers brilliantly not letting the opposition batsmen to get away easily, frequently changing the ends.</p>
<p>For Pakistan, only Umar Akmal looked good during his 30-ball 33-run knock but couldn&#8217;t go on to get a big score.</p>
<p>Kamran Akmal hit a couple boundaries &#8212; one each off Ashwin and medium pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/21) before his partner Ahmed Shehzad&#8217;s indiscretion brought about his downfall.</p>
<p>The call was Shehzad&#8217;s, who came halfway down the track only to retreat back as Akmal couldn&#8217;t make it back to his crease. Bhuvneshwar did well to pick up and throw down the stumps on his follow-through.</p>
<p>Skipper Mohammad Hafeez (15) never looked comfortable during his 22-ball stay at the wicket. He should have been gone for five had his mistimed pull off Mohammed Shami been taken by a diving Yuvraj at deep square leg boundary.</p>
<p>But it did not cost India dearly as Hafeez gave Jadeja the charge only to mistime the shot and give a skier that was pounced well by Bhuvneshwar.</p>
<p>Shehzad (22 off 17 balls) did the initial hard work but Mishra out-thought him with a flighted delivery that turned away after pitching. It was a classical leg-break that drew the batsman forward and beat by flight as Dhoni gleefully whipped off the bails.</p>
<p>Umar Akmal played himself while Shoaib Malik (18) announced his arrival with a huge straight six off Mishra. The duo added 50 runs in seven overs but that certainly wasn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>Malik could have been out on 14 when he pulled an Ashwin carrom ball which Bhuvneshwar diving in-front failed to catch as the ball went past the boundary ropes.</p>
<p>But Mishra had his revenge when Malik was holed out at long-off boundary by Raina.</p>
<p>Umar also followed suit lofting Shami to Raina at long-off. Shahid Afridi&#8217;s (8) hit and miss game didn&#8217;t work as he tried to sweep Bhuvneshwar but gave Raina, his third catch of the day in the deep.</p>
<p>While Sohaib Maqsood hit Shami for a six and four to score a quickfire 21 off 11 balls, it wasn&#8217;t enough for Pakistan to get to a decent score.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015525&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Real Madrid were given a chance to avenge last season&#8217;s Champions League semi-final defeat by Borussia Dortmund when the teams were drawn against each other on Friday in the quarter-finals of this year&#8217;s tournament.</p>
<p>Dortmund, who won the first leg 4-1 on the way to a 4-3 aggregate victory, will visit the Bernabeu for the first leg on April 1/2 with the return a week later.</p>
<p>Titleholders Bayern Munich were paired with Manchester United, a meeting that will inevitably spark memories of their 1999 final when United scored two goals at the death to win 2-1.</p>
<p>Paris St Germain face Chelsea and the remaining tie is an all-Spanish affair between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, the teams&#8217; first-ever meeting in European competition.</p>
<p>Poland forward Robert Lewandowski, who scored all four goals in Dortmund&#8217;s 4-1 win over Real last season, will be suspended for the first match against the nine-times champions.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a big big blow. He is a great player. It was a ridiculous decision,&#8221; said Dortmund CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke after Lewandowski was booked in the second leg against Zenit St Petersburg for handball.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would have liked to get someone else. Real is the world&#8217;s biggest football club. But there is no easy draw here at this stage. We just have to be as best prepared as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take an enormous effort from everyone to do well. Obviously we had a great team (last year) whether or not we can raise the level of our game we will see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bayern, who are on course of a Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup treble for the second season in a row, promised they would not be taking United likely despite their domestic problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should not be blinded by their current position in the league because they have outstanding players,&#8221; said Bayern captain Philipp Lahm.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to perform according to what we can and if we do that we have good chances of reaching the semi-finals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barcelona sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta said in an interview with Spanish television broadcaster Canal Plus: &#8220;Considering the teams that were in the draw I don&#8217;t know if we would swap for anyone else as they would all be very tough ties.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are seeing in La Liga this season that Atletico are one of the strongest teams in Europe right now.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015512&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/andreapirloapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015401" alt="Juventus' Andrea Pirlo celebrates after scoring during an Europa League, round of 16, return-leg soccer  match between Fiorentina and Juventus at the Artemio Franchi stadium (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/andreapirloapm.jpg" /></a> Juventus&#8217; Andrea Pirlo celebrates after scoring during an Europa League, round of 16, return-leg soccer match between Fiorentina and Juventus at the Artemio Franchi stadium (AP)
<p>Andrea Pirlo kept Juventus on course for a home Europa League final after his superb free kick settled their battle with Italian rivals Fiorentina to send the Serie A leaders into the quarter-finals on Thursday.</p>
<p>Pirlo&#8217;s dead-ball accuracy after 71 minutes, which saw him caress the ball high into the far right corner of the net, handed Juve a 1-0 win in Florence and a 2-1 aggregate success over a Fiore side who finished with 10 men.</p>
<p>Juve were joined in the last eight by last season&#8217;s beaten finalists Benfica, Porto, Valencia, Sevilla, Olympique Lyon, FC Basel and AZ Alkmaar.</p>
<p>Benfica survived a spirited fightback by Tottenham Hotspur to earn a 2-2 second-leg draw in Lisbon and go through 5-3 on aggregate while 2011 winners Porto, who sacked coach Paulo Fonseca this month, drew 2-2 at Napoli to win 3-2 on aggregate.</p>
<p>Sevilla overcame city rivals Real Betis 4-3 on penalties, after a 2-2 aggregate draw, while 10-man Basel ended the impressive campaign of Austria&#8217;s Salzburg although their 2-1 away win, after a goalless first leg, was marred by a first-half interruption when Swiss fans threw objects on to the pitch.</p>
<p>This season&#8217;s final will be held at the Juventus stadium in Turin on May 14, which was a huge incentive for the Italian league title holders, but Antonio Conte&#8217;s side needed something special from talisman Pirlo to stay in the competition.</p>
<p>Needing to score after Fiore grabbed an away goal in a 1-1 first-leg draw, Juve were struggling for inspiration at the Stadio Artemio Franchi until Gonzalo Rodriguez was sent off for tripping Fernando Llorente to leave Pirlo with a sight of goal.</p>
<p>The Italy playmaker did not let runaway Serie A leaders Juve down, stroking a superb strike past Neto&#8217;s outstretched hand.<br />
&#8220;We knew that we were going to have to fight for it, and Andrea&#8217;s goal was the crowning glory of a great performance,&#8221; said Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci.</p>
<p><strong>Benfica scare</strong></p>
<p>Benfica, who were 3-1 up from an impressive first-leg win in London, appeared to be cruising through after Ezequiel Garay&#8217;s first-half header but injury-hit Spurs rallied.</p>
<p>Visiting Belgium winger Nacer Chadli&#8217;s quickfire double, a low shot and then a close range finish, left Tottenham a goal away from forcing extra time with 11 minutes left.</p>
<p>The Premier League side had a strong penalty appeal turned down and then in stoppage time Benfica keeper Jan Obrak made a fine save to keep out Gylfi Sigurdsson&#8217;s header.</p>
<p>The Portuguese then won a penalty in the final seconds, which Lima converted to secure a 2-2 draw and extend Benfica&#8217;s unbeaten run at home in European competition to 11 games.</p>
<p>Porto ended Napoli manager Rafael Benitez&#8217;s hopes of leading a side to a second successive final after the Spaniard triumphed in the competition with Chelsea last season.</p>
<p>Napoli had looked the more likely to progress after Goran Pandev&#8217;s 21st-minute goal cancelled out Porto&#8217;s 1-0 first-leg win but the Portuguese side stunned the hosts after the break.</p>
<p>Fine strikes from Algerian substitute Nabil Ghilas and Ricardo Quaresma put Porto 2-1 up with a stoppage-time equaliser from Duvan Zapata proving scant consolation for Napoli.</p>
<p><strong>Sevilla shootout</strong></p>
<p>Sevilla piled on the misery for Real Betis after booking a place in the last eight by winning a tense penalty shootout after goals from Jose Antonio Reyes and Carlos Bacca saw the visitors wipe out a 2-0 first-leg home deficit.</p>
<p>Betis, who are bottom of La Liga and nine points adrift of the safety zone, had the upper hand in the shootout but successive misses by Cedrick Mabwati and Nono condemned the green half of the city to a heart-breaking defeat.</p>
<p>Lyon eased through 5-3 against Viktoria Plzen despite a 2-1 second-leg defeat in the Czech Republic, while a second-half goal from Paco Alcacer earned Valencia a 1-0 win at home to Bulgaria&#8217;s Ludogorets for a comfortable 4-0 aggregate success.</p>
<p>Dutchman Dick Advocaat, who guided Zenit St Petersburg to the 2008 UEFA Cup title, took AZ Alkmaar into the last eight with a goalless draw against Anzhi Makhachkala in Ramenskoye.</p>
<p>Anzhi, propping up the Russian Premier League with one win in 21 games, failed to overturn a 1-0 first-leg deficit. Their frustrations boiled over in stoppage time when Karlen Mkrtchyan was shown a red card for a challenge on Steven Berghuis.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015388&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP) " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/eltonchigumburaapm.jpg" /></a> Elton Chigumbura scripted Zimbabwe&#8217;s victory over UAE with a fine fity. (AP)
<p>Elton Chigumbura struck a fluent half-century as Zimbabwe notched up a five-wicket win over the United Arab Emirates in a qualifying match to keep themselves in the hunt for a place in the ICC World Twenty20 Championships here today.</p>
<p>Set a modest target of 116 after opting to bowl, Zimbabwe lost early wickets before pulling through in the 13.4 overs courtesy a fine effort by Chigumbura, who remained unbeaten on 53.</p>
<p>Chigumbura struck half a dozen fours and three sixes in his fiery knock, which came off just 21 deliveries. The African side needed to win the match in 15.4 overs to go past Ireland in net run rate to remain afloat in Group B.</p>
<p>Chigumbura ensured that the team managed to win it within the stipulated overs. They now have to hope for an Irish loss<br />
to the Netherlands later today.</p>
<p>Right-handed Chigumbura was the undisputed star of the proceedings, rightly fetching the Man of the Match award for<br />
top-scoring in the match.</p>
<p>He got a life in the 12th over when he was dropped by Khurram Khan off medium pacer Manjula Guruge and he capitalised on to it steer Zimbabwe home after a top-order collapse which had reduced them to 34 for four at one stage.</p>
<p>For the UAE, already out of contention for a place in the main draw, Guruge was the most successful bowler, grabbing 2/18 in his economical four overs.</p>
<p>Earlier, the UAE crumbled miserably with wicket-keeper Swapnil Patil 27-ball 30 being the only highlight of their batting effort.</p>
<p>His 58-run stand with Khurram Khan (26) for the third wicket was the lone steady partnership which the UAE innings<br />
witnessed.</p>
<p>Patil struck five boundaries in his knock before being trapped LBW by Sikander Raza, who grabbed two wickets in his three overs which cost merely 15 runs.</p>
<p>The UAE failed miserably to build partnerships after the duo&#8217;s dismissal and could have found themselves folding up for a less-than-100 score had it not been for a couple of entertaining cameos lower down the order.</p>
<p>Kamran Shazad especially stood out with a 15-ball 21 which was laced with a four and a couple of sixes, which came in the final over of the UAE innings.</p>
<p>Left-arm spinner Sean Williams was once again the pick of the Zimbabwean bowlers, snaring three wickets while conceding merely 15 runs in his quota of four overs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2015269&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rvpmreuters.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015248" alt="Robin van Persie scores a penalty against Olympiakos during their Champions League clash. (Reuters) " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rvpmreuters.jpg" /></a> Robin van Persie scores a penalty against Olympiakos during their Champions League clash. (Reuters)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Robin van Persie scored a sensational hat-trick as Manchester United beat Olympiakos 3-0 to progress to the Champions League quarterfinals, while Borussia Dortmund joined them in the last eight in Wednesday’s other match.</span></p>
<p>Under-pressure United manager David Moyes saw his side produce a much-improved performance from Sunday’s 3-0 home defeat to Liverpool, and Van Persie made the difference as the ailing Premier League champions overcame a 2-0 first-leg deficit to go through.</p>
<p>There was less drama in Germany, where last season’s beaten finalists Dortmund lost 2-1 at home to Zenit St Petersburg but progressed 5-4 on aggregate.</p>
<p>United had only previously come back from a first-leg defeat to win a Champions League tie once before, against Roma in the 2007 quarterfinals, and the listless nature of their recent displays would have done little to inspire confidence among the home fans at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>However, a Wayne Rooney header that came back off the post set the tone before the three-time European champions were awarded a penalty midway through the first half when Jose Holebas barged into the back of Van Persie. The Dutchman confidently beat Roberto from the spot, and the Spanish goalkeeper then did well to save from a Patrice Evra header.</p>
<p>Olympiakos, who retained the Greek title at the weekend, remained a threat and United goalkeeper David de Gea made a brilliant double save to deny David Fuster and Chori Dominguez as half-time approached.</p>
<p>United though, levelled the tie on aggregate in first-half stoppage time when Rooney’s low cross was lashed home first-time by Van Persie, and he then scored the decisive third goal, and completed his hat-trick, by curling home a free-kick in the 52nd minute.</p>
<p><strong>Moyes delighted</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Moyes will be delighted that his side held on, although there were plenty of nerves, and Evra picked up a yellow card that rules him out of the first leg of their quarterfinal while Van Persie went off with an injury late on.</p>
<p>“The way the players responded after Sunday’s defeat pleased me. I said to them on Monday morning we had to win 3-0 and give the crowd something back,” Moyes told British Sky television at full-time.</p>
<p>“They deserved it because we’ve not given them much to shout about. The players were incredibly committed. We didn’t play well in Greece but tonight we put it right, and we deserved it,” Moyes added.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a struggle from here, but we’re looking forward to the draw,” he added, before saying that Van Persie’s leg injury did not appear to be anything serious.</p>
<p><strong>DORTMUND LOSE LEWANDOWSKI</strong></p>
<p>At the Westfalenstadion, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missed a glorious chance to put Dortmund in front before Brazilian forward Hulk put Zenit ahead with a trademark 30-yard piledriver that swerved through the air.</p>
<p>Having lost the first leg 4-2 in Russia, Zenit still needed to score twice more without reply to go through, but Jurgen Klopp’s side levelled on the night when captain Sebastian Kehl headed home a Marcel Schmelzer cross before the interval. Substitute Jose Rondon stooped to head home and win the game for Zenit in the second half, and incoming coach Andre Villas-Boas will have drawn much encouragement as he prepares to take the reins in St Petersburg.</p>
<p>Dortmund go through, but they do not appear to pose quite the same threat as 12 months ago, and will have to do without top scorer Robert Lewandowski in the first leg of their quarterfinal due to suspension after he was booked in the first half.</p>
<p>United and Dortmund join reigning champions Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea in the quarterfinal draw, which will be made on Friday at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. The last-eight ties will be played in the beginning of April.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014872&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has written letters to state associations around the country, asking them to include all the IPL-bound players in their respective squads for the annual Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament. The associations, however, have also informed that these players will not be available once the knockout stages get underway. The zonal T20 event has generally been a low-key affair with many of the players involved with IPL franchises giving it a miss and preferring to work on their fitness in the build-up to the blockbuster tourney.</p>
<p>“The BCCI has decided that all IPL players will have to play in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy this time. We have informed the affiliates that no player can skip the zonal T20’s and join a franchise for IPL preparation instead,” BCCI game development manager Ratnakar Shetty informed.</p>
<p>Most of the IPL franchises generally organise their preparatory camps a month before the season begins. With the first 20 games of IPL7 to be held in the UAE, there is a good chance that the teams will be keen on sending their players there early to help them acclimatize with the conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Clash of tourmaments</strong></p>
<p>Previous editions of the Mushtaq Ali Trophy have also had the misfortune of clashing with ongoing IPL seasons, resulting in the tournament’s profile being lowered even further. With that not being the case this year, the BCCI is adamant on ensuring that they have most of the high-profile players on show in this year’s edition.</p>
<p>“The knock-outs will start in the second week of April when most of the IPL players will have to travel to the UAE a week prior to the IPL. So the associations have been told not to pick those players as most of them would have left,” said Shetty.</p>
<p>The board have also revealed that in case Mahendra Singh Dhoni &amp; Co are knocked out of the World T20 at an early stage, it will be up to the respective state associations on whether to pick players from the Indian team presently playing the World T20 in Bangladesh for the Mushtaq Ali Trophy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) has picked veteran pacer Zaheer Khan in their 30-member probables’ list for the zonal T20’s.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014867&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Placed comfortably on top of the table with a half-point lead, five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand will enter the crucial phase of the Candidates chess tournament, taking on Peter Svidler on Friday after the second rest day.</p>
<p>From a great beginning to some cautious play, Anand, with four points from six games, leads his nearest contender Levon Aronian of Armenia by half a point.</p>
<p>It’s a closely-matched field as almost everyone except the lowest seed, Dmitry Andreikin of Russia, seems to be in the race to be the challenger for the next world championship match against Magnus Carlsen to be played later this year. The eight player double-round-robin tournament has seen a lot of excitement. There are no clear favourites as yet but surely, Anand has an edge thanks to his cushion.</p>
<p>The stakes are high as apart from a match against Carlsen, the winner will take home 1,35,000 Euros (a little over Rs 1 crore) as cash prize.</p>
<p>The Russian duo of Vladimir Kramnik and Peter Svidler, Bulgarian Veselin Topalov and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan follow Aronian, a half point behind on three points apiece, and all of them have reasons to fancy their chances as the tournament nears the completion of the first half.</p>
<p>Not far behind is Sergey Karjakin on 2.5 points, who can not only play the spoiler but also has it in him to pull a few victories to match the leaders.</p>
<p>Anand has been leading from day one. It was the day when Anand showed to the world that he is not finished yet. No one could have asked for a better start than a victory over Aronian. A draw with Topalov followed, with the Indian ace in absolute control and the third round saw an inspiring performance when Mamedyarov was crushed in all departments of the game.</p>
<p>Since then, however, Anand has adopted a cautious approach. In the fourth round, Kramnik played the Vienna variation and the Indian would have fancied his chances but the Russian showed better preparation and got an easy draw. Andreikin struggled a little in the fifth round but did not face many difficulties before drawing with the Indian and in the previous round, Sergey Karjakin suffered just momentarily before steering to safety.</p>
<p>If the first three games showed Anand in great spirits, the last three have dampened them a little. And the next two games will be most crucial as Anand meets both, Svidler and Aronian with black in the seventh and eighth rounds respectively. Should he come out unscathed in the next two, Anand will be a huge favourite.</p>
<p>After an insipid start that involved four draws and a loss, Topalov came back with a bang scoring over Kramnik in the previous round. The result changed many equations and Kramnik, who had looked almost invincible thus far, suddenly finds his position vulnerable.</p>
<p>It was a similar story for Svidler who had come up with some sterling chess till the fifth round. Had Svidler been on track, he would have had at least one point more till the fifth round itself. He lost the sixth round against Mamedyarov.</p>
<p>Kramnik crushed Karjakin in round two, missed a winning continuation against Aronian and got the easiest of draws with black against Anand. Things were shaping well till he met Topalov but he will have to do the hard work again.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014847&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>BY : ROELANT OLTMANS</strong></p>
<p>After facing the threat of being axed from the Olympics, it has become necessary for hockey to evolve and move forward with time.</p>
<p>The International Hockey Federation (FIH), on Thursday, introduced some major changes to the game which are aimed at meeting the commercial needs of the game while ensuring its basic nature is not compromised.</p>
<p>With the growing demands of the television producers and keeping in mind the economic interests of hockey itself, these innovations are required.</p>
<p>As we have seen during the Hockey India League, additional breaks provide a broadcaster an opportunity to make some returns on their investments and at the same time, improve the viewer-experience with special analysis programmes. For a game like hockey, that is essential.</p>
<p>The FIH got a new television deal with the same broadcasters recently. It seems they are encouraged by the response received during the HIL and hence have applied the same rules for the game globally. As much as the TV producers, even the hockey family needs the game to be economically viable to sustain itself.</p>
<p><strong>Huge impact</strong></p>
<p>The new format, meanwhile, will certainly have a huge impact on the game. Even though the total playing time has been reduced from 70 minutes to 60, I don’t think there will be much difference in the overall game time.</p>
<p>The 10 minutes less playing time will not be practiced in reality. There will be stoppage time for goals and penalty corners, which will eventually mean that we will end up spending close to 70 minutes on field. Only in situations where there are no goals and penalty corners will we see a match get over in one hour. But that scenario is highly unlikely to arise.</p>
<p>What will happen, though, is that there will be more moments of rest during the game. Due to the physical and quick nature of the game, even the fittest and best players can break down quickly.</p>
<p>The stoppages will give more time to the players to rest which means the top players can play more minutes during a game. That’s one of the biggest positives of the new rules.</p>
<p>Hockey will continue to remain as fast as it is today but you might get to see more tactical variations. The time-outs will give coaches an opportunity to re-strategise and should encourage them to keep their key players on the field for longer duration. That will allow us to see more skillful hockey and in turn raise the quality of the game.</p>
<p>At the moment, I do not see any drawbacks of the new rules. We have seen how successful and viewer-friendly they are during the HIL as well as the European Hockey League.</p>
<p>Even though we have little less time (the other tournaments have each quarter of 17-and-a-half minutes) but overall, it is good for the development of hockey.</p>
<p>World over, the biggest challenge for the sporting bodies has been to strike a balance between meeting the commercial needs and not damaging the game itself. On this occasion, the FIH has found a reasonable way to do that.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hockeym.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015433" alt="The Indian team trains at the Dhyan Chand Stadium in New Delhi ahead of their tour of the Netherlands (Photo: Hockey India)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hockeym.jpg" /></a> The Indian team trains at the Dhyan Chand Stadium in New Delhi ahead of their tour of the Netherlands (Photo: Hockey India)
<p>Hockey’s international body reduced the playing time of matches from 70 to 60 minutes, in a move triggered to accentuate commercial interests but one that could also have far-reaching impact on the tactical aspects of the game.</p>
<p>The International Hockey Federation (FIH) has decided to do away with the traditional format of two 35-minute halves for a more television-friendly format that will have four quarters of 15 minutes each. The FIH’s executive board also announced that there will be a 40-second break after every penalty corner awarded and each goal scored to ensure that the 60 minutes is maximized for actual play.</p>
<p>The new regulations will be applied in a few of the major upcoming tournaments: the Champions Trophy (which will be held in Odisha this December), World League Round 2, World League semifinal and final, all continental Olympic qualifying events as of September 1 this year as well as the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier experiments</strong></p>
<p>The quarter format was first experimented in India almost a decade ago for the Premier Hockey League. It has since been applied for various competitions such as the World Series Hockey, Hockey India League and also the Euro League. The FIH said since the model was tried and tested in these events, they have implemented the new rules directly for the major events. Several other sports such as basketball, American football, netball and even ice-hockey follow the quarter system and the FIH hopes it will help in engaging the viewers better.</p>
<p>After the first and third quarters, each team will have a two-minute break, while the existing 10-minute half time will remain unchanged. The FIH said by introducing the supplementary 40-second time-out rule, it will eliminate time wasting tactics employed by the teams during penalty corner set up and also let the teams enjoy their goal celebrations.</p>
<p>“In the case of a re-awarded penalty corner, time will be immediately stopped but the teams will not be allowed an additional 40 seconds, only enough time to get back into position,” the FIH said in a statement.</p>
<p>“If a team takes longer than the 40 seconds to get set for the initial penalty corner, the guilty player will be given a green card and therefore a two-minute suspension. If the defending goal keeper is the guilty player, the umpire will award a green card to another player in the defensive corner unit.”</p>
<p>Hockey nearly fell out of the Olympic-fold last year for not being innovative enough and its inability to engage a wider audience. The sport’s world governing body, however, has not shied away from experimenting with new rules and formats.</p>
<p>Olympian MM Somaya said the actual match time may not be affected due to the new rules but insisted the pace of the game will increase. “The game will probably be faster. It may not be of advantage or disadvantage to India or any other team in particular. The teams who adapt to the quarter system quickly will have an advantage,” Somaya said.</p>
<p>Former India coach Harendra Singh said the responsibility of coaches will be bigger than before. Harendra, who has guided debutants CAG to the semifinals of the ongoing national championships, also pointed out that the new format should be implemented in the domestic circuit soon.</p>
<p>“It’s an outstanding opportunity to rework and rethink strategies. The coaches will have more time to analyze the proceedings on field more closely and will also have more opportunities to make more tactical changes, almost every 15 minutes,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014833&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[So who is going to win it? I don’t know, I am just going to enjoy the cricket, writes Harsha Bhogle.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014826&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kohlirainaapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015409" alt="On paper, India's batting line-up is as good as any, especially with Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli firing (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kohlirainaapm.jpg" /></a> On paper, India&#8217;s batting line-up is as good as any, especially with Suresh Raina and Virat Kohli firing (AP)
<p>I’m often asked who I think will win the ICC World T20 and I think my answer is the same as that any cricket lover can give. “I don’t know and I can’t tell”. Realistically, any of the six teams can win it, a seventh is a very strong dark horse and the eighth, well it depends on whether they believe they can! I don’t remember being to any world event that is as open as this. It is great news for the youngest form of our sport and, since finance occupies a major part, it is excellent for the networks and advertisers.</p>
<p>The good news is that it is great for the fans too. In the six and a half years since the first World T20 was held (yes that makes it five in that much time!), the game has evolved, skills have improved and since they only need to be on display for at most forty five minutes, teams are much closer than ever before.</p>
<p>India and Australia have probably the best batting line-ups in the tournament and it will be interesting to see if India start briskly. Like the old cars when we were growing up, India tend to take time to hit top speed and that is indicative of a slightly defensive mindset. When you play seven quality batsmen (Jadeja is one in this form), you would like to give two the license to go for it early. I am certain Australia will do that with Warner and Finch but I would like to see India do so with Dhawan and Raina at number three. Yes, it would mean Kohli opens the batting and I do believe he is tailor-made to play that role.</p>
<p>This is also a better fielding side than some others, though it is interesting that the batsmen field far better than the bowlers. It is something that demands attention another day for you would believe the bowlers would be better athletes. Or maybe it is because the batsman need to be really quick over 20 yards and that helps. But India’s problem is not merely how the bowlers field but, rather more worryingly, how they bowl. On the evidence so far, three spinners and two seamers seems the way to go, though the choice of bowlers for the last four overs will occupy Dhoni’s mind more than anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Going against tradition</strong></p>
<p>It is for that reason that not many would be tempted to put India among the top favourites. Yes, the pitches would favour India but the dew is already emerging as a strong counter to teams that are banking on spin bowling. I won’t be surprised if teams reverse the traditional order of bowling and get the spinners first and the quicker bowlers later!</p>
<p>Australia’s batting line up is scary and now, vastly experienced in these conditions. Warner, Finch, Watson, Bailey, Hodge and Faulkner have played a lot of cricket on the sub-continent and Maxwell and Haddin are not short on batting experience either. Each of those eight can be explosive, so can Starc and Coulter-Nile. Expect big scores from Australia, and given that they will always field well, expect them to defend those most days too. If at all there is a weakness here, it is in the quality of spin bowling -though Brad Hogg will blow a fuse if he reads this! Hogg is actually a wonderful choice, as is Hodge because both are very good in the small roles they will be called upon to play.</p>
<p>I believe Pakistan are the other team you will want to watch very closely simply because they are the best bowling side in the tournament. With Ajmal, Afridi and Hafeez, you are almost guaranteed twelve overs of spin and in Junaid, Umar Gul (in his favourite format) and Tanvir, potentially twelve overs of quality quicker bowling. Pakistan have a couple of issues to grapple with, and fielding is top of that list. If Umar Akmal is released from keeping, as he must because elder brother Kamran will play, he will add significantly to the quality in the outfield and Shoaib Malik is probably still better than most others. Ahmad Shahzad completes the trio but you are struggling with the others. The batting has a touch of the unexpected to it as well and if I was Pakistan I would aim for 150, no more, and back my bowlers to defend that most days.</p>
<p>The West Indies complete an extraordinarily tough pool and like with the Aussies, they are no strangers now to these conditions and, if anything, are better equipped now to play on slowish wickets. The return of Dwayne Smith is a belated show of selectorial judgement and him and Gayle are an awesome pair. And with the all-round abilities of Bravo, Samuels and Sammy, they always seem to have a bowler extra. I am surprised they have left out Kevon Cooper and Jason Holder but Santokie and Badree are probably the horses for courses bowlers.</p>
<p>South Africa have been going under the radar a bit but du Plessis, Miller and de Villiers are all matchwinners; de Kock is a star in the making and Duminy is just the all-rounder they could be looking for. Phangiso is a good spinner and quick bowling has never been an issue; and it helps that two of them, Albie Morkel and Parnell, are fine strikers of the ball. Can a team of Amla, de Kock, du Plessis, de Villiers, Duminy, Miller, Morkel, Parnell, Steyn, Phangiso and Morkel win it? It will be a tough call to say they can’t!</p>
<p><strong>Little to fuss about</strong></p>
<p>There is a noticeable lack of fuss around Sri Lanka too but I believe 50 overs is their stronger format especially for players like Jayawardene and Sangakkara. Dilshan is not getting younger and Chandimal hasn’t really announced himself yet. I suspect bowling is their stronger suit and opponents are always recalibrating their targets when Malinga has two overs left. Those two should be favourites to qualify from their group.</p>
<p>That leaves a strong dark horse in New Zealand and a rather under-rated team in England. If the pitches are good, New Zealand present a daunting batting line up with Guptill, McCullum, and Taylor followed by the most versatile lower order in Munro, Anderson, Ronchi and Neesham. Spin bowling could be a weakness and indeed, playing it could be too and dare I say the flatter the tracks the better New Zealand will look.</p>
<p>In 2012 in Sri Lanka, England put up the most woeful performances against spin and seem to have struggled in the West Indies as well. That might be a big factor though it might favour them to be as low key as they are. I don’t think teams are losing sleep playing England though and the only surprise this World T20 can throw up is if they win it.</p>
<p>I am expecting a great tournament though I hope the pitches are good enough given the amount of action they have had, especially at Mirpur. And I do wish the effect of the dew gets minimal as we go along. You can argue it is the same for both teams for the evening games but it is not a factor that is good for the game.</p>
<p>So who is going to win it? I don’t know, I am just going to enjoy the cricket!</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014826&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hongkongbangladeshapm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015220" alt="Bangladesh lost to Hong Kong for the first time on Thursday but qualified for the World T20 main draw on run rate." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hongkongbangladeshapm1.jpg" /></a> Bangladesh lost to Hong Kong for the first time on Thursday but qualified for the World T20 main draw on run rate. (AP)
<p>Bangladesh, unbeaten in the group stage and expected to romp past winless Hong Kong, were dismissed for 108 in 16.3 overs. Hong Kong then had to reach the winning target within 14 overs to ruin the party for the tournament host and help Nepal advance instead.</p>
<p>But Hong Kong also struggled to score and didn’t earn its maiden World T20 victory until the last over, with two wickets and two balls left, Haseeb Amazad hitting the historic winning runs with a six over extra cover off Abdur Razzak. Bangladesh moved into Group 2 of the Super 10 with India, Pakistan, Australia and the West Indies. The host’s first match is against the West Indies on Tuesday.</p>
<p>For Hong Kong, spinner Nadeem Ahmed claimed 4-21, legspinner Nizakat Khan had figures of 3-19, and medium pacer Tanwir Afzal took 2-24, starting the rout of Bangladesh with both wickets in the first over. Shakib Al Hasan top-scored with 34, his dismissal sparking Bangladesh’s collapse from 85-3.</p>
<p>Shakib then boosted his side with his left-arm spin, taking 3-9 in four overs to slow down Hong Kong and dash Nepal’s hopes. Opener Irfan Ahmed put Bangladesh’s aspirations in jeopardy with three sixes and three boundaries but Shakib produce a gem that spun viciously to trap Ahmed lbw, out for 34 off 28 balls.</p>
<p>Mahmudullah joined Shakib in frustrating Hong Kong further but Munir Dar rose to the occasion. He ripped 36 off 28, including three fours and one six, although Bangladesh had already qualified by then.</p>
<p><strong>BRIEF SCORES:</strong></p>
<p>Bangladesh 108 all out in 16.3 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 34, Anamul Haque 26; Nadeem Ahmed 4/21, Nizakat Khan 3/19) lost to Hong Kong 114/8 in 19.4 overs (Munir Dar 36, Irfan Ahmed 34; Shakib Al Hasan 3/9, Mahmudullah 2/13) by two wickets.</p>
<p><strong>All important Mukhiya</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Subash Khakurel smashed a fine half-century to help underdogs Nepal beat Afghanistan by nine runs in their final  Group A qualifying match and register their second win in the ICC World T20.</p>
<p>The win kept Nepal’s slim hopes of qualifying for the Super-10. Nepal, who have two wins from three matches, are second in the table behind Bangladesh, who take on Hong Kong in their last qualification-round fixture later in the day. Put into bat, Nepal posted a challenging 141 for five in 20 overs before their bowlers rattled the Afghan top-order to restrict them to 132 for nine.</p>
<p>Opener Khakurel made 56 off 53 balls and shared a 76-run stand in 9.1 overs with Sharad Vesawkar (37) for the fourth-wicket to put up a fighting total. Medium-pacer Jitendra Mukhiya (3/18) was pick of the bowlers for Nepal as he bowled four economical overs that included three wickets.</p>
<p>Sompal Kami (2/32) and Shakti Gauchan (2/25) were also instrumental in pegging back the Afghans. Afghanistan were tottering at 50 for five in nine overs before Shafiqullah (36 off 32) and Asghar Stanikzai (49 off 36) raised hopes of overhauling the target.</p>
<p>But regular strikes from bowlers never allowed the game to slip away from Nepal. Stanikzai smashed four boundaries and a six in a late blitz, including three fours in the final over, but the effort wasn’t enough to take Afghanistan home.</p>
<p>Nepal had earlier defeated Hong Kong and now have one more important scalp in their emerging international career.</p>
<p><strong>BRIEF SCORES:</strong></p>
<p>Nepal 141/5 in 20 overs (S Khakurel 56, S Vesawkar 37; S Zadran 2-19, M Ashraf 1-14) bt Afghanistan 132/8 (A Stanikzai 49, Shafiqullah 36; J Mukhiya 3-18, S Gauchan 2-25) by nine runs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014827&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Remember those days, of Venkatesh Prasad and Sachin Tendulkar (on separate occasions) mouthing expletives and showing batsmen Aamir Sohail and Saqlain Mushtaq the way to the dressing room? Remember those days when an India-Pakistan World Cup match was played out in shivering England even as the countries were hot at war?</p>
<p>Those days, according to the current day captains of the two sides, MS Dhoni and Mohammad Hafeez, is nothing more than a distant memory. Dhoni, in fact, believes that the rivalry has lost its cut-throat nature, obviously for the better.</p>
<p>“I believe it has mellowed down over the years. Nowadays, you won’t find altercations like it used to happen when the players of the last generation played,” Dhoni said a day before the clash. “We used to get tense watching those matches on TV when we were young. There used to be plenty of action happening apart from cricket. It’s good it’s not happening nowadays. You don’t want to cross the line,” he said.</p>
<p>Hafeez was asked what he felt about the Pakistan fans who want his team to beat India more than winning the trophy. “It’s great to know the expectations of the fans but we would like to win the World T20 trophy,” said Hafeez with a smile. “But for that we need to start well and win tomorrow’s match.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014820&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afrididhoniapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2015418" alt="Tunnel vision: The last time India met Pakistan, in the Asia Cup earlier this month, Shahid Afridi turned the match around with the bat in the final over.

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Mohammed Bashir has made the trip to Mirpur from half-way across the globe. </span>The one-time Karachi resident, who looks much older than his 59 years, runs a biryani joint in Chicago along with his wife who was born in Hyderabad, India. Bashir is a cricket tragic and a heart patient, plus he has a  weakness for India-Pakistan games. Three years back he was at Mohali to watch the World Cup semi-final between his two favourite teams. That was when he suffered a stroke, his third. He spent three days in the Intensive Care Unit but that didn’t stop him from giving up on being a traveling fan. Such is the pull of the India-Pakistan game.</p>
<p>Regardless of where these big ticket ICC events are held, the India-Pakistan game is always the most anticipated contest. Tickets of these games get snapped up within minutes of the online sales opening and as the D-Day nears the locals too get sucked into the hype around the games. This World T20 tournament is no different.</p>
<p>Along with the fans in green and blue, who have flown in from around the world, the Bangladesh cricket enthusiasts too will be trooping in to watch the traditional rivals cross swords once again. It doesn’t come as a surprise that the ICC event managers picked this sell-out match to kick-off the second phase of the tournament, the one that will see the big boys enter the field.</p>
<p>Though, the ‘war without guns’ phase of this once fierce, and at times ugly, cricketing rivalry is a thing of the past but still the fans, and the media too, expect some kind of aggressive posturing from the two set of players. Minutes after Pakistan middle-order batsman Umar Akmal landed in Dhaka, he faced a steady stream of questions from the media about the game against India that was nearly a week away. “India-Pakistan ke alawa aur koi sawal hai?” he finally asked with an expression of exasperation.</p>
<p><strong>Jinx talk again</strong></p>
<p>But there are some, like opener Ahmed Shahzad, who willingly add a bit of spice to the contest. “Hara denge hum. Is baar badal denge. (This time we will beat them),” he says while talking about the old jinx of Pakistan losing to India in ICC events. Maybe, Shahzad’s confidence comes from Pakistan’s recent win over India in the recently concluded Asia Cup. But World Cups and World T20s have been a different story as India enjoy an 8-0 streak.</p>
<p>Fans from Pakistan, who were at Durban, Johannesburg, Colombo — the three venues where both the teams have met in the World T20 — or at Sydney, Bangalore, Manchester, Centurion and Mohali for the 50-over Cup, will be hoping that there is a change in fortune.</p>
<p>Over the years players have changed but, interestingly, the template of the sides haven’t. Like always this Indo-Pak game too is likely to be decided by India’s batsmen or Pakistan’s bowlers. A line-up that contains Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni will worry any bowling line-up in the world. Or maybe not. That in case if you have the likes of Umar Gul, Sohail Tanveer, Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi and Junaid Khan in your ranks.</p>
<p><strong>Pressure games</strong></p>
<p>Most of these pressure games are generally won by the team that keeps its cool. The last time when the two teams met &#8211; in the Asia Cup at the same venue &#8211; it all boiled to the last over. Ravichandran Ashwin had the ball in hand and in front of him was Aridi, who was wildly swinging his bat. The six with which the Pakistan old hand sealed the game barely cleared the rope. Had the shot been an inch shorter, the result would have been different. In that case it would have been Ashwin, and not Afridi,  who would be beaming.<br />
It this unpredictability that sees fans like Bashir travel miles to see an India-Pakistan game.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014811&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/msdhonim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009040" alt="Mahendra Singh Dhoni was non-committal on sending Ajinkya Rahane up the order (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/msdhonim.jpg" /></a> Mahendra Singh Dhoni was non-committal on sending Ajinkya Rahane up the order (File)
<p>Underlining his bowling concerns, India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said they need to bowl well at the death and hoped that batsmen would give the bowlers more than the par score on board.</p>
<p>India will begin their ICC World T20 campaign against arch-rivals Pakistan in Mirpur on Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bowling is an area of concern compared to batting. Getting off to a good start is important as it will help us get 10 to 15 runs more than the par-score. Our aim will be to do well in death bowling and also bat well and we will have a good chance (in the tournament),&#8221; Dhoni said on the eve of the opening group league match.</p>
<p>He said the likes Mohammed Shami and Bhuvneshwar have not played a lot of T20 Internationals but the IPL experience will<br />
certainly come in handy for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed they haven&#8217;t played a lot of T20 International cricket but the experience in IPL will help them a lot. We<br />
would want the bowlers to get one or two wickets with the new ball, their job will be much easier,&#8221; Dhoni said.</p>
<p>While he was happy about Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina’s performance, he was non-committal on sending Ajinkya Rahane up the order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, we have achieved a lot during the two practice games. The idea was to give the guys some fair time in the middle. Yuvi and Raina contributed in bowling.&#8221;</p>
<p>About Rahane opening, he said, &#8220;That&#8217;s under consideration. You will have to wait and watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>The skipper agreed that presence of a few genuine all-rounders in the Pakistan team would help the rivals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Playing proper all-rounders always adds to the strength of a side. If you have players who are equally capable with bat and ball, one can play more than five bowlers and still have the same batting strength,&#8221; the Indian captain opined.</p>
<p>Among the rival bowlers, pacer Umar Gul and wily spinner Saeed Ajmal came in for special praise from the Indian<br />
captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Umar Gul is a fantastic bowler. I remember during the 2007 ICC World T20, he would be introduced in the 11th or 12th over and bowl till the end. Having said that, they have other fast bowlers also, who are equally dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dhoni conceded that it is difficult to score freely against mystery spinner Saeed Ajmal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ajmal is a bowler against whom you can never score freely. It&#8217;s also the manner how they have used him (Ajmal) to stop batsmen from scoring runs in the slog overs. They gave him an over in the first six (Powerplay) and then couple of overs in the middle. If you see on an average, all countries have had difficulties in facing Ajmal,&#8221; Dhoni explained.</p>
<p>Having been clubbed with Pakistan, West Indies and Australia in the group makes an even tougher challenge and the skipper wants to win each and every game in order to ensure a smooth passage to the last four.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to do well in each and every match. If you look at the last World T20 in Sri Lanka, we lost one match (vs Australia) and were knocked out of the tournament. It is a tough group. Also you have to realize that in this format, the difference between a good team and a not so good team is very less. I believe even they have the talent to upset big sides. It depends on what kind of cricket you play on that particular day,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>However the captain said that Afridi&#8217;s innings in the Asia Cup will have a very little bearing on Friday&#8217;s match.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was a mono-syllabic reply to the question on Afridi.</p>
<p>When someone queried as to what exactly he was doing when Afridi hit the winning six off Ashwin’s bowling, Dhoni smiled and replied, &#8220;I was watching (the match) on television. Initially, I thought that the ball was going to the fielder but then I saw that it went for a six. It was an exciting match.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a roundabout manner, a scribe queried if it’s difficult for him to focus on his game considering what all is happening around him, he smilingly counter-questioned, &#8220;What all is happening around me? You tell me! Well, there’s plenty that goes around you and irrespective of that you have to focus on your job. These things are a part and parcel of the game,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014560&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Fierce, lethal, intimidating, unremitting, intense &#8211; these are a few adjectives that aptly describe the atmosphere in an India &#8211; Pakistan cricket match. Every time India takes on Pakistan, stadiums transform into Colosseums as fans erupt in cacophonous uproars and players transcend to gladiatorial heights of cricketing frenzy.</span></p>
<p>Now in its fifth edition, the ICC World Twenty20 2014 is expected to smash all records of television viewership with the forthcoming group 2 match between India and Pakistan. Given their impeccable record against Pakistan in previous Twenty20 world cup encounters &#8211; a 100% win record in the three matches played between 2007-2012 &#8211; India hold slight edge in Friday&#8217;s game at Dhaka. However, fans and connoisseurs of Indian cricket would be wary of the team&#8217;s wobbly form and recent last-over loss against their rivals in the nail-biting Asia Cup match. On the other hand, Pakistan would be waiting with baited breath to register their first Twenty20 World Cup victory against India.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Players to Watch Out For</strong></p>
<p>All eyes will be set on the performances of India&#8217;s batting behemoths &#8211; Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni &#8211; who have often waded their team out of calamitous situations in recent times. Besides them, India would also look to bank on the all-round services of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. Although their collective performances have been fairly inconsistent in recent history, Dhoni would look to attack Pakistan on the their weakest area &#8211; batting &#8211; with the spin twins.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Virat Kohli</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Much has been said about the rise of Virat Kohli as the world&#8217;s most exciting young batsman. His exemplary consistency and aggressive temperament is best suited for the shortest format of the game. Kohli&#8217;s batting oozes class and suaveness. His recent innings of 74 not-out in Wednesday&#8217;s practice match against England highlighted his clinical ability to score runs at a brisk pace without entering the archetypal slam-bang mode that this format is reckoned for. With an impressive strike-rate of 130.44, K0hli is expected to bludgeon and pillage bowling attacks in the ongoing world cup. Pakistani pacers and spinners need to rethink their strategies if they expect to curb Kohli&#8217;s run-scoring in Friday&#8217;s game.</p>
<p><strong>Ravichandran Ashwin </strong></p>
<p>R. Ashwin seems to have  found his length in familiar territory. After struggling during India&#8217;s overseas tours, the offie exhibited encouraging performances in the Asia Cup, and the two warm-up fixtures. His bowling repertoire, which includes a lot of variety, can be a big asset for India in their campaign. Furthermore, he can chip in with the bat too. With some extra inches, the right-hander can negate the Pakistan speedsters.</p>
<p><strong>Pakistan </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mohammad Hafeez  </strong></p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s search for  a batting all-rounder ended with Hafeez&#8217;s successful transformation into a genuine off-break bowler. His ingenious ability to bowl in tight areas with the new ball has often troubled batsmen in the shorter formats of the game. Not to forget, the 33-year-old can score at a brisk pace at the top of the order.</p>
<p><strong>Shahid Afridi </strong></p>
<p>India is one team which brings the best out of this all-rounder. Renowned for his herculean hitting and aggressive temperament, Shahid Afridi is a valuable asset for Pakistan, especially in this format. The way he turned matches, with the bat, in the Asia Cup spoke volumes about his batting credentials &#8211; something which is not talked about that often. The T20 format is tailor-made for somebody like Afridi who prefers striking the ball clean instead of staying at the crease and rotating the strike. He hits at least one four everytime he takes the crease.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014345&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Borussia Dortmund reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the second successive season on Wednesday, surviving a 2-1 second-leg defeat by a spirited Zenit St Petersburg to go through 5-4 on aggregate.</p>
<p>Dortmund, last year&#8217;s runners-up who won 4-2 in Russia in the first leg, were far from their best and fell a goal behind when Hulk thundered Zenit into the lead with an unstoppable long-range effort in the 16th minute.</p>
<p>Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl settled the hosts&#8217; nerves when he headed in the equaliser in the 38th minute before the visitors retook the lead in the 72nd through substitute Jose Rondon&#8217;s diving header.</p>
<p>Dortmund held on in a scrappy finale and the 2-1 defeat was enough to send them into the last eight as the second German team along with Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>They were dealt a blow however as defender Marcel Schmelzer suffered a suspected groin injury that could see him join their already long injury list.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zenit had to come forward and they have such quality in attack,&#8221; Kehl told reporters. &#8220;We did not have our best match today but we can leave here with a big smile on our face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet Kehl said he was unhappy with the atmosphere in the stadium and questioned what team mate Kevin Grosskreutz called &#8220;moaning fans&#8221; who had come seemingly expecting a rout.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found this atmosphere in the stadium a bit depressing. Maybe they wanted to see a 6-1 win but that does not happen every day,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had a lot of injuries this season but this result shows we are well prepared. So the season is not that bad as some make it out to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a lively start to the game, Dortmund, who had won eight of their last nine Champions League home matches, came close in the fifth minute but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang&#8217;s header sailed narrowly wide.</p>
<p><strong>Thundering drive</strong></p>
<p>Zenit, who sacked coach Luciano Spalletti after a run of one win in 12 competitive matches and will be managed by Andre Villas-Boas from Thursday, responded a minute later with an Axel Witsel shot that forced keeper Weidenfeller to save at full-stretch.</p>
<p>Brazil international Hulk did better with a thundering left-foot drive from 25 metres that left Germany international Weidenfeller with no chance and gave caretaker coach Sergei Semak something to smile about in his last match in charge.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were fresh, they took risks because they had to and we had to put a huge amount of work into it,&#8221; said Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not communicate at times. There was nervousness, you could see it. That is why we deserved to go through. The players battled extremely hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dortmund, missing the pace of Reus in attack, were dealt a further blow when striker Robert Lewandowski was booked for a hand ball, ruling him out through suspension from the quarter-final first leg.</p>
<p>It took time for them to recover but not before Oleg Shatov threatened Dortmund again with a low drive.</p>
<p>It was the Germans who scored before the break, however, with Kehl rising high above defender Domenico Criscito to head in a perfect Marcel Schmelzer cross from the left.</p>
<p>The goal meant Zenit needed another three to advance and the pressure told in the second half with Dortmund controlling the tempo.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a huge job for us to come here and score three goals and unfortunately we could not do it,&#8221; said Zenit coach Semak. &#8220;I must congratulate my team on a good performance, the boys did the best they could do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zenit struck against the run of play when Rondon silenced the home crowd in the 72nd minute but it was too little too late as the Russian side crashed out after only their second win in the competition this season.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014385&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/msdhoniireutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014380" alt="Misbah pointed out that Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a terrific T20 cricketer (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/msdhoniireutersm.jpg" /></a> Misbah pointed out that Mahendra Singh Dhoni is a terrific T20 cricketer (Reuters)
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s Test and ODI captain Misbah-ul-Haq has warned his teammates to be wary of traditional rivals India, who he feels will be a different side after the return of Mahendra Singh Dhoni.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dhoni is a big stabilising force for India and his return means that Pakistan will have to work much harder to get that win over India,&#8221; he told reporters in Lahore.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan will lock horns in a marquee clash of the ICC World Twenty20 in Mirpur on Friday.</p>
<p>Misbah said it will be a completely new game on Friday irrespective of the fact that Pakistan had defeated India in the Asia Cup recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t read much into India&#8217;s results in the Asia Cup because T20 is a different format and requires a different approach. Dhoni&#8217;s return is a big boost for them as he has lot of experience and has led them wisely. He knows how to get the best out of his players,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Misbah pointed out that Dhoni himself is a terrific T20 cricketer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Pakistan will need to focus a lot more on team work than individual performances to beat India after Dhoni&#8217;s return. The good thing is that the conditions in Bangladesh are good for the Pakistani batsmen and they should be comfortable batting first or even chasing,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Misbah said the current edition of the World T20 was going to be a tough task for Pakistan since other teams had also now come well prepared for the competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both Australia and West Indies are going to be tough for Pakistan and India in the group stages but the good thing about our team is that once we get going and the confidence flows, Pakistan can beat anyone in the world,&#8221; he stated.</p>
<p>Misbah was sidelined from the T20 format by the Pakistan board in 2012 and was replaced by Mohammad Hafeez as captain but he had continued to play in the format at domestic level and done well.</p>
<p>Misbah, 39, said many of the players of other teams were also in their thirties or older and this just showed that now T20 cricket was not all about youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I still enjoying playing T20 cricket and I will continue doing so at the domestic level but from here I can only wish<br />
Pakistan team best of luck,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014373&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/hafeeznewm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1951616" alt="Mohammad Hafeez has scored three centuries in the first four one-day matches against Sri Lanka (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/hafeeznewm.jpg" /></a> Mohammad Hafeez-led Pakistan will take on India in the ICC World Twenty20 opener on Friday (AP)
<p>India haven’t exactly done well in the Powerplay overs but the Pakistan captain refused to read into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Statistics like these can help, but on the day, you need to execute your plans. It also helps that we have played a lot of matches in Bangladesh. We have won the Asia Cup over here and are aware about the conditions. But similarly, the Indian team also has a lot of experience in these conditions,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>While there were reports of rift between Hafeez and some other members of the team management, the skipper rubbished the rumours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any decision that we take is a team decision. We have one aim and that is to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>The skipper was ecstatic about how senior speedster Umar Gul has worked on his fitness and is looking sharp as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been an outstanding comeback by Umar Gul. He has done a lot of hardwork to get his rhythm back. He is our No 1 pacer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hafeez is confident that youngsters such as Ahmed Shehzad and Umar Akmal will play for Pakistan for a long time as they have the talent to be consistently successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Umar and Shehzad have played a lot of cricket together from the U-19 days. There are four-five boys who are really talented. There&#8217;s Umar Amin, Sohaib Maqsood who are also very talented and will only get better day by day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pakistan were bundled out for 71 in the final warm-up game against South Africa in Fatullah, yesterday but Hafeez is not really worried about the performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some players needed to be given a chance,” was his answer. The skipper is also of the opinion that the best XI players should play and that&#8217;s the reason he is ready to do away with Sharjeel Khan-Ahmed Shehzad opening combination after Kamran Akmal scored 52 runs in the first warm-up game against New Zealand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always believed that the in-form players should play&#8221;, Hafeez signed-off.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014160&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/davidmoyesmreuters2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014127" alt="Under fire Moyes hands Manchester United an inspiring victory against Greek giants Olympiakos in Wednesday's Champions League clash." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/davidmoyesmreuters2.jpg" /></a> Under fire Moyes breaths a sigh of relief as Manchester United defeat Olympiakos in their Champions League clash on Wednesday.  (Reuters) 
<p>Manchester United kept their season alive by reaching the Champions League quarter-finals with a memorable victory over Olympiakos Piraeus on Wednesday, but under-pressure manager David Moyes was not getting too carried away.</p>
<p>United have endured a miserable first season under the Scot who was hand-picked by his predecessor Alex Ferguson to succeed him when he retired after 26 years in charge at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s 3-0 victory over the Greek champions, which gave United a 3-2 aggregate success and a place in the last eight, was in marked contrast to their dismal display when they lost 3-0 at home to Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I am not going to say is that this result is the start of a change in our fortunes, though I hope it is,&#8221; Moyes told a news conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;There have been a few false starts already this season and while this is a really good result and a really important win I cannot say that everything will change now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a big job to do here, a lot of changes and it will take time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Liverpool result left United in seventh place in the table, 18 points behind leaders Chelsea and 12 adrift of Manchester City who occupy the fourth Champions League spot.</p>
<p>Unless they win the Champions League, their only realistic chance of European competition next season is in the second-tier Europa League.</p>
<p>Wednesday&#8217;s win kept them in with a chance of lifting the European Cup for the fourth time, but it appears to be a slim one with the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Chelsea looking far more likely winners on current form.</p>
<p>Moyes was keeping his feet firmly on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might not be favourites to win the Champions League this season but if we go into the quarter-finals as underdogs that&#8217;s fine by me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this squad this club can be more than a match for anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one thing that is sure is that if United had gone out to Olympiakos the pressure on Moyes would have been even greater than it has been over the last few months.</p>
<p>They have suffered a series of ignominious home defeats and the performance against Liverpool was probably their worst of the season.</p>
<p>It might not have been a vintage display against Olympiakos but it was the first time in 30 years they have overcome a two-goal first-leg deficit to win a European tie.</p>
<p>Striker Robin van Persie, who has often looked listless this season, showed just why United paid Arsenal 24 million pounds ($40 million) for him two years ago with a coolly taken hat-trick.</p>
<p>United return to league action on Saturday when they visit one of their least popular grounds in West Ham&#8217;s Upton Park.</p>
<p>A good result there and victory over neighbours Manchester City next Tuesday and perhaps Moyes might start to believe that the season really is beginning to turn around.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014092&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)
<p>Ryan Giggs rolled back the years with an inspirational display to lead Manchester United into the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday, becoming the oldest outfield player to take part in the competition&#8217;s knockout stages.</p>
<p>Handed his first start in 11 games, the 40-year-old was central to all that was good in United&#8217;s play and he provided key passes to set up the opening two goals in a 3-0 win over Olympiakos that took United into the last eight.</p>
<p>Giggs, making his 140th Champions League appearance, is second behind former Real Madrid striker Raul, on 142, in games played in the competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I looked at the appearances in the programme before the game,&#8221; United manager David Moyes told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s incredible the amount of games he has played. I thought Giggsy was fantastic, he really was. The passes he made for the two goals and his general play.</p>
<p>&#8220;More importantly his general fitness. You think sometimes that he&#8217;d need to come off after 60 minutes but he&#8217;s a freak he really is. He&#8217;s something different.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the latter stages of his career Giggs has been transformed from a pacy winger to a central midfielder. Although the trademark speed has all but disappeared, he is still able to have a major influence in the most important games by virtue of his tactical nous and awareness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just felt after the result to Liverpool I needed him to play a particular role in the centre of midfield for me which he knows and understands and he carried it out perfectly,&#8221; Moyes said.</p>
<p>One of the only positives in what has been a poor season at Old Trafford has been the emergence of 19-year-old winger Adnan Januzaj and Moyes conceded that the need to identify Giggs&#8217;s long-term successor was the reason behind the veteran&#8217;s lack of recent playing time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to look to see what the others can do. Ryan Giggs is not going to go on forever, we know that,&#8221; he said.<br />
&#8220;So we have to look to find the new Ryan Giggs. It was a big night, we needed it off the back of a bad result and I thought we needed his experience tonight and he certainly showed it.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014042&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rvprooneyapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014024" alt="Manchester United's Robin van Persie, right, celebrates scoring their third goal, and his hat-trick against Olympiakos, with team-mate Wayne Rooney (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rvprooneyapm.jpg" /></a> Manchester United&#8217;s Robin van Persie, right, celebrates scoring their third goal, and his hat-trick against Olympiakos, with team-mate Wayne Rooney (AP)
<p>Robin van Persie&#8217;s hat-trick lifted the gloom surrounding Manchester United and manager David Moyes as the English side beat Olympiakos Piraeus 3-0 to overturn a 2-0 first-leg deficit and reach the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday.</p>
<p>United, mounting a dismal defence of their Premier League title in Moyes&#8217;s first campaign since replacing Alex Ferguson, kept alive their last remaining hope of lifting a trophy this season.</p>
<p>Asked to show character by their manager, United responded with Van Persie showing a clinical edge that has been missing of late while the recalled Ryan Giggs was also instrumental on his first start since late January.</p>
<p>Van Persie began the Old Trafford comeback with a 25th-minute penalty, awarded after he had been shoved in the back by Jose Holebas.</p>
<p>The Dutchman levelled the tie on aggregate in first-half stoppage time, steering in Wayne Rooney&#8217;s cross and Van Persie completed his hat-trick with a free kick six minutes after the break that left Olympiakos keeper Roberto rooted to the spot.</p>
<p>Moyes, who cut a defiant figure this week despite his troubled start, praised a &#8220;magnificent team performance&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were no passengers tonight, everyone fought their corner and we played some really good football,&#8221; the Scot told a news conference after United joined Premier League leaders Chelsea as the only English representatives in the last eight.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s especially pleasing as we did not play well in the first leg in Greece but came back strongly tonight.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might not be favourites to win the Champions League this season but if we go into the quarter-finals as underdogs that&#8217;s fine by me.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this squad this club can be more than a match for anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giggs provided the passes for two of the goals on his 140th appearance in the competition, just two off the record held by Raul.</p>
<p>He said: &#8220;It was always going to be tough not to concede a goal and to score three goals but we managed it. The crowd got us over the finishing line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hopefully tonight can be the turning point in our season.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only twice in their long European history had Manchester United recovered from a 2-0 first leg defeat to advance, the last time 30 years ago when they came back from the same first leg score to beat Barcelona 3-2 on aggregate in the European Cup Winners Cup quarter-finals.</p>
<p>They also had history on their side with Olympiakos having lost all of their previous 11 European matches in England and had not scored a goal against United in their two previous meetings at Old trafford.</p>
<p>A repeat performance of the famous 1984 comeback over Barca appeared possible after United started with a much brighter tempo than they showed at any time in their humbling 3-0 defeat by Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Impressive Giggs</strong></p>
<p>After Arsenal loanee Joel Campbell went close in the second minute for the Greeks, United took control of the game with Giggs, Danny Welbeck and Antonio Valencia, dominating the midfield both centrally and on the flanks.</p>
<p>Giggs picked out Rooney to head against the foot of the post after 18 minutes and it was from another angled delivery that Van Persie was pushed over by Holebas to put United ahead from the spot.</p>
<p>Giggs was involved in United&#8217;s second, finding Rooney with another flighted pass for the striker to cross low for Van Persie to steer past Roberto.</p>
<p>United could never relax at the back with Olympiakos a constant threat on the counter-attack and it needed a superb double-save from goalkeeper David De Gea to keep the Greek side out.</p>
<p>He first kept out a header from David Fuster, then the follow-up from Alejandro Dominguez to keep United in the tie.</p>
<p>Van Persie&#8217;s free kick early in the second half proved decisive, although the Dutch striker was carried off on a stretcher in the final minutes with an apparent leg injury.</p>
<p>Moyes said the striker took a knock behind the knee but was &#8220;hopeful it was not too bad&#8221;.</p>
<p>Olympiakos coach Michel said his side&#8217;s first-leg lead was never going to prove enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;We tried for the early quick goal to kill off the tie, but it did not come,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We played as well as we could play, but I always felt 2-0 was never going to be quite good enough.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2014018&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/zimbabwet20apm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013993" alt="In another group B match, Zimbabwe kept alive their hopes of reaching the next stage after Vusi Sibanda's last ball six helped them pip Netherlands by five wickets (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/zimbabwet20apm.jpg" /></a> In another Group B match, Zimbabwe kept alive their hopes of reaching the next stage after Vusi Sibanda&#8217;s last ball six helped them pip Netherlands by five wickets (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ireland beat the United Arab Emirates by 21 runs on the Duckworth/Lewis Method at the World Twenty20 on Wednesday after a game that was cut short by rain and also being twice interrupted by power failures. </span></p>
<p>Ireland was cruising at 103-3 in the 15th over of the Group B qualifier when the floodlights went out for a second time in 13 minutes — and the rain came down.</p>
<p>Ed Joyce made 43 off 38 balls while captain William Porterfield was unbeaten on 33 before rain stopped further play.</p>
<p>The two seasoned Ireland batsmen took the total to 95 after Paul Stirling was struck on the elbow by a short pitched delivery of Sharif Asadullah in the first over and had to retire hurt in the next over with the total on 15.</p>
<p>UAE hit back in the closing stages with three wickets in the space of six runs, but by that time the outcome was all but decided. “It was very pleasing to limit them to 120 on that pitch,” Porterfield said. “Paul is fine and we know if we beat Netherlands we are through.”</p>
<p>UAE was earlier restricted to 123-6 with Paul Stirling claiming 2-12 and Kevin O&#8217;Brien dismissing top scorer Shaiman Anwar (30) and Amjad Javed (19). Ireland defeated Zimbabwe in its opening match and is now the favorite to advance after its last qualifier against the Netherlands on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: </strong>Ireland103-3 in 14.2 overs (Ed Joyce 43, William Porterfield 33 not out; Sharif Asadullah 2-21) def. UAE 123-6 (Shaiman Anwar 30, Amjad Ali 20; Paul Stirling 2-12, Kevin O&#8217;Brien 2-17)</p>
<p><strong>Zimbabwe keep hopes alive</strong></p>
<p>Earlier in another Group B match, Zimbabwe kept alive their hopes of reaching the next stage after Vusi Sibanda&#8217;s last ball six helped them pip Netherlands by five wickets. Tom Cooper struck an unbeaten 72 and featured in two half-century stands to help Netherlands overcome a wobbly start and post a competitive 140-5.</p>
<p>Netherlands captain Peter Borren himself did little to justify his decision to bat first, virtually gifting Prosper Utseya his wicket with a rash shot and his departure left the Dutch side reeling at 35-4 in the fifth over. Tom Cooper first rebuilt the innings with a 52-run stand with brother Ben Cooper (20) and then counter-attacked, adding 53 with Mudassar Bukhari (14 not out).</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s 58-ball knock contained one six and nine fours, the final being an amazing improvised shot as he switched stance to scoop a slow bouncer from Tinashe Panyangara to help it to the ropes.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe were going steady in their chase at 85-1 in 13 overs before Pieter Seelar dismissed Hamilton Masakadza (43) and the scoreless Elton Chigumbura in the same over to peg them back.</p>
<p>Captain Brendan Taylor (49) fell at a crucial juncture and needing one run off the last three balls, Sean Williams failed to score off the fourth delivery and ran himself out in the fifth. Sibanda kept his cool, however, and belted the final Ahsan Malik delivery for a six to keep his side in the hunt to progress to the super 10 stage.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: </strong>Netherlands 140 for 5 in 20 overs ( T Cooper 72, B Cooper 20, P Utseya 2/24, N Mushangwe 1/24) lost to zimbabwe 146/5 in 20 overs.(H Masakadza 43, B Taylor 49, S Williams 26, P Seelar 2/9) by 5 wickets</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013819&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Abu Dhabi is all set to be the venue for the grand opening of the IPL&#8217;s seventh edition when the glitzy T20 caravan rides into the desert next month. While the tournament launch is set for April 15, defending champions Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders will face-off in the season opener at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium a day later. In all, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will host 20 matches of IPL7&#8242;s first leg from April 16-30, according to the schedule announced by the IPL governing council on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>The matches will be played in three of the biggest cities in the UAE, with the T20 action spread across Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Dubai. The schedule is so designed that all eight franchises will play three matches at each at the three venues. The matches will start at 4pm and 8pm IST with five of the 15 days set to host double-headers, including both weekends. While Abu Dhabi and Dubai will play host to seven matches each, the historic Sharjah Cricket Ground will see six matches coming its way.</p>
<p>The UAE leg of the IPL, a part of which has been shifted out of the country due to general elections, will wind up on April 30 with Mumbai facing Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Dubai International Stadium.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the second leg of IPL7 which was to be held in tentatively in Bangladesh might get shifted to India with the organisers claiming that many of the state governments had expressed keenness to host the matches once polling for general elections is completed in their respective areas.</p>
<p>“Based on the responses received so far, the BCCI believes that the Pepsi IPL 2014 can be conducted in India from the first week of May,” BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel said.</p>
<p>While the detailed schedule for the post-UAE part of IPL7 is yet to be announced, the governing council had already announced earlier this month that the last leg starting from May 13, including the play-offs and the final slated for June 1, will be held in India.</p>
<p>Due to the lesser number of teams, the duration of the league has also been shortened this time to 47 days and 60 matches &#8211; much less than the 76 games played last season which was spread over 54 days.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013816&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kumarsangakkaramap.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013983" alt="Kumar Sangakkara is bowled out by West Indies' bowler Dwayne Bravo during their ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup warm up match in Dhaka (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kumarsangakkaramap.jpg" /></a> Kumar Sangakkara is bowled out by West Indies&#8217; bowler Dwayne Bravo during their ICC Twenty20 World Cup warm up match in Dhaka (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">When Sunil Narine has the ball in his hand things tend to happen in the middle. Sri Lanka is a team which knows that. In the final of the previous edition of the World T20 in Colombo, Narine finished with figures of three for nine to help West Indies defend 137. </span></p>
<p>On Wednesday, Narine returned four for 24, three of those wickets coming in one over &#8211; the sixteenth of this practice game. This was also an over in which the off-spinner, ranked the No.1 T20 bowler in the world, showed why he can be a tricky customer towards the end of a Twenty20 innings when the asking rate is climbing and the batsmen are targeting the stands.</p>
<p>Before being brought on for the second time in the innings, Narine had bowled two overs &#8211; the sixth and eight of the innings &#8211; while Kumar Sangakkara and Thilakaratne Dilshan were on strike. He conceded nine runs in 12 balls and could have dismissed Sangakkara if Andre Russell had held on to a difficult catch.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult equation</strong></p>
<p>When Narine was reintroduced into the attack, Sri Lanka needed 68 off 30 balls. Narine removed three batsmen &#8211; Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews and Thisara Perera &#8211; all capable of lusty blows. He could have scalped four if he hadn&#8217;t overstepped.</p>
<p>Chandimal mistimed a slog and was caught on the long-on boundary in the second delivery of the sixteenth over. Mathews stayed back and attempted to hit Narine to the on side. The ball was flatter and Mathews missed the line and it crashed into the stumps.</p>
<p>Both Chandimal and Mathews had succumbed to the pressure of a high asking rate. Such scenarios play into Narine&#8217;s hands. He has variations up his sleeve but the batsmen can&#8217;t afford to get their eye in or even play him out.</p>
<p>Nuwan Kulasekara was another such batsmen to fall prey to Narine. He tried to drive but couldn&#8217;t get bat on ball and was stumped in the same over. The West Indians were confident of the appeal but the television umpire didn&#8217;t have to go as far as the final frames of the replay because Narine had overstepped.</p>
<p>The free-hit delivery crashed into the stump off Kulasekara&#8217;s leg. An edge off the next delivery allowed Kulasekara to scamper through for a single. This put Thisara Perera on strike. Perera tried to play the ball fine, but it spun and hit him on the back leg. The umpire ruled in the bowler&#8217;s favour.</p>
<p><strong>Devastating over</strong></p>
<p>Narine had taken three wickets for just four runs. He was to take another one, that of Kulasekara who tried to play across the line in his last over, the nineteenth of the innings. At this point, Sri Lanka needed 39 off 12 with just one wicket in hand. They ultimately fell 34 runs short.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka had a formidable spin attack on Wednesday. They played Ajantha Mendis, Rangana Herath and Seekkuge Prasanna. All of them picked up wickets but West Indies posted a formidable 172. Chasing down this total was going to be challenging.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka lost opener Kusal Perera in the third over to leg-spinner Samuel Badree, who started with the new ball, while medium-pacer Dwayne Bravo dismissed Thilakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara as Sri Lanka lost wickets regularly. They were reduced to 83 for 5 by the thirteenth over. From here on there was no comeback for the Lankans as Narine was brought back into the attack shortly.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: </strong>West Indies 172/5 in 20 overs (D Smith 60, D Bravo 43, R Herath 2/20) beat Sri Lanka 139 all out in 19.2 overs.( T Dilshan 43, K Sangakkara 24, S Narine 2/24, D Bravo 3/29) by 33 runs</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013815&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mahendrasinghdhonireutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013975" alt="The wickets have LEDs that flicker on the slightest impact (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mahendrasinghdhonireutersm.jpg" /></a> The wickets have LEDs that flicker on the slightest impact (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">At the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh, cricketers won’t be able to walk off the field with stumps and bails as souvenirs. </span></p>
<p>That’s because the timber targets used in the tournament are special and not easily replaceable. Decked with LEDs that flicker on the slightest impact with the ball, the stumps are made of composite plastic and have sensors connected to a microprocessor.</p>
<p>The high-tech stumps, marketed as ‘Zings’ by an Australian firm, are expensive and thus precious.</p>
<p>“We have $40,000 worth of patented technology out on the field at each game and that is a lot of money. Each bail costs as much as an iPhone. We can’t afford to give them away to players at the end of a game,” says Zings inventor Bronte Eckermann.</p>
<p>He is always stationed next to the boundary rope and gets restless towards the end of the game. “I will chase the players and get the stumps and bails back if they try to get away with them,” he adds with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>Eckermann’s ‘glowing stumps’ might be making their debut at an ICC event but they have been used in T20 leagues in Australia, New Zealand and the West Indies. The one-time batsman who opened for Adelaide district says that despite the extensive use of his invention across the world, the ‘Zings’ have never failed him nor have they been broken. “Although the other day my heart was in the mouth when Malinga got those yorkers going against India,” he says. The ‘lighted stumps’ were used in both of India’s warm up games — the most-watched matches in the initial phase — and will be a regular feature in the second phase of the tournament.</p>
<p><strong>Eureka moment</strong></p>
<p>The cricket addict’s ‘eureka’ moment arrived when he was at home watching a game on television. “My daughter was playing with a ball that lit up when it was thrown. I was hoping to produce something that would add value to T20 cricket. I was also excited about LED technology,” recalls Eckermann as he talks about his invention.</p>
<p>Off the shelf or online, Eckermann’s bails cost just $25.</p>
<p>This ‘garden variety’ Zing doesn’t have sensors in the spigot that triggers lights within a millisecond of it coming off the grove on the stumps and caters to kids shopping for cricket equipment for backyard games.</p>
<p>“Widespread use of Zings will bring down the cost. Our main aim is to help umpires make better decisions when it comes to close run-outs or stumping. May be a few years down the line, I can allow the players to keep the bails and stumps after a final,” he says.</p>
<p>Until then, players will have to show restraint at the end of the game and Eckermann will continue to be restless off the field.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013810&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Kazakhstan’s Yaroslava Shvedova beat former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-4 6-2 at the Sony Open on Tuesday, earning a second-round meeting with world number one Serena Williams.</span></p>
<p>The world number 59 broke the Italian to take the first set and broke again to move ahead 3-1 in the second before recording one final break to close out the contest and collect her first win in four meetings with the 2010 French Open champion.</p>
<p>Schiavone, the first Italian woman to win a grand slam, has been in miserable form losing seven consecutive first-round matches before ending the barren stretch last week at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells.</p>
<p>Shvedova has lost all three meetings with Williams but did push the six-times Miami champion to three sets during a round of 16 meeting at the 2012 Wimbledon. The upset of the day went to 20-year-old Monica Puig who dispatched 36th ranked Magdalena Rybarikova of Slovakia, a four-time winner on the WTA Tour, 6-1 7-6 (9-7).</p>
<p>The tournament began on a down note for the home contingent with American Bethanie Mattek-Sands falling 6-3 3-6 6-3 to Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013803&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/murraylendlreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014015" alt="Andy Murray and Ivan Lendl had two good years together (File/Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/murraylendlreutersm.jpg" /></a> Andy Murray and Ivan Lendl had two good years together (File/Reuters)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Following a fruitful two-year relationship, Wimbledon champion Andy Murray has parted ways with coach Ivan Lendl — the man who turned him from a four-time Grand Slam runner-up into a two-time major champion.</span></p>
<p>Murray and Lendl announced their decision on the British player’s blog on Wednesday, a few days after Murray lost in the fourth round at Indian Wells.</p>
<p>“I’m eternally grateful to Ivan for all his hard work over the past two years, the most successful of my career so far,” said Murray, who returned from back surgery this season. “As a team, we’ve learned a lot and it will definitely be of benefit in the future. I’ll take some time with the team to consider the next steps and how we progress from here.”</p>
<p>With Lendl, Murray won Olympic gold in London in 2012 and the US Open title later the same year. In 2013, he became the first British man to triumph at Wimbledon in 77 years.</p>
<p>Before winning the US Open, Murray was 0-4 in Grand Slam finals. Only one other man in the Open era, which began in 1968, lost his first four major titles matches: Lendl. The Czech-born baseline player then went on to win eight Grand Slam singles titles during a 17-year career, spending 270 weeks at No. 1 in the world rankings.</p>
<p>Lendl first got involved with Murray in December 2011. Despite a lack of coaching experience, Lendl immediately struck a chord with his protege as Murray made it to the Wimbledon final, where he lost to Roger Federer in four sets.</p>
<p>Murray’s breakthrough came a month later when he beat Federer in the Olympic final at the All England Club. He then defeated defending champion Novak Djokovic in the final at Flushing Meadows to win his first Grand Slam singles title.</p>
<p>“Working with Andy over the last two years has been a fantastic experience for me,” Lendl said. “He is a first class guy. Having helped him achieve his goal of winning major titles, I feel like it is time for me to concentrate on some of my own projects moving forward including playing more events around the world which I am really enjoying.</p>
<p>“I will always be in Andy’s corner and wish him nothing but great success as he too goes into a new phase of his career.”</p>
<p>Lendl has recently played exhibitions in Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Charlotte and London. He has also been giving clinics in the Canary Islands as well as opening new courts in Bluffton, South Carolina, at the Ivan Lendl Junior Tennis Academy.</p>
<p>Murray will be defending his Miami title next week before leading Britain in the quarterfinals of the Davis Cup next month against Italy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013802&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Owners of five Indian Premier League (IPL) and as many I-League teams are believed to have picked up the bid documents for the Indian Super League (ISL), which is scheduled to be held from September to November this year.</span></p>
<p>Sources claimed Kolkata Knight Riders, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Delhi Daredevils, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals have purchased the bid documents. Among the I-League teams, Dempo, Mumbai FC, Bangalore FC, Shillong Lajong and Pune FC are reported to have expressed interest in the ambitious league.</p>
<p>Kerala-based second division I-League team Eagles FC too have reportedly bought the bid documents along with several other individuals, of whom former India captain Sourav Ganguly, Sunil Gavaskar (via PMG), actor Ranbir Kapoor and producer Ronnie Screwvala are the big names.</p>
<p>While the keenness of IPL teams is understandable, the interest of five I-League teams would come as a relief to the organisers. The clubs were at loggerheads with IMG-R and AIFF, fearing that the ISL will have a direct impact on the future of the I-League. Fences have been mended since and the the fact that nearly half a dozen of the I-League teams have bid shows that they have shed their initial reluctance towards the tournament.</p>
<p>Dempo president Shrinivas Dempo said they hope to use the ISL as a platform to build a strong base for their I-League teams. “We look at the ISL as a commercial opportunity. There are some concerns that ISL will take over the I-League but we will sustain the I-League club because it is the core of Indian football,” he said.</p>
<p>IMG-Reliance, along with Star India, called for bids through the Invitation To Bid (ITB) documents for nine cities (Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Goa, Guwahati, Kochi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Pune) earlier this month. The document is priced at Rs 5 lakh and the base price for each franchise has been fixed at Rs 120 crore for a period of 10 years.</p>
<p>Roughly, a dozen suitors have since picked up the ITB documents and there are two more days for the deadline. It remains to be seen how many parties will officially submit their bids. The last date to table tenders is March 25. Advisory firm Ernst &amp; Young has been entrusted with the responsibility of evaluating the bid documents, following which the top eight bidders will be announced by first week of April.</p>
<p>“There are a few more parties who have expressed interest but not picked the ITB documents yet. We expect that to happen over the next couple days. The parties will have to submit the documents by March 25 and the winning bids will be announced in the first week of April,” the source said.</p>
<p><strong>Grassroot development clause</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The source added that one of the crucial factors to winning the bid is a detailed grassroots development plan. It is mentioned in the bid document that Rs 2 crore should be spent on grassroots development in the first year itself. The franchisees will have to indulge in the development activities starting June. By the fifth year, all franchises are expected to have their own academies.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013795&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viswanthananandfidem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2014000" alt="Viswanathan Anand’s game against Karjakin held interest only in the latter stages (FIDE.com)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viswanthananandfidem.jpg" /></a> Viswanathan Anand’s game against Karjakin held interest only in the latter stages (FIDE.com)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Viswanathan Anand played out a comfortable, early draw against Sergey Karjakin to ensure he stays in the lead and watched on as the chasing pack played out significant round six games at the Candidates tournament in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia. Of the three players who were joint-second at the start of the round, it was only Levon Aronian who managed to stay in touch with a draw, while Vladimir Kramnik and Peter Svidler fell behind with losses. </span></p>
<p>Going into the second rest day, the race for candidature has narrowed Anand in the lead and Aronian half a point behind. A full point behind Anand are Kramnik, Topalov, Svidler and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in third place. Eight rounds remain to be played, though, and with the players facing each other again in the reverse fixtures, there is enough time for the lead to change hands a few more times.</p>
<p>Anand’s game against Karjakin held interest only in the latter stages, with the first 21 moves, quite incredibly, staying true to theory in the notoriously drawish Berlin Defence variation of the Ruy Lopez. It was an interesting choice by Karjakin, who played black, for the Berlin was extensively used by Magnus Carlsen in the World Championship match a few months back and the Indian was bound to have come up with a few new ideas over the course of the final. In his favour, Karjakin has played the opening, and even the position that evolved out of it on Wednesday, with both white and black.</p>
<p>Anand finally surprised (mildly) Karjakin, deviating from games already played in this line on the 21st move. Still, Anand could not really formulate a plan to breakthrough, as Karjakin built a fortress on his king’s side, not allowing Anand’s rook, bishop or pawns much play. The draw was signed after 33 moves, by which time Anand had a pleasant position; it was just that the win proved elusive.</p>
<p>By the time the dust settled in round six, it was just Aronian who was hanging on, with a draw against bottom-placed Dmitry Andreikin. Aronian obtained an edge out of the Reti Opening and though Andreikin seemed to be coping reasonably well, complications in the middle game and poor time management saw Aronian breakthrough. By the time Andreikin scrambled past 40 moves to receive additional time on his clock, Aronian’s ‘b’ pawn had cantered down the board to give the Armenian a winning advantage. However, Aronian’s inaccuracies in the rook and pawn endgame saw Andreikin get away with a draw.</p>
<p>Kramnik had enjoyed a good tournament until Wednesday, finding a brilliant defence to hold out against Svidler after coming up with a convincing win against Karjakin in round two. Still, his round six game came at the back of a five-and-a-half hour draw against Aronian and Topalov kept the pressure on Kramnik right from the start. It was a sharp Queen’s Gambit Declined and it just seemed that Topalov had the line well prepared with white.</p>
<p><strong>Grudge match</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In an attempt to complicate the position, and also perhaps to throw Topalov off his preparation, Kramnik resorted to aggression — he advanced his f pawn to the fourth rank to strike at the bast of white’s central pawn chain and in the next move, tried to undermine his opponent’s pawn structure on the queen side. Unfortunately, the successive moves, the 12th and 13th, saw Kramnik’s position worsen, leaving his king exposed and queen side compromised. Topalov, ahead by more than 30 minutes on time (another indicator that the Bulgarian knew exactly what he was doing, thanks to his home preparation), closed out the win against an opponent with whom he does not share a cordial relationship. Since the Toiletgate incident in the World Championship final of 2006, where Topalov and Kramnik accused each other of cheating, the pair haven’t shook hands during games, as is customary. Wednesday’s win will no doubt be sweat for the Bulgarian.</p>
<p>Svidler played the rare Dutch Defence against Mamedyarov, a choice that proved initially successful for the Russian. Though he had obtained counterplay, Svidler did not follow it up with the best moves in the middle game. With only five minutes to make 10 moves until the time control, the Russian resigned as he was just faced with a lost bishop and pawns endgame.</p>
<p>Round six results: Anand (3.5 pts) drew with Karjakin (2), Topalov (2) bt Kramnik (3), Mamedyarov (2) bt Svidler (3), Aronian (3) drew with Andreikin (1.5).</p>
<p>Standings after round six: 1. Anand (4 pts); 2. Aronian (3.5); 3-6. Kramnik, Svidler, Mamedyarov, Topalov (3); 7. Karjakin (2.5); 8. Andreikin (2).</p>
<p><strong>Diptayan in joint-lead</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kolkata:</strong> After knocking over Bangladesh Fide Master Animul Islam in the opening round on Tuesday, 16-year old Diptayan Ghosh defeated former Under-16 world champion B Adhiban in the second round of the Kolkata Open Chess Tournament played here at Alekhine Chess Club. The youngster now leads the table along with eight other players with two points each. Two top seeds Nigel Short and Sergy Fedorchuk trail the leaders by half a point, though they both notched up wins in their respective matches today. Short defeated Prince Bajaj, while Fedorchuk got the better of Pratik Patil.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013793&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Barren return for Drogba as Chelsea beat toothless Galatasaray 2-0 at home to enter quarters; Real thump Schalke 9-2 on aggregate.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013791&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Chelsea eased into the quarterfinals of the Champions League at the expense of Galatasaray on Tuesday, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice as Real Madrid completed a comprehensive win against Schalke 04. First-half goals from Samuel Eto’o and Gary Cahill gave Chelsea a 2-0 victory as they saw off their Turkish opponents 3-1 on aggregate to succeed where fellow Premier League clubs Arsenal and Manchester City failed and make it into the last eight.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carlo Ancelotti’s Madrid defeated Schalke 3-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu to advance 9-2 on aggregate and extend their long unbeaten run to 31 games.</p>
<p>“Last season when Chelsea won the Europa League it was a different level,” Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said. “Now we are amongst the last eight in the Champions League. That is important.”</p>
<p>The build-up to the game at Stamford Bridge had been dominated by the return of Didier Drogba to the ground where he is still hailed as a hero and the Ivorian — scorer of the winning penalty when Chelsea beat Bayern Munich in a shoot-out in the 2012 final — was presented with a silver boot prior to kick-off.</p>
<p>Chelsea’s away-goal advantage from last month’s meeting in Istanbul meant they had no obligation to take the game to Roberto Mancini’s side, but they found themselves ahead on the night inside four minutes. Oscar’s pass in behind the visiting defence found Eto’o, and the Cameroonian beat the offside trap before sending in a low shot that was too powerful for goalkeeper Fernando Muslera.</p>
<p>As Eto’o celebrated scoring the 30th Champions League goal of his career, Drogba and Galatasaray offered little by means of a response.</p>
<p>John Terry volleyed just over from a Frank Lampard free-kick before Jose Mourinho’s side increased their lead three minutes prior to the interval, Gary Cahill ramming home the rebound after Muslera had blocked Terry’s header at a corner.</p>
<p>Mancini tinkered tactically at the interval, switching to a three-man defence, but Chelsea never looked in danger as Drogba bowed out with a whimper.</p>
<p><strong>RONALDO EQUALS PUSKAS</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In Spain, Ancelotti resisted the temptation to rest Ronaldo despite Madrid leading 6-1 from the first leg in Germany and having a crucial league game against Barcelona to come at the weekend. Gareth Bale was left on the bench at kick-off, but the Welshman came on inside eight minutes to replace Jese Rodriguez, who came off with a serious knee injury.</p>
<p>“I think it is confirmed he has ruptured cruciate ligament,” Ancelotti said. “He has had bad luck and we are going to lose a very important, young player who has done very well this season.”</p>
<p>Bale then set up Ronaldo to put the Spanish league leaders in front on the night midway through the first period, but Schalke gave their noisy travelling support something to celebrate by equalising on 31 minutes when Tim Hoogland’s speculative effort beat Iker Casillas with the aid of a huge deflection off Sergio Ramos.</p>
<p>Ronaldo fired home his second of the night and his 13th goal in seven Champions League matches this season, but he couldn’t complete his hat-trick. Alvaro Morata completed the scoring with quarter of an hour remaining after a Ronaldo effort had come back off the bar.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ronaldo’s brace on the night was enough for him to equal the great Ferenc Puskas’s tally of 242 goals in a Madrid shirt.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013791&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sureshrainareutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013966" alt="Suresh Raina hit two sixes and six fours in a 31-ball 54, and also picked up a wicket in an economical four-over spell (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sureshrainareutersm.jpg" /></a> Suresh Raina hit two sixes and six fours in a 31-ball 54, and also picked up a wicket in an economical four-over spell (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Forty-eight hours before India play their first official game of the tournament, a Super 10 match versus Pakistan, MS Dhoni&#8217;s side managed to gather what is termed ‘momentum&#8217;. In Twenty20 cricket competitions, where there is little time between games, captains hopes to continue their streak from a winning match.</span></p>
<p>India will meet West Indies, the defending champions, with a day&#8217;s gap following their match against Pakistan. Losses in one or both of these games could make it tougher for India to advance because their group also includes Australia. Bangladesh too are set to advance to the same group of the Super 10s. India&#8217;s assignments over the 11 days will be against: arch-rivals, defending champs, hosts and the pedigreed Aussies.</p>
<p>The 20-run win over England in the final warm-up match puts the Indians in the right frame of mind ahead of more serious assignments coming up. The team will take away ‘positives&#8217;, the other frequently used word by captains to assure themselves and their teammates that all is well.</p>
<p>The ‘positives&#8217; are as follows. Virat Kohli made a crucial contribution at No.3, like he does so often in the shorter formats of the game. He came in after Rohit Sharma fell cheaply and soon Shikhar Dhawan too perished, to a brilliant catch in the covers. But Rohit ensured that the England bowlers didn&#8217;t settle down.</p>
<p>Suresh Raina, batting at No.5 in this game, made a half-century in typically belligerent fashion. He hit two sixes, the second of which was a slog over square leg for his fifty. Raina, who is currently only part of the Twenty20 set-up, also hit six fours and scored his runs at a strike rate of nearly 175. The corresponding figure for Kohli was 154.16. The two batsmen ran up a 81-run stand helped the side overcome the damage caused by losing three wickets in the Powerplay overs. Then, there was Dhoni. The skipper finished off the innings in style, hitting one six and one four and remained unbeaten on 21 off 14 balls.</p>
<p>Michael Lumb and Alex Hales were threatening to take the game away in the early part of the innings. But after being hit for a six and a four, Bhuvneshwar Kumar used an in-cutter, bowled at good pace to knock over Hales&#8217; woodwork.</p>
<p><strong>Bowling option</strong></p>
<p>Lumb fell four overs later to Raina, who gives his captain an option with the ball. Raina deceived Lumb as the batsman came down the wicket to be stumped by Dhoni. The spinners picked up four of the six England wickets that fell. Ravindra Jadeja took two wickets, picking up Jos Butler in the same way Raina got rid of Lumb. Ashwin was fortunate that Eoin Morgan hit a full toss straight to Yuvraj Singh at long-on.</p>
<p>Though this was a tidy performance, not everything went to plan. Leggie Amit Mishra was expensive while Varun Aaron game away 13 runs in his only over. Some of the fielding in the deep was shoddy.</p>
<p>Yet as far as momentum goes, this match gave India some. This was their first win in any format over a Test playing nation, other than Bangladesh, in over three months. That in itself is a big ‘positive&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> India 178/4 in 20 overs (V Kohli 74, S Raina 54; J Dernbach 1/27, R Bopara 1/25) beat England 158/6 in 20 overs (M Lumb 36, M Ali 46; R Ashwin 1/20, R Jadeja 2/23) by 20 runs</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013612&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Judge Thokozile Masipa granted a request on Wednesday from prosecutor Gerrie Nel to adjourn the trial until Monday so that Nel has time to consult his last witnesses. No court session was scheduled on Friday, which is a national holiday in South Africa.</p>
<p>Defense lawyer Barry Roux said the trial is expensive and he does not want to delay proceedings. He did not object to Nel&#8217;s request.</p>
<p>Pistorius has been charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on Feb. 14, 2013. The athlete acknowledges he fatally shot her, but says it was a mistake.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013495&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/schalke04m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013312" alt="Schalke 04 have crashed out of the UEFA Champions League after suffering a demoralizing defeat at the hands of giants Real Madrid. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/schalke04m.jpg" /></a> Schalke 04 crashed out of the UEFA Champions League after a demoralizing defeat at the hands of giants Real Madrid (Reuters) 
<p>Schalke 04 bid farewell to the Champions League following a comprehensive 9-2 aggregate defeat to Real Madrid but they hope their absence will be short-lived with the Ruhr valley club eyeing a top-three finish in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Their round of 16 tie was essentially settled when they were thrashed 6-1 at home in the first leg with Real also easing to a 3-1 victory over the Germans on Tuesday to book a last eight berth.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Champions League chapter is now unfortunately closed,&#8221; said Schalke&#8217;s Tim Hoogland, who scored their only goal in Madrid.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we have no reason to leave the competition with our heads hanging low. What is important now is to carve out a chance in the final league sprint so that we are back in the top European competition next season.&#8221;</p>
<p>The top three German teams advance to the Champions League group stage with the fourth-placed team entering the qualifying rounds.</p>
<p>Schalke&#8217;s inconsistent season indicated they would struggle on the tougher European stage but they have climbed up the Bundesliga table in recent weeks, moving into third past rivals Bayer Leverkusen thanks to last week&#8217;s second straight win.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who watched the game tonight saw that we restored our pride,&#8221; coach Jens Keller said in Spain. &#8220;My team showed exactly that what we had wanted to show. We were aggressive and rehabilitated ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was also a silver lining to the defeat with eight products of the club&#8217;s youth system starting the game on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was exceptional to have eight players from the Schalke youth on the pitch at the start,&#8221; said 19-year-old defender Kaan Ayhan, who was making his Champions League debut. &#8220;That is something that the entire club can be proud of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keller, however, will have to plan the immediate future without one of them when captain Benedikt Hoewedes suffered a suspected muscle tear and is expected to be sidelined for some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not have a clear diagnosis yes but it is clear that it is a muscle injury,&#8221; said coach Jens Keller. &#8220;He is not expected to play against Eintracht Braunschweig (on Saturday).&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013267&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cristianronaldoapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013287" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo's double in Tuesday's 3-1 win against Schalke 04 took his tally in the latest edition of Europe's elite club competition to 13 (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cristianronaldoapm.jpg" /></a> Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s double in Tuesday&#8217;s 3-1 win against Schalke 04 took his tally in the latest edition of Europe&#8217;s elite club competition to 13 (AP)
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s scintillating form and the supporting role played by the likes of Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema suggest Real Madrid have every right to believe a rare treble is well within their grasp.</p>
<p>Barcelona became the only Spanish team to win the Champions League and the domestic league and Cup in the same season in 2009 and La Liga leaders Real are in a strong position to match their arch rivals after Ronaldo&#8217;s goals helped them put together a 31-match unbeaten run since the end of October.</p>
<p>The Portugal forward has scored 41 in 37 appearances for the world&#8217;s richest club this term.</p>
<p>His double in Tuesday&#8217;s 3-1 win against Schalke 04, as Real secured their place in the Champions League quarter-finals with a club record 9-2 aggregate success, took his tally in the latest edition of Europe&#8217;s elite club competition to 13.</p>
<p>His opening goal in the 21st minute showcased his ability to time his runs to perfection as he sprinted into the area and clipped a Bale centre into the net.</p>
<p>His second 17 minutes from time was classic Ronaldo as he collected the ball near the halfway line and charged past the helpless Schalke players before smashing a low shot into the bottom corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ronaldo didn&#8217;t become World Player of the Year for nothing,&#8221; Schalke coach Jens Keller told a news conference. &#8220;His qualities are outstanding.&#8221;</p>
<p>With 13 goals in seven games, the 29-year-old former Manchester United player, who also scored twice in the 6-1 win at Schalke in their round of 16, first leg, has surpassed his best Champions League haul and is one short of the record of 14 set by Barca forward Lionel Messi in 2011-12.</p>
<p><strong>One-man show</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Cristiano is the best in the world,&#8221; Real midfielder Casemiro, who had a rare chance to impress on Tuesday with his team virtually assured of going through, told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a one-man show and an example for everyone,&#8221; the 22-year-old added. &#8220;I learn a lot from him and he is an incredible player.&#8221;</p>
<p>Real will find out on Friday who they will face in the quarter-finals and they could be drawn against Barca or city neighbours Atletico Madrid.</p>
<p>Real host Barca, the last team to beat them, in the La Liga &#8220;Clasico&#8221; on Sunday, when a win would stretch their lead over the champions to seven points and deal a severe blow to Barca&#8217;s chances of a fifth title in six years.</p>
<p>Barca are third after a couple of surprise defeats, a point behind second-placed Atletico.</p>
<p>Barca and Real also meet in next month&#8217;s King&#8217;s Cup final, a repeat of the 2011 showpiece which Real won 1-0, raising the prospect of a possible four meetings between them in the space of just over three weeks.</p>
<p>Bale, who has started to come into form after an injury-disrupted start to his Real career, has developed a highly effective partnership with Ronaldo and the Wales winger said his confidence was high as the season enters a crucial phase.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am enjoying my game,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are playing well, with a lot of confidence, and are on a good run,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are coming to a decisive part of the season and we have to keep it going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barcelona is a direct rival and we will try to play a good match (on Sunday) and get the three points.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have very good players but we are focused on our game and on our team because we also have very good players.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013265&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tigerwoodsapm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013244" alt="Tiger Woods has been plagued by back problems since last year but his condition worsened over the past month (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tigerwoodsapm1.jpg" /></a> Tiger Woods has been plagued by back problems since last year but his condition worsened over the past month (AP)
<p>Tiger Woods announced on Tuesday he had withdrawn from this week&#8217;s Arnold Palmer Invitational, one of his favourite events and a key lead-up to next month&#8217;s Masters.</p>
<p>The world number one said he pulled out of the tournament because he was still having problems with his aching back and was unsure whether he would be fit to play in this year&#8217;s first major.</p>
<p>Woods posted a statement on his website saying he told Palmer in person that he would not be able to defend the title he won at Bay Hill last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I personally called Arnold today to tell him that, sadly, I won&#8217;t be able to play in his tournament this year,&#8221; Woods said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to express my regrets to the Orlando fans, the volunteers, the tournament staff and the sponsors for having to miss the event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woods has been plagued by back problems since last year but his condition worsened over the past month.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old American failed to finish the Honda Classic at Palm Beach Gardens earlier this month, quitting after 13 holes in his final round.</p>
<p>Then he tweaked his back again on the last day at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami a week later, tumbling out of contention with a final-round 78 to finish tied for 25th.</p>
<p>Woods won the last of his 14 majors in 2008 and said that he was uncertain whether he would be able to play in the Masters, starting at Augusta National on April 10.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, my back spasms and the pain haven&#8217;t subsided,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too early to know about the Masters, and I will continue to be evaluated and work closely with my doctors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Woods missed the 2008 British Open and PGA Championships because after knee surgery and also skipped the 2011 U.S. Open and British Opens because of a recurrence of his knee problems.</p>
<p>But the American has never missed the Masters since he made his debut at Augusta National as an amateur in 1995. The Arnold Palmer Invitational, starting on Thursday, is one of Woods&#8217;s favourite events and attracts most of the world&#8217;s top players.<br />
Woods has won the tournament eight times, including each of the past two years, and would have been chasing an unprecedented ninth title.</p>
<p>The only other player to have won the same PGA event eight times is Sam Snead, who won the Greater Greensboro Open eight titles between 1938 and 1965.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am certainly sorry that Tiger is not able to play,&#8221; Palmer said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite obviously, we will miss having him here this week. He called me to tell me that his back was still giving him a lot of trouble and he didn&#8217;t feel he should play.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him I understood and wished him well.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013221&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Chelsea cruised into the Champions League last eight with a 2-0 win over toothlesss Galatasaray on Tuesday for a 3-1 aggregate success as Didier Drogba&#8217;s Stamford Bridge homecoming turned out to be a damp squib.</p>
<p>First-half goals by Samuel Eto&#8217;o and Gary Cahill effectively settled the tie and Chelsea then smothered the match with Frank Lampard offering a tireless midfield screen and their John Terry-led defence in total command.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are a Champions League club, we are amongst the last eight, the best teams in the world, with all the big clubs. The players deserve to be there,&#8221; said Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last season the Europa league was a different level but to come from there to the Champions League quarter-final is important for the players and the club,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Chelsea won the second-tier Europa League competition last season under Rafa Benitez after being knocked out of the Champions League at the group stage.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s defeat for Galatasaray capped a frustrating return for former fans&#8217; favourite Drogba who received a hearty welcome before kickoff and even gave Mourinho a kiss.</p>
<p>However, the Ivory Coast striker failed to make any headway as the visitors slipped out of the competition without once testing home keeper Petr Cech.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it was difficult the way the team played, if you are a striker and the team is not there you are a lonely man,&#8221; Mourinho said of Drogba&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he couldn&#8217;t do much, in my opinion Gary Cahill and John Terry gave a fantastic performance, we controlled the game so well we couldn&#8217;t see Didier in the dangerous positions.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Early goal</strong></p>
<p>Galatasaray had not won in eight previous visits to English clubs, drawing three and losing five, and the odds of them ending that streak lengthened considerably with a goal after four minutes that settled the hosts.</p>
<p>Eden Hazard produced a neat touch and turn on the halfway line and sent Oscar clear down the right. The Brazilian crossed low for Eto&#8217;o who swept in a low shot that keeper Fernando Muslera got a hand to but could not keep out.</p>
<p>The goal quietened the travelling fans, who had brought some welcome noise and colour to their corner of the ground, and Chelsea&#8217;s experience kept them subdued as the home side remained calmly in control of a stop-start first half punctuated by endless free kicks.</p>
<p>If the first goal was the product of Chelsea&#8217;s international brigade, the second in the 42nd minute was fashioned from traditional British beef as Terry headed a Lampard header goalwards and, after Muslera parried, fellow centre back Cahill slammed the loose ball gleefully into the roof of the net.</p>
<p>Chelsea worked hard to maintain their shape in the second half and Galatasaray&#8217;s Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder, who was the key man when Inter Milan beat Chelsea here four years ago, was a peripheral figure.</p>
<p>So too was Drogba, whose miserable return to London was summed up by a first-half free kick that was so high that it clattered into a &#8220;Drogba Legend&#8221; banner hung by Chelsea fans from the second tier of the stands.</p>
<p>His team did not muster a single shot on goal all night and when their only real chance fell to the 36-year-old in the final minute, his swinging boot failed to make any contact.</p>
<p>Galatasaray coach Roberto Mancini said: &#8220;We really played very, very badly. Chelsea were the better side and they converted the opportunities they got.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible to score with just one shot on goal. We need to take several steps in order to be a better team.&#8221;</p>
<p>The match was Chelsea&#8217;s 100th home game in European competition and few of the previous 99 can have been so easy.</p>
<p>They could go into Friday&#8217;s quarter-final draw as England&#8217;s only remaining club after Manchester City and Arsenal were eliminated last week and Manchester United face a tough task to overturn a 2-0 first-leg deficit when they host Olympiakos Piraeus on Wednesday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013156&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cristiano Ronaldo scored two goals as Real Madrid completed its Champions League last 16 thrashing of Schalke with a 3-1 victory on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Madrid breezed into the quarterfinals after winning 9-2 on aggregate following its 6-1 first-leg victory in Germany.</p>
<p>The Spanish leader&#8217;s progress was never in doubt as coach Carlo Ancelotti rotated his squad, with Gareth Bale forced off the bench early when Madrid forward Jese Rodriguez injured his right knee two minutes in at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
<p>Bale played a key role in the victory, feeding Ronaldo for the 21st-minute opener before Schalke defender Tim Hoogland equalized from a shot deflected beyond Iker Casillas.</p>
<p>Ronaldo scored his 13th goal of the competition with an individual effort before Alvaro Morata struck Madrid&#8217;s third from Bale&#8217;s pass in the 75th. The victory extended Madrid&#8217;s unbeaten run to 31 games in all competitions ahead of Sunday&#8217;s Spanish league showdown with Barcelona.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, Chelsea beat Galatasaray 2-0 to reach the quarterfinals with a 3-1 aggregate victory, keeping alive the possibility of Madrid coming up against former coach Jose Mourinho.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think all of the best teams have won their series, although there can be some surprises,&#8221; Ancelotti said, with the quarterfinals draw coming on Friday. &#8220;Whoever we draw, it&#8217;s going to be difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jese exited after Schalke defender Sead Kolasinac barged into the back of the Madrid winger, leaving him on the turf in visible pain. Ancelotti said Jese had ruptured his cruciate ligament, leaving him unlikely to return this season.</p>
<p>Bale swiftly added to the attack as Morata threaded a ball onto his run into the area and the Welshman picked out the inrushing Ronaldo to beat Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann.</p>
<p>Madrid&#8217;s intensity soon slackened, and the visitors took advantage of the dip in the 31st as Julian Drexler started a break that eventually finished with Hoogland&#8217;s shot from outside the area deflecting off Sergio Ramos&#8217; foot around goalie Iker Casillas.</p>
<p>&#8220;The team reacted well, the performance was good,&#8221; Schalke coach Jens Keller said through a translator. &#8220;But the minute Real Madrid has an opportunity, they can convert it into goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bale lost control at the halfway line in the 74th but Ronaldo skipped onto the loose ball and headed straight for Schalke&#8217;s goal, twisting and turning defender Joel Matip before closing the run with a clinical finish from the edge of the area.</p>
<p>Ronaldo didn&#8217;t look done as he found the crossbar in the ensuing minute, with the rebound falling to Bale to unselfishly pass back for Morata to net after the Madrid striker had missed a number of early scoring chances.</p>
<p>Ronaldo, who then found the post after that, moved within one goal of the record 14 scored by Lionel Messi of Barcelona and Jose Altafini of AC Milan in a single campaign of Europe&#8217;s top-tier competition.</p>
<p>Ronaldo also equaled club great Ferenc Puskas&#8217; mark of 242 goals with his brace.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2013088&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kevinpietersenm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1983857" alt="Not long ago after he was retained by the Delhi Daredevils, Kevin Pietersen was named captain of the franchise for the seventh edition (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kevinpietersenm.jpg" /></a> Not long ago after he was retained by the Delhi Daredevils, Kevin Pietersen was named captain of the franchise for the seventh edition (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The world of Kevin Pietersen has always been a spectacle, both on the field and off it. And cricket’s foremost headline-grabber is back in the news after being named Delhi Daredevils skipper on Tuesday. Incidentally, the latest switch-hit of wonder-who’s-writing-your-script proportions in the former England captain’s fascinating career has come just a month after the English selectors had handed him the pink-slip—this time for good.</span></p>
<p>That the 33-year-old would be given the reins of the Daredevils was expected ever since the wooden-spooners from IPL-6 had bought him for Rs 9 crore by using their right-to-match card at the auction in Bangalore. But Pietersen’s appointment has inevitably created a buzz in world cricket at a time where England have entered the World T20 looking terribly under-strength without their talisman. The flashy stroke-maker had missed last year’s IPL after being sidelined by injury but had scored 305 runs at an average of 61 when Delhi finished on top of the league standings back in 2012.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Gary Kirsten was coach of the South African team when Pietersen was found guilty of having ridiculed his then skipper Andrew Strauss in text messages sent to the opposition players. It was this incident that had embittered relations between him and his England team-mates. Though Pietersen did don the three-lions logo again soon after, his chequered career ended with him being singled out as an outcast and a divisive force.</p>
<p><strong>New management</strong></p>
<p>Now, he will team up with Kirsten, who takes over as the Daredevils coach from IPL-7, in a bid to turn around the fortunes of his franchise. And not surprisingly, both coach and captain spoke about looking forward to working with each other.</p>
<p>“I feel incredibly honoured to have been asked to captain the Delhi Daredevils in this year’s IPL. I am very much looking forward to working alongside Gary Kirsten. We have a fantastic squad with a good blend of youth and experience and a brilliant coaching set up. We hope to bring our incredible fans a lot of happiness this season,” said Pietersen.</p>
<p>“It will be great to have him with us for the full duration of IPL and I have no doubt that he will have a positive and significant impact,” added Kirsten.</p>
<p>While he might have been alienated by English cricket, Pietersen’s fan-base has only grown since his dumping .</p>
<p>Australian all-rounder Shane Watson recently called Pietersen’s absence from world cricket a ‘shame’ and believed that a tournament like the World T20 was made poorer by him not being around. He even went on to call Pietersen a ‘good guy’. T20 behemoth Chris Gayle is another one to join the bring-back KP campaign. The West Indian opener had insisted that Pietersen’s ouster was ‘disrespectful’ to cricket fans around the world.</p>
<p>Pietersen’s biggest supporter, British television host Piers Morgan, had even indulged in a twitter war with England wicket-keeper Matt Prior after he had admitted that the dressing-room was better off without his former teammate. And Morgan was among the first to react following the Daredevils’ announcement regarding KP.</p>
<p>“Kirsten sees @KP24 as such a massively disruptive dressing room scourge that he’s put him in charge of it. #ECBClowns,” Morgan tweeted. He wasn’t the only one though with numerous other tweets in support of the recent twist in Pietersen’s tale going viral including, “You know what a player is worth when the world’s best coach wants him to play as a captain in his team.”</p>
<p><strong>Bailey to lead KXIP</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Chandigarh: AUSTRALIA’S T20 skipper George Bailey was picked as the ‘unanimous’ choice to lead Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) in the seventh edition of the IPL. The 31-year-old’s career in the event has been restricted to four matches across three seasons that he spent with the Chennai Super Kings earlier. Despite his previous low-billing in the IPL, KXIP spent Rs 3.5 crore for roping in Bailey, who has built up an impressive reputation for Australia in the shortest format.</span></p>
<p>Under Bailey, the men from Down Under have won 13 out of 24 international T20s so far. He was also at the helm of Hobart Hurricanes’ run-up to the Big Bash final two months ago. Bailey was Australia’s leading run-scorer during their ODI series loss in India in 2013, where he scored 478 runs at a strike-rate of 116.01.</p>
<p>And the Punjab outfit, the perennial mid-table finishers in the tournament, will look at the genial Tasmanian to turn around their fortunes at IPL7. Bailey will lead an outfit that has three other Australians, Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Johnson and Glenn Maxwell, along with veteran Virender Sehwag.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012768&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/msdhonim1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013062" alt="Mahendra Singh Dhoni has arraigned Zee Media Corporation Limited, its editor and business head, Sudhir Chaudhary, suspended senior IPS officer G Sampath Kumar, and News Nation Network Private Ltd as defendants one to four (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/msdhonim1.jpg" /></a> Mahendra Singh Dhoni has arraigned Zee Media Corporation Limited, its editor and business head, Sudhir Chaudhary, suspended senior IPS officer G Sampath Kumar, and News Nation Network Private Ltd as defendants one to four (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In a temporary relief to the Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the High Court of Madras on Tuesday directed two private television news channels not to telecast for a fortnight any news connecting him to the Indian Premier League (ILP) betting and fixing scandal.</span></p>
<p>The interim order was given on a petition Dhoni moved on Tuesday, which also sought Rs 100 crore from the television channels, Zee Group and News Nation, for damaging his reputation by airing malicious reports that linked him to the match-fixing and betting controversy, which had erupted after an IPS officer’s deposition to the inquiry committee became public.</p>
<p>The Indian captain has arraigned Zee Media Corporation Limited which runs Zee News, its editor and business head, Sudhir Chaudhary, suspended senior IPS officer G Sampath Kumar, and News Nation Network Private Ltd that runs News Nation channel as the defendants one to four.</p>
<p>Dhoni charged in his petition that since February, the television news channels &#8211; and their websites &#8211; have been carrying defamatory, scandalous and libellous reports insinuating that he was involved in betting and fixing in the IPL circuit. This was to project him as an object of hate and ridicule among the general public, and malign his reputation among the millions of fans across the world, the petition added.</p>
<p>These media outlets should be restrained from circulating any news that would denigrate his integrity and honesty as a cricketer, except the publication of the news of any order passed by the court, sought the petition.</p>
<p>Holding that the petitioner had a prima facie case, Justice S Tamilvanan of the Madras High Court passed the interim order restraining the channels for two weeks, and issued notices to the defendants. Dhoni was represented by former attorney general of Tamil Nadu, PS Raman, who is also the counsel for the Indian cricket board, N Srinivasan, and his controversial son-in-law, former CSK team principal, Gurunath Meiyappan, who is still under the betting-fixing cloud.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Zee Media Corporation Limited refuted the allegations made in the defamation suit. Their media statement said: “The news channel has telecasted the story that was based on revelation made by Mr. Vindu Dara Singh &amp; Mr. Sampat Kumar, IPS Officer during the sting operation.” It went on to add that “Zee Media Corporation Limited has already moved an intervention application along with the evidence in its possession before the Honorable Supreme Court of India in the pending SLP filed by Cricket Association of Bihar.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012766&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After watching close to 80 matches in the last 20 days and monitoring roughly 450 players playing for 42 teams in the two divisions of the National Hockey Championships, ask a national selector how many players have impressed him. He may be able to count them on his fingers.</p>
<p>A core group of 33 players is currently training in New Delhi for the World Cup. Chief coach Terry Walsh was hoping to include a few more from the ongoing nationals in Lucknow. The Australian hoped for a broader player pool and considering that India will be playing four major tournaments in the second half of the year, it is imperative to have depth in the squad. But as is the case with a majority of the nationals championships through the years, this one too is unlikely to throw up any new talent.</p>
<p>Substandard hockey and a paucity of players are hardly new phenomena in Indian hockey. Even so, the rapid decline in quality, as seen with every passing edition, is a concerning trend. What’s even more distressing, is that many have now accepted that the quality of country’s premier domestic tournament is not set to rise.</p>
<p>Every year, you see the same set of players turning out for the same, or different, teams. At the 2012 nationals in Bangalore, hosts Karnataka were the only team to feature young, new players. Last year in Pune, all the teams swore by their tried and tested players and the same story is repeating itself this year. Comptroller and Auditor General of India, debutants, are the only exception.</p>
<p>With a team that is the youngest on paper and coached by the technically-adept Harendra Singh, CAG are one win away from reaching the semifinals at the expense of domestic powerhouse Punjab. Uttar Pradesh, coached by Olympian Shakeel Khan, too have been among the few sides who’ve been impressive. With yesteryear stars like Devesh Chauhan and Tushar Khandker in their ranks, UP — once a hotbed of Indian hockey — have qualified for the semifinals after a hiatus of 25 years.</p>
<p>While not taking any credit away from them, you wonder how much the abysmal standard of most other teams has played role in their success.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/anandfidem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013068" alt="Viswanathan Anand and Dmitry Andreikin played out a draw after 42 moves (Fide.com)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/anandfidem.jpg" /></a> Viswanathan Anand and Dmitry Andreikin played out a draw after 42 moves (Fide.com)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand played out an easy draw as black against lowest ranked Dmitry Andreikin of Russia in the fifth round, but kept the lead at the Candidates chess tournament on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>It turned out to be a no-hassle day for Anand as the Indian was seen pressing for an advantage towards the end of the game. The draw took Anand to 3.5 points out of a possible five and he keeps his half point lead with the end of the first half now approaching near.</p>
<p>Anand chose the Berlin defense, an opening he has not been able to break himself as white for some time and Andreikin employed the closed set up that was on expected lines. The Russian got slightly favourable position in the middle game but was made to sweat hard for more by Anand who played at a good speed.</p>
<p>It was a mild time pressure for Andreikin that led him in to difficulties and Anand was fighting for an advantage towards the end of the first time control. The Russian, however, got his act together just in time to find the path to equality after trading the queens. The peace was signed in 42 moved.</p>
<p>“I was trying but I didn’t see anything concrete, my hope was when his king came out but after the queen exchange its just a draw,” said Anand in the post-game conference, adding, “I was very happy with my position in the middle game but it did not become more”.</p>
<p>In other games of the day Peter Svidler of Russia defeated Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria while Sergey Karjakin of Russia played out a draw with Azeri Shakhriyar Mamedyarov.</p>
<p>Russian Vladimir Kramnik was close to winning against Levon Aronian of Armenia, but after a long struggle the latter was able to hold his fort together.</p>
<p>With Anand in front on 3.5 points, Svidler, Kramnik and Aronian follow him a half point behind. Topalov, Karjakin and Mamedyarov are on two points each from their five games while Andreikin remains at the bottom on one and a half points.</p>
<p>Svidler came out with a sterling performance to beat Topalov. From a Ruy Lopez Moller, Svidler opted for the variation he had popularised some years back and did not get any advantage.</p>
<p>Topalov’s opening preparation may have worked in his favour, but the Bulgarian did not handle the intricacies as well as he wanted. Svidler got a small advantage first and then his wily manoeuvres ensured that white’s advantage grew in the rook and opposite colour Bishops endgame.</p>
<p>As the position became more difficult, Topalov lost track and blundered in to a hopeless position.</p>
<p>Sergey Karjakin and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov played out a regulation draw. Karjakin did not get anything with his white pieces against the Sicilian defense and the pieces kept getting exchanged at regular intervals. In almost no time, the players reached a heavy pieces endgame where the final result was only a matter of time.</p>
<p><strong>Kramnik held</strong></p>
<p>Vladimir Kramnik of Russia was involved in a heated battle against Levon Aronian. The Russian did everything right to attain a dangerous attack with his white pieces but could not force matters as Aronian came up with a stupendous Queen sacrifice.</p>
<p>The position remained better for Kramnik but the Aronian just found the right defense to equality. The longest game of the day lasted 60 moves.</p>
<p><strong>Results round 5: Dmitry Andreikin (Rus, 1.5) drew with V Anand (Ind, 3.5); Peter Svidler (Rus, 3) beat Veselin Topalov (Bul, 2); Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 2) drew with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze, 2); Vladimir Kramnik (Rus, 2.5) playing Levon Aronian (Arm, 2.5).</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012758&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>West Indian opener Chris Gayle sounded out a warning to the rival teams ahead of the World T20 by declaring that he can score a hundred irrespective of the conditions. And that he is the best spinner going around in the world at the current moment.</p>
<p>“I am a batsman (who is) capable of scoring a century in any conditions and on any wicket in the world. It will be nice to get more hundreds,” Gayle said with an air of confidence during an open media house. He was also in a mood to have a laugh or two. On his other job in the side, bowling off-spin, he said, “I am the best spinner in the world. I know you guys have not seen me for sometime but I have a secret weapon you know!”</p>
<p>Not long after he talked the talk, Gayle managed to walk it against England in a warm-up game in Fatullah on Tuesday. Chasing 132 to win, Gayle, who opened the innings for the West Indies, smacked an unbeaten 38-ball 58, including six fours and two sixes. The defending champions won by seven wickets. Gayle did not bowl in the first innings.</p>
<p><strong>Holland begin with big win over UAE</strong></p>
<p>Sylhet: Stephan Myburgh smashed his maiden T20 international half-century and medium fast bowler Ahsan Malik grabbed 3-16 in the Netherlands’ convincing six-wicket win over United Arab Emirates in the World Twenty20 Group B match. Myburgh blazed seven fours and two sixes in his 55 as the Netherlands eased to 152-4 with seven balls to spare after Malik’s three late strikes had bowled out UAE for 151 in 19.5 overs. The Netherlands joined Ireland at the top of Group B after the Irishmen stunned Zimbabwe by three wickets. Shaiman Anwar top scored with 32 for UAE as none of the middle-order batsmen could capitalize on steady starts. Myburgh and Michael Swart set the tone with a rollicking start of 69 runs off 40 balls with Tom Cooper remaining unbeaten on 34 off 26 balls.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: </strong>UAE 151 all out in 19.5 overs (S Anwar 32, K Khan 31, Ahsan Malik 3/16) lost to Netherlands 152/4 in 18.5 overs.(S Muburgh 55, T Cooper 34*; K Shazad 2/19)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012750&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shanewatsonapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013035" alt="Shane Watson's Indian Premier League experience, coupled with that of Darren Lehmann's as coach (Deccan Chargers) and Shane Warne's as player-coach, should come in handy as Australia look to claim their first World T20 title (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shanewatsonapm.jpg" /></a> Shane Watson&#8217;s Indian Premier League experience, coupled with that of Darren Lehmann&#8217;s as coach (Deccan Chargers) and Shane Warne&#8217;s as player-coach, should come in handy as Australia look to claim their first ICC World Twenty20 title (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">For close to a decade, starting from the late 1990s and right through the noughties, Australian teams had mastered the art of winning titles. That too in style. Three World Cups, two Champions Trophies and not to forget the Ashes won by a 5-0 margin as recently as January this year. Somehow though, the T20 crown has always seemed to elude them.</span></p>
<p>While they were knocked out of the inaugural edition in the semifinals by India and were runners-up to England in 2010, Australia have never looked their naturally dominant selves at previous World T20s. Rarely have they showed up for the party with that indomitable Aussie authority.</p>
<p>There is something different about the present George Bailey-led outfit that has turned up in Bangladesh, however. More than ever before, they seem to possess the potential to tick that elusive box. Key all-rounder Shane Watson for one certainly seems to think so.</p>
<p>“This I know now is an incredible squad. Apart from Mitch Johnson being out with a toe infection, this is the best squad that we have put together in a T20 tournament. We have fire-power in batting till No 10 and a couple of very good death bowlers. We have a lot of balance in our team. You need a lot of guys who can make a difference in the team and we have got those,” he said.</p>
<p>When it comes to team composition, Watson is on the money, even if ‘incredible’ might sound a tad hyperbolic. They have power-hitters at the top and in the middle order, they carry experienced spinners in the side. Moreover, their batsmen can bowl spin while the fast bowlers are fast and crafty.</p>
<p>Australia might seem to have all their bases covered not just when it comes to the strength of their squad. But more importantly, they also have in their mix a number of individuals, both in terms of personnel and support staff, who have tasted major success in T20 cricket.</p>
<p>Watson, who was recently named Rajasthan Royals skipper for IPL7, himself was part of the same franchise when they lifted the title in the maiden edition. For now, he has his skipper from 2008, and the man under whom he grew in stature, back on his side with Shane Warne being drafted in as spin consultant for Australia ahead of the World T20. Then there’s Darren Lehmann, who coached Deccan Chargers to IPL glory in 2009 and is credited by many including Watson for having triggered a dramatic turnaround in his team’s fortunes.</p>
<p>The list of T20 victors in the Australian squad doesn’t stop there. Mitchell Johnson was part of the Mumbai Indians outfit that won the IPL last year. But though he’s out with a toe infection, his replacement Nathan Coulter-Nile was with him in Mumbai. The right-arm pacer was also with Perth Scorchers, winners of the Big Bash last month while Bailey was skipper of Hobart Hurricanes who finished runners-up. Johnson’s like-for-like replacement Doug Bollinger is no stranger to IPL glory either, having won the IPL twice with the Chennai Super Kings.</p>
<p>“There are guys coming through (Big Bash). Look a major reason (for improvement) is the high quality of cricket in the IPL, Big Bash and throughout the world in other leagues. We have got such a strong squad,” Watson added.<br />
Ageless Brads</p>
<p>Then there are the two ageless Brads. Few batsmen have scored more T20 runs than Hodge while chinaman exponent Hogg has found a spring in his aging strides and outsmarted a number of guys half his age in the Big Bash. Hodge will also have crucial inputs from his time as Barisal Burners captain in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL).</p>
<p>And Bailey in his second World T20 as captain will have the bonus of having a number of leaders by his side, from predecessor Cameron White to Aaron Finch. And there’s Watson. This might well be the time for the men from Down Under to once and for all add that slippery T20 prize to their burgeoning trophy-cabinet.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012748&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Against Sri Lanka in warm-up tie, the Jharkhand quick proved his worth with a fiery spell.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012745&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/varunaaronm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013020" alt="Varun Aaron made his outing in the warm-up game against Sri Lanka count with figures of 3-0-18-1 (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/varunaaronm.jpg" /></a> Varun Aaron made his outing in the warm-up game against Sri Lanka count with figures of 3-0-18-1 (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">When Sri Lanka play Lasith Malinga, they hope that he has got up on the right side of the bed that morning. For when it’s Malinga’s day, there’s little the opposition can do to keep him from firing his lethal and slingy yorkers, almost at will &#8212; just like he did while winning the match for Sri Lanka against India on Monday. </span></p>
<p>But when Malinga doesn’t get it right, which has happened rather often since his bowling was shredded to pieces by Virat Kohli in Hobart a couple of years ago, his very presence in the playing eleven could seem like a gamble gone horribly wrong for the Sri Lanka think-tank. It can happen with any team that picks its fast bowlers loaded with just one overwhelming skillset. It happens with India time and again, at least everytime they field Varun Aaron in the playing eleven.</p>
<p><strong>Still learning</strong></p>
<p>Aaron is fast; fast enough to consistently clock over 150 kmph in a limited overs match. As of now, very early into his career, it seems to be his own major weapon. On wickets where that pace benefits the oppostion batsmen more than him, his inclusion in the side can seem like a real big mistake. Ask Kohli, who perhaps still hasn’t forgotten the quick’s spell in the latter’s only appearance at the Asia Cup earlier this month. Against Bangladeh, Aaron went for 74 runs in 7.5 overs.</p>
<p>It took a Kohli century to save that match. But on Monday against Sri Lanka, Aaron sizzled it up and reaped the rewards &#8212; three overs, 18 runs and a wicket.</p>
<p>Aaron is still an unfinished product, but he has learnt to bowl a yorker and use a bouncer smartly. It may be progress enough for him to earn the faith of the skipper, considering the way fellow Jharkhandi and India captain MS Dhoni used him in India’s first warm-up tie.</p>
<p>He came on to bowl first-change &#8212; Lanka’s fourth over. The first ball to Kushal Perera was wide but the batsman failed to put bat to ball and completed a bye. Then he did better. His second delivery was full and quick. Tillakaratne Dilshan could only push it back. As Dilshan happily got off strike next ball, it was Perera’s turn to face the music. Beaten for pace immediately, Perera looked to clear Aaron over the infield but only ended up returning a catch at mid-off.</p>
<p>Over the next few balls, there were more misses than hits. Dilshan, one of the best pullers in the game, was too late into one and was smacked in the gloves by Aaron to complete his first over. When he came on to bowl his second over, Dilshan was once again on strike. He bowled five balls at the Lankan opener and conceded just one run. Then, when Mahela Jayawardene faced the Indian speedster, he only managed a top-edge against a fiery bouncer. Two overs in the powerplay and Aaron’s figures read: 2-0-6-1. Seven of those were dots.</p>
<p><strong>Alive at the death</strong></p>
<p>Aaron was brought back in the death, for his third and final over. Against Thisara Perera, a powerful hitter, he brought out the yorker. And to Nuwan Kulasekara, he bowled fast and short. When Kulasekara swung and connected one for six, Aaron had conceded his only boundary on Monday. It arrived of his 17th ball.</p>
<p>It is easy to see why the selectors have added Aaron in the mix. He is still very young (24), fast and can be quite a handful when he isn’t spraying it around. Yes, he is far from being the complete package that India desperately need in their pace department. But if he can consistently perform like he did on Monday, the Indian think-tank will be certain that Aaron is a gamble worth taking.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">After Dhoni gives batting a skip, India falter in chase by 5 runs</strong></p>
<p>Mirpur: India’s batting woes continued in familiar conditions as they lost their opening warm-up tie against Sri Lanka by five runs in Mirpur on Monday.</p>
<p>Batting first, Sri Lanka scored 153 for six and then bowled out India for 148 in exactly 20 overs. Needing 12 off the last over bowled by Lasith Malinga, Indians could get only six as the Lankan slinger finished with figures of 4/30 from four overs. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not bat in this unofficial match.</p>
<p>Ravichandran Ashwin’s all-round show (3/22 and 19 runs) was the lone bright spot in the opening encounter.</p>
<p>India were off to a disastrous start as Shikhar Dhawan (2) played a lazy shot off Kulasekara to hole out at mid-off while Rohit Sharma (4) was caught at the deep mid-wicket off Malinga. Raina looked more comfortable on a low-bounce track as he played those customary lofted shots.</p>
<p>He was looking good for a big one as he smacked five fours and a six. But fell to Ajantha Mendis before reaching his 50.</p>
<p>Yuvraj Singh hit two sixes and two fours in his 28-ball stay at the crease. But once he fell, it was difficult for India’s lower order and tail to finish the game. (PTI)<br />

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Bangladesh were all but assured of qualifying for the main round of the World Twenty20 after inflicting an eight-wicket defeat on Nepal on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>The tournament host was the only team in its group with two wins from two matches, and is favoured to claim the qualifying spot when it meets winless Hong Kong on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nepal, which beat Hong Kong on Sunday, never looked like challenging when it was restricted to 126-5, and Bangladesh raced to 132-2 in 15.3 overs.</p>
<p>Shakib Al Hasan was unbeaten on 37 off 18 balls and sealed the victory with his fourth six after refusing to run a winning single on the previous ball.</p>
<p>Opening batsman Anamul Haque top-scored with 42 off 33 balls, and shared an opening stand of 63 with Tamim Iqbal, who made 30, as Nepalese bowlers found it hard to handle the wet ball under heavy dew.</p>
<p>Earlier, after electing to bowl first with the dew in mind, Bangladesh medium fast bowler Al-Amin Hossain took two wickets in three deliveries to have Nepal at 39-3 before captain Paras Khadka (41) and Sharad Vesawkar (40) added 85 for the fourth wicket.</p>
<p>“The toss was important because of the dew and it was very difficult to grip the ball,” Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim said.</p>
<p>Khadka rued the fact that his batsmen could not hit a single six while Bangladesh batters smashed nine in their brisk run-chase.<br />
“Nepal needed 140-plus to challenge Bangladesh in these conditions,” Khadka said. “We got stuck and didn’t rotate strike, lacked the big hits too.”</p>
<p><strong>BRIEF SCORES: </strong>Nepal 126/5 (P Khadka 41, S Vesawkar 40; A Hossain 2/17) lost to Bangladesh 132/2 in 15.3 overs (A Haque 42, S Hasan 37*; B Regmi 1/14)</p>
<p><strong>Hong kong knocked out</strong></p>
<p>Chittagong: Opener Mohammed Shahzad and Shafiullah hit half-centuries as Afghanistan recorded a convincing seven-wicket win over Hong Kong in a Group B match to keep their hopes alive to qualify in the World Twenty20 in Chittagong on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the process, Afghanistan earned its first win in the World Twenty20 and kept alive slim hopes of making the Super 10 with an emphatic maiden victory on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chasing 154 to win, Afghanistan overhauled the target with two overs to spare and knocked Hong Kong out of the tournament in the process as Shafiullah came up with a blistering unbeaten knock of 51 off just 24 balls.</p>
<p>Shahzad, who hit 68 off 53 balls, and Sahfiqullah added 47 runs for the third wicket before the opener was caught by Irfan Ahmad off Haseeb Amjad. Shahzad hit nine boundaries in his significant knock.</p>
<p>Shafiqullah kept batting well from the other end and steered the side to the finish line. Afghanistan collected 24 runs in the 17th over bowled by Aizaz Khan and from there, Hong Kong were driven out of the game and the event.</p>
<p>Earlier, Hong Kong posted a decent 153 for eight even as their middle and lower struggled after electing to bat. Waqas Barkat (32), skipper Jamie Atkinson (31) and Mark Chapman (38) were the only batsmen who made a mark with the bat.</p>
<p>Hong Kong could manage just 51 runs after losing the top-order batsmen inside 14th over as Shapoor Zadran (2/27), Hamza Hotak (2/32) and Mohammed Nabi (2/27) took two wickets each. (PTI)</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: </strong>Hong Kong 153/8 (M Chapman 38, W Barkat 32; S Zadran 2/27, M Nabi 2/27, H Hotak 2/32) lost to Afghanistan 154/3 (M Shahzad 68, Shafiqullah 51; T Afzal 1/19)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012740&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rogerfedererapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013085" alt="Despite being denied a record fifth title at Indian Wells, Roger Federer is 19-3 this year and 4-2 against top-10 opponents (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rogerfedererapm.jpg" /></a> Despite being denied a record fifth title at Indian Wells, Roger Federer is 19-3 this year and 4-2 against top-10 opponents (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Roger Federer could have been upset about losing a close final in one of the biggest events outside the Grand Slam tournaments. But the blow of a three-set loss to Novak Djokovic in the BNP Paribas Open on Sunday was softened by knowing how far he had come since injuring his back a year ago at Indian Wells.</span></p>
<p>Last spring, Federer took a seven-week break. After Wimbledon, he re-injured his back and found himself questioning everything, leading to an uneven year for someone who once ruled this sport. “I had some doubts at certain times,” he said. “But, overall, I knew that it can&#8217;t be that I will feel this way forever, so it was just important to stay patient and wait. That&#8217;s the most difficult thing to do. I haven&#8217;t had it very often in my career. That&#8217;s why it was somewhat new for me.”</p>
<p>The chatter grew that Federer&#8217;s game had fallen. Some suggested he consider retirement. He heard the noise but didn&#8217;t listen. “A few weeks ago, months ago, a few people said I couldn&#8217;t play tennis anymore,” he said. “But at the same time, that fire, wanting to win, is important, and right now I have that. I think have a really good balance right now.”</p>
<p>Despite being denied a record fifth title at Indian Wells, Federer is 19-3 this year, his best start since opening the season with a 23-2 mark two years ago. He&#8217;s 4-2 against top 10 opponents, the most wins of any player this year.</p>
<p>He moved up three spots to No. 5 in Monday&#8217;s rankings. That&#8217;s the closest he&#8217;s been to the top four since last June, when he was third.</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Federer won his first title of the year two weeks ago in Dubai, beating Djokovic in a three-set semifinal. He was a finalist in Brisbane andsemifinalist at the Australian Open. “I&#8217;m just happy I&#8217;m playing consistent tennis and I&#8217;m going deep in tournaments and I&#8217;m giving myself chances to win,” he said. “I&#8217;m playing really good tennis. I&#8217;m moving well. Serving well, consistently well. Many things are working.”</span></p>
<p>Federer heads to Miami this week for the Sony Open, which he skipped last year because of his back. “I&#8217;m just surprised that I&#8217;m able to keep it up week for week now,” he said. “I expected myself to have a breakthrough tournament, but then maybe a couple of early exits. Who knows, maybe that&#8217;s all upon me, I don&#8217;t know. But I got very, very close, so it&#8217;s encouraging for Miami and for the rest of the season.”</p>
<p>Federer&#8217;s rivals have noticed a recharged Roger. “He has more depth on his shots, especially from the backhand side. He&#8217;s opening with his backhand shot down the line,” Djokovic said. “He gives himself an opportunity to finish with the forehand. He serves well. He just played better than he did in the last 13, 14 months.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012733&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/davidmoyesfilem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2013079" alt="David Moyes' Manchester United are currently seventh in the Premier League (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/davidmoyesfilem.jpg" /></a> David Moyes&#8217; Manchester United are currently seventh in the Premier League (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">If history was the only deciding factor then Manchester United would be highly fancied to overturn their 2-0 first leg defeat against Olympiakos and reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League on Wednesday. But the reality for manager David Moyes and his stuttering team is that present form, rather than past successes, will have a far bigger influence at Old Trafford.</span></p>
<p>United&#8217;s unimpressive season reached a new low on Sunday when they were crushed 3-0 at home by bitter rivals Liverpool, a result that left last season&#8217;s champions seventh in the Premier League with just a remote possibility of a top-four finish. Their only realistic hope of competing alongside Europe&#8217;s elite next season would now appear to be by somehow winning the competition for a fourth time in May, starting by knocking Olympiakos out.</p>
<p>“The players are well aware of what it means on Wednesday and what we have got to do,” Moyes said. “We&#8217;ve got something to go for so hopefully we can do that.”</p>
<p>Misfiring United, who last failed to qualify for the Champions League 18 years ago, have no guarantees at all of achieving their aim against the Greeks who have just won their domestic title for the fourth successive season, the 16th time in 18 campaigns they have ended as champions and the 41st in all.</p>
<p>Their head-to-head record, and the Greek side&#8217;s woeful record on the road against English clubs, does offer hope.</p>
<p>Until Olympiakos triumphed in Athens on Feb. 25, United had won all four of the previous matches between the clubs. They have also won all five matches they have played against Greek clubs at home while Olympiakos have lost all 11 of the matches they have played in England.</p>
<p>That sorry sequence began with a 4-0 loss at West Ham United in the old European Cup Winners&#8217; Cup in 1965 and has continued since with subsequent defeats at Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool (twice), Newcastle United, Chelsea, Manchester United (twice) and Arsenal (three times).</p>
<p>But they arrive at Old Trafford buoyed by a comprehensive title victory, even if Sunday&#8217;s 2-0 win over Panthrakikos was achieved behind closed doors.</p>
<p><strong>DOMESTIC SUPERIORITY</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>While United have been in the unfamiliar position of looking up at the leading pack in the Premier League, the Piraeus club have been head and shoulders above their domestic rivals this season.</p>
<p>Spanish coach Michel is not getting carried away with their chances of reaching the last eight for the first time since 1999. “We aim to do what we always do and that is concentrate on our own game,” he said.</p>
<p>Michel has to choose between former Argentina forward Javier Saviola, who missed the first leg due to injury and who would make his 100th appearance in European club competition, and Paraguayan Nelson Valdez for the lone attacking role in place of Nigerian striker Michael Olaitan.</p>
<p>Olaitan was kept in hospital for a week following his dramatic collapse during the Athens derby against Panathinaikos on March 2 due to viral myocarditis, but although he has no serious condition he is not yet ready for action. Defensive midfielder Ivan Marcano is also expected to be fit after being rested over the weekend.</p>
<p>Among those United will be keeping a close eye on is 21-year-old Joel Campbell, the Costa Rican international who is on loan from Arsenal.</p>
<p>He scored an excellent goal to seal the 2-0 win in Athens and caused the creaky United defence problems with his pace and movement.</p>
<p>Moyes could shake up his team following Sunday&#8217;s defeat with Nani, Javier Hernandez and Jonny Evans all training again after injuries.</p>
<p><strong>KLOPP&#8217;S FIERY FUSE</strong></p>
<p><strong>DORTMUND:</strong> Borussia Dortmund&#8217;s notoriously hot-tempered coach Juergen Klopp has barred fans from watching the team train this week as he seeks a calm lead-up to the side&#8217;s Champions League Round of 16 second leg tie against Zenit St Petersburg on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Klopp was banished to the stands for dissent in a 2-1 loss to Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday as Dortmund lost their fourth league game of the season on the weekend prior to a Champions League match.</p>
<p>He should cut a more passive figure this week, however, as Dortmund go into the return leg with Zenit as overwhelming favourites to advance to the quarte-finals following their convincing 4-2 victory in Russia last month.</p>
<p><strong>INJURY CONCERNS</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Klopp has had to contend with a host of injuries since the start of the season and Wednesday&#8217;s game will continue the trend as several key players miss out, including Sven Bender, Jakub Blaszczykowski and Ilkay Guendogan.</p>
<p>There is some good news, however, after Robert Lewandowski returned to action on Saturday and has been ruled fit to face the Russians. Playmaker Henrikh Mkhitaryan is also expected to return despite missing Saturday&#8217;s game but Marco Reus remains a doubt.</p>
<p>Zenit have bigger concerns, going into the match under the guidance of interim coach Sergey Semak, who replaced Luciano Spalletti earlier this month. The 38-year-old has been handed a caretaker role, though he lost his first game in charge, a 1-0 defeat to CSKA Moscow last week.</p>
<p>Defender Cristian Ansaldi and forward Andrei Arshavin missed the loss against the reigning Russian Premier League champions through injury and the side go into this week&#8217;s match on a dreadful run of form in Europe&#8217;s elite club tournament.Zenit have failed to win any of their last four games in the Champions League, qualifying for the Round of 16 with a solitary win in the group stage.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sehwagwarnerptim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012492" alt="&quot;What was Sehwag’s primary tip for me? Well, to try and hit them as long as possible,&quot; said Aaron Finch (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sehwagwarnerptim.jpg" /></a> &#8220;What was Sehwag’s primary tip for me? Well, to try and hit them as long as possible,&#8221; said Aaron Finch (File)
<p>Talented Australian batsman Aaron Finch feels that his opening partner David Warner has become a better batsman having played alongside Virender Sehwag for four years in the IPL franchise Delhi Daredevils.</p>
<p>&#8220;Four years with Virender Sehwag at Delhi Daredevils certainly made David Warner a better batsman and helped his game a lot. Not only Warner, I have also learnt a lot from Sehwag during my stay at the Daredevils. What was Sehwag’s primary tip for me? Well, to try and hit them as long as possible,&#8221; the 27-year-old Finch said during an interaction.</p>
<p>When asked to elaborate about what else Viru had told them, Finch gave a detailed insight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sehwag told us that the important thing about playing in the subcontinent is that at times you can try and capitalise on the new ball when the field is in. The ball is at its best for batting and that’s when you get the opportunity to get ahead in the game. That’s really the message he has sent in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way he has batted against the new ball in Test cricket and I think Warner playing IPL with him has helped his game a lot. He once told us that guys who are successful in T20 are also successful in Test cricket,&#8221; Finch added.</p>
<p>&#8220;They know their game so well and they don&#8217;t go too far away from that. David Warner, Virender Sehwag, Shane Watson and Chris Gayle are guys who are successful in all forms of the game. I think it goes on to show that you just have to play good shots. Even Mahela (Jayawardene&#8217;s) presence helped us a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>His strike-rate in 14 T20 Internationals has been an amazing 167.33 with a highest score of 156 but Finch says it wont be wise to compete with Warner.</p>
<p>&#8220;The day you try to compete with him (Warner) is the day you will lose your career pretty quickly! The reason why he can play those shots is because he is a phenomenal player. He is an unbelievable talent and so I don’t get near those shots too often. He practises quite a bit in the nets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having played with him since their school cricket days have created a comfort level and Finch exactly knows what his job is.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are both very attacking players and I think it helps to take the pressure off each other at different times. T20 is a hard game. Being able to hit the ball right away is quite a challenge. So I am comfortable batting with someone (Warner) who can take the pressure off me and the other way round. I think most teams are so worried about the damage he can do, I just tend to fly under the radar which is a nice feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;While batting together, we don&#8217;t need to talk to each other. I think we have both played so much T20 cricket that we have that feel. When David wants to go, you know it and you just try to get off strike and let him play. I think it&#8217;s that kind of relationship and that kind of partnership that you don&#8217;t need to say much.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something that happens. And it’s a pretty incredible experience when David is on and you just keep yourself safe at the other end,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012485&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Madras High Court restrained Zee News and News Nation channels from telecasting any news linking India cricket captain M S Dhoni with the Indian Premier League (IPL) betting/fixing scam.</p>
<p>The interim order, effective for two weeks, was passed by Justice S Tamilvanan on a defamation suit filed by Dhoni claiming Rs 100 crore damages from the Zee Media Corporation for allegedly telecasting &#8220;malicious&#8221; news that he was involved in betting, spot and match fixing of IPL matches.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am of the view that there is a prima facie case and the balance of convenience is also in favour of the plaintiff. Hence interim injection granted for a period of two weeks,&#8221; the judge said in his order after perusing Dhoni&#8217;s affidavit.</p>
<p>He issued notice to defendants Zee Media Corporation Limited, Zee News Editor and Business Head Sudhir Chaudary, IPS officer G Sampath Kumar (who initially probed the IPL betting scam) and News Nation network private limited.</p>
<p>Dhoni, in his suit, submitted that the defendants had been carrying highly defamatory, scandalous and libellous false reports and statements since February 11, 2014.</p>
<p>The first and second defendants Zee Media Corporation Limited (Zee News) and Sudhir Chaudary, Editor and Business Head of Zee News Channel, Essel Studios, Noida, Uttar Pradesh, in collusion with the third defendant IPS officer G Sampath Kumar have been telecasting and broadcasting and posting in their websites false reports insinuating that Dhoni was involved in illegal activities of betting, match fixing and spot fixing.</p>
<p>Similarly, defendant no.4, News Nation network private limited (News National channel) Noida, UP, joined the tirade against Dhoni and later on went to the extent of stating that Dhoni was summoned by the Tamil Nadu police, which was also utterly false, the affidavit stated.</p>
<p>He charged that actions were done with an intention to project Dhoni as an object of hate and ridicule to the general public. The general public, especially IPL fans of Chennai Superkings in Chennai, have been negatively influenced by the malicious false reports, it claimed.</p>
<p>The sole agenda of the defendants was somehow to malign and destroy the reputation of the plaintiff in the eyes of the millions of his fans and cricket lovers all over the world.</p>
<p>Plaintiff has filed the suit because his fundamental right and personal rights had been breached by the telecast and broadcast of the malicious news.</p>
<p>He sought a permanent injunction restraining the defendants, their associations, sister concerns, agents, officers, correspondents, employees or any other person or entity in print or electronic media or via internet or otherwise from publishing/republishing or in any other manner circulating any news insinuating or denigrating his integrity and honesty as a cricketer except the publication of the news of the exact judicial order if any passed by the court.</p>
<p>Damages are to be paid jointly and severally by all the defendants for an amount of Rs 100 crore, the affidavit said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012467&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has urged the club&#8217;s American owners to agree a new deal with manager Brendan Rodgers as soon as possible.</p>
<p>High-scoring Liverpool are second in the Premier League, four points adrift of Chelsea but with a game in hand, and Gerrard said the Northern Irish manager had proved he was a &#8216;perfect fit&#8217; since joining in 2012.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am absolutely delighted he is here and I hope there is a lot of movement in Boston now because they have got to get him signed up as soon as possible,&#8221; the captain told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, I think he deserves a very long contract here and he is perfect for this club.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liverpool owners Fenway Sports Group signed Rodgers, 41, from Premier League rivals Swansea on a three-year contract to replace sacked Anfield great Kenny Dalglish.</p>
<p>Chosen ahead of bigger name candidates, he was only the 18th manager in the club&#8217;s 120 year history.</p>
<p>Liverpool finished seventh in Rodgers&#8217; first season but have been transformed into a free-flowing team challenging for their first title since 1990.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been a revelation. He keeps tweaking and tinkering with the formation and making little subtle changes to personnel and tactics and it is coming off from week to week,&#8221; Gerrard said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been absolutely blown away by his sessions, his tactics and his maturity in the job. I am learning off him every single day.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is driving the club forward. He manages every single player differently, he knows we have different characters in the dressing room and his man-to-man, one-on-one management is the best I have known.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liverpool humiliated champions Manchester United 3-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday with Gerrard scoring twice from the penalty spot and missing a third.</p>
<p>Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez scored the other for his 25th Premiership goal in 24 games this season. Daniel Sturridge, a Rodgers signing, is second top scorer with 18 goals.</p>
<p>Gerrard said Rodgers had brought out the best in the players through his motivational skills.</p>
<p>&#8220;He makes you go out on the pitch feeling a million dollars,&#8221; Gerrard said of Rodgers.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you have a manager who is making you feel good, but who is also not scared to give you a good one-on-one telling off as well, then he has the perfect ingredients.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012428&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/coulternileapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012424" alt="With the addition of Doug, I think in Mitchell Starc and Nathan Coulter-Nile, we've got three guys who bowl at really good pace, said the Australian skipper (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/coulternileapm.jpg" /></a> &#8220;With the addition of Doug, I think in Mitchell Starc and Nathan Coulter-Nile, we&#8217;ve got three guys who bowl at really good pace,&#8221; said the Australian skipper (AP)
<p>Australia will miss injured paceman Mitchell Johnson but their bowling attack remains potent enough to help them win a maiden World Twenty20 title in Bangladesh, captain George Bailey said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The left-arm quick has been in the form of his life, bowling Australia to an Ashes whitewash of bitter rivals England followed by an impressive performance in the subsequent test series victory in South Africa.</p>
<p>A toe infection, however, means Australia will miss Johnson&#8217;s unnerving pace and the disconcerting bounce he generates from difficult angles as they bid for the only major cricket trophy to have eluded them.</p>
<p>Fellow left-arm paceman Doug Bollinger has been called up as Johnson&#8217;s replacement and Bailey backed him to be a success in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll miss Mitch, no doubt about that,&#8221; Bailey told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just looking at his form over the last six months, he&#8217;s been absolutely unbelievable for us. The last time he was in the subcontinent in the one-day series against India in October, he was really good there.</p>
<p>&#8220;But having said that, (in) Doug Bollinger, as his replacement, I think we&#8217;re really lucky to have that sort of back up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Doug&#8217;s in great touch. He has got some good Twenty20 form and pedigree behind himself and he has got good pace and swings the ball. These are the things which I think would be handy over here.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Good pace</strong></p>
<p>Australia begin their Group B campaign against Pakistan on March 23, boasting a batting order replete with exciting strokemakers including David Warner, Aaron Finch, Shane Watson and the captain himself.</p>
<p>Bailey was equally pleased with the variety in the bowling department.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really happy with the pace battery. In the subcontinent conditions, it&#8217;s important to have really good pace, to have guys swing the ball.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the addition of Doug, I think in Mitchell Starc and Nathan Coulter-Nile, we&#8217;ve got three guys who bowl at really good pace and swing the ball. That&#8217;s really important for us.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess another important thing is you&#8217;ve to finish it well in the other end and all these guys have great skills at death (bowling).&#8221;</p>
<p>Spin bowlers are expected to play a crucial role in Bangladesh&#8217;s slow and low wickets and Bailey said he was spoilt for choice in that department.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we got all bases covered. Brad Hogg&#8230; guess he&#8217;s been around for 30 years. James Muirhead is a really exciting leg-spinner for us.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love the option of having leg-spinners. I think they are match-winners, wicket-takers. They force batsmen to do something different.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;ve got a lot of part-time and back-up spinners. Glenn Maxwell has done a really good job for us in Twenty20 bowling.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s probably no longer a part-time spinner, plays a main role for us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Finch bowls a little bit of leg spin, Cameron White bowls a little bit of leg-spin&#8230; we&#8217;ve got plenty of options there.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012409&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Delhi Daredevils appointed swashbuckling England batsman Kevin Pietersen as their captain for the upcoming IPL with wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik as his deputy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kevin Pietersen will captain the all new look Delhi Daredevils during the seventh edition of the Pepsi Indian Premier League. Wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik would be the vice-captain,&#8221; the Daredevils said in a statement.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old former England skipper was expected to take over as captain given his formidable reputation as a T20s batsman.</p>
<p>He was named the &#8216;Man of the Tournament&#8217; in the 2010 World T20 Championship for helping England bag their maiden crown.</p>
<p>Pietersen joined Delhi Daredevils in 2012 and made an impact with his eight-match outing amassing 305 runs with an average of 61.</p>
<p>He was unavailable in 2013 due to an injury but made it a point to visit the team and spend valuable time with the youngsters in the squad. KP, as he is popularly known, was retained by Daredevils through the &#8216;Matching Card&#8217; option for Rs 9 crore during the players&#8217; auction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel incredibly honoured to have been asked to captain the Delhi Daredevils in this year&#8217;s IPL. I am very much looking forward to working alongside Gary Kirsten. We have a fantastic squad with a good blend of youth and experience and a brilliant coaching set up. We hope to bring our incredible fans a lot of happiness this season,&#8221; Pietersen said on his appointment as captain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Karthik will make his return to the Daredevils after having played with the franchise for the first three years. He was bought by the Daredevils for a mind-boggling Rs 12 crore in the recently-concluded auction.</p>
<p>The wicket-keeper batsman has amassed 1741 runs in 92 IPL appearances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am really thankful and honoured on being appointed as the vice-captain of Delhi Daredevils cricket team. I also thank GMR Group and Delhi Daredevils for having the faith in me,&#8221; Karthik said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking forward to working under legends like Kevin Pietersen and Gary Kirsten and show my full support and faith for the team. I will try and take the team to a newer level and achieve great things,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Team coach Gary Kirsten said the two players would be crucial to the franchise&#8217;s fortunes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking forward to working with Kevin Pietersen as the captain of the Delhi Daredevils. It will be great to have him with us for the full duration of IPL and I have no doubt that he will have a positive and significant impact,&#8221; Kirsten said.</p>
<p>Kirsten said that Pietersen along with vice-captain Dinesh Karthik would form a formidable leadership team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinesh Karthik, who has been appointed as vice-captain will also form part of the leadership team. He has a lot of experience of playing the IPL and he will offer valuable inputs into our game plans and strategies during the tournament,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p><strong>George Bailey appointed KXIP captain</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Kings XI Punjab, one of the eight competing teams of Pepsi IPL season 7, announced George Bailey as the captain to lead the squad in the upcoming tournament.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am extremely honored and excited to lead Kings XI Punjab this season. I would like to thank the franchisee for having faith in me and entrusting me this opportunity. I hope to live upto the expectations of the franchise and its fans and I am looking forward to playing with some of the finest cricketers in the team.” said George Bailey on his appointment as the captain of KXIP. <strong><em>(-ENS)</em></strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012351&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka stalwarts Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene have announced they will retire from international Twenty20 cricket after the World Twenty20 tournament in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Both players led their country to the finals of the World T20, Sangakkara in 2009 in England when Sri Lanka lost to Pakistan and Jayawardene in 2012 in Sri Lanka when his team was beaten by West Indies.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb"><p>Thanks for all the msgs. Right time for me to retire. Gives the selectors more time to build for next T20 WC. Hope to leave with a win!</p>
<p>— Kumar Sangakkara (@KumarSanga2) <a href="https://twitter.com/KumarSanga2/statuses/445473456058953730">March 17, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The batsman has played 50 T20 internationals for Sri Lanka, hitting 1,311 runs at an average of 32.77 and a strike rate of 120.</p>
<p>Jayawardene also 36 and a former captain, is Sri lanka&#8217;s leading run scorer in the format having hit 1,335 runs at an average of 31.78 with a strike rate of 134.17 from 49 T20 internationals.</p>
<p>Wisden India quoted Jayawardene as saying he too had decided it was time to go: &#8220;The rationale is pretty much the same as Sanga&#8217;s,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it is clear that I can&#8217;t see myself playing in the next ICC World T20, there wasn&#8217;t much point in me occupying a spot. It makes more sense for a youngster to come into the mix and establish himself,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012142&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/davidmoyesapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012122" alt="Manchester United, who last failed to qualify for the Champions League 18 years ago, have no guarantees at all of achieving their aim against the Greeks (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/davidmoyesapm.jpg" /></a> Manchester United, who last failed to qualify for the Champions League 18 years ago, have no guarantees at all of achieving their aim against the Greeks (AP)
<p>If history was the only deciding factor then Manchester United would be highly fancied to overturn their 2-0 first leg defeat against Olympiakos and reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the reality for manager David Moyes and his stuttering team is that present form, rather than past successes, will have a far bigger influence at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>United&#8217;s unimpressive season reached a new low on Sunday when they were crushed 3-0 at home by bitter rivals Liverpool, a result that left last season&#8217;s champions seventh in the Premier League with just a remote possibility of a top-four finish.</p>
<p>Their only realistic hope of competing alongside Europe&#8217;s elite next season would now appear to be by somehow winning the competition for a fourth time in May, starting by knocking Olympiakos out on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The players are well aware of what it means on Wednesday and what we have got to do,&#8221; Moyes said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got something to go for so hopefully we can do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Misfiring United, who last failed to qualify for the Champions League 18 years ago, have no guarantees at all of achieving their aim against the Greeks who have just won their domestic title for the fourth successive season, the 16th time in 18 campaigns they have ended as champions and the 41st in all.</p>
<p>Their head-to-head record, and the Greek side&#8217;s woeful record on the road against English clubs, does offer hope.</p>
<p>Until Olympiakos triumphed in Athens on Feb. 25, United had won all four of the previous matches between the clubs.</p>
<p>They have also won all five matches they have played against Greek clubs at home while Olympiakos have lost all 11 of the matches they have played in England.</p>
<p>That sorry sequence began with a 4-0 loss at West Ham United in the old European Cup Winners&#8217; Cup in 1965 and has continued since with subsequent defeats at Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool (twice), Newcastle United, Chelsea, Manchester United (twice) and  Arsenal (three times).</p>
<p>But they arrive at Old Trafford buoyed by a comprehensive title victory, even if Sunday&#8217;s 2-0 win over Panthrakikos was achieved behind closed doors.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic superiority</strong></p>
<p>While United have been in the unfamiliar position of looking up at the leading pack in the Premier League, the Piraeus club have been head and shoulders above their domestic rivals this season.</p>
<p>Spanish coach Michel is not getting carried away with their chances of reaching the last eight for the first time since 1999.<br />
&#8220;We aim to do what we always do and that is concentrate on our own game,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know our opponents very well and we know that 2-0 is not a serious advantage. We need to score to make sure we make it difficult for them as we know that United have a strong desire to turn the tie around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michel has to choose between former Argentina forward Javier Saviola, who missed the first leg due to injury and who would make his 100th appearance in European club competition, and Paraguayan Nelson Valdez for the lone attacking role in place of Nigerian striker Michael Olaitan.</p>
<p>Olaitan was kept in hospital for a week following his dramatic collapse during the Athens derby against Panathinaikos on March 2 due to viral myocarditis, but although he has no serious condition he is not yet ready for action.</p>
<p>Defensive midfielder Ivan Marcano is also expected to be fit after being rested over the weekend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael will be missed because against United he was amazing,&#8221; said Michel.</p>
<p>Among those United will be keeping a close eye on is 21-year-old Joel Campbell, the Costa Rican international who is on loan from Arsenal.</p>
<p>He scored an excellent goal to seal the 2-0 win in Athens and caused the creaky United defence problems with his pace and movement.</p>
<p>Moyes could shake up his team following Sunday&#8217;s defeat with Nani, Javier Hernandez and Jonny Evans all training again after injuries.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2012119&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/fottball-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011951" alt="Drogba’s last kick for Chelsea, a penalty, won the English side their only Champions League title two years ago. (file)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/fottball-main.jpg" /></a> Drogba’s last kick for Chelsea, a penalty, won the English side their only Champions League title two years ago. (file)
<p>Former Chelsea great Didier Drogba does not know how he will react when he returns to Stamford Bridge with his Galatasaray team on Tuesday for their Champions League last-16 second leg, the Ivorian striker said.</p>
<p>Drogba won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups and, most memorably, the 2012 Champions League when his penalty in the shootout clinched victory for the Londoners against Bayern Munich in the final at the Allianz Arena.</p>
<p>He scored 157 goals in 341 appearances for Chelsea between 2004-12 and was voted the greatest player in the club&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>“It is the club where I experienced everything,” Drogba told the UEFA website (www.uefa.com). “I experienced the highest level, big games &#8211; it allowed me to get closer to the best players in the world.</p>
<p>“It is a very special moment because I do not know what my reaction will be. I am quite apprehensive about it,” he said of the second leg after the opening match in Istanbul ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>Jose Mourinho looked close to tears after being given a rapturous welcome by the Stamford Bridge faithful when he returned for his second stint as manager at the start of the season but he believes Drogba deserves even more adulation from the fans. “I think I&#8217;m allowed to say that I will receive a warm welcome because I know Chelsea&#8217;s fans and our relationship is really special,” said Drogba.</p>
<p>Mourinho brought Drogba to Stamford Bridge from Olympique Marseille and the pair clearly share a special bond.</p>
<p><strong>GREAT FORWARD</strong></p>
<p>“When Chelsea were thinking of signing me it was Mourinho who came to see me,” said the 36-year-old forward. “He said, &#8216;If you want to be a great forward like Thierry Henry or Ruud van Nistelrooy you have to come and play for me.“It&#8217;s true that I was a good player in the French League at the time but he made me one of the best in Europe. That&#8217;s why I, for Jose, was capable of going to the ends of the earth.”</p>
<p>Drogba&#8217;s successor as the leader of the Chelsea attack, Fernando Torres, gave his side the lead in the first half in Istanbul. Galatasaray were outplayed in the opening period but they forced Mourinho&#8217;s men on to the back foot in the second half and earned a deserved draw thanks to an equaliser from Aurelien Chedjou.</p>
<p>The Turkish team are the underdogs but Chelsea must clear their heads quickly after Saturday&#8217;s meltdown at Aston Villa. they lost 1-0, had Brazil midfielders Willian and Ramires red-carded and Mourinho was also sent from the dugout in the closing stages. Galatasaray warmed up for the trip to Stamford Bridge by drawing 0-0 at Karabukspor on Friday. Roberto Mancini&#8217;s side are second in the Turkish championship, five points adrift of leaders Fenerbahce. Drogba believes that if Galatasaray are firing on all cylinders they are capable of knocking Chelsea out.</p>
<p>“If we are focused, if we are well physically, then we can make it difficult for many great teams,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>ISCO MAY START FOR MADRID</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Real Madrid &#8212; who have all but sealed a place in the Champions League quarter-finals after their 6-1 first-leg away victory over Schalke &#8212; could hand Isco another opportunity to prove his worth in the return on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The playmaker has not been able to hold down a regular place in Carlo Ancelotti&#8217;s side since his big-money move from Malaga.</p>
<p>Since then, however, it has not gone according to plan for Isco who has not been able to find a role in Real&#8217;s expensively assembled squad. Part of the reason is that after a slow start to the season, the Ancelotti has found success with a 4-3-3 formation that does not ideally suit Isco&#8217;s attributes of picking the passes behind the forwards.</p>
<p>Isco was given the chance in midfield against Malaga at the weekend with Angel Di Maria left on the bench as he was only a booking away from a suspension.</p>
<p><strong>Timings: </strong><em>Real Madrid vs Schalke 01:15 am on TEN Sports; Chelsea vs Galatasaray 01:15 am on TEN Action &amp; Ten HD</em></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011950&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nba-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011947" alt="Griffin (C) had 21 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists on his 25th birthday as Clippers beat Cavaliers 102-80. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nba-main.jpg" /></a> Griffin (C) had 21 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists on his 25th birthday as Clippers beat Cavaliers 102-80. (AP)
<p>Blake Griffin had 21 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists on his 25th birthday as the Los Angeles Clippers held off the Cleveland Cavaliers 102-80 Sunday for their 11th consecutive victory.</p>
<p>Chris Paul had 15 assists and scored 11 of his 16 points in the final 6:04 for the Clippers, who haven&#8217;t lost since Feb. 21. Los Angeles matched the longest winning streak in the NBA this season, equalling 11-game runs in November by Portland and San Antonio.“This stretch of games that we&#8217;ve played and we&#8217;ve been successful, has been a huge team effort,” Griffin said. “With our team, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s one guy that&#8217;s making us go. I genuinely believe it&#8217;s been a total team effort.”</p>
<p>The San Antonio Spurs kept their own win streak alive, topping the Utah Jazz 122-104 for their 10th straight victory.Argentine star Manu Ginobili scored 21 points, Tony Parker had 18 points and Tim Duncan 16 for the Spurs (50-16), who became the first NBA team to 50 wins this season. The Western Conference-leading Spurs shot a season-high 62.8 percent from the field.</p>
<p>At Oklahoma City, the Dallas Mavericks stopped a seven-game, regular-season losing streak to the Thunder with a 109-86 victory.</p>
<p>Shawn Marion scored 19 points, Vince Carter added 18 and Dirk Nowitzki 17 for the Mavericks, who became only the third Western Conference team to win this season in Oklahoma City, joining the Trail Blazers and Clippers. Kevin Durant scored 30 points for the Thunder — his 26th straight game of 25 points or more, the longest such streak since Michael Jordan did so in 40 straight games during the 1986-87 season.</p>
<p><strong>MIAMI STOP SLIDING</strong></p>
<p>In the Eastern Conference, the Miami Heat stopped their worst skid in three years with a 113-104 win over the Houston Rockets. Ray Allen scored 14 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter and LeBron James and Dwyane Wade each scored 24 for the defending champions Heat, who won for just the second time in their last seven games. The Heat were down 97-92 following a 3-pointer by James Harden midway through the fourth, but finished the game on a 21-7 run.</p>
<p>Harden finished with 30 points and Dwight Howard added 21 points and 14 rebounds for the Rockets, who&#8217;ve dropped three straight.</p>
<p>The Golden State Warriors pulled within 1 1/2 games of Portland for the fifth seed in the crowded Western playoff standings with a 113-112 win over the Trail Blazers. Stephen Curry scored 28 of his 37 points in the second half and Klay Thompson made the go-ahead 3-pointer with 11.1 seconds remaining to lead Golden State.</p>
<p>In other games, New Orleans&#8217; Anthony Davis set career highs with 40 points and 21 rebounds as the Pelicans edged the Boston Celtics 121-120 in overtime. Davis became the first player in team history to have at least 40 points and 20 rebounds in the same game.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves beat the Sacramento Kings 104-102, getting 26 points and 10 rebounds from Kevin Love.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Suns handed the Toronto Raptors their first loss at home since Feb. 27, winning 121-113, and the Charlotte Bobcats defeated the NBA-worst Milwaukee Bucks 101-92 for their fourth straight victory.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011944&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india16.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011946" alt="Chris Gayle has been nominated as the ‘batting captain’ of the West Indies side, led otherwise by skipper Darren Sammy." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india16.jpg" /></a> Chris Gayle has been nominated as the ‘batting captain’ of the West Indies side, led otherwise by skipper Darren Sammy.
<p>Team West Indies have decided to share the burden of defending the World T20 title. So, captain Darren Sammy and coach Ottis Gibson won’t be the only ones breaking their heads over plans or strategies. A delegation of responsibility means Chris Gayle is the batting leader, Ravi Rampaul is in-charge of the bowling unit while wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin will have a big say in field positioning.</p>
<p>So flexible is the West Indies leadership that in case the game situation demands Sammy to field on the fence, ODI skipper Dwayne Bravo, stationed closer to the action, will call the shots.</p>
<p>The plan to share responsibilities may not be unique to the West Indies squad alone, but skipper Sammy believes it will help every player to be involved in the game all the time. “The sharing of responsibilities give players a good idea of what is to be done on the field and everybody is clear about what is needed to be done and once you are clear in your head you can execute the plans better,” Sammy said. The team think-tank hopes that by having more brains at work, players will be able to work out ways to achieve consistency, a trait that is not associated with the team from Caribbean.</p>
<p>Between the final of the previous World T20 and ahead of the current one, defending champions West Indies have played 13 Twenty20 Internationals. Of these, they have won seven and lost six, one of which happens to be against Ireland less than a month ago. This win-loss record wouldn’t have inspired confidence in fans as West Indies arrived in Dhaka to defend their World T20 title.</p>
<p>A glance at how they won their title in Colombo nearly 18 months ago shows that West Indies had struggled with consistency even then. A couple of years ago, they beat England but lost to Australia and Sri Lanka. The two defeats pushed them to the brink and it was only a Super Over win over New Zealand that saw them qualify for the semifinal.</p>
<p><strong>Shortest format success</strong></p>
<p>However, they were a different beast from there on. They thrashed Australia by 74 runs in the semifinal and beat Sri Lanka in the final by 36 runs despite scoring just 137. They are eighth on the Test as well as ODI ranking tables, but in the Twenty20 format, where rankings matter little on any given day, the West Indies have found success. Their big six-hitters and wily spinners make them favourites for any tournament they enter. In Tests, they have lost four of their last five games, three of them being innings defeats. Former captain Clive Lloyd, exasperated by their lack of fight in the Tendulkar send-off Test series, said that the West Indies looked ‘drunk’ on Twenty20.</p>
<p>The win over Sri Lanka in the final of the previous edition, the success of the first edition of the Caribbean Premier League and the rise in the stock of West Indian players in the Indian Premier League have made the 20-over format central to their cricketing universe.</p>
<p>In Dhaka, they have been clubbed along with two previous winners from the subcontinent, India and Pakistan, and Australia, a side that can never be written off. But Sammy is confident of retaining the title.</p>
<p><strong>Growth and experience</strong></p>
<p>“I think we have grown as a team since the last edition. Our guys have more experience (playing in leagues around the world) and the belief is high,” he says. Last time around, the West Indies side believed they had the potential to win but didn’t want to get too ahead of themselves.</p>
<p>“It (the belief) is a little bit more vocal than it was in 2012. Last time we knew we had a chance of winning and we believed silently in the dressing room. This time we are not afraid to say we could go out and win that title,” Sammy said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011942&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nicorosbergreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012021" alt="Nico Rosberg of Germany (C) sprays champagne beside second-placed Red Bull Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo of Australia (L) and third-placed McLaren Formula One driver Kevin Magnussen of Denmark after the Australian F1 Grand Prix (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nicorosbergreutersm.jpg" /></a> Nico Rosberg of Germany (C) sprays champagne beside second-placed Red Bull Formula One driver Daniel Ricciardo of Australia (L) and third-placed McLaren Formula One driver Kevin Magnussen of Denmark after the Australian F1 Grand Prix (Reuters)
<p>Nico Rosberg said Mercedes would have to work hard to improve the reliability of their new F1 car despite his emphatic win in the season-opening Australian Grand Prix.</p>
<p>While Rosberg was dominant in his fully functioning W05, his pole-sitting team-mate Lewis Hamilton lasted only four laps before a misfiring cylinder ended his race.</p>
<p>World champion Sebastian Vettel was also an early retiree after power problems in his Red Bull, underlining this year&#8217;s unpredictability as teams grapple with new hybrid technology.</p>
<p>“Despite our success, we also know that there is still some work to do,” said Rosberg, who streaked away from third on the grid for a wire-to-wire victory.</p>
<p>“We saw over the weekend that reliability is still a concern and it prevented us from having a strong two-car finish.</p>
<p>“We have two weeks to improve that. I am very much looking forward to (the next race in) Malaysia and I would love to race again tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Red Bull&#8217;s Daniel Ricciardo was disqualified from second place for violating fuel rules, in another illustration of the challenges facing teams this year.</p>
<p>But McLaren were rewarded for getting both their cars to the finish line, with debutant Kevin Magnussen classified second and Jenson Button third after Ricciardo&#8217;s disqualification. “We know that reliability will be crucial to this long season and we will be working hard to improve the situation for the race in Malaysia,” said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff.</p>
<p><strong>Costly Hiccup</strong></p>
<p>Hamilton, the 2008 world champion and the pre-race favourite after a thrilling drive in qualifying, said Mercedes would learn from their “costly hiccup”.<br />
“Of course I&#8217;m disappointed with my own race and when I think about all the work that has gone on back at our factories, it&#8217;s tough to have a costly hiccup,” he said. “However we have achieved an incredible amount to get here, to be at the front and to be so competitive. We will bounce back and learn from this.</p>
<p>There is a very long way to go this season.”</p>
<p>Rosberg claimed his fourth grand prix win but with the sport in so much flux, he is far from raising hopes of emulating his father Keke&#8217;s 1982 world championship win.</p>
<p>However, Rosberg drew great encouragement from the performance of his “unbelievably quick” car, which finished nearly 25 seconds ahead of Ricciardo. “I always dreamed of having such a strong Silver Arrow and now it seems we are there,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Aussie GP boss raps ‘quiet cars’</strong></p>
<p>Melbourne: Australian Grand Prix organisers have complained to Formula One commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone about the quieter V6-powered cars and say their reduced volume may have breached race contracts with Formula One management.</p>
<p>Australian Grand Prix Corporation (AGPC) Chairman Ron Walker had already expressed his misgivings to Ecclestone, the organiser&#8217;s CEO Andrew Westacott told Fairfax radio on Monday.</p>
<p>Westacott said the quieter cars had taken something away from the F1 spectacle for fans at the race. “One aspect of it was just a little bit duller than it&#8217;s ever been before and that&#8217;s part of the mix and the chemistry that they&#8217;re going to have to get right,” Westacott said on Monday. “Ron spoke to (Ecclestone) after the race and said the fans don&#8217;t like it in the venue. “We pay for a product, we&#8217;ve got contracts in place, we are looking at those very, very seriously because we reckon there has probably been some breaches.”</p>
<p>The season-opening Grand Prix in Melbourne raised the curtain on F1&#8242;s technological revolution, which includes new turbocharged hybrid engines. Some pundits have bemoaned the quieter cars, saying they preferred the more robust noise of the previous V8 engines. Team principals of the major F1 outfits shrugged off the change, saying fans would get used to it. <em>(Reuters)</em></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011935&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india15.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011940" alt="Rohit Sharma could well be seen as a middle-order batsman again. File" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/india15.jpg" /></a> Rohit Sharma could well be seen as a middle-order batsman again (File)
<p>With a host of T20 batting game-changers in the side, India can be expected to consistently compile match-winning scores or chase down tall targets. But for that to happen, the Indian team management needs to know the strength of their batting stars and fix a perfect slot for them in the batting line-up. Getting the batting order right, then, will be biggest challenge for the team in this World T20.</p>
<p>India have played just one T20 International in over a year. In that game against Australia at Rajkot last year, the batting order was: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Suresh Raina, Virat Kohli, Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin followed by the pacers. All of these batsmen are part of the current World T20 squad. Dhoni, not known for radical team selections decisions, might stick to the same combination. But a bit of an experiment wouldn’t harm the team. It could actually do them a world of good.</p>
<p>First the bowling tweak. Wickets in Mirpur are expected to suit the spinners. So instead of playing three medium-pacers, like in Rajkot, Dhoni can field two and accommodate an extra batsman or an additional spinner. If he picks a slow bowler, it has to be the leg-spinner Amit Mishra. The other option at his disposal is to bring in medium pacer Stuart Binny. Adding Binny to the playing XI wouldn’t mean a major shake up. It just will mean a specialist pacer sitting out.</p>
<p><strong>Good headache</strong></p>
<p>But it is the presence of in-form Ajinkya Rahane in the squad that might make things difficult for Dhoni. It gives him a problem of plenty and a delicious dilemma. In case Rahane gets included, the established order will have to be reshuffled. Rahane has been a regular and also a highly successful opener for his Indian Premier League side, Rajasthan Royals.</p>
<p>Last season he scored 488 runs for the Royals at the top of the order against some of the best bowlers in the world. In the season before that he made 560 runs. When he made his ODI debut against England in 2011, Rahane was the first to pad up. The Mumbai lad might bat lower down the order in the longer format but in T20 he is very comfortable facing the new white ball. But if Rahane is to occupy the top slot, one of the openers will have to drop down the order.</p>
<p>And that opener could perhaps just be Rohit Sharma. Rohit, who has been opening the batting in ODIs over the past year and a half, has played in the middle-order with a fair amount of success earlier. He occupies a middle-order slot for the Mumbai Indians. He has also proved to be adept in the role of a finisher when he turned out for his previous team, the Deccan Chargers.</p>
<p>Moving Rohit down the order and adding Rahane at the top will result in India fielding eight batsmen, including Jadeja. In this scenario, India will have a plethora of finishers down the order in Yuvraj, Raina, Dhoni himself, Rohit and Jadeja.</p>
<p><strong>Team man</strong></p>
<p>“Right now, I am not thinking about any batting number or position,” Rahane said. “I just want to go out there and enjoy my cricket and just back myself. I know that I have been playing well in T20 for Rajasthan Royals batting at the top but here the decision is completely up to the team management. I am not thinking about that. Whatever opportunities I get, I will try and score runs and contribute towards the team.”</p>
<p>The opportunity may be available in one of the two practice games that India will play — the first on Monday versus Sri Lanka and the second on Wednesday versus England.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011938&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/paulstirlingapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011998" alt="Paul Stirling’s 60 came off just 34 balls with the help of nine boundaries and one six (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/paulstirlingapm.jpg" /></a> Paul Stirling’s 60 came off just 34 balls with the help of nine boundaries and one six (AP)
<p>Paul Stirling struck a blistering half-century to guide Ireland to a three-wicket win over Zimbabwe in a Qualifying Group B match of the ICC World T20 in Sylhet on Monday.</p>
<p>Chasing a challenging 163 for five set by Zimbabwe, Stirling (60) and skipper William Porterfield (31) got Ireland off to a blazing start and shared 80 runs off just 8.2 overs for the opening stand to set the platform for the win.</p>
<p>Stirling’s 60 came off just 34 balls with the help of nine boundaries and one six, while Porterfield laced his 23-ball knock with three fours and one hit over the fence.</p>
<p>Going strong at 100 for two, Ireland lost their next five wickets in a hurry to make life difficult for themselves towards the end with medium-pacer made Tinashe Panyangara (4/37) doing the bulk of the damage.</p>
<p>After Stirling’s dismissal, Ed Joyce (22), Andrew Poynter (23) and big-hitting Kevin O’Brien (17) did the bulk of the scoring but failed to ensure the victory for Ireland as they all became victims of Panyangara.</p>
<p>But Ireland finally managed to scamper home in the final delivery of their innings with Stuart Thompson remaining unbeaten on three off six balls.</p>
<p><strong>Nearly a Super over finish</strong></p>
<p>The match could well have gone into a Super Over had Zimbabwe’s ‘keeper-captain Taylor hit the stumps after star-bowler Panyangara managed to sneak in a ‘dot’ ball to batsman Alex Cusack. Cusack missed his shot, but scrambled for a single as the good length ball reached Taylor behind the stumps.</p>
<p>Then Taylor aimed for a run-out, but as and when he missed, non-striker Thompson had grounded his bat over the crease to clinch the bye and Ireland had won the match by the narrowest of margins.</p>
<p>Earlier, sent into bat, Zimbabwe rode on skipper Brendan Taylor’s 46-ball 59 to reach 163 for five from their alloted 20 overs.</p>
<p>Apart from Taylor, Elton Chigumbura (22 not out), Hamilton Masakadza (21), Sean Williams (16) and Vusi Sibanda (16) made significant contributions with the bat.</p>
<p>Left-arm orthodox bowler George Dockrell (2/18) and off-spinner Andy McBrine (2/26) shared four wickets between them for Ireland.</p>
<p>Ireland will play UAE in their next qualifying match on Wednesday here, while Zimbabwe will be up against Netherlands.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Zimbabwe 163 for five in 20 overs (Brendan Taylor 59, Elton Chigumbura 22, Hamilton Masakadza 21; George Dockrell 2/18, Andy McBrine 2/26) lost to Ireland 164 for seven in 20 overs (Paul Stirling 60, William Porterfield 31, Andrew Poynter 23, Ed Joyce 22; Tinashe Panyangara 4/37, Tendai Chatara 1/20, Sean Williams 1/27) by three wickets</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011932&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/novakdjokovicapm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2012011" alt="Novak Djokovic closed the gap in his head to head record against Roger Federer to 16-17 (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/novakdjokovicapm1.jpg" /></a> Novak Djokovic closed the gap in his head to head record against Roger Federer to 16-17 (AP)
<p>Novak Djokovic came into Indian Wells for the first time in four years without a title. He left with a $1 million check and his first trophy of the year, beating Roger Federer 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (3) on Sunday to win the BNP Paribas Open for the third time.</p>
<p>“Not winning a title and coming here, there were certain doubts,” Djokovic said. “I had ups and downs in my concentration in opening rounds, but I managed to stay mentally strong and have that self-belief. That&#8217;s something that definitely makes this title very special to me.”</p>
<p>Federer rallied from a break down and a 5-3 deficit in the third set to force the tiebreaker, but he made a slew of mistakes to lose the 33rd meeting between the rivals.</p>
<p>Federer still leads the series 17-16, having beaten Djokovic in three sets in the semifinals at Dubai two weeks ago. Djokovic will remain No. 2 in the world, while Federer will rise three spots to No. 5 on Monday in the ATP Tour rankings.</p>
<p>Flavia Pennetta routed injured Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2, 6-1 to win the women&#8217;s title, the biggest of her career.</p>
<p>Federer was trying to win a record fifth title in the Southern California desert, and at 32, he would have been the oldest Masters 1000 winner since 34-year-old Andre Agassi won at Cincinnati in 2004.</p>
<p>But Djokovic wouldn&#8217;t allow it.</p>
<p>After Federer breezed to the first set in 31 minutes, Djokovic earned the lone break of the second set to go up 5-3 after Federer pulled a forehand wide.</p>
<p>“I know he always comes out confident, aggressive,” Djokovic said. “He doesn&#8217;t give you the victory; you have to earn it,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Early break</strong></p>
<p>Djokovic got the early break in the third, again on one of Federer&#8217;s forehand errors, to lead 2-1. His 112-mph (180 kph) ace gave him a 4-2 lead, and he extended it to 5-3 with a backhand winner down the line.</p>
<p>But Federer then served a love-game to make it 5-4 and broke Djokovic to tie the set, 5-all.</p>
<p>“I was able to just keep the pressure on Novak and show him that if he slips up, I will be there and I will make it a very competitive match in the end for him,&#8221; Federer said.</p>
<p>In the tiebreaker, however, the Serb raced to a 5-1 lead, helped by four errors from Federer, and closed it out when Federer&#8217;s backhand landed in the net.</p>
<p>“At the end, he made sure he kept the ball in play and I might have made a few too many errors when it really mattered,” Federer said.</p>
<p><strong>Career comeback</strong></p>
<p>A year ago, Pennetta was close to retiring from tennis. The Italian veteran&#8217;s ranking plunged to 166th in the world in June, and she had struggled to rebuild her career after having right wrist surgery the previous August.</p>
<p>Now she&#8217;s glad she stuck around.</p>
<p>“After so many years, so much work and everything, this is the moment I always waited for,” she said. “And it&#8217;s coming when you don&#8217;t expect. It was something I was waiting since long time, and finally I have a good trophy in my hands.”</p>
<p>Actually, the crystal trophy was so heavy, she didn&#8217;t hoist it for photographers.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Italian became the third-oldest winner of the tournament after Martina Navratilova, who won at age 33 and again at 34 in 1990-91. It was Pennetta&#8217;s first title since winning at Marbella in 2010.</p>
<p>“We are old, but we still good athletes,”Pennetta said. “We are strong. We have so many years on the tour, and we know how to handle the emotion and everything.”</p>
<p>As the 20th seed, Pennetta became the lowest seed to win the title. She came in ranked 21st and is projected to rise to No. 12 in the world Monday in the WTA Tour rankings. She beat top-seeded Li Na in the semifinals on her way to the title.</p>
<p>Radwanska, seeded second, was bothered with a left knee injury in the final. She twice called for the trainer in the second set and had her knee heavily taped. She was in tears apologizing to the sympathetic crowd afterward, saying she was unable to run.</p>
<p>The Pole said she hurt her knee a few days ago in practice. “I just didn&#8217;t expect it was going to be much worse today,” she said. “But when the pain is so big that nothing is working —no painkillers, no tape — that means it is bad.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011927&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Timothy Gruijters is not a happy man. Having made way for Tom Cooper in the Netherlands squad for the World T20 in Bangladesh, all-rounder Gruijters released a statement on Youtube on Monday, claiming that he was ‘forced and bullied into undergoing a back scan’ so that Cooper could join the squad at the last minute.</p>
<p>Cooper had been playing for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield, but as his side, the Redbacks, failed to make the final, the batsman was freed off his duties earlier than expected.</p>
<p>The ICC approved of the replacement (as only injured players are allowed to be switched after the squads are announced, and Gruijters had a long standing problem with his back) and featured in the match against UAE on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>The full transcript of Gruijters’ allegations follows:  </strong></p>
<p>This message has been recorded for the ICC, the KNCB and all the followers of Dutch Cricket. It explains why I had to leave the Dutch squad just before the world T20 2014, and how Tom Cooper could join.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Timothy Gruijters. I would have played in the Dutch cricket team had it not been for the fact that the Dutch coaching staff decided to bend the rules, act against the spirit of cricket, and basically cheat. Let me give you the facts.<br />
Fact number one, on Thursday, March 13, Tom Cooper became unexpectedly available for the Dutch team after narrowly missing out on the Sheffield Shield Final. Tom Cooper is probably the best batsman eligible to play for the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Fact two. On the same day, some teammates and I had talked about Tom’s availability. We all agreed that noone was injured; so it would be impossible for Tom Cooper to play.</p>
<p><strong>Behind closed doors</strong></p>
<p>Fact three. The next morning, March 14, the coaching staff called me to their room. They told me that I would have been in the first eleven had Tom Cooper not been available. We need someone to be injured they said; we need you to have a scan so that we can get the ICC’s approval.</p>
<p>Fact four. I was forced and bullied into having the scan. The scan showed I have a bad back; no surprise there, I’ve had a bad back for years &#8212; just like others have had bad shoulders, and bad knees. Like all sportsmen, I’ve learnt to deal with the limitations and the pain. In fact, my back is better than it has been in a while. I think I’m in the best form possible for the tournament.</p>
<p><strong>The Cooper angle</strong></p>
<p>So there you have it. Yes I have a bad back, I’ve had it for years. But I’ve learnt how to deal with it and made my way into the first eleven for the T20 World Cup. It is a fact that I would never have been forced to go for a scan had Tom Cooper not been available.</p>
<p>I have an injury, but it would not have stopped me playing. It’s clear that the Dutch coaching staff decided to misuse the rules, hoodwink the ICC, and get Tom Cooper in for me. It’s a disgrace, it’s a cheat, and I would like to state that I do not want to be part of any of it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011928&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cricket-main1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011849" alt="India's batsman Virat Kohli is bowled out during their ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup warm up match against Sri Lanka. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cricket-main1.jpg" /></a> India&#8217;s batsman Virat Kohli is bowled out during their ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup warm up match against Sri Lanka. (AP)
<p>Indian team&#8217;s batting woes continued in the familiar sub-continental conditions as they lost their opening warm-up tie of the ICC World T20 against Sri Lanka by five runs, here on Monday.</p>
<p>Batting first, Sri Lanka scored 153 for six and then bowled out India for 148 in exactly 20 overs.</p>
<p>Needing 12 off the last over bowled by Lasith Malinga, Indians could get only six as the Lankan slinger finished with figures of 4/30 from four overs. Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni did not bat in this unofficial match.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s inability to finish a close match again came to the fore as the likes of Suresh Raina (41), Yuvraj Singh (33) and Virat Kohli (17) all failed to convert their starts.</p>
<p>Ravichandran Ashwin&#8217;s all-round show (3/22 and 19 runs) was the lone bright spot in the opening encounter.</p>
<p>India were off to a disastrous start as Shikhar Dhawan (2) played a lazy shot off Kulasekara to be holed out at mid-off while Rohit Sharma (4) was caught at the deep mid-wicket boundary off a Malinga delivery.</p>
<p>Raina looked more comfortable on a low-bounce track as he played those customary lofted shots in the region between extra cover and mid-off. He also lofted Kulasekara for a six over mid-wicket.</p>
<p>He was looking good for a big knock as he reached 41 with the help of five fours and a six. But the 31st ball he faced saw him fail to reach to the pitch of the delivery. Ajantha Mendis was the bowler and Raina couldn&#8217;t clear Rangana Herath at long off boundary.</p>
<p>Ajinkya Rahane offered a simple return catch to Sachitra Senanayeke as India were in deep trouble at 56 for four.</p>
<p>Yuvraj was having a bit of trouble initially reading Senanayeke&#8217;s deliveries but he broke the shackles by coming down the track to hit left-arm spinner Rangana Herath over long-on for a six. He also picked up Mendis&#8217; carom ball early to hit another six over long on.</p>
<p>Kohli started off on a promising note smacking 17 off only eight balls as the duo added 32 runs in quick time before Malinga struck.</p>
<p>Coming back for his second spell, Malinga got Kohli to play away from his body and he dragged it back onto the stumps. Yuvraj was gone trying to steer Kulasekara and Sangakkara took a fine diving catch behind the stumps.</p>
<p>The left-hander hit two sixes and two fours in his 28-ball stay at the crease. Once Yuvraj was gone, it was difficult for the others to finish the game.</p>
<p>Earlier, Ashwin gave a good account of himself as two-time finalists Sri Lanka upped the ante in the end to put on a competitive total after being sent into bat.</p>
<p>Ashwin ended with impressive figures of three for 22 in his four-over spell as the batsmen had lot of trouble playing their strokes on a slowish track at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.</p>
<p>Amit Mishra (1/38 from four overs) got some stick but also bowled a few good balls while Raina (1/12) was lucky to get a wicket.</p>
<p>Nuwan Kulasekara with 21 off 14 balls and Thisara Perera with 18 from 11 deliveries added 30 runs in the last three overs to take the score past 150.</p>
<p>Among the pacers, Varun Aaron worked up good pace in his three overs to end with one for 18 as Mahela Jayawardene (30) and skipper Dinesh Chandimal (29) were the only ones in the top-order, who looked like scoring a few runs.</p>
<p>Bhuvneshwar Kumar was taken for 17 runs in his final over as he finished with figures of none for 33 from three overs.</p>
<p>Mohammed Shami&#8217;s inspiring effort in the field definitely helped in lifting the spirit of the team. Having bowled an over at full tilt, the speedster stationed at mid-off dived full stretched to take a brilliant one-handed catch that dismissed Kusal Janith Perera (21) off Aaron&#8217;s bowling.</p>
<p>Dilshan, on the otherhand, looked ill at ease both against pacers as well as spinners as he simply could not get off the blocks.</p>
<p>Jayawardene, however, looked attacking from the start as his mistimed pull shot off Shami went over Dhoni&#8217;s head for a boundary.</p>
<p>But the very next shot was a beauty as he bisected the point and gully fielder to find another boundary.</p>
<p>When Ravindra Jadeja was introduced into the attack, Jayawardene muscled him behind square leg boundary for a six.</p>
<p>The veteran right-hander slog swept leggie Amit Mishra over square leg for another maximum.</p>
<p>But Mishra had his revenge off the very next ball when he varied the length. He altered it by a feet and Jayawardene was induced into playing early offering an easy return catch which Mishra had no problems in pouching.</p>
<p>Finally, Dilshan&#8217;s misery ended when he was adjudged leg before after being struck on the frontfoot trying to flick an Ashwin delivery. Sangakkara played the worst shot among the top order batsmen as he literally gifted Raina a wicket.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011848&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Lionel Messi scored a hattrick to pace Barcelona&#8217;s 7-0 rout of Osasuna in the Spanish league on Sunday, ensuring the defending champions stayed in striking distance of leader Real Madrid before their critical ‘clasico&#8217; match next Sunday.</span></p>
<p>In the process Messi, who now has 371 goals in all competitions, over took Paulino Alcantara as Barcelona&#8217;s all-time leading scorer. Paulino had scored 369 goals in 357 matches as a Barca player between 1912 and 1927.</p>
<p>Messi netted from close range to open the scoring at Camp Nou in the 18th minute. Alexis Sanchez made it 2-0 four minutes later before Andres Iniesta scored just his second goal of the season in the 34th.</p>
<p>Messi struck twice more in the second half, either side of Cristian Tello&#8217;s goal, to give him a team-leading 18 league goals this campaign, before he set up Pedro Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Barcelona&#8217;s win left it in third place, four points behind Madrid, ahead of their meeting in the Spanish capital next week.</p>
<p><strong>Atletico keep pace</strong></p>
<p>CRISTIANO Ronaldo scored his Spanish league-leading 25th goal to give Real Madrid a lackluster 1-0 win at Malaga on Saturday, when the pacesetters extended their unbeaten run to 30 matches in all competitions. Diego Costa made sure Atletico Madrid stayed within three points of its crosstown rivals by scoring his 22nd league goal of the season in a 1-0 win at home over Espanyol.</p>
<p>Ronaldo netted the winner in the 23rd minute, and a tired-looking Madrid team was fortunate Malaga failed to muster a comeback after pushing the visitors into their area for the final 10 minutes. Third-place Barcelona will enter Sunday’s match against Osasuna seven points behind Madrid in the league standings. The two powerhouses are set to clash in the Spanish capital next weekend.</p>
<p>Madrid’s win was tarnished by the loss of Karim Benzema to a thigh injury after colliding with Ronaldo in the first half. “We suffered, above all in the second half,’’ Xabi Alonso said. “These are three important points. There are 10 games left and we have to play each one like it’s the last.’’</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Rayo Vallecano beat Almeria 3-1 to provisionally escape the relegation zone with a third consecutive victory, while Celta Vigo earned an entertaining 1-0 win at Levante.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011443&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/suarez.jpg"><img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/suarez.jpg" alt="Liverpool&#039;s Luis Suarez celebrates after scoring against Manchester United, during their English Premier League soccer match at Old Trafford Stadium, Manchester, England, Sunday, March 16, 2014.

(AP Photo)<br />
<span style="line-height:1.5em;">Two Steven Gerrard penalties helped Liverpool to a crushing 3-0 victory at bitter rivals Manchester United on Sunday to leave them breathing down the necks of Premier League leaders Chelsea. Gerrard’s strikes either side of halftime put the visitors in control and Luis Suarez sealed only Liverpool’s second win at Old Trafford in nearly 10 years with a well-taken third.</span></p>
<p>Skipper Gerrard could have completed a rare hat-trick of spot kicks but struck the foot of the post after Nemanja Vidic was red-carded for tripping Daniel Sturridge shortly before Suarez completed the rout. With nine matches remaining to Chelsea’s eight, Liverpool’s run of five consecutive league wins has left them four points behind Jose Mourinho’s side who were beaten 1-0 at Aston Villa on Saturday having had two men sent off.</p>
<p><strong>Derby win for arsenal</strong></p>
<p>Also, Tomas Rosicky’s thunderous strike after 72 seconds was enough to secure a precious 1-0 derby victory for Arsenal over Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday to rekindle their Premier League title hopes. Consecutive away league defeats had seen Arsenal lose ground at the top but they held off a spirited second-half revival by Spurs to move to join Liverpool on 62 points, four behind leaders Chelsea who were beaten at Aston Villa on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tottenham were caught on the counter-attack with only a minute on the clock and when the ball dropped to Rosicky 25 metres out on the right he lashed the ball first time into the top corner of Hugo Lloris’s goal.</p>
<p>Liverpool, seeking a first English title since 1990, could have won by an even bigger margin as they underlined the incredible turnaround in fortunes for English’s football’s two great north west rivals.</p>
<p>They ended last season 28 points behind champions United, who managed one shot on target on Sunday, but are now 14 clear of David Moyes’ side who now look almost certain to finish outside the top four for the first time.</p>
<p>“I got a bit cocky with the third penalty,” Gerrard told Sky Sports. “I’ve come here many times and been played off the park and but to come here and dominate like we did, we’re even a bit upset we didn’t get more goals. I don’t think their defence has ever had a more difficult 90 minutes.” Gerrard’s first penalty after 33 minutes followed a deliberate handball by Rafael that could have earned the defender a second yellow card, while his second shortly after the break was for a clumsy Phil Jones challenge on Joe Allen.</p>
<p>United’s day went from bad to worse when Vidic sent Sturridge sprawling in the area with a lunging tackle and though Gerrard could not beat de Gea again Suarez’s neat finish after 84 minutes capped a dazzling Liverpool display. Vidic now has four red cards against Liverpool in his United career, more than any other player against one opponent in the history of the Premier League. United’s ninth defeat of the season, a new record for the club in the Premier League, left them languishing in seventh place with 48 points.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011442&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The Swiss master has already won the Indian Wells title four times and made it through to a fifth final.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011439&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic set up another mouthwatering final at the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells after winning their semis on Saturday. Federer ended the giant-killing run of Ukrainian Alexandr Dolgopolov when he cruised to a 6-3 6-1 victory in a one-sided semi-final that lasted just a tick over an hour.</span></p>
<p>Then Djokovic succeeded in blunting the booming serve of John Isner to beat the American 7-5 6-7(2) 6-1 and join Federer in Sunday’s championship match. It will be the 33rd time overall and the ninth time in a final that the pair have locked horns. Federer holds a 17-15 lead in their head-to head matches and they are tied 4-4 in finals.</p>
<p>The Swiss master has already won the Indian Wells title four times and made it through to a fifth final without dropping a set in the California desert this week. Relaxed and super confident after winning his 78th singles title in Dubai earlier this month, Federer pounced on Dolgopolov from the outset, breaking him once to snatch the opening set.</p>
<p>“I was ready physically, mentally,” said Dolgopolov. “I wasn’t nervous much, but I wasn’t sharp enough. My concentration was going away for maybe one, two points every game, and you can’t afford to have that in these matches.”</p>
<p>The Ukrainian had beaten three higher ranked players, including world number one Rafa Nadal, to reach the semis but was powerless to stop the 32-year-old Federer, who fired down seven aces in a brilliant serving performance.</p>
<p>“(It was) tough conditions for both of us,” Federer said in a courtside interview.</p>
<p>“I think I really served well when I had to and that allowed me to take more chances. Alexandr’s had a wonderful tournament so it’s really a big win for me today. I was going for it and I served a lot of aces, it was one of the best serving performances of my career.”</p>
<p>Later, at his news conference, Federer said he was in a good frame of mind, having made his third final this year. “Now it’s just a matter of keeping that up, taking the right decisions not to overplay, not to underplay, and enjoy yourself. Because at the end of the day, it’s also very important,” he said.</p>
<p>Isner upset Djokovic in the semi-finals at Indian Wells two years ago but the Serbian was better prepared this time. The key to beating the 6ft 10in (2.08metre) Isner has always revolved around how his opponents cope with his devastating serve. The wind had died down shortly after Federer wrapped up his victory over Dolgopolov and Djokovic had to save three set points on his serve in the 10th game of the opening set.</p>
<p>But in the following game, Djokovic broke Isner’s serve for the first time then serving out the set. Djokovic twice had the chance to serve out the match in the second but faltered each time as Isner forced a tiebreak, which he won to set off a deafening roar in the stadium.</p>
<p>Sunday’s women’s final will be contested between Poland’s Agnieszka Radwanska and Italian veteran Flavia Pennetta.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011439&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[In season opener, Red Bull’s Ricciardo disqualified after finishing second; Mercedes’ Rosberg wins.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011428&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Formula One’s season-opening race ended in rancor and controversy Sunday as initial second-place finisher Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull disqualified for a breach of fuel regulations, five hours after Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg took the checkered flag.</span></p>
<p>Ricciardo’s exclusion from the results tarnished what had been a day of celebration for local fans, who were jubilant that the Red Bull driver had apparently become the first Australian to finish on the podium at his home race.</p>
<p>However just before midnight, stewards ruled that Ricciardo’s car had “exceeded consistently the maximum allowed fuel flow’’ and that the team refused an instruction from the race’s technical delegate Charlie Whiting to change the fuel-flow sensor before the race and a further request during the race to reduce the fuel flow.</p>
<p>Red Bull immediately announced it would appeal the decision.</p>
<p>“Inconsistencies with the FIA fuel flow meter have been prevalent all weekend up and down the pit lane,’’ a Red Bull statement said. “The team and (engine supplier) Renault are confident the fuel supplied to the engine is in full compliance with the regulations.’’</p>
<p>The exclusion capped a day of shocks at the Albert Park street circuit.</p>
<p>Thought Rosberg’s victory was little surprise, given Mercedes had been the dominant team in preseason testing and across the race weekend in Melbourne, few would have expected pole sitter Lewis Hamilton and defending four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel to be mere onlookers after half a dozen laps.</p>
<p>Both Hamilton and Vettel suffered engine failures, illustrating the difficulties all teams are having getting performance and reliability out of the sport’s new V6 hybrid engines. Ricciardo’s disqualification meant Kevin Magnussen was promoted to second in his debut race, ahead of his McLaren teammate Jenson Button, giving the team a bright start to the season and the lead in the constructors’ championship after a very disappointing 2013.</p>
<p>Rosberg started third on the grid and was first to reach turn one, then drove away from the field to eventually win by 24.5 seconds at the Albert Park street circuit. The margin of victory and the authority of the performance showed why Mercedes is considered a strong favorite to finally win its first constructors’ title this season.</p>
<p>“I had an unbelievably quick car today,’’ said Rosberg, whose world champion father Keke won the inaugural Australian F1 GP in 1985. “It was such a pleasure to drive, it’s such a great feeling and I really look forward to the new races.’’</p>
<p><strong>Hamilton disappointment</strong></p>
<p>Rosberg’s delight was a contrast to the disappointment on the other side of the garage as Hamilton quickly retired a car that was only firing on five cylinders.</p>
<p>“We looked so strong but to then have a hiccup is tough for everyone, but we will bounce back,’’ Hamilton said.</p>
<p>Like Mercedes, Red Bull was on one hand celebrating a strong performance in the opening race while also harboring concern about the engine problems that caused the retirements of their top drivers.</p>
<p>“We learned the car is quick, we just need to get everything together,’’ Vettel said. “No doubt we’ll fix this issue, the question is how soon?’’</p>
<p>Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso finished fourth in a worryingly uncompetitive performance for the Italian team, while Williams driver Valtteri Bottas recovered from losing a wheel early in the race to finish fifth; pulling off a succession of impressive passing moves that showed the strong potential of the car.</p>
<p>Force India’s Nico Hulkenberg and Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen — in his return to the team after six years away — finished sixth and seventh respectively, ahead of the Toro Rosso pair Jean-Eric Vergne and Daniil Kvyat. After Ricciardo’s exclusion, Force India’s Sergio Perez was promoted to the final points-paying position in 10th.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old Kvyat’s 10th place made him the youngest driver ever to earn an F1 point, breaking Vettel’s record set at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. The 21-year-old Magnussen was the second-youngest driver to claim a podium finish, behind Vettel’s record at the 2007 US Grand Prix.</p>
<p>Despite fears that few cars would complete the race due to a series of reliability problems in preseason testing and over this weekend, 15 of the 22 racers finished. There was only one major accident, with Caterham driver Kamui Kobayashi slamming into the back of Felipe Massa’s Williams at the first corner, immediately ending the race for both drivers.</p>
<p>Magnussen’s heady performance for a rookie driver illustrated why McLaren put such faith in him.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011428&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ireland’s cricketers at the World T20 were glued to internet television in their hotel rooms in Sylhet watching their rugby team win the Six Nations title on Saturday. The 22-20 win over France in Paris has shifted the focus away from the cricketers, who play their first game of the World T20 (qualifying game against Zimbabwe at Sylhet on Monday). But that is only a momentary diversion for Sunday.</p>
<p>Monday is Saint Patrick’s Day, a public holiday in Ireland. It is also the day on which Ireland knocked out Pakistan in the 50-over World Cup in 2007, their biggest feat on a cricket field. Following up on the Six Nations high is something that the Irish cricketers have in mind as they begin their campaign.</p>
<p>“Brilliant win yesterday in Paris, no better way to send @BrianODriscoll off. Hope we can follow their lead with a win tomorrow,” George Dockrell, the left-arm spinner, tweeted. Dockrell was referring to Ireland centre O’Driscoll, who retired after the title with 133 caps.</p>
<p>“Fitting end yesterday to a great career for #BOD. Hopefully we can round off a good St. Paddys weekend tomorrow,” 22-year-old all-rounder Stuart Thompson tweeted.</p>
<p><strong>Stars missing</strong></p>
<p>Team Ireland are here without a couple of senior pros. Boyd Rankin, the fast bowler, now turns out for England, and Eoin Morgan might just captain the Three Lions if regular skipper Stuart Broad remains injured. Also, Trent Johnston, Ireland’s most inspirational captain, has retired. All three were part of that famous win against Pakistan. Though the squad may be a touch inexperienced on the bowling front, they do have the services of Ed Joyce, a man who was part of the England set-up during the 2007 World Cup but has shifted back to his country of birth before the previous edition.</p>
<p>“There are a few nerves jangling around,” Joyce said on the eve of the game versus Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>However, the conditions in Sylhet, which are more ‘European’ (the ground is inside a tea estate) will tilt the balance in Ireland’s favour, Joyce said. Coach Phil Simmons, the former West Indies all-rounder, said that the ‘green wicket’ is a good sign for Ireland. “It is St Patrick’s Day and there is green on the wicket. You never know. There could be shades of that Pakistan win.”<br />
Memorable past</p>
<p>Kevin O’Brien, one of only three players from the 2007 World Cup squad who is at this World T20, hoped that this would be another St Patrick’s Day to remember. “Paddy’s day has been kind to us and I hope it is a good omen for when we play Zimbabwe. We have serious ambitions to go all the way in the tournament,” Brien told the News Letter.</p>
<p>Brien’s ambitions though high may not be completely misplaced. Ireland have already qualified for the 50-over World Cup in 2015 and are the top-ranked nation among the qualifiers. They also wisely spent the run-up to the World T20 in the Carribean, conditions closer to what it is in Bangladesh, rather than practice in the cold back home. The Irish will also take inspiration from their victory over West Indies, the defending World Champions, at Sabina Park last month.</p>
<p>“We’ve not been able to celebrate the rugby yet because the boys have stayed focused on Monday’s game against Zimbabwe. But if we win on St Patrick’s Day, we will surely make up for it,” Cricket Ireland team manager Barry Chambers said on Sunday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011424&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Debutants Nepal produced a dominating all-round performance to crush Hong Kong by 80 runs in a Qualifying Group A match of the World T20 in Chittagong on Sunday.</p>
<p>Sent into bat, Nepal first rode on batting heroics from Gyanendra Malla (48) and skipper Paras Khadka (41) to post a competitive 149 for eight and then left-arm spinners Shakti Gauchan and Basant Regmi scalped three wickets apiece to bowl out Hong Kong for 69 runs.</p>
<p>Nepal will next play hosts Bangladesh in their crucial last Group A encounter, again in Chittagong, on Tuesday and the winner of that match will seal a place in the main round of World T20.</p>
<p>Bangladesh had defeated Afghanistan by nine wickets earlier in the day, which means the other Group A match between Afghanistan and Hong Kong on Tuesday is just a formality.</p>
<p>At the Zahur Ahmed Choudhury Stadium on Sunday, Nepal made a bright start to their innings after being put into bat with the opening duo of Subhash Khakure (22) and Sagar Pun (13) adding 36 runs for the first wicket.</p>
<p><strong>Leading from the front</strong></p>
<p>After Khakure and Pun’s dismissal in quick succession, Malla and captain Paras took the onus on themselves to guide the Nepal innings and stitched a crucial 80 runs off just 65 balls for the third wicket to set the platform the Himalayan nation.</p>
<p>Malla scored his 48 off 41 balls with the help of four fours and one six, while Khadka’s knock came off 37 deliveries and was laced with four boundaries.</p>
<p>For Hong Kong, pacer Haseeb Amjad picked up three wickets for 25 runs, while left-arm orthodox picked up two wickets giving away 26 runs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sports.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2011417" alt="Bangladesh players celebrate after Shakib Al Hasan dismissed Afghanistan’s Najeeb Tarakai during World T20 qualifier match in Dhaka.

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">On the eve of Bangladesh’s opening game against Afghanistan, the curtain-raiser for this World T20, Shakib Al-Hasan liked what he saw on the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium central square. The slow surface promised a good outing for spinners and hence, also for Bangladesh. It was a perfect platform for the hosts, a team with a tradition of producing wily spinners, to avenge their recent Asia Cup loss to Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p>Shakib said that the team was so confident that there was a strong belief in the dressing room that the Afghanistan could be restricted to a below-100 score. By bowling out Afghanistan for just 72 in a match his side won by nine-wickets, Shakib and Bangladesh had not overestimated their spin strength.</p>
<p>Shakib’s 3/8 and Abdur Razzaq’s 2/20 foxed the Afghanistan batsmen, helping their team register a much-needed and confidence-boosting win &#8212; a performance that gave a rousing start to their campaign of hosts of the fifth World T20. The success of any event depends on the performance of the local team. The noisy celebrations by the fanatical supporters meant this was a perfect lung-opener for the much-anticipated event.</p>
<p>It would be fair to say that nothing went Afghanistan’s way on Sunday. Though, it was the Bangladesh spinners who did most of the damage, it was pacer Mashrafe Mortaza who started it all.</p>
<p>Off the first ball of the match, Afghanistan opener Mohammad Shahzad was sent back to the hut. Big-hitter Shahzad, as always, was a man in a hurry. He quickly took guard as if it was an unnecessary formality. Seconds later, the WorldT20 was off to a flying start. Mortaza was much faster than what Shahzad had expected. After meeting the bat, the ball didn’t get the elevation Shahzad intended and went only as far as Mahmudullah, who completed a tumbling catch after running towards covers from mid-off. The attempted shot over the boundary ropes was the beginning of a big slide.</p>
<p><strong>Choke slam</strong></p>
<p>Bangladesh, ecstatic with this early breakthrough, immediately went on to employ spin to choke Afghanistan out of runs and the match. Shakib came on in the fourth over, not long after Gulbadin Naib had hit two fours against medium-pacer Al-Amin Hossain. He tried to hit Shakib out of the ground but Sabbir Rahman spilled the chance at long-on. Naib’s next shot revealed the Afghanistan batsman’s mind-set on the day.</p>
<p>They would try and hit out of trouble against spin. Naib used the slog-sweep and got a top edge that floated in the air till Rahman made up for his mistake this time around. Next ball, to put Shakib on a hat-trick, Najeeb Tarakai decided to play against the spin and gave an easy catch to Nasir Hossain in the covers.</p>
<p>To complement Shakib’s left arm spin, Bangladesh introduced Mahmudullah and Abdur Razzak, off-spinner and left-arm spinner respectively. The scoring rate dropped and wickets fell. Skipper Mohammed Nabi didn’t spot the arm-ball from Razzak and was trapped in front. Samiullah Shenwari, one of the heroes of that famous win in Fatullah earlier this month, paid the price for staying back to Razzak and fell LBW.</p>
<p>Then, there were two runs out. Both came about as a result of the poor judgement from batsmen struggling to counter Bangladesh’s strength — spin.</p>
<p>Afghanistan were bowled out in just 17.1 overs for 72. They were 36 for four in the sixth over, slightly worse off than their predicament at Fatullah in the Asia Cup against the same opponents. Then, a sixth-wicket partnership of 164 had helped them post 254 and pull off their greatest ODI win yet. But there was no fight back from the Afghans on Sunday. Bangladesh knocked off the runs in 12.1 overs for the loss of just one wicket, not taking the opposition for granted this time around.</p>
<p>For Afghanistan, it was a day that they learnt an important lesson. If they thought that T20 cricket was all about big hits, they were wrong. The game’s shortest format is also about showing patience at the start and keeping wickets in hand for the assault later.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011414&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[India's other challenger Gaganjeet Bhullar continued his downward spiral after a great opening round. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011407&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Shiv Kapur overcame his blues on the front nine and turned in a five-under 67 that catapulted him to tied fourth after the third round of the Trophee Hassan II golf here. Kapur is now eight-under for three days but as many as nine shots behind the runaway leader, Alejandro Cañizares (69) at Golf du Palais Royal.</span></p>
<p>India&#8217;s other challenger Gaganjeet Bhullar continued his downward spiral after a great opening round. After a first day 67, he has had 73 and 74 on next two days and is now tied 38th. While Kapur had six birdies and just one bogey on front nine, Bhullar after a nightmarish start of double and a triple bogey on the first two holes, recovered on the back nine with two birdies an eagle on par-5 17th. Kapur had three birdies on each stretch and just one bogey on fourth.</p>
<p>Canizares takes a huge six-shot lead into the final round of the Trophee Hasan II as he chases a first European Tour title for eight years. A third round of 69 was enough for Cañizares to extend his overnight lead from one shot to six over playing partner Seve Benson of England.</p>
<p>Kapur&#8217;s round of 67 was the joint best of the day and he was ecstatic with his showing on the front nine, where he had a tough time on first two days. “It was nice to play the front nine for a change. The first two days I played the back nine really well and then struggled my way around the front. I got off to a good start though the conditions were a bit tricky with the way the pins were. You got to take the medicine and the play to the heart of the green,” he said.</p>
<p>He added, “I definitely take the position that I am in now after being four over for the first eight (in the first round) and it looked like an early flight home. And now here I am at eight-under par and in the thick of things. I can&#8217;t really complain.”<br />
Big gap up front</p>
<p>Speaking on Canizares being way ahead of the field at 17-under, Kapur said: “There&#8217;s rally nothing I can do, especially on a golf course like this, where you have to play percentages. The set up, the way around it; it&#8217;s a little bit like a Major where the pins are tucked and near the water and near bunkers and like that.</p>
<p>“Sometimes even 70-80 yards out you are playing 20-30 feet to the left or the right of the flag. So you cant really push and force things. You take what you get. You don&#8217;t hope for anything bad for the leaders, but you just hope the leaders falter and you take your chance from there. I really like this course and have been coming here from the time it started. The way the set up is it is brilliant. The green complex is fantastic, it makes you think. It is not like target practice and I like it.”</p>
<p>Cañizares&#8217; only previous European Tour victory came in the Russian Open in 2006 on only his third start. Asked if he felt the tournament was now his to lose, Cañizares added: “In this game anything can happen. Everybody saw that you can go low on this golf course, I have to keep moving forward and not look over my shoulder.”</p>
<p>The three-time Challenge Tour champion Benson, who carded a round of 74 to slip back to 11 under par, will now need to make up a six shot deficit if he is to secure his maiden European Tour title. Dutchman Robert-Jan Derksen a further stroke back after his 67, which was the only bogey-free round of the day.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011407&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Karnataka's success this season has been based more on a sum of all parts rather than a major dose of individual brilliance.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011401&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the Vijay Hazare Trophy under their clasp, Karnataka have now completed a rare treble in Indian domestic cricket. Along the way, they&#8217;ve had a former captain and legend gushing-even if he might not have witnessed most of their feats in person.</p>
<p>While in South Africa as a commentator for India&#8217;s Tests, Rahul Dravid spent an ample amount of his off-TV time checking Karnataka&#8217;s progress.</p>
<p>Always one for history, the former India captain would recall the two previous great eras of Karnataka cricket while lauding the achievements of Vinay Kumar&#8217;s team. He also made a point about how this present lot was a polar opposite of the ones that had dominated domestic cricket before. Dravid should know after all, having been an integral part of the power-packed side that won three out of four Ranji Trophy titles in the mid-90s.</p>
<p>A team that boasted of a roster full of stars, from Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad to Anil Kumble and Sunil Joshi. Just like the bunch buoyed by the likes of Erapalli Prasanna, GR Vishwanath and Bhagwath Chandrasekar that proved to be the only challengers to the dominance of Bombay and Delhi in the 1970s and 80s.</p>
<p>In contrast, the present mix is bereft of a starry presence. Robin Uthappa and Kumar are the only household names and among the four to have donned India colours.</p>
<p>Their success this season has been based more on a sum of all parts rather than a major dose of individual brilliance. Their narrow win over Railways in the VHT final was symbolic of that with Abhimanyu Mithun chipping in with four wickets and Karun Nair holding his nerve in the chase. This, after veterans Uthappa and Kumar had led the way with bat and ball in the overall statistics.</p>
<p>In the Ranji Trophy, they had only one bowler in Mithun among the top 15 wicket-takers while KL Rahul with over 1000 runs was the lone man in the top-10 run-getters&#8217; list. Crucially though, someone or the other always put their hand up when push came to shove.</p>
<p>Their heroes ranging from Nair scoring three back-to-back centuries leading up to the final, Kumar&#8217;s five-wicket burst against Punjab in the semi-final, and Shreyas Gopal and HS Sharath excelling with the ball in their debut seasons.</p>
<p>Having produced almost as many international cricketers as Mumbai and Delhi, Karnataka has historically been looked at as more a breeding ground for world-beating talent, resulting in their progress as a domestic team being overshadowed. And Dravid&#8217;s not the only one left gushing over their return.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Karnataka beat Railways for 3rd consecutive Vijay Hazare title to go with Ranji, Irani wins.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011396&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It turned out to be a little laborious, but Karnataka showed the required grit to complete an historic treble. By defeating Railways by four wickets in the Vijay Hazare Trophy final at the Eden Gardens, becoming the first side to hold all three major domestic trophies at the same time. Earlier this year, they had earlier won the Ranji Trophy and Irani Cup.</span></p>
<p>The celebrations were not very ecstatic but the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) added colour to it by painting the players red and green. After all, the country was celebrating Holi. “It&#8217;s a great achievement and we achieved it because we have a special team. The best thing is that every player in this side wants to play for India. I would rate this Karnataka team as one of the best ever,” captain R Vinay Kumar said.</p>
<p>Karnataka were almost home and dry after Railways were all out for a paltry 157 in 47.4 overs on a two-paced Gardens wicket. But the underdogs fought back brilliantly, taking the first five Karnataka wickets for just 47 runs. In-form Robin Uthappa started off well with back-to-back fours off Anureet Singh in the first over of the chase.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult start</strong></p>
<p>His opening partner Mayank Agarwal then clobbered Krishnakant Upadhyay for a couple of boundaries in the very next over and Karnataka raced to 21 for no loss in quick time. But Uthappa&#8217;s dismissal to an outswinger from Upadhyay started the slide as Agarwal, Vinay Kumar, Manish Pandey and Ganesh Satish departed inside just 29 balls. Railways suddenly sniffed an unlikely victory. They, however, had very little to bowl with. Karnataka basically needed just one decent partnership, and the impressive KL Rahul and Karun Nair provided that with a 66-run stand for the sixth wicket.</p>
<p>Rahul survived a very confident leg before shout from Karn Sharma when he was on 12 but umpire C Shamshuddin turned it down and Railways didn&#8217;t have another opportunity till the 21-year-old played a little early and was caught and bowled by Chanderpal Saini for 38. By then, the danger was averted. The youngster was ready to bide his time, playing 72 balls and looked very organised throughout.</p>
<p>Another young batsman, 22-year-old Nair, remained unbeaten on 53 off 86 balls. A fluent stroke-player, he eschewed his attacking intent to play a very mature innings. This was his third half-century in List A games and by far the most important.</p>
<p>Earlier, it was a hugely disappointing batting display from Railways after they were asked to bat first. Amit Paunikar has had been scoring runs in this tournament but today he got out cheaply as he tried to run down a Vinay Kumar delivery that was angled in. A leading edge and Ganesh Satish took a simple catch at mid-on.</p>
<p><strong>wicket not unplayable</strong></p>
<p>Paunikar&#8217;s opening partner Shivakant Shukla, however, was the bigger let down. A painstaking 46-ball 21 gave an impression that the pitch was very difficult for batting. The odd ball stopped and a few rose awkwardly off a length but the wicket was not unplayable. Railways lacked batting application. After getting his eye in, Shukla threw it away, pulling a half-tracker from Uthappa straight to Satish at deep backward square leg.</p>
<p>Mahesh Rawat could have upped the ante, but Uthappa dismissed him with a beauty and then Abhimanyu Mithun got into the act. The medium pacer removed Ashish Yadav and Karn Sharma in his second spell to ensure that there was no middle-order resistance from Railways. He returned with four for 19 from 9.4 overs to bag the Man of the Match award.</p>
<p>Railways also suffered by dropping Jonathan Rongsen down the order at No. 7. He had scored 58 under pressure against Tamil Nadu. Today also, he batted with purpose. There were three fours in his 57-ball 46, but he kept the fielders busy with his running between the wickets.</p>
<p>Jonathan&#8217;s association with Amit Mishra yielded 38 runs for the eighth wicket and then he added another 34 runs with Anureet Singh for the ninth wicket. Railways&#8217; innings had just 11 fours in 286 balls. They were too defensive and paid for it.</p>
<p>“Yes, I would say the batters froze on the big occasion, but it&#8217;s an inexperienced side and the players will learn from their mistakes. We lost the final alright, but we&#8217;ve a lot of positives to take from this tournament. In fact, this season has given us prominence,” Railways coach Abhay Sharma said. Starting as rank outsiders, they indeed played some very good cricket here till they were outclassed by the team of the tournament.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: Railways 157 all out in 47.4 overs (Rongsen Jonathan 46, Arindam Ghosh 33; Abhimanyu Mithun 4/19, R Uthappa 2/19) lost to Karnataka 158/6 in 43 overs (Karun Nair 53 not out, KL Rahul 38; Krishnakant Upadhyay 3/30, Anureet Singh 2/41) by 4 wickets</strong></p>
<p><strong>We will target quadruple: Vinay Kumar</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It is due to Karnataka&#8217;s “bigger goal” of having as many representatives as possible in the Indian that the southern side is presently reaping the benefits at the domestic level.</span></p>
<p>They completed a historic treble today by winning the Vijay Hazare Trophy at the Eden Gardens. They had earlier won the Ranji and Irani trophies.</p>
<p>Describing the performance as a great milestone, Karnataka skipper R Vinay Kumar said: “The mantra is nothing different. In our side everyone wants to play for India. Once they have a bigger goal, small things fall in place.”</p>
<p>He rated this Karnataka side as the best ever. “If you see, every day different players are performing for us. We are not banking on any particular individual, we have been combining well as a side. I think this is the best ever side.”</p>
<p>The out-of-favour India medium pacer said they would now look to achieve a qudraple of titles by winning the Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 beginning next month. “Yes, that will be in our mind. But we want to go step by step. We take one match at a time and give our best. The rest falls in place.”</p>
<p>The biggest gain for Karnataka has been out-of-favour India batsman Robin Uthappa&#8217;s coming to form as the opener has smashed three centuries and one fifty to top the run charts with 536 runs at an average of 76.57.</p>
<p>Among youngsters, Nair, who made his Ranji debut this season, has impressed with his maiden List A century as he totalled 309 from eight innings, while wicketkeeper Lokesh Rahul, too, impressed with his glovework and batting.</p>
<p>Vinay Kumar spearheaded the bowling well, topping the list with 28 scalps, while the final&#8217;s Man of the Match Abhimanyu Mithun excelled with 13 wickets from six matches.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011396&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">On a high after two big wins, five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand will take on former challenger and in-form Vladimir Kramnik of Russia in the fourth round of the Candidates chess tournament in Khanty-Mansiysk.</span></p>
<p>Starting with a fine victory over rating favourite Levon Aronian of Armenia, an easy draw as black against Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and a win against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan has put Anand in front of the eight-player pack on 2.5 points from three games.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early days to reach any conclusions with 11 rounds still to come in the event that will decide the challenger for Magnus Carlsen for the next World championship match.</p>
<p>However, Anand has certainly proved that there is a lot left in him by showing tremendous motivation, skill and all-round display of competitive chess he has been known for over the years.</p>
<p>Sunday brings the first of the four rest days and it will give Anand a chance to get some rest before he takes on the Russian brigade in the next four rounds.</p>
<p>Starting with Kramnik, Anand will meet Dmitry Andreikin and Sergey Karjakin before the second rest day arrives. Given the form Anand is in, a victory in the next three rounds will help strengthen his position at the top.</p>
<p>Kramnik and Peter Svidler share the second spot with two points each and both have displayed high quality chess thus far. The two were part of a timeless masterpiece in the third round wherein Kramnik did a &#8216;Houdini&#8217; to come out unscathed from what looked like a lost position.</p>
<p>Svidler&#8217;s sole victory came against Andreikin, the lowest ranked player, but he has been involved in some lively chess thus far that makes him a feared opponent.</p>
<p>Aronian and Topalov stayed on a 50 per cent score after a nail biting draw in the third round. While Aronian lost one and won one, Topalov is the only player who has drawn all games thus far.</p>
<p>karjakin, andreikin trail</p>
<p>Topalov&#8217;s battle against Anand was the only tame draw wherein the Indian showed good preparation after sacrificing a pawn and gave no chances as black.</p>
<p>The Russian duo of Sergey Karjakin and Andreikin has some catching up to do as they both have one point. Karjakin was outdone by Kramnik in round two and will have to recover quickly if he has to make an impact. For Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, it has been a bad beginning but a lot can change as he gets into the groove.</p>
<p>The Candidates thus far has belonged to Anand and if the Indian ace keeps up the momentum there is no stopping him.</p>
<p>What will happen in remaining rounds will unfold in due course, for now its &#8216;advantage Anand&#8217;.</p>
<p>Pairings round 4: V Anand (Ind, 2.5) v/s Vladimir Kramnik (Rus, 2); Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze, 0.5) v/s Dmitry Andreikin (Rus, 1); Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 1) v/s Veselin Topalov (Bul, 1.5); Levon Aronian (Arm, 1.5) v/s Peter Svidler (Rus, 2).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2011393&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/nepal.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2010874" alt="Nepal’s Gyanendra Malla plays a shot during a warm-up cricket match against Ireland ahead of the Twenty20 World Cup Cricket in Fatullah, near Dhaka, Bangladesh, Wednesday, March 12, 2014.

<p>Within days of the World T20 tickets going on sale, Nepal’s opening game was sold out.</p>
<p>Every time Nepal takes the field in the coming days in Bangladesh, their politicians will wear the team colours to parliament.</p>
<p>Players from Nepal might be brushing shoulders with the game’s top stars for the first time but the Himalayan nation’s love affair with cricket did not happen overnight.</p>
<p>Nepal’s captain Paras Khadka, who has been part of the national side since 2004, believes the team will take inspiration from the heroes’ welcome it received on arrival in Katmandu after qualifying for the World T20.</p>
<p>“We have an amazing number of fans back home. The fan-following, especially after we qualified for the World T20, matches up to any Test-playing nation’s,” Khadka said.</p>
<p>This is the second instance when cricket in Nepal has taken centrestage.</p>
<p>“When we played in the Under-19 World Cup in 2000, the nation was behind us. We rubbed shoulders with the Mohammad Kaif-led India side that included Yuvraj Singh. But we lost our way again as one of our main sponsors (an Indian media company) pulled out after promoting the game for a couple of years. But now, after qualifying for the World T20, we have regained lost ground,” said former Nepal player Aamir Akhtar, who was part of the Under-19 squad of 2000.</p>
<p>Akhtar is now director of the company that is launching the Nepal Premier League (NPL) and he believes the tournament will help promote the game in the region.</p>
<p>The NPL will be played at venues from Dhangadi in the far west, Biratnagar in the southeast and Rajbiraj close to the Indian border. Six corporate groups have invested in owning teams in a country where football remains the No.1 sport.</p>
<p>Unlike most smaller cricketing nations that bank on expatriates from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka to form their teams, the Nepal story is different.<br />
“All the players are Nepalese, there are no expatriates in our side and that makes our success unique. Us qualifying for the World T20 has revived interest in cricket in our nation. Our political leaders will be cheering for the team, along with the common fans. This has never happened before,” says Akhtar, an all-rounder in his playing days.</p>
<p>Nepal has also reached out for advice and support to their more experienced neighbours. Amrit Mathur, a former manager of the Indian team and secretary at the Sports Authority of India, is the international consultant of the Cricket Association of Nepal. Last year, Mathur helped arrange the senior Nepal team’s tour of India during which they were hosted by the Delhi and District Association and played matches against a DDCA XI.</p>
<p>“The Asian Cricket Council has also played a big role in developing the sport. The ACC have appointed a Sri Lankan coach (Pubudu Dassanayake), which has made a difference. The core of the current national squad has also played together for a long time. The ambassador of India to Nepal is also supporting cricket in Nepal,” Mathur said. Dassanayake’s experience of coaching Canada when they qualified for the 50-over World Cup in 2007 and 2011 came in handy.</p>
<p>However, the sport has a long way to go in terms of infrastructure, which makes the team’s qualification for the World T20 a struggle against the odds.</p>
<p>“Two years ago CAN drew up a plan to qualify for the World T20. The core group of players were given $250-$300 per month so that they could focus on cricket. That said, in terms of infrastructure we have a long way to go. There is only one turf wicket in the whole country, in Kathmandu,” Akhtar said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010826&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Manchester City overcame the early sending-off of captain Vincent Kompany to beat Hull 2-0 thanks to goals by David Silva and Edin Dzeko on Saturday, keeping the team in touch with Premier League leader Chelsea. Silva curled home the opening goal in the 14th minute, just as City was reorganizing following a straight red card to Kompany in the 10th.</p>
<p>City’s defense held firm and Silva set up Dzeko for the second in the 90th minute. Manuel Pellegrini’s team reduced the gap to Chelsea to six points with two games in hand. Chelsea plays later Saturday at Aston Villa. City was playing three days after losing to Barcelona, so the last thing the visitors needed was to be reduced to 10 men early on.</p>
<p>Pellegrini reacted by dropping holding midfielder Javi Garcia back into defense alongside Martin Demichelis but the changes had no adverse effect, with City going ahead four minutes later. Yaya Toure slipped a short ball through to Silva, who curled a brilliant shot inside the post from 25 yards.</p>
<p>Pablo Zabaleta almost doubled the lead when he sent a dipping volley against the underside of the bar in the 31st minute. From then on, it was mostly Hull on the attack, without seriously testing City goalkeeper Joe Hart. David Meyler had a goal disallowed for offside, Jake Livermore shot just wide from 20 meters and, just after the break, Jelavic didn’t get enough purchase on a free kick as Hart easily saved.</p>
<p>Fernandinho spurned a great chance for the City in the 72nd when he ran onto Silva’s deflected shot, but all alone in the penalty box, he screwed a left-footed shot wide. Minutes earlier, Hart escaped a red card after motioning his head toward George Boyd after the Hull midfielder tumbled under a challenge by the goalkeeper. Hart was booked. Dzeko, playing on his own up front in the absence of the injured Sergio Aguero, grabbed his first goal in nine games in all competitions with a fierce left-foot shot with seconds left.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010794&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Viswanathan Anand continued his great start to the Candidates tournament with a comprehensive 31-move win over Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in the third round.</p>
<p>The win was opportune, in that Anand won with black pieces, and also timely: all other boards settled for draws, putting the Indian half a point ahead of the field.</p>
<p>The other interesting game of the day was the draw between Vladimir Kramnik and Peter Svidler, who had come into the round level on points with Anand. Kramnik was worse off for long stretches of the game but eventually managed to salvage a very uncomfortable position.</p>
<p>It was interesting in the light of how Mamedyarov played the opening without too much conviction and Anand’s own mastery of it, why Mamedyarov was drawn into playing the Slav against the Indian. As black, the position often combines solid defence with greating attacking prospects. A lot of Anand’s memorable wins come from this opening system, including a few high-profile ones in the Championship matches.</p>
<p>Very few moves into the opening and Mamedyarov may have had second thoughts about his choice. Anand played a novelty which was more a theoretical deviation than anything that conferred an advantage. Still, it already meant that Anand had a better theoretical appreciation of the position, thanks to his preparation, than the opponent.</p>
<p>Mamedyarov did not play a rank bad move except at the very end when everything was already lost, but it was a series of small slips in the opening. How Anand exploited them was sleek. Pieces combined with lethal effeciency: his rook and dark bishop gave him complete control of the e file; pieces were well-positioned: His queen was threatening a diresome check while also holding down key defensive squares and with all the mayhem in the air, there was some housekeeping: in the middle of an attack, Anand still found time to hop the king over to the next square at the other end of the action to unpin a pawn that would join the attack a few moves later. Anand’s major pieces bore down on white’s king and black’s defense was in a tangle with no prospects of a counter attack.</p>
<p><strong>Final blow</strong></p>
<p>Already facing heavy damage, Mamedyarov blundered his king into a square that allowed Anand to fork his king and rook. The Indian was not, of course, forced to play out the crude move as Mamedyarov resigned immediately after the mistake. “The killing precision of Anand is resembles how i remember him from 2008,” GM Anish Giri tweeted after the win.</p>
<p>With two wins from two games, it couldn’t have been any better for Anand as he went into the rest day on Sunday. He may need the rest, considering he plays Kramnik on Monday, but the prospects of doing much else outside of chess seem bleek in Siberia right about now.</p>
<p>“Yesterday I tried going for a walk in the evening, but the snow was quite heavy, atleast for poor Indian boys,” he said, speaking about his evenings during the tournament so far.</p>
<p>Svidler seemed to have had Kramnik on the ropes in the symmetrical English game but some great counter-attacking late on by Kramnik. He managed to get his queen to pull off perpetual checks with white’s pieces too far up the board in attack to intervene. The draw was signed after 51 moves.</p>
<p>Both other boards (Levon Aronian vs Veselin Topalov and Dmitry Andreikin vs Sergey Karjakin) followed the Spanish opening that developed into balanced positions soon and ended in uncomplicated draws.</p>
<p>Round three results: Anand (1.5) bt Mamedyarov (0.5), Svidler (1.5) drew with Kramnik (1.5), Andreikin (1) drew with Karjakin (1),  Topalov (1) drew with Aronian (1).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010791&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Hamilton saved the best for last with his final lap of a gloomy session after Australian Daniel Ricciardo had stormed to the top of the timesheets only seconds earlier on his first race weekend for champions Red Bull.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Briton’s time of one minute 44.231 seconds on a greasy Albert Park track was just over three-tenths of a second faster than Ricciardo, who upstaged Vettel to the delight of the home fans. Quadruple champion Vettel was only 13th fastest and was frustrated by a crash late in the final session by Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen which brought out the yellow flags and forced drivers to ease their pace.</p>
<p>“Today made it so much harder with the conditions, but I’m really happy with the job the team did,” said Hamilton, whose 32nd second pole equalled Nigel Mansell’s British record. “These cars are much harder driving in the wet.” Mercedes’ Nico Rosberg will start third on the grid alongside McLaren’s 21-year-old Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen, who underlined his talent with a poised drive in trying conditions.</p>
<p>Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso qualified fifth with Jean-Eric Vergne sixth fastest for Toro Rosso. It was the first time Vettel had failed to make the final round of qualifying since he started 11th on the grid in Belgium in 2012, before battling through the field to finish the race second. Vettel will move up to 12th, however, with Williams’ Finnish driver Valtteri Bottas due to drop from 10th place after taking a five-place penalty for a gearbox change.</p>
<p>“Obviously tricky conditions, for some reason we had more problems today than we had yesterday,” said the 26-year-old German, who appeared to struggle with handling and survived a brush with a wall in the first qualifying session. “The speed is there so we will see what we can do tomorrow. It’s a long race, anything can happen.”</p>
<p><strong>LOTUS NIGHTMARE</strong></p>
<p>With Red Bull still playing catch-up to Mercedes after an abysmal winter testing plagued by reliability problems with their Renault power unit, Vettel looks set to be beaten for the first time since Hamilton won in Hungary last July. Ricciardo, who has shouldered Australia’s hopes since the retirement of his Red Bull predecessor Mark Webber at the end of last season, had few illusions about the gap between the teams.</p>
<p>With teams already struggling to master the new turbocharged hybrid engines, fuel consumption will add an additional layer of complexity for drivers in Sunday’s race, with a new rule limiting cars to 100 kilograms of petrol.</p>
<p>Vettel will be in esteemed company in the middle of the grid, with two other champions — McLaren’s Jenson Button and Raikkonen — also failing to get into the final group of 10. Briton Button qualified 11th but will start 10th, while  Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, was 12th fastest on his first Saturday since returning to Maranello.</p>
<p>The Finn, winner in Melbourne with Lotus last year, crashed into the wall at turn 14. Russian rookie Daniil Kvyat also enjoyed a positive qualifying debut, despite hitting the wall at the end of the final session, to line up eighth for Toro Rosso with Force India’s Nico Hulkenberg seventh. Brazilian Felipe Massa will start ninth on the grid in his first race since crossing to Williams from Ferrari.</p>
<p>Japan’s Kamui Kobayashi, making his comeback after being dropped by Sauber at the end of 2012, gave lowly Caterham a boost by qualifying 15th — which will become 14th after Bottas drops down. Lotus’s horror week continued as both Frenchman Romain Grosjean and Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado were among the six knocked out of the first session. Grosjean locked up and spun off after posting the slowest lap time in the opening session, while Maldonado was unable even to trouble the timesheets due to a problem with the power unit and will rely on the stewards’ discretion for a Sunday start.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010788&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian and Chinese badminton coaches are, currently, akin to mega-city mayors who know they have sure winners to flaunt as soon as their countries’ tallest skyscrapers start rising on their skyline. Badminton courts around the world are buzzing with similarly dizzying excitement.</p>
<p>At 182 cm, Sun Yu (19) is China’s and their women’s coach, Chen Jin’s, big hope for the future in badminton. Standing just 4 cm shorter is PV Sindhu — perhaps P Gopichand’s most ambitious project, given the amount of versatility, speed and strength that he is looking to lend to the long-limbed 20-year-old.</p>
<p>On Saturday, they played their fifth match against each other and even though the Indian lost a marathon 1 hour 19 minute humdinger 18-21, 21-12, 21-19 at the Swiss Open in Basel, their rivalry has the makings of a classic for the sheer audacity of the performances that their coaches are trying to squeeze out of these athletes.</p>
<p>They were 2-2 going into the Basel semifinal, but even if the Chinese (ranked 26) put her snout marginally ahead of the World No 9 Indian this weekend, no one can tell for sure which way the next one will go. Both have the flapping reach — badminton courts seem to shrink in their striding wake. But the astounding aspects of their game hardly seem to be related to their reach — though their face-off is always the match-up between the world’s tallest women’s players.</p>
<p>Sindhu’s off-season training has significantly improved her lateral striding, footwork and defence as was evidenced this week, so there is none of the lumbering locomotion associated with tall athletes. She pounces on the shuttle, both in her backcourt and when shuffling to the net, like a jungle cat, and her whippish racquet-speed betrays none of the stiff bearing of those that are vertically gifted but sluggish.</p>
<p><strong>Height advantage</strong></p>
<p>The Chinese ought to be worried when the Indian gets going against some of their shorter players — they’re all 5’7” plus, but none at 5’11”. She has the ability to combine her speed and height with the carefully cultivated aggression to loom over them and is quick in picking shuttles. It’s one reason why she’s beaten all of the top Chinese players.</p>
<p>Sun Yu isn’t the most fluid movers on court. But with a crouching style of play, she rarely seems unbalanced achieving that centre of gravity with an easy low stance. One would think that a 6-plus footer would also naturally rely on steep smashing as a weapon but that’s not for Sun Yu. The tall girl displayed a wide array of deceptive shots — drops straight and cross-court, as well as a lethal overhead shot on which she achieved unbelievable angles with her supple wrists. It means that she has none of the predictability of a tall shuttler’s game.</p>
<p>Sindhu, meanwhile, made the contest closer — first bridging a 12-17 deficit in the opener to win that set and later, while defying the Chinese in the decider and giving her an almighty scare as she threatened to eat up the lead with a string of winners — by dominating the net.</p>
<p>It was a tight-spinning dribble in the end — perhaps Sun Yu’s only success at the net, albeit on a big point — that took her to match point. But both girls are playing an extremely athletic and elastically agile game for a pair that’s graduating out of the awkward teen years.</p>
<p>There’s moments when they are on court, when the clumsiness, unsure-footedness and confusion of tall athlete come to the fore. But as their games get polished and chiselled, the two are redefining notions of a tall athlete in badminton, with a spunky attitude boosting their 6-foot frames.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010781&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australia outlined their World Twenty20 credentials as they chased down South Africa’s target in just 15 overs to win the third and final T20 international by six wickets at Centurion on Friday. Where South Africa had made the pitch appear stodgy and batting seem difficult, Australia proved conditions were not so tricky as Aaron Finch hit 39 from 27 balls and Shane Watson struck two sixes in his 35.</p>
<p>South Africa’s only meaningful contribution with the bat came from Quinton de Kock, whose 41 came at a run a ball as they posted 128-7 in 20 overs. Yet Australia reached 129-4 with five overs to spare to win the three-match series 2-0 ahead of this month’s global tournament in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>“Obviously the conditions in Bangladesh will be difficult, but we’ll take some confidence into the World T20,’’ Australia captain George Bailey said. “We’ve won our last five matches in a row now.’’</p>
<p>South Africa’s innings never gathered momentum after they lost the toss and were asked to bat, as Mitchell Starc trapped Hashim Amla lbw early on and Glenn Maxwell dismissed both Faf du Plessis and JP Duminy. Australia’s 43-year-old spinner Brad Hogg backed that up with the key wickets of AB de Villiers and De Kock, as South Africa limped to 81-6 in the 14th over.</p>
<p>Albie Morkel hit a couple of sixes in his 18, but when he was bowled by Starc it was left to the lower order to try and get the hosts to a reasonable total, which they were unable to do.</p>
<p>“We didn’t play too well at the start and while we rebuilt they kept getting wickets,” South Africa captain Du Plessis said. “It wasn’t a big enough total at Centurion because at night the ball skids on. The dot-ball percentage is something we look at.”</p>
<p><strong>Inadequate score</strong></p>
<p>Australia openers Aaron Finch and Cameron White quickly proved how inadequate South Africa’s score was when they hammered 38 in the opening four overs, and although White fell in the next over, Finch continued the assault with Watson.</p>
<p>Finch’s dismissal off the bowling of leg-spinner Imran Tahir slowed the scoring rate momentarily, before Watson and Maxwell took 18 runs off an Albie Morkel over to put the result beyond doubt. Both batsmen fell before the target was achieved, but George Bailey and Brad Hodge hit a six apiece to finish the job in style.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010777&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former Pakistan skipper Rameez Raja feels India will be under greater pressure when they take on Pakistan in their Twenty20 World Cup league match in Dhaka on March 21, as they would be keen to avenge their Asia Cup defeat.</p>
<p>“Many pundits believe that the way India lost the Asia Cup match in the final over it has left a scar on them just like Javed Miandad’s last ball six in Sharjah did many years ago,” Rameez told ‘Geo Super channel’. “I recall after Miandad’s six India never beat us in Sharjah, and I think Pakistan should take advantage of the Asia Cup win when they play in the World T20 Cup,” he added.</p>
<p>Rameez said although India would be strengthened with the return of skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, hard-hitting batsman Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina, there would more psychological pressure on them.</p>
<p>“Remember these players, especially Yuvraj and Raina have not been in great form off late, so there will a lot of pressure on them to deliver,” he said.</p>
<p>Rameez urged the Pakistan team management to take full advantage of their Asia Cup win. “I think in every team meeting they should recall that victory and create more self-belief in themselves. Especially before the India match.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010774&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Far from being daunted by the prospect of facing India in their World Twenty20 opener on Friday, Pakistan captain Mohammad Hafeez is rather happy his team will kick off their campaign in Bangladesh against the arch-rivals.</p>
<p>The bitter South Asian rivals have fought three wars in their brief independent history and remain deeply mistrustful of each other and there has been tremendous pressure on the cricketers whenever they met each other.</p>
<p>Hafeez, however, was determined not to get swayed by the emotion that would surround the match at Mirpur’s Shere Bangla National Stadium.</p>
<p>“India-Pakistan game is always full of pressure,” the 33-year-old told reporters on Saturday. “We as a team are very happy. I’m happy that our first match is such that if we do well in it, subsequent matches would seem easier, as far as pressure is concerned.</p>
<p>“Of course you can’t underestimate any team in this tournament, but we’d like to take off well from there.”</p>
<p>Hafeez insisted Pakistan could not afford to get distracted by their rivalry against India if they are to replicate their 2009 triumph from a group also containing defending champions West Indies and tournament favourite Australia.</p>
<p>“Media is always excited about India-Pakistan match but we are not targeting just one team. We have plans for Australia and West Indies as well, both are good sides. We are ready for all,” he said.</p>
<p>“It seems our group has all the favourites in it. It’s again a good challenge for the team. You can’t take things easy. You have to give your best to win the game.”</p>
<p>All-rounder Shahid Afridi, recovering from a hamstring injury, did not arrive with the team but Hafeez assured the talismanic all-rounder would reach Monday.</p>
<p>“I think our team manager cleared the position before we left Pakistan. He is fit, we’ve just given him some extra time for his rehab, so that he joins us fully fit. I think he is joining us on (March) 17th.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010768&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karnataka stand on the brink of an unprecedented treble. No team in the history of Indian domestic cricket has won the Ranji Trophy, the Irani Cup and the Vijay Hazare Trophy in the same season. R Vinay Kumar&#8217;s men have already achieved the double and face Railways in the Vijay Hazare Trophy final at Eden Gardens on Sunday.</p>
<p>Karnataka&#8217;s success in this tournament has been based on their batting. Robin Uthappa has been in scintillating form scoring consecutive centuries —132 not out (135 balls) against Gujarat in the quarters and 133 (135 balls) against Jharkhand in the semis. Karun Nair (120 against Gujarat), Mayank Agarwal and KL Rahul, too, have chipped in. Karnataka have posted 300-plus totals in both their matches in the tournament proper.</p>
<p>Those matches, however, were played at Jadavpur University&#8217;s Salt Lake Campus Ground where the ball did very little in the air and off the surface. On the other hand, a spicy pitch is likely for the final at Eden Gardens. If it does pan out so, Uthappa and company will face a serious test.</p>
<p><strong>Well Stocked</strong></p>
<p>Karnataka, however, are well stocked for all conditions. Vinay Kumar has been taking wickets — nine in the last two matches — and Abhimanyu Mithun, too, has carried forward his Ranji Trophy form to the shorter format. On paper, Karnataka have the edge.</p>
<p>Railways, though, have been the giant killers of the tournament. They saw off heavyweights such as Baroda, Punjab and Bengal to reach the final, and will look to capitalise on their momentum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Limited-overs cricket is all about who plays better cricket on the day and my team never gives up,&#8221; Railways coach Abhay Sharma said.</p>
<p><strong>Punching above weight</strong></p>
<p>The Railways team have punched well above their weight so far and a victory on Sunday will make a compelling case for increasing the facilities available to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Winning the title would be very important for Railways. It might help us get better infrastructure next season. More importantly, for players like Anureet Singh, Mahesh Rawat and Karan Sharma, it could be a real boost in terms of their future. They&#8217;re ready for the top level, and with the national selectors watching, a strong performance in the final might open the doors to Team India for them,&#8221; Sharma said.</p>
<p>Railways have played all three matches under lights but Friday&#8217;s match will be played during the day. Even so, their coach sounded bullish.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conditions don&#8217;t matter. This is a skill-based game, and if you&#8217;re skillful enough, you really don&#8217;t care about the other factors,&#8221; Sharma rounded off.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010764&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishtan (BKSP) is a vast complex situated in Savar, which is an hour’s drive from the plush hotel where the Indian team is put up in Dhaka. The BKSP was called the Bangladesh Institute of Sports till the mid-1980s before it was rechristened. It is what the National Institute of Sport in Patiala is to India.</p>
<p>One has to go over a river, drive between fields and through dusty two-lane asphalt road before the green expanse of the BKSP arrives on the right. The Indian team made its journey from Dhaka to Savar on Saturday afternoon for their first practice session ahead of the World T20.</p>
<p>Once at the entrance of the BKSP-IV ground, the driver of the team bus realised that the mouth of the road was too narrow to drive through. So the players took a five-minute walk to the practice facility. It seemed to take an eternity for the Indian side to arrive for practice, but once they did, they got down to business quickly.</p>
<p>There were two wickets at the BKSP &#8211; one in the centre of the ground and the other at the far end. It was at the latter wicket that the spinners assembled, and among them was off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. The bowling unit has recently struggled more than the batting, and in India’s difficult overseas run, a question or two has been asked over the effectiveness of the spin unit. Here, however, the wickets are likely to aid the slower bowlers, and the side will count on Ashwin’s experience in Twenty20 (he has also played 19 Tests and 79 ODIs). Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja, leg spinner Amit Mishra and all-rounder Yuvraj Singh will complete the set of spinners in the side.</p>
<p>But the scrutiny will be severe on Ashwin, who has shown a recent revival in form during the Asia Cup but had a prolonged dry run in South Africa and New Zealand before that. Ashwin finished the Asia Cup with nine wickets in four games, an improvement from the two wickets in eight away ODI games in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p><strong>Action reaction</strong></p>
<p>The Asia Cup was also a tournament in which Ashwin decided to experiment with his bowling action. He delivered the ball in a manner similar to that of West Indies’ Sunil Narine — front-on and high-arm.  Though the tweaked approach earned Ashwin criticism, the off-spinner said on Saturday that he had backed himself to pull it off.</p>
<p>“I think there has been a lot of speculation about what I did. There are enough and more experts going around who know the game really well and do a very good job of it. As far as I am concerned, if I am really convinced about doing something, then I go ahead and do it rather than sit back and say I could have done this. I would rather go out there, try it and see how it comes out. There’s not much more I can add to it. I have tried it; it was not like it was hammered, it was not like it was venomous,” Ashwin said.</p>
<p>During India’s first practice session at the BKSP, Ashwin started off bowling with his regular action before slipping in a couple of deliveries with the modified one. Ashwin said that he was convinced that he was doing the right thing by trying to mix up things. “Generally I keep trying different things whenever I go for a practice session. We have a lot of practice sessions — like someone turns up at office. If you are not going to do something different, eventually you are going to get bored with what you are doing, that’s how I see it. I keep trying things. If there is something I think can be applied in a match scenario, I go and do it. It’s about trying to take the opinion of people around me; I see how they take it. If I am convinced, I will go out and try it. Unless you try it, you will never know,” Ashwin added.</p>
<p>During the World T20, Ashwin will not only be called upon to get breakthroughs but may also have to bowl in the Powerplay overs. “Yes, there are going to be scars that you carry from the previous game, but predominantly, the scars that the Indian team carries is from what they read. I try and replicate as many times as possible an aggressive mindset when I go into a game. When I am not able to do it, I still will my mind to get around to doing it.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010755&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Khurram’s cricketing journey, interestingly, began on the streets of Multan, alongside two brothers who played first-class cricket. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010745&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/uaekhurramm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2010752" alt="The UAE skipper scored 581 runs during the World Cup qualifiers." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/uaekhurramm.jpg" /></a> The UAE skipper scored 581 runs during the World Cup qualifiers.
<p>For Khurram Khan, the return journey from Auckland to Dubai earlier this week was a special. First, he could stretch his legs in the plush business-class seat of the Emirates Airlines plane and not worry about the comfort of his fellow passengers. For a change, Khurram was a privileged guest and not a purser. More important, the part-time cricketer was going to be a World Cupper in a year’s time.</p>
<p>During his flights across the globe as the Emirates’ chief flight-attendant, Khurram had come across many cricketers. But only once, claims the characteristically shy left-hander, has he dropped his guard and introduced himself as being the face of UAE cricket for over a decade.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t help myself when I saw Brian Charles Lara. He was very generous. I took some pictures with him. He was surprised that some despite being in my 40s, I was so serious about the game,” recalls Khurram with pride.</p>
<p>The Lara episode though, was an exception. Khurram isn’t habituated to narrating his cricketing exploits.</p>
<p>“At times I would be serving these international cricketers from India and Pakistan. I just introduce myself as being a local cricketer and never tell them about my achievements in UAE colours. I’m always worried they’ll say ‘That’s ok, now go back to work,’ ” he explains.</p>
<p><strong>One-man army</strong></p>
<p>Those achievements in UAE colours he speaks about are nothing short of world-class. Khurram has not only been the only constant in his team for almost 15 years, he’s also been their most prolific batsman and most consistent bowler. Even the UAE’s eventual qualification for the World Cup was built on their talismanic skipper’s 581 runs at an average of 72.62.</p>
<p>“Maintaining fitness is crucial for me. So I am always armed with my running and fitness gear along with my elastic bands in my bag. I am in the gym as soon as I reach the hotel. If not, I make the most of night flights, doing push-ups in the back,” he says.</p>
<p>Such is Khurram’s schedule that often, he’s had to jump straight out of a flight and into a match for his national team. In fact, he believes that playing a match in those situations could be the best antidote to jet-lag.</p>
<p>“Certain times, I have even flown back from Australia, 14 hours, or the US, a 15-hour direct flight, come home, changed and left for a match,” he says.</p>
<p>Khurram’s cricketing journey, interestingly, began on the streets of Multan, alongside two brothers who played first-class cricket. But a failure to break into the senior teams, despite a successful stint with Tariq Cricket Club, saw him shift base to the UAE.</p>
<p>“I scored a century for Fly Emirates club in my first match and went home with a job,” he says.</p>
<p>While he looks forward to his next business-class visit Down Under in 12 months’ time, without the Emirates uniform that is, the grand old man of UAE cricket insists that he no will longer feel inhibited when he encounters an international cricketer.</p>
<p>He says confidently: “I’ll tell them, you might be facing my left-arm spin during the World Cup.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010745&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajavedm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2010743" alt="Under Aaqib Javed, the UAE team has changed from a bunch of unfit, middle-aged amateurs to a competitive unit that has qualified for two ICC events." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajavedm.jpg" /></a> Under Aaqib Javed, the UAE team has changed from a bunch of unfit, middle-aged amateurs to a competitive unit that has qualified for two ICC events.
<p><em>From bowling first-change after the two Ws to being Pakistan’s long-time assistant coach, Aaqib Javed has always played the second fiddle. Bharat Sundaresan discovers how the former pacer finally got a lead role in the UAE’s cricket reawakening.</em></p>
<p>As first days in office go, Aaqib Javed had just experienced an absolute nightmare. Only a month earlier, he had been part of a Pakistan setup that had swept England, the then No.1 Test team in the world, 3-0 in the UAE. Now, he was back in Dubai once again, having accepted an offer that had left many in the cricketing world, and more in Pakistan, in shock. After all, being the UAE’s coach wasn’t really the most-coveted job in the cricketing world.</p>
<p>The first impression that Javed’s new team left on him, however, was one that made him cringe. He went home depressed, ruing his decision. What the former Pakistani-pacer encountered, was not a bunch that inspired him with any confidence to back up his own proclamation that he would lead the UAE into three World Cups. Instead, it was a team made up of overweight, unfit, middle-aged amateurs with an attitude that, as Javed puts it, was ‘pathetic’.</p>
<p>The offer itself had originally come from former new-ball partner Kabir Khan, famous for having led Afghanistan’s cricketing revival. What sealed the deal though was a passing mention about it to his daughter Uqba, who insisted that her father take the gambit for her sake.</p>
<p>Despite the persuasion from his family and a growing desire to create his own identity as a head coach, the 41-year old had set upon his new assignment with trepidation and a Bulleh Shah couplet for company.</p>
<p>Chal chal Bulleya, chal utthe chaliye jitthe saare anhey,Naa koi sadi zaat pechaaneh, naa koi sanu manneh.</p>
<p>Loosely translated, it reads: Come, let’s go to the land of the blind and the pure, where nobody will inquire about your caste and nobody shall judge you.</p>
<p><strong>Moving on</strong></p>
<p>It was in these words that Javed found solace the pugnacious pacer made the audacious move to the Middle East.</p>
<p>In many ways, it rang true to his imminent mission. He was, after all, heading to Dubai aiming to start afresh — having left all his baggage behind. In the UAE, he was not just seeking an elusive oasis but also embarking on a journey of self-discovery in the desert.</p>
<p>This would eventually culminate in him guiding the UAE into the 2015 ICC World Cup — not to forget the U-19 World Cup, which finished last month — and the World T20 in Bangladesh. Along the way, he also earned the title of ‘Thakur Sahib’ from his players, an assorted group of expats from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka — assimilated into a crack unit fighting towards a common goal. It would also help him create his own niche, one that had eluded him for a majority of his cricketing life.</p>
<p>For way too long, Javed had to be content being the perennial bridesmaid of Pakistan cricket. As a bowler, he was among the finest exponents of swing but unfortunately, remained the third cog of a formidable pace-attack behind the illustrious pair of Wasim and Waqar.</p>
<p>As a coach, he churned out an assembly line of fast bowlers during the 2000s — from Umar Gul and Mohammad Asif to Mohammad Aamer, Mohammad Irfan and Junaid Khan. He also led the Pakistan U-19 team to World Cup glory in 2004. Javed though, still continued to linger in the background, one of the many support staff jettisoned to the rim of team photographs either as assistant or bowling coach.</p>
<p>In an alien land, Javed, finally, was the man in charge. Having taken the bull by the horns, it was time to tame it. Once the astonishment of his first meeting with Khurram Khan &amp; Co had sunk in, Javed chalked out a plan to get his house in order.</p>
<p>“The bowling attack was basically four ordinary spinners and one medium-pacer who was their all-rounder. I told them point blank, ‘if you play like this outside you will be smashed,’ “ he says.</p>
<p>In the search for genuine fast bowlers, he scoured the land, travelling to every nook and corner of the country, from the smallest of clubs to academies in the big cities. When it came to choosing them, he adopted an Imran Khan-esque approach, one that he knew well, considering he too had been picked out of oblivion in similar fashion as a 16-year-old back in 1988. But it wasn’t easy to convince the selectors, mainly senior businessmen with limited knowledge about the game.</p>
<p>“I told them I can select a fast bowler even by seeing him bowl with oranges. A fast bowler just needs speed, the rest of it I’ll fix,” he explains.</p>
<p><strong>Coaching by example</strong></p>
<p>Today, the UAE boast of four to five seamers, including Kamran Shazad who hit speeds of over 140kph. Javed, however, does take great pride in the drastically-improved fitness levels of his present lot. Not a man of many words, the seasoned coach opted for a more ‘hands-on’ method.</p>
<p>“The turning point was when I started training with them. If they ran two rounds, I ran 10. If they lifted 5 kg in the gym, I lifted 40. Being amateurs, they would come up with 100 excuses but since I was doing it, they had no option but to follow suit,” says Javed, before breaking into a guffaw.</p>
<p>“The current routine is 10 rounds in 18 minutes. Some of the guys are doing level-12s in the bleep tests, which is like professional South African level,” adds the proud coach.</p>
<p>Javed though, had to keep telling himself that cricket was always going to be a secondary passion for the players he was dealing with. These were men who were still working nine-to-five jobs to earn a living — some in banks, others on flights and one loading cargo at the airport.</p>
<p>“Can you believe it that I have never had a day or morning session with my team? I salute them though. Some live as far as Abu Dhabi and Ajman. So they leave their homes at 7 in the morning and don’t go back till 11.30 in the night,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>Sailing over the hurdles</strong></p>
<p>Long before he moved to the UAE in  March 2012, the Sharjah Cricket Stadium had been a sort of second home for Javed. At the historic venue, the lanky pacer with the silky locks would often come into his own — like the time he took a hat-trick against India — and briefly outshine his more celebrated peers at their own game.</p>
<p>A lot has changed in terms of cricketing infrastructure in the Emirates since then. It started with the ICC shifting base here followed by Pakistan being forced into adopting the UAE as their home base. The Arab nation has also seen an infusion of state-of-the-art stadiums in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. But Javed believes the immigration laws of the UAE have curtailed the infusion of talent into the team despite the boom.</p>
<p>“The qualification rules are too stringent. At times I have to wait for three years after a very talented player has been spotted. There is a fast bowler who won’t be ready for another nine months,” explains Javed.</p>
<p>Despite having had the last laugh, Javed still believes in living his life based on the couplet that has been an ally through many challenges. The line in the sand might have gotten smudged over time, but what he’s achieved with a motley crew of eager amateurs will remain etched forever in cricketing folklore.</p>
<p>Even having taken an obscure team from the brink of oblivion into the biggest event in the sport, the hurt of not having gotten his due back home does rankle him at times, though not as acutely as before.</p>
<p>“Look, I took charge of the Pakistan team before the first World T20 in 2007 and worked with them for three months. Then, two days before the event, they hire Geoff Lawson as coach and say my job’s done. It doesn’t matter now. In my head, Ab wahan chaley hai jahan sirf andhe rehte hain.. na koi jaat poochega na koi judge karega.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010734&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mizoramm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2010707" alt="Mizoram’s love for football goes a long way back. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mizoramm1.jpg" /></a> Mizoram’s love for football goes a long way back.
<p><em>Behind Mizoram’s clean sweep of the football national championship lies an extraordinary league, sustained efforts, and slow and steady progress. ADAM HALLIDAY on how the state laid the ground for its maiden Santosh Trophy</em></p>
<p>TILL two-three years ago, Aizawl’s main square Zodin would empty out by evening. A few sentries guarding the Assam Rifles’ compound gate and a handful of straggling youngsters in youthful defiance as the city turned in early for the night would be the only ones hanging around.</p>
<p>On most nights these days, there is hardly a place more bustling with activity in Mizoram’s capital. Hundreds of parked motorcycles line the winding roads that meet at Zodin, while the air fills up with chants, songs and cheers from fans in club jerseys and painted faces. They are all headed for Lammual, Mizoram’s oldest and best-known football field, lit up with floodlights and laid with sleek new astro-turf.</p>
<p>Behind Mizoram’s crowning as national football champions on March 9, after an unbeaten run through the Santosh Trophy, lie this ground, this change, and another, unheralded success story — of the Mizoram Premier League (MPL).</p>
<p>All 20 members of the Santosh Trophy winning team, which beat former champions Indian Railways 3-0 in the final, are MPL players. So are the team’s three coaches and one physiotherapist.</p>
<p>“I can say there was an element of madness to the proposal,” laughs Lalnunpuia, 28, talking of how MPL originated. The success is certainly unbelievable given that the league came into being only in 2012, and has not finished even two seasons so far.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, Lalnunpuia and close friend L V Lalthantluanga (a.k.a Tato), sons of Mizoram’s well-known media pioneers K Sapdanga and Vanneihtluanga respectively, had set up a television network company called Zonet Cable TV Pvt Ltd. In 2012, they approached the Mizoram Football Association (MFA) with an idea. They proposed a five-year contract under which the MFA would organise a professional football league and their network would pour in Rs 1.25 crore into it, in exchange for exclusive rights to telecast the matches live. Zonet hoped to get in sponsors, and promised to foot the entire bill otherwise (it is currently pitching in half the budget). Within months, the league had started falling into place.</p>
<p>Living up to its side of the bargain, the state government laid astro-turf on two of Aizawl’s main football fields, including Lammual and Rajiv Gandhi Stadium Stadium at Mualpui, and equipped them with floodlights, with Sports Minister Zodintluanga and MFA president Lal Thanzara putting their weight behind the project. It helped that Thanzara was then a parliamentary secretary and is now Minister of State handling a dozen portfolios, nine of them assisting his elder brother Lal Thanhawla, Mizoram’s five-time chief minister. It was Thanhawla who set up the MFA back in 1973.</p>
<p>Lalnunpuia and Lalthantluanga, 29, have both been football players, though as Lalnunpuia says, he never had the same potential as his partner. He also credits Lalthantluanga with all the behind-the-scenes work.</p>
<p>“Honestly, we did not have that much money to spare and there was only a slim chance there would be financial returns,” Lalnunpuia says. “But we knew Mizo youth had potential and all they needed was a platform and opportunity&#8230; Maybe in the back of our minds there was hope that our boys would attain glory and that, maybe, it would shine the spotlight on the league.”</p>
<p>That would prove an understatement. The response was overwhelming. With Zonet showing MPL matches, complete with post-match interviews and match analyses, and Mahindra Two Wheelers pledging to partly sponsor the seasons, the league soon became the biggest televised sporting event in Mizoram’s history. Sporting company Nivea officially launched an MPL ball ahead of the second season last year.</p>
<p>Not just Mizos, but two players from Manipur and West Bengal and six foreign players (from Japan, Cameroon and Nigeria) now play in the league’s eight teams. The prize catch is Belgian coach-cum-player Phillippe De Ridder, credited with getting East Bengal back on track in the mid-2000s and leading it to the top of Indian football.</p>
<p>Mizoram’s love for football goes a long way back. Before the cable television revolution, entire villages would squeeze themselves into the rare living rooms with TV sets to watch the FIFA World Cup, despite the flickering Doordarshan signal or that caught from nearby Bangladesh after constant tuning of rickety metal antennas.<br />
In the 1980s, various government departments — police, public works and public health engineer departments, in particular — patronised the sport and built up clubs that attracted the state’s top talent. In response, some of Aizawl’s well-off businessmen and wealthy families teamed up to form the first privately owned Aizawl FC, buying players from government-backed clubs.</p>
<p>“They were way ahead of their time. There was no prize money, no regular pay for players, and the highlight was that thousands of us would gather to watch football at Lammual,” recalls MFA general secretary Lalnghinglova Hmar, better known as Tetea.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s and 2000s, as cable TV brought in live telecast of European football tournaments, the fandom hit a new high. English clubs’ fans wear their loyalties on flags and banners that adorn inter-state and intra-state maxicabs, English Premier League news fills up the state’s newspapers, while youths are known to adopt Facebook names such as ‘Gunner’, ‘Gooner’, ‘Chelsea’ and ‘Liverpool’.</p>
<p>The captain of the 2014 Santosh Trophy winning team, Zico Zoremsanga, is named after Brazilian football legend Zico, not an uncommon name in Mizoram, along with the Peles and the Maradonas.</p>
<p>The popularity of the sport gave birth in 1985 to an annual tournament by the Young Mizo Association (YMA), a powerful cultural group. Teams were formed along neighbourhood and village lines. The matches drew huge turnouts and stoked passionate rivalries.</p>
<p>Another major tournament called Red Ribbon followed. It was part of a multi-media campaign against AIDS and drug abuse, supported by AIDS control societies and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). But even the three Red Ribbon inter-village tournaments between 2009 and 2012 saw astounding numbers — the first had 202 teams with 4,664 players participating, the last featured 222 teams and 4,440 players.</p>
<p>People from far-flung villages would head towards the capital for these matches with bedding and football boots and stay at people’s homes that temporarily functioned as dorms. Players would do odd jobs between matches to provide for meals.</p>
<p>A league such as MPL was always a step away.</p>
<p>It was also around the time of the YMA and Red Ribbon tournaments that Mizoram produced its first professional footballer — S Malsawmtluanga. Belonging to a small village in Mizoram’s south, he was picked up by reputed clubs such as East Bengal and Mohun Bagan and played alongside Indian football captain Bhaichung Bhutia in several international tournaments.</p>
<p>As several others made a name for themselves in Malsawmtluanga’s wake, the rest of the country began waking up to Mizoram’s potential. The Mizoram team won the 1998 U-19 National Football Championships (NFC) in Shillong, the 2003 U-16 NFC in Aizawl, the 2004 U-16 NFC in Goa and most recently the 2013 49th Junior NFC for B C Roy Trophy in Jharkhand.</p>
<p>“Those were all respectable achievements, but were all junior-level championships. We at the MFA knew that unless we won a senior-level tournament, we would never be recognised as a football powerhouse. That’s why, for many years now, our topmost priority has been the Santosh Trophy,” says Hmar.<br />
“That’s when MPL came and everything changed,” he adds. The league meant that players no longer played for only a few weeks between long breaks, and that they could consider playing the game professionally.</p>
<p>MPL’s mission statement lays out strict criteria for the participating clubs:</p>
<p>a) Professionalise local football: An MPL club must register itself as a society and have a minimum of Rs 4 lakh in its bank account, with at least Rs 1 lakh coming from commercial sponsors. To encourage youths who play the game with almost zero financial incentive, a club has to sign a contract with each and pay a minimum of<br />
Rs 3,000 per season.</p>
<p>b) Build a local market: Rs 30 a ticket is charged during league matches and</p>
<p>Rs 50 for the finals, with the gains from ticket sales split between the MFA and clubs. All except two MPL clubs have taken to merchandising club jerseys, as well as key chains, mufflers and T-shirts.</p>
<p>c) Youth development and keeping grassroots football alive: MPL is linked to all of MFA’s eight district-level entities. First-division district-level clubs have a chance to enter MPL through playoffs, where the top club automatically replaces the worst club of the last season, and the runner-up plays against the second worst to find a place in the next MPL season.</p>
<p>“This ensures district-level clubs have something to aim for. We already have one club like this in the league,” says Lalnunpuia.</p>
<p>MPL also makes it mandatory for each of its final eight clubs in the league to have an U-17 club, with a parallel U-17 league for these. Besides, at least three players in each team in a match line-up have to be below 19 years of age.</p>
<p>To ensure a steady stream of youngsters filling the ranks, the MFA has in place an impressive grassroots training programme. In October 2012, FIFA instructor Scott O’Donnel arrived in Aizawl to coach 28 trainers, who are now training 6-12-year-olds. Two months later, the All India Football Federation’s technical director Rob Baan opened another grassroots course. Since May 2013, every district has been holding football courses under the MFA’s district entities.</p>
<p>In what may be the result of these efforts, last week, four coaches — two from English club Liverpool FC and two from Pune’s DSK Shivajiyan FC — arrived in Aizawl to scout for U-19 and U-17 players to coach at a new football academy in Pune. Mizoram was their first stop in a country-wise hunt.</p>
<p>At the zonal qualifier of the Santosh Trophy on January 31, which had Mizoram and Manipur battling it out for the final round in Siliguri, the crowds were unprecedented, says Lalthanzama Vanchhawng, an MPL commentator.</p>
<p>“People were sitting on every spare inch of space Lammual could offer. They were on tree branches, on the flyover outside. The audience even spilled into the commentator’s box. Children were sitting at my feet, between the microphone and me.” Roars and singing swept up Aizawl every time the Mizoram team scored and when the team finally won 3-0.</p>
<p>When the players took the leap from that undefeated zonal run to the Santosh Trophy win in Siliguri, Mizoram turned out in strength to celebrate. Mindful of the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha elections, Governor Vakkom B Purushothaman took the permission of the Election Commission to declare March 12, the day the team arrived home from Kolkata, as a state holiday. Whoever can must be a part of the welcome party was the governor’s unequivocal message.</p>
<p>By the time the team landed at Lengpui Airport at 12.30 pm, and emerged with the trophy held aloft, thousands in red shirts had gathered at the terminal, waving red flags (the team’s colour) and dancing and singing the team’s theme song Lalpa’n thil ropui min tihsak e (The Lord has done something great for us), to the accompaniment of a brass band and the traditional Mizo khuang (drum).</p>
<p>“You may find it strange, but we did not celebrate that much in Siliguri. We went back to where we were staying, had our dinner, chatted and slept. We were saving the celebrations for when we got home. We knew a big party was awaiting us,” said Zico in an interview later on.</p>
<p>With a traffic police SUV and two siren-mounted motorcycles in the lead and a convoy of 100-odd Royal Enfield motorcycles behind, the team was driven through 31 km of highway in the open back of a truck to Aizawl. Tens of thousands more lined up the streets in the city, to cheer the champions.</p>
<p>Lammual, where the cavalcade ended, was set for a night-long celebratory concert. As the late afternoon sun turned the ground yellow, Tetea took the stage. “We all know how big India is. We know how many people there are in India. And we know how small and remote our state is, and how so few of us are there,” he said. “But we are the champions! We are the champions!”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010700&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Lewis Hamilton captured pole position for Mercedes for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in a thrilling finish to a rain-hit qualifying session on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hamilton saved the best for last with his final lap after Australian Daniel Ricciardo had topped the timesheets only seconds earlier on his first race weekend for champions Red Bull.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Briton&#8217;s time of one minute 44.231 seconds on a wet Albert Park track was just over three-tenths of a second faster than Ricciardo, who upstaged quadruple world champion team mate Sebastian Vettel to delight the home fans.</p>
<p>Vettel, winner of the last nine races of 2013, set only the 13th best time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today made it so much harder with the conditions, but I&#8217;m really happy with the job the team did,&#8221; said Hamilton. &#8220;These cars are much harder driving in the wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mercedes&#8217; Nico Rosberg will start third on the grid alongside McLaren&#8217;s 21-year-old Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen, who underlined his talent with a poised drive in trying conditions.</p>
<p>Ferrari&#8217;s Fernando Alonso qualified fifth with Jean-Eric Vergne sixth fastest for Toro Rosso.</p>
<p>It was the first time Vettel had failed to make the final round of qualifying since he started 11th on the grid in Belgium in 2012, before battling through the field to finish the race second.</p>
<p>Vettel will move up to 12th, however, with Williams&#8217; Finnish driver Valtteri Bottas in 10th place taking a five place penalty for a gearbox change.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old German was in esteemed company, with two other champions &#8211; McLaren&#8217;s Jenson Button and Ferrari&#8217;s Kimi Raikkonen &#8211; also failing to get into the final group of 10. Button qualified 11th.</p>
<p>Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion, was 12th fastest in his first race since returning to Maranello after crashing into the wall at turn 14.</p>
<p>Lotus&#8217;s horror week continued as both Frenchman Romain Grosjean and Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado were among the six slowest failing to make it through the first round of qualifying.</p>
<p>Grosjean locked up and spun off after posting the slowest lap time in the opening session, while Maldonado was unable even to trouble the timesheets.</p>
<p>Sauber&#8217;s Mexican Esteban Gutierrez, who qualified 19th, also collected a five-place grid penalty for the race for having a new gearbox.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010381&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former deputy secretary general of FIFA, Jerome Champagne, announced in January that he will contest for the post of FIFA’s president in the elections in April 2015. Talking on the sidelines of the Goa International Football table organised by Goa Football Development Council, the Frenchman explains how globalisation has impacted football and why it is necessary to introduce new, dynamic rules to reinvigorate the sport.</p>
<p><strong>What makes you throw you hat into the ring for FIFA presidency?</strong></p>
<p>If you look at past 20 years, globalisation has had a positive impact on football. It is the No.1 sport without any doubt. But it has come with difficulties. The first one is the gap between wealthy clubs, leagues and players, and the rest has increased. So has the gap between continents, countries of the same continents and the clubs playing in same competitions. Two decades ago, it was still possible for a club from Netherlands, Norway, Eastern Europe or my country France to go very far in the Champions League. Now it’s not possible. The gap between clubs is so huge. The way money in Champions League is distributed across Europe is distorting the competitions in every country. These inequalities are placing the game in a position of danger. Second reason is the privatisation of the game. Foreign governments and private companies invest in a team not for the love of the game. For instance, in the French league we have a Qatari club (PSG), a Russian club (Monaco) competing for top two spots and 18 French clubs are competing for the third. It is unfair. Lastly, a lot of accusations leveled against FIFA are unfair. Mr Sepp Blatter is not a corrupt man. FIFA is not a corrupt organisation. Football institutions have lost credibility. I decided to stand because this perception needs to change.</p>
<p><strong>How big an issue is this disparity?</strong></p>
<p>It’s ‘elitisation’ or ‘NBA-isation’ of football, where the concentration is on one percent of the countries, players and clubs. Football will become like basketball. In basketball, you have the NBA and the rest; in that game, the world basketball federation has no control over the NBA and it is clear that some people want football to go the same way. If we want this alternative of pure elitism then we don’t need FIFA. We need more democratic, respected and proactive body. I am not against globalisation. It has helped India grow so much. But it comes with potholes. For instance, EPL makes $50mn from India. How much do the reinvest in India? Zero. I do not have the exact figure of how much UEFA makes from India but how much do they reinvest? Zero.</p>
<p><strong>How do you plan to tackle it?</strong></p>
<p>It is a misconception that FIFA president is a very powerful post. But I intend to make some institutional changes. Three continents are under-represented and that needs to change. For example, Europe with 53 federations has 8 seats. Africa with 54 has only 4. We at FIFA cannot ignore this. If we want to keep FIFA relevant in the future in terms of world governance then we need to be proactive in correcting the inequalities.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve advocated a few revolutionary ideas.</strong></p>
<p>The referees are the persons doing the most difficult job. Most good referees are aged between 35 and 45. They are running after kids who are 25 and can run faster. Most of the stuff happens behind their back. In a split second, they have to take decisions which will be scrutinised and criticised. These guys deserve all the respect. I have made a few concrete suggestions. We cannot accept the players screaming at referees. Hence, I feel only captains should have the right to speak to the referees. If there is any aggressive objection then you move the free-kick by 10 yards. This rule was tested in last year’s u-17 competition but those players are babies and they hardly objected a referee’s decisions.</p>
<p>Second is the concept of sin bins or what I call the orange card. Let me give you a concrete example. In the first half a player gets a yellow because he commits a bad foul. In the second half he scores a goal, takes off his jersey in celebration, gets a second yellow and he is out. You place the referee in a position where he either has to ignore the regulations or to probably distort the end result of the match. So you need to give them another option. This rule exists in basketball, rugby, hockey and other sports. You cannot prevent a referee from giving a red card if the player deserves it.</p>
<p><strong>How much does Pele backing your bid help?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone will agree that Pele is the best footballer in history. He is a man who has been very active against racism and has supported South Africa’s bid. I was privileged to know when I was No.3 at French embassy to Brazil. He was the minister of sport back then and we became friends. To have someone like Pele endorsing me is something incredible as a candidate and a person. I remember I was 12 at my grandma’s place watching him in the 1970 World Cup. It is an honour but also a responsibility because I cannot fail him.</p>
<p><strong>Sepp Blatter focused a lot on India. How do you plan to carry that on?</strong></p>
<p>I have known your country and football because I have closely monitored the projects here with Mr Blatter. Four countries — China, India, USA and Indonesia represent 45 percent of world’s population. These four countries football have a huge margin to grow. Your country has intelligent people, educated people and strong business sector. There are all recipes to succeed. So you have to roll up your sleeves. Now you also have the U-17 World Cup. Don’t miss this opportunity. This is one shot, one opportunity and you cannot allow yourself to miss it.</p>
<p><strong>Regarding the structure of the domestic game in India, do you think a six-week tournament like the Indian Super League can be helpful?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it’s an illusion to think that you can change football on national basis with a tournament that will last for six weeks. A lot of people are involved IMG-Reliance project. Let’s wait and see. But I feel we need to solidify the current league, expand second division and increase youth participation. A state like Mizoram winning Santosh Trophy shows that you can succeed even more when you start from scratch. It’s about doing the right things.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010189&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of India’s top corporates have responded enthusiastically to a call to invest in kabaddi, India’s biggest indigenous sport. The result is a eight-city professional league with a prize purse of Rs 1 crore, and plenty of optimism about the venture taking off inspite of kabaddi being a distinctly desi sport.</p>
<p>Managing Director of Pro Kabaddi’s organising group Mashal Sports, Charu Sharma, believes that the fact that it is uniquely an Indian sport was one of main themes that were pitched to the corporates. “Americans take pride in American football, their own creation. Australians thrive on Footie (Australian Rules Football) even though no other country plays it. They both respect their traditional sport and celebrate it. Why shouldn’t we?” says Sharma.</p>
<p>The Mumbai franchise has been purchased by founder and former CEO of UTV Group Ronnie Screwvala. “Next to where I grew up at Grant Road was a small ground. Nobody played cricket or football there. It was all kabaddi. And everyone enjoyed it,” the former studio head says, explaining his enthusiasm for the sport into which he is heavily investing after moving out of the entertainment sphere.</p>
<p>At the introductory ceremony for Pro Kabaddi at the National Sports Club of India, Mumbai, Anand Mahindra, the corporate honcho who is the force behind Pro Kabaddi roping in other corporates, says the project is very close to his heart.</p>
<p>After making it clear that his involvement in the venture is based on a personal capacity, Mahindra admits that the thought of promoting an indigenous sport was one that appealed to him. “The sport needed a revival. As a principle of the brand that I have represented for all these years, we look to support the underdog and bring forth a rise,” he says.</p>
<p>Other owners include Rajesh Shah (Co-Chairman of Mukund Group in steels) who bought the Kolkata franchise, and CEO of Future Group Kishore Biyani, who is deciding between purchasing the Patna and Delhi teams. GMR Group and Murugappa Group are others looking to invest in a franchise.</p>
<p>A hundred players will compete, 72 being Indian while the rest being foreign, coming from Japan, Afghanistan, Canada, South Korea, Italy, Turkmenistan, Zimbabwe, Pakistan, England and the United States among others.</p>
<p>The Pro league will be played on red or pink mats to make it more appealing for the high-quality TV broadcast. “The sport has always attracted massive crowds even in cities like at Shivaji Park in Mumbai and all across Punjab and Haryana and south in TN. This sport has the potential to surprise India,” said a franchise official.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010188&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bengal batsmen couldn’t take advantage of the wicket stripped off its grass, getting bowled out for 185, with Railways chasing down the target with 70 balls to spare. Railways made the final of the Vijay Hazare Trophy with a comfortable five-wicket win, where they will play Karnataka on Sunday.</p>
<p>Three days ago in the quarterfinal against Tamil Nadu, Bengal had folded for 167 but still won by 77 runs because Eden Gardens green-top helped their seamers. Before the semifinal, the team management instructed the curator to mow down the grass. The change backfired. Bengal didn’t have the patience that was needed on the dusty track and were bowled out for 185 in 47.4 overs. Railways never threatened to fall apart in the chase.</p>
<p>Maybe Mohammed Shami’s absence — the fast bowler left for Dhaka for the World T20 — prompted the Bengal camp to take a defensive route. It was unusual, for all their success at home this season was based on playing in seamer-friendly conditions. In Shami’s absence, Ashok Dinda was expected to take the lead. But the medium pacer lacked the change of pace required to get the better of the conditions.</p>
<p>Dinda also lacked support from the other end as Laxmi Ratan Shukla wasted the new ball and Veer Pratap Singh, three late wickets notwithstanding, looked non-threatening. Railways’ openers Amit Paunikar and Shivakant Shukla started the chase in aggressive fashion, adding 109 for the first wicket in 21.4 overs. It was the end of the contest.</p>
<p><strong>Paunikar, the aggressor</strong></p>
<p>Paunikar played the role of an aggressor. He started off with back-to-back boundaries off the Bengal captain in the second over. Then he slapped Dinda to the point boundary. And as Veer Pratap came, Paunikar welcomed him with a boundary to square leg. He raced to his half-century in just 52 balls and by the time he got out for 83 (86 balls), Railways were almost through.</p>
<p>Shukla anchored the other end. When Paunikar got out, he was batting on 14 off 45 balls. He upped his strike-rate a bit after that and remained unbeaten on 56 in 88 balls. They suffered mild jitters in the middle as four wickets fell for 31 runs, but the target was always within reach.</p>
<p>Earlier, Bengal won the toss and elected to bat but lost wickets at regular intervals. This was not a pitch that encouraged big hits but all Bengal batsmen, except for Manoj Tiwary, refused to grind it out. Tiwary made 61 off 95 balls with just one four, but he played a lone hand.</p>
<p>For Railways, Chanderpal Saini took three wickets with his slow medium pace, leg-spinner Karn Sharma and left-arm spinner Ashish Yadav bagged two wickets apiece. Medium pacer Anureet Singh once again stood out, with one for 22 in eight overs.</p>
<p>Brief scores: Bengal 185 all out in 47.4 overs (M Tiwary 61, S Goswami 38; CP Saini 3/25, A Yadav 2/25) lost to Railways 188/5 in 38.2 overs (A Paunikar 83, S Shukla 56*; VP Singh 3/54) by 5 wickets</p>
<p><strong>Another ton by uthappa</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Robin Uthappa slammed a 135-ball 133 to set up Karnataka’s 21-run win over a spirited Jharkhand as the Ranji and Irani Trophy champions stormed into the Vijay Hazare Trophy final at the JU second campus ground in Salt Lake on Friday.</p>
<p>Ishank Jaggi kept Jharkhand in the hunt with a belligerent ton, hitting 144 from 121 balls in an 87-run partnership with skipper Saurabh Tiwary (47) but Karnataka skipper Vinay Kumar (4/75) took two wickets in two balls after H S Sharath dismissed the centurion to restrict Jharkhand to 302/9 in the stipulated 50 overs.</p>
<p>In pursuit of an unprecedented hattrick of titles at the domestic level, Karnataka will face Railways in the one-day tournament summit clash at Eden Gardens Sunday.<br />
Brief scores: Karnataka 323/6 (R Uthappa 133, L Rahul 67, M Agarwal 66; R Shukla 3/59) beat Jharkhand 302/9 (I Jaggi 141, S Tiwary 47; V Kumar 4/75, Abhimanyu Mithun 3/52) by 21 runs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010187&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The blazing floodlights of the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium catch the eye as soon as one hits the busy Mirpur roads that have cycle rickshaws, carts, trucks, buses, cars, two-wheelers, animals and, of course, the teeming thousands. It doesn’t matter that if its Friday, you never walk alone around here. Despite the crowd, it’s easy to spot an outsider.</p>
<p>Unlike those who are fresh off the boat, the locals, too busy negotiating the chaos, don’t give the illuminated stadium a second glance. They seem to be in a rush to reach home. On Sunday, though, the collective focus of this cricket-crazy nation will be on the 26,000-seater venue as Bangladesh play Afghanistan in the opening game of the World T20.</p>
<p>There’s anxiety about the game since Bangladesh, of late, hasn’t been on top of its game. The loss to Afghanistan during Asia Cup last week happens to be one of the seven defeats in their winless ODI stretch. But still, the die-hards haven’t given up on their team.</p>
<p>Shafiul Alam, one of the founding members of Bangladesh Cricket Supporters Association, established by 21 members three months ago, is a typical cricket romantic.<br />
“This is not the first time Bangladesh have done badly. As true fans we will turn out to support the team again and will hope and pray for a revival. The World T20 is an opportunity for the Tigers and our country to showcase its best side after the recent turmoil on and off the field. We have to make the most of the opportunity,” Alam said.</p>
<p><strong>Thrill of shorter format</strong></p>
<p>There may be many who might not share Alam’s optimism but the excitement of watching the best in the world in the coming days is evident. There is anticipation in the air to watch the thrilling games with big hits and flying stumps, something that the shortest format guarantees. Every World T20 event has seen packed houses and Bangladesh will certainly not change the trend.</p>
<p>Actually, the local are quite relieved that the world has finally checked in. That’s because Bangladesh almost lost the hosting rights for World T20 after violent clashes and riots following political unrest. Doubts were raised about Bangladesh’s readiness for the event and security for the cricketers. An incident-free Asia Cup has seen the cloud of uncertainty blow away.</p>
<p>But what can make this World T20 truly memorable event for the hosts will be the performance of Bangladesh. There is a real fear that the home team might not even advance to the second stage — the Super 10s.</p>
<p>Clubbed along with Afghanistan, Nepal and Hong Kong, they happen to be in Group A. Only the winner from this group and Group B (Zimbabwe, Ireland, UAE and Netherlands) will join the top-eight teams. Once they clear the first high hurdle — Afghanistan — there will be a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Habibul Bashar, the former skipper who is currently a selector, believes that the World T20 will be a different story.</p>
<p>“The team wants to forget the recent record and start afresh. The Asia Cup was a tournament where the team disappointed the fans. But this is bigger than the Asia Cup as Bangladesh is single-handedly hosting a world event. This is a huge opportunity for the Bangladesh team to bring joy back to the nation and also show the world how good we can be,” Bashar said. And for that, they need to play like Tigers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010184&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Edwards also said that the BCCI had given a commitment to keep the IPL in its present size and not expand its duration for at least the next eight years.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010183&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CRICKET Australia chairman Wally Edwards has revealed that the BCCI had threatened to go on an IPL voyage and ‘leave world cricket behind’ if the ICC didn’t enforce a structural overhaul to reflect the Indian board’s financial contribution.</p>
<p>And that it were these tactics that had led to the formation of the controversial ‘position paper’ that then got a thumbs-up from nine of the 10 member nations last month.</p>
<p>In an interview to ESPNcricinfo, Edwards also said that the BCCI had given a commitment to keep the IPL in its present size and not expand its duration for at least the next eight years. The Indian board, however, has insisted that they hadn’t committed to any such deal.</p>
<p>“We’ve made a commitment to whom? That’s the first question. Secondly, nothing could be called a commitment unless something has been agreed upon in writing. Yes, we discussed the IPL issue with different cricket boards on the sidelines of the ICC meetings but I would like to maintain that no written commitment has been made. At the same time, I can say that there’s no plan to expand IPL in the immediate future,” a BCCI source told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>Edwards also said, “We have a commitment from them that the IPL dates won’t change, the start date won’t change and the length of the tournament won’t change. They’ve given us that commitment. IPL is important to them, and to the world of cricket players who make a lot of money out of it, and we didn’t want to see it grow.”<br />
The issue reportedly came up for discussion during the recent ICC Board meetings and Edwards says that the BCCI had to be persuaded to avert a Packer-like situation when almost all top international stars had shunned mainstream cricket to join the ‘revolution’.</p>
<p>He also expressed fears that there was a real possibility of the ‘IPL turning into a travelling circus that would take all our good cricketers 12 months of a year and leave us with second rate international cricket’.</p>
<p>“It’s not a pretty thought. But it’s possible, and they know that. Maybe in the end it will still happen one day, but I don’t think it will happen in the next eight years,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>PACKER REVISITED</strong></p>
<p>Far from having agreed to keep the IPL in tact, the BCCI insider also revealed that the board was yet to sign the Members Participation Agreement (MPA) for the TV rights for the next rights cycle, and the issue will once again be tabled in the next ICC meetings. “There are a few issues in this regard which need to be looked into. We will reach an agreement through discussion,” said the source.</p>
<p>While drawing parallels with the infamous row between the then Australian Cricket Board and Kerry Packer in the 1970s that led to the formation of World Series Cricket, Edwards indicated that with the MPA still not signed, it was better to not antagonise or alienate the BCCI.</p>
<p>It was the media tycoon who ended up with the best players in the world at his disposal, leaving world cricket deeply undernourished with talent.</p>
<p>“India are strong and we’ve got to recognise that, but what we want them to do is be part of the decision-making process and be in the ICC rather than just turning up and being aggressive, angry and unhappy,” he said.  By drafting and agreeing upon the ‘position paper’ Edwards claimed to have found a middle ground with the BCCI, one where they seemed convinced enough to not let the IPL gobble up international cricket.</p>
<p>“They’ve said more than once ‘you can have a World Cup but we won’t be coming’. We can argue they might come, but will they come to Champions Trophy or a World Twenty20? They might not. I can easily see them not coming,” Edwards said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010183&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mario Gomez dusted off his shooting boots to put Fiorentina in the driving seat with a 1-1 Europa League draw at Juventus while Benfica were too good for Tottenham Hotspur, winning their last-16 first leg 3-1 away on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gomez had not scored since returning in February after five months out with a knee injury but tilted the tie in his team’s favour with a 79th-minute strike while Real Betis tore up the form book to win 2-0 at local rivals Sevilla.</p>
<p>Twice winners Porto beat Napoli 1-0 thanks to Jackson Martinez’s superb finish and Helton’s agile goalkeeping. Valencia played for more than an hour with 10 men but still beat Ludogorets 3-0 in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>The goals, however, dried up for Salzburg who were held to a 0-0 draw at Basel, ending a run of 14 successive wins in all competitions.</p>
<p>Juventus’s clash with Fiorentina  came four days after the two sides met in Serie A. Juventus, three places and 27 points clear of their domestic rivals, won 1-0 on Sunday and took the lead after three minutes when the ball fell kindly at the feet of Arturo Vidal and he dispatched it powerfully into the net from 10 metres.</p>
<p>Gomez came off the bench in the 67th minute and made a decisive impact, controlling a lofted pass before shooting through the legs of Juventus keeper Gianluigi Buffon.</p>
<p>Tottenham were hosting Benfica for the first time since they met in the European Cup semi-final in 1962. Benfica won that tie and were thoroughly on top when they went ahead after 30 minutes. Rodrigo raced onto a throughball from Ruben Amorim and picked his spot, curling his finish with his in-step into the far corner.</p>
<p>Christian Eriksen curled in a free kick to reduce the deficit but Luisao struck again, pouncing on a rebound to shoot into the roof of the net from close range.</p>
<p>Tottenham defender Younes Kaboul refused to throw in the towel however. “Everything is possible in football,” he told ITV. “We will go there to win and see what happens.”</p>
<p><strong>SEVILLE DERBY</strong></p>
<p>The first Seville derby in Europe did not go according to the script as Sevilla suffered a shock home reverse against struggling rivals who are bottom of the La Liga.<br />
Betis took the lead when Baptistao powered a header into the roof of the net after 15 minutes and Salvador Sevilla put the result beyond doubt in the 77th minute when he drove the ball into the far corner of the net.</p>
<p>Porto’s preparations for their tie against Napoli were undermined when they parted company with coach Paulo Fonseca last Wednesday, but they still looked a well-drilled unit against Rafa Benitez’s side.</p>
<p>The Portuguese team survived an early second-half onslaught from Napoli thanks to the lithe reflexes of keeper Helton, who kept out a drilled shot on the turn from Gonzalo Higuain and blocked Raul Albiol’s header from close range.Minutes later they went ahead when Martinez showed a fine scorer’s instinct to drop off his marker at the far post and rifle a volley into the net from 15 metres.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010037&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lewis Hamilton lent some credibility to the hype surrounding Mercedes by posting the fastest time in Friday practice at the Australian Grand Prix, as the Formula One season kicked off with teams still battling reliability problems.</p>
<p>The 2008 world champion could not finish a lap in the first session due to a sensor problem, but topped the timesheets in the second with a lap of one minute 29.625 seconds on a glorious sunny day at Albert Park.</p>
<p>Hamilton’s quickest edged out team mate Nico Rosberg by 0.157 seconds as the pace of the two Mercedes’ drivers carried on from their promising performances in winter testing.</p>
<p>“I missed obviously P1 which I felt like was a big back-step,” Hamilton said. “I’m satisfied with P2 &#8230; Not the most perfect day but I’m really glad I got some run in P2 and just grateful I got some time to feel the car.”</p>
<p>Teams struggled to come to terms with the new turbocharged hybrid engines during pre-season, and continued to battle glitches during practice, with drivers cooling their heels for long stretches in the garages.</p>
<p>Excursions onto the track saw a number of drivers fight to handle the extra torque and reduced downforce of the new V6 units, with plenty of over-steering at corners and skids into the grass.</p>
<p>Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso handled conditions better than most, posting the quickest lap of one minute 31.840 seconds in the first session and finishing third fastest in the second.</p>
<p>Reigning quadruple champion Sebastian Vettel had a couple of nervy skids, coming onto the grass at one point in the later session, but finished an encouraging fourth, having endured a dismal winter testing with Red Bull. “I’m quite surprised today, both Dan and I did a lot of laps so that’s very good news, so let’s see what tomorrow brings,” Vettel said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jose Mourinho was at his most cagey on Friday when discussing the prospect of Chelsea opening up a nine-point lead at the top of the Premier League away to Aston Villa on Saturday.</p>
<p>Should fourth-placed Manchester City slip up at Hull City in Saturday’s early kickoff, victory at Villa could even establish a 10-point cushion for Chelsea as second and third placed sides Liverpool and Arsenal are not in action until Sunday.</p>
<p>Not that the Portuguese coach was too interested either way.</p>
<p>“I keep saying the same, the table is fake,” Mourinho, whose side have played three more matches than City, told a news conference at Chelsea’s training ground.</p>
<p>“If you look at the table, before the points column is the number of matches played. We could have 30 more points but have played 10 more so it means nothing.</p>
<p>“When everyone has the same number of matches, I don’t know when that will be, maybe in the last week, only then is the table real.”</p>
<p>Fake table or not, with 26 points from the last 30 available, it would appear that Mourinho is closing in on a third league title, having won it in 2004-05 and 2005-06 during his first spell in charge.</p>
<p>While admitting he thinks Chelsea are “ahead of schedule”, Mourinho said his side deserved to be at the top.</p>
<p>“I would prefer the destiny in my hands,” he said. “But the position at the top is real. Lots of work, lots of sweat from the players and they deserve the 66 points they have.”</p>
<p>Mourinho will take charge of his 150th Premier League game on Saturday and despite Chelsea having won the last four league clashes with Villa, racking up 16 goals in the process, he said a point “would not be too bad”.</p>
<p>“We have a very difficult match tomorrow,” he said. “After Villa comes Arsenal, we go match by match. I really live day by day and we don’t look at the table because it’s fake.”</p>
<p>Defenders David Luiz and Ashley Cole are both still unavailable, having also missed last week’s 4-0 thrashing of Tottenham Hotspur, but striker Fernando Torres could be involved at Villa Park after recovering from a hamstring injury.</p>

It depends on today’s training and conversations after the session.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2014 Formula One season hasn’t started with a bang, the kind you would hear miles away every time teams revved up their engines. Rather, it has begun, observers noted after the Australian Grand Prix’s Friday practice at Albert Park, with the whirring of a bunch of “sewing machines on wheels”.</p>
<p>The sport enters a new era with the introduction of the fresh, environment-friendly 1.6-litre six-cylinder engine. It is significantly smaller than the 2.4l, V8 beast that powered the cars between 2006 and 2013.</p>
<p>Without getting into too much technical specifications, let’s put it this way: the new engine is considerably less powerful. In making this change, F1 has meddled with two of its crowd-pullers: sight and sound. For, not only does the V6 make less noise (a term that F1 aesthetes dislike, they prefer “music”), but it also seems to have made the cars slower. And, owing to the resultant chassis design changes, uglier. Also, less reliable.</p>
<p>To make the sport greener still, F1 has introduced a slew of rule changes, too, including a cap on the amount of fuel used for a race. Now, the drivers will have to make do with 100 litres, as opposed to 150 litres last season.</p>
<p>All this ostensible tree-hugging brings in more complications to a sport many felt had already become overcomplicated. Normally, in a race, in any race, if you are the fastest, you win. Over here, however, if you push pedal to metal, it may leave you stranded on the track with an empty tank. The days of unadulterated racing, therefore, appear to be well and truly over now.</p>
<p>What you are left with, instead, is more of a tight-rope walking with the drivers having to find a fine balance. Like in tight-rope walking, the most challenging job, in the first few races at least as teams come to grips with new rules, will be to complete the race. Competing will come next.</p>
<p>That said, the 1.6-litre glass is also half-full in a way. What the rule changes have done is to reset the clock. Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull, who many blame had made F1 into a boring procession in the recent few years, are now only as fast or slow as the next car on the grid.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roger Federer charged into the semi-finals of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells on Thursday with a straight sets win over South African Kevin Anderson. The Swiss master succeeded where others had failed by blunting the serve of the towering 6ft 8in (2.13m) Anderson to win 7-5 6-1.</p>
<p>Federer faced only one break point in the entire match and reeled off seven games on the trot to clinch the opening set and race to a 5-0 lead in the second. His reward for winning was a semi-final clash on Saturday with Ukrainian giantkiller Alexandr Dolgopolov, who continued his fairytale run in the Californian desert by defeating big-serving Canadian Milos 6-3 6-4.</p>
<p>“It was big to win the set and then to go on to break early in the second,” Federer said. “Then (getting a) double break was like a bonus. From then on I was home. It was a really good match for me, basically.”</p>
<p>In the women’s draw, China’s Li Na won her rematch with Slovakia’s Dominika Cibulkova to join Italian veteran Flavia Pennetta in the semis.</p>
<p><strong>Aussie final repeat</strong></p>
<p>In her first meeting with Cibulkova since the Australian Open final in January, Li once again proved too strong for her younger opponent, winning 6-3 4-6 6-3 in a little over two and a half hours.</p>
<p>Pennetta booked her place in the last four by beating American Sloane Stephens 6-4 5-7 6-4 in a seesawing match played in gusting winds.</p>
<p>In a tournament that has been packed with surprises and high-profile casualties, the 32-year-old Li has been a model of consistency, ferociously battling through each round.</p>
<p>The Chinese top seed, in the absence of world number one Serena Williams, has struggled with her serve all week and committed eight double faults against Cibulkova, four in the opening set and four more in the third when the pressure was on.</p>
<p>The Slovak also made eight doubles while the pair combined for more than 100 unforced errors in a match that was longer and much tighter than their last meeting in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Li got the decisive break late in the third set and then served out for victory to stay on course for her first title at one of the biggest events outside the grand slams. “Here is different than Australia. Of course score should be different,” said Li. “I think today she played more aggressive. I was feeling if I try to go back like a little bit she was trying to step in to hit the ball. Also I was feeling in the second set I think I dropped down a little bit and gave her more chance. She can get a lot of winners.”</p>
<p><strong>Winds of change</strong></p>
<p>Pennetta looked to be heading for the exit when she blew her first chance to win the match then fell behind in the deciding third set. The 32-year-old was two points from victory when serving for the match in the second set when the wind suddenly started to blow a gale and her game started to unravel.</p>
<p>Stephens, 20, broke her serve and won six games in a row to jump out to a 3-0 lead in the third when Pennetta staged her own comeback, winning six of the last seven games to wrap up an extraordinary win.</p>
<p>Dolgopolov has been a revelation at Indian Wells since he was thrust into the spotlight when he scored an upset win over Rafa Nadal in the third round.</p>
<p>Players who register shock wins often fail to maintain their form on but the 28th seed has gone from strength to strength, beating three seeds in succession. Raonic beat Wimbledon champion Andy Murray on Wednesday but found Dolgopolov too hot to hold.</p>
<p>“I just wish I could have served better. But other than that, he did the right things at the right times right away from the start of the match,” said Raonic. “He was a factor of why I didn’t serve as well as I would have liked as well.”</p>
<p>Not only did Dolgopolov succeed in breaking the Canadian’s serve three times, including twice in the second set to overcome a 3-0 deficit, but showed he also has a serve to be reckoned with as he fired six aces, two more than his opponent. “I was really happy with that. And I was able to get more returns,” said Dolgopolov.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010022&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Olympic bronze medallist Saina Nehwal set up a quarterfinal clash with world number three and top seed Yihan Wang, while Commonwealth Games bronze winner Parupalli Kashyap, too, entered the last eight in the Swiss Grand Prix Gold tournament in Basel on Friday.</p>
<p>The 23 year-old from Hyderabad registered an easy 21-7 21-13 win over Sashina Vignes Waran of France in the pre-quarterfinals that lasted 34 minutes in the women’s singles competition.</p>
<p>Kashyap, on the other hand, had to toil hard before prevailing over Malaysia’s Beryno Jiann Tze Wong 21-23 21-9 21-14 in a 57-minute men’s singles match at St. Jakobshalle. He will next take on Chinese Taipei’s Tien Chen Chou in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Saina, who had beaten Sashina in the same tournament in 2011 and 2013, didn’t have any problem whatsoever and in five giant strides snatched the opening game, moving to 6-1 and then 13-2, before closing it with three straight points from 18-7.</p>
<p>In the second game, the sixth seeded Indian was chased by the World number 42 French from 3-8 to 11-12, but Saina reeled off six points at 15-13 to seal her place in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>The World number eight Indian has a poor record against Yihan, losing six times and her only victory was at the London Olympics when the Chinese had retired midway because of a knee injury.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve strength</strong></p>
<p>World number 25 Kashyap, meanwhile, had to dig deep in his reserves in the opening game but despite being 20-19, the Indian could not press home the slight advantage.</p>
<p>In the second game, the 27-year-old showed his class as he didn’t allow the Malaysian any chance to come near and led right from the start to make a roaring comeback in the contest.</p>
<p>In the decider, Wong made early strides and led 10-5, but Kashyap clawed back at 11-11 and then zoomed ahead from 14-13 to 20-13 with a six-point burst. He then closed the door on the Malaysian.</p>
<p>Kashyap’s next opponent is world number 22 Tien but the Indian will take heart from the fact that he had beaten him in the Macau Open in 2011.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010015&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Gaganjeet Bhullar, who shot a five-under 67 on first day, was playing in second half of the day in second round. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010013&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiv Kapur lost his way on back-nine but kept his scores steady and ensured he would make the midway cut at the Trophée Hassan II in Morocco. Kapur, who had a topsy-turvy first round had a similar day in the second round. He had rounds of 70 and 71 in his first two rounds to stay inside top 20, but that will change with the others, including fellow Indian Gaganjeet Bhullar (67 in first round), yet to start his second round.</p>
<p>Kapur, who earned his way into the main European Tour, with two wins on the European Challenge Tour last year, has found the going tough on the front half of the Golf du Palais Royal course on both days.</p>
<p>On the first day, he was three-over for the front nine with two birdies, three bogeys and one double bogey but made up with a stunning streak of four in a row from 14th to 17th to finish at two-under 70.</p>
<p>On the second day, Kapur birdied the 10th, just as he had on first day, and also birdied the 12th, before finding three more in a row from 15th through to 17th at which point he was five-under through eight holes.</p>
<p>But he dropped his first shot of the second day on the 18th. On the second nine, the front half of the course, he dropped bogeys on first and second, just as he done on first day, and seventh to come down to a round of 71 and a total of three-under 141 at tied 20-the with much of the field yet to finish.</p>
<p>Gaganjeet Bhullar, who shot a five-under 67 on first day, was playing in second half of the day in second round. Alejandro Cañizares carded a career-low round of 62 to claim the lead after the first round of the Trophée Hassan II and he was five-under through 17 holes in second. He was three ahead of Seve Benson, who opened the tournament with a 63, was at 13-under through 15 holes in second round after being four-under for second day.</p>
<p><strong>SSP on course</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile in Manila, SSP Chowrasia put himself in perfect position to take a shot at title glory for the first time since 2011, as he moved within a shot of co-leaders, Angelo Que and Miguel Tabuena of the Philippines at the halfway stage of the US$300,000 Solaire Open on Friday.</p>
<p>While Que and Tabuena were tied for the lead at seven-under 135, Chowrasia, who lost his European Tour card last year, was six-under 136 after two identical rounds of 68 each.</p>
<p>He birdied the seventh, bogeyed eighth and turned in even par. On the back he was steady with three birdies on 10th, 14th and 16th and did not drop any shots.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010013&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[After draw in second round of Candidates, former world champion joined in lead by Svidler and Kramnik<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010010&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The second round games at the Candidates tournament in Khanty-Mansiysk spun on a different axis to that of the opening day, with three boards yielding results on Friday. Playing black, Viswanathan Anand consolidated on his first round win over World No. 2 Levon Aronian with a comfortable draw against Veselin Topalov, while Peter Svidler and Vladimir Kramnik joined the Indian at the top of the table with wins. Aronian too got his challenge back on track with a win against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov.</p>
<p>Topalov had unsuccessfully challenged Anand for the world title in 2011, and was coming into the game on the back of a loss to Anand, giving the then-world champion a rare win in 2013. Topalov, though, is ranked three spots above Anand in the latest ratings, and was considered one of the outside favourites at the beginning of the tournament. The Bulgarian began with a non-conventional opening, the Reti, much like Magnus Carlsen had against Anand, in the early stages of the championship match in November last year. Anand wasn’t too troubled by the opening then (he even had something of an advantage in a few of the Retis against Carlsen), and Friday did not prove much different.</p>
<p>Anand played a novelty early in the opening (7&#8230; Bd6), which was perhaps a remnant of his preparation from during the match against Carlsen. The idea was to sacrifice a central pawn, but instead force a speedy exchange of queens and fracture white’s queen-side pawns. The engines approved of Anand’s plan — black was evaluated to have neutralised white’s first-move advantage as early as around the 13th move. In the middle game, Anand had the option of forcing a draw through repetition, but he chose not to go for it perhaps because Topalov had by then fallen a bit behind on the clock.</p>
<p>Still, with just rooks and pawns on the board, the complications Anand sought to enforce didn’t worry Topalov. The Bulgarian held on to the extra pawn, but the game had by then entered the ‘theoretically drawn’ relm. The Sofia Rules which bars players from signing quick draws are not in force this tournament. Topalov, though, has at various points in the past asked for the Sofia rules to be made mandatory in big tournaments, and unsurprisingly, played on until the board was stripped off all the pieces except for the two kings.</p>
<p>The draw had taken 54 moves, but that it was the first game of the round to come to an end suggests that the players weren’t exactly wading through murky waters. Though Topalov has looked fairly solid in the first set of games ahead of Saturday’s rest day, he will know bigger tests await after. He will play top seed Aronian in the next set of matches. Anand will play bottom-placed Mamedyarov.</p>
<p>Aronian was the beneficiary of the most straight-forward result of the round, as Mamedyarov blundered early in the Queen’s gambit declined (Rafozin Defence) setup, giving the Armenian a queen for a rook and bishop. That it was a blunder and that Mamedyarov could do precious little about the position was evident from his use of the clock. Despite the early mistake, Mamedyarov did not use more than nine minutes for any of his moves subsequently, until he resigned on move 44.</p>
<p>Andreikin again played a wild game, but this time he could not really pull back like in the first round draw against Kramnik. There was the rare sight of Andreikin’s two central connected pawns sitting within a square of promotion, at d2 and e2, but even that was not enough. Svidler’s rooks were perfectly positioned, going on a jaunt, picking up black pieces but returning right in time to thwart the ambitious pawns. Andreikin resigned on the 31st move.</p>
<p>Kramnik’s win over Sergey Karjakin was the longest game of the day. Kramnik came out the better of the Queen’s gambit declined opening despite Karjakin’s novelty. Kramnik threw in an exchange sacrifice to force the win, though both players had less than three minutes by the time Karjakin threw in the towel on move 39.</p>
<p>Rankings after round 2: 1-3. V Anand, P Svidler, V Kramnik (1.5 pts); 4-5. V Topalov, L Aronian (1); 6-8. D Andreikin, S Karjakin, S Mamedyarov (0.5)</p>
<p>Results, round 2: Kramnik bt Karjakin, Svidler bt Andreikin, Topalov drew with Anand, Aronian bt Mamedyarov</p>
<p>Pairings for round 3: Andreikin vs Karjakin, Svidler vs Kramnik, Topalov vs Aronian, Mamedyarov vs Anand</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010010&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FORMER India captain Rahul Dravid has made it clear that he isn’t interested in becoming India coach as of now while also insisting that calls for the ouster of Duncan Fletcher were premature.The 41-year-old though didn’t rule out the possibility of the coveted job attracting his attention in the years to come.<br />
In the wake of India’s back-to-back failures away from home in South Africa and New Zealand, not to mention the early exit in the Asia Cup, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar had proposed the sacking of Fletcher with the incumbent coach being replaced by Dravid. But having hung up his boots just two years ago, Dravid felt that he wasn’t ready to take on the assignment.</p>
<p>“I am happy and honoured that he (Gavaskar) thinks I am capable of doing the job. But the job requires a lot of time, almost 11 months a year. I have just retired and at the moment because of time constraints, I have to decline (the suggestion),” he said.</p>
<p>Gavaskar had touted Dravid to be the best man for the job in India citing that he was enormously respected by the present Indian players. Come next month, the prolific former No.3 will be an integral part of the coaching staff at Rajasthan Royals, the franchise that he spent the last three years of his IPL career with. And despite expressing enthusiasm in terms of helping the next generation, Dravid said that the taking over the mantle with the national team wasn’t in his plans for the near future.</p>
<p>“But who knows some day, sometime in the future after few years. I am involved with Rajasthan Royals for a couple of months this time with a slightly different role. And time permitting I would love to work with the Under-19s or India A on shorter tours,” he added.</p>
<p>During his lengthy and successful career, Dravid played under a variety of national coaches, both Indian and foreign, including the likes of John Wright, Greg Chappell and Gary Kirsten. It was under Fletcher, however, that he ended his career. And despite the Zimbabwean’s inability to resurrect India’s fortunes abroad, Dravid felt that the BCCI was unlikely to change the coach before2015.</p>
<p>“You got to give the coaching staff and support staff four years to try and change things. With two big tours of Australia and England coming up and the World Cup after that it is unlikely that India will change its coaching staff or any part of the leadership group. I guess they will review that after the World Cup,” he pointed out.</p>
<p><strong>Nationality no bar</strong></p>
<p>If it was under Wright that Indian cricket saw its stocks rise away from home, Dravid captained India to their first Test series win in the West Indies in over 30 years with the aegies of Chappell. Then came the World Cup glory in 2011 with Kirsten at the helm. And Dravid believed that the ‘nationality’ of the coach shouldn’t even come up for discussion. The only thing that should matter was whether he was the best man for the job.</p>
<p>“Having said that, coaching in India has become very professional. There are a number of impressive coaches plying their job in the Ranji Trophy presently. It’s a great sign for Indian cricket. And in the future we might have an Indian good enough to take over the reins,” he explained.</p>
<p>While Fletcher has attracted incessant flak of late for the lack of impact he’s had on the Indian team since taking over in 2011, Dravid insisted that the team’s fortunes depended on the senior players’ contribution.</p>
<p>“I think sometimes the role of a coach is overstated but the responsibility should always lie with the senior players. At the end of the day, it is their team. A team is defined by what the senior players bring to the party and in the end, and so too the captain as they are the ones who have to perform. The coach can help bring the right environment and conditions,” he said.</p>
<p>He added, “You can’t necessarily always judge coaches on results. If someone is coaching Bangladesh he’s not going to always get great results but that doesn’t mean he is doing a bad job. That is why sometimes coaches are on a hiding to nothing. They can’t really influence the course of a game but they get judged.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010006&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Of the last ball with West Indies needing seven to win, England’s  Dernbach bowled two wides of which Sammy left only one alone. 	<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010003&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>England resisted a late West Indies surge and held on for a consolation five-run victory in the third and final Twenty20 international at Kensington Oval. Despite surrendering the series to the home side 2-1, yesterday’s match was a personal triumph for Chris Jordan.</p>
<p>The Barbados-born all-rounder smashed Dwayne Bravo for four sixes off the final over of the England innings to lift his team to 165 for six after they had lost six wickets for 40 runs following an opening stand of 98 between Michael Lumb (63) and Alex Hales (38).</p>
<p>He then claimed three for 39 and took an outstanding catch on the boundary to dismiss Bravo, a magnificent effort that was enough to earn him the man of the match award in very familiar surroundings as West Indies were restricted to 160 for seven. “I’m just happy to have made the most of the opportunity,” said Jordan in reflecting on his performance.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to get into the game, and did that with the bat, then it rolled over into my bowling.” West Indies were indebted to Lendl Simmons (69) and Denesh Ramdin (33) in getting them back into the match after they had slumped to 67 for five in pursuit of that target of 166.</p>
<p>Jade Dernbach started the rout with the wicket of Dwayne Smith off the first ball of the innings while Jordan removed Johnson Charles and Marlon Samuels. They put on 73 for the sixth wicket before Jordan returned to get rid of Ramdin in the penultimate over.</p>
<p>West Indies skipper Darren Sammy came to the crease with every expectation that he would have still been able to pull off a minor miracle with the bat, as he did in the series-clinching win two days earlier. He struck two fours and a six almost immediately, but needing 17 off the final over bowled by Dernbach, the run out of Simmons along with the bowler’s tactic of bowling wide of off-stump proved critical in the end.</p>
<p>“Credit to the guys for taking it down to the final over,” said Sammy. “We’ve seen what some of the guys have to offer so it gives the selectors a real headache when we get to Bangladesh (for the World Twenty20).” West Indies had rested big-hitter Chris Gayle and specialist bowlers Ravi Rampaul and Samuel Badree for the match with the series already in the bag.</p>
<p>But it took nothing away from England’s delight on finishing off the short campaign with a victory after having already taken the one-day series 2-1. “This was a tremendous result and Chris’ performance shows that we have some strength in depth going into the World Cup,” said England stand-in captain Eoin Morgan. “Defeating a good West Indies like this gives us a lot of confidence moving forward.”</p>
<p>Brief scores: England 165/6 in 20 overs (M Lumb 63, A Hales 38, C Jordan 27 n.o; K Santokie 2/27, S Cottrell 2/37) bt WI 160/7 in 20 overs (L Simmons 69, D Ramdin 33; C Jordan 3/39, R Bopara 2/28, J Dernbach 1/38)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2010003&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Six and a half years ago, it India’s triumph in the inaugural World T20 that saw an aura grow around Mahendra Singh Dhoni. On Friday, as Dhoni spoke ahead of the fifth edition of the event, he seemed desperate to turn back the clock.</p>
<p>India have arrived in Dhaka licking wounds from failed campaigns in South Africa and New Zealand (Tests and ODIs). Under Virat Kohli, who stood in for an injured Dhoni, the team didn’t play like world champions in the Asia Cup.</p>
<p>The team’s form in ODIs has been patchy as they have won just two of their last 12 ODIs, the only wins coming against Bangladesh and Afghanistan in the Asia Cup. Against tougher opposition, namely Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the side was beaten in home-like conditions in Bangladesh.<br />
India has been restricted to playing just one T20 International in the last 14 months. In that particular game they beat Australia with two balls to spare. Since that October night, the highs have been few in terms of results.</p>
<p>Dhoni was guarded when he spoke about his team’s chances. “Our group is quite a competitive one (Pakistan, Australia, West Indies and one qualifier) so all the matches will be important. In the last T20 World Cup, we lost just one match but still we were out of the tournament. So every match is important and we have to be at our best throughout,” Dhoni said on Friday.</p>
<p>Talking about the team’s recent dip in form, Dhoni added, “I think we have had to endure tough times recently but even in these situations it’s not like we hadn’t played good cricket. If you look at our Test performances away from home since 2011 you will see that our displays haven’t been up to the mark.  In the last two away series (against South Africa and New Zealand) we have shown that we have talent though we lost both the series.”</p>
<p>The skipper was confident that the Indian team would not carry any baggage from the losses in Tests and ODIs into the Twenty20 format. “T20 is a completely different format. I don’t think it will have a direct affect on twenty20 performance.”</p>
<p>For Dhoni, the period just before the World T20 was an opportunity to step back and take a much needed break after a side strain before the Asia Cup.</p>
<p>“For me, the positive side was to get a bit of rest. I was at home with no work. It was something that I would appreciate. You don’t want to get injured and miss a series. So overall, a good 10-12 days off,” he said. The niggle was perhaps a blessing in disguise for a skipper who has faced a fair amount of flak recently. The WT20 may be as liberating as it was for Dhoni when on his first assignment as skipper.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009996&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Fletcher was summoned by the BCCI chief N Srinivasan for a meeting to discuss the team's sagging performances.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009852&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/fletcherdhoniiem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009856" alt="Duncan Fletcher's one year contract extension ends on March 31 this year (IE Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/fletcherdhoniiem.jpg" /></a> Duncan Fletcher&#8217;s one year contract extension ends on March 31 this year (IE Photo)
<p>The BCCI made it clear that under-fire coach of the Indian team Duncan Fletcher has its &#8220;full backing and support&#8221; and there was no immediate plans to remove him despite calls for his ouster from batting icon like Sunil Gavaskar.</p>
<p>Fletcher was summoned by the BCCI chief N Srinivasan for a meeting to discuss the team&#8217;s sagging performances of late but no warning was given to him that his job was on line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me set the record straight. Duncan Fletcher has the wholehearted backing and support of BCCI. There has been no discussion on his removal. We told him that we have a lot of faith in his coaching abilities and he should not be worried about anything else&#8221;, BCCI Secretary Sanjay Patel told PTI.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no truth in reports that Fletcher was given a warning by the president (Srinivasan),&#8221; Patel, who was present at the meeting, said.</p>
<p>Asked about Gavaskar&#8217;s comments that Fletcher should be removed immediately, Patel said, &#8220;Mr Gavaskar is entitled to have his opinion just like I have an opinion. It is not necessary that the BCCI is in agreement with what Mr Gavaskar thinks. It&#8217;s his opinion and the BCCI has nothing to do with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fletcher&#8217;s trip to Chennai a day before the team&#8217;s departure to Bangladesh gave rise to speculation about BCCI boss making it clear that the board was not happy with his performance after India lost back-to-back Test and ODI series in South Africa and New Zealand. Fletcher&#8217;s one year contract extension ends on March 31 this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people are not aware that BCCI routinely holds meeting with the coach and the support staff after each and every tour. This is an age-old norm. This meeting would have also been held at the Cricket Centre in Mumbai but our president had a cataract operation and was unable to travel. That&#8217;s why, I also flew down to Chennai for this meeting,&#8221; Patel said.</p>
<p>Patel also dismissed suggestions of an Indian support staff being tagged along with the current trio of Fletcher, Joe Dawes and fielding coach Trevor Penny.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no plans of having an Indian in the existing support staff as of now,&#8221; he clarified.</p>
<p>However, he was not very forthcoming on whether Fletcher will get an extension till the next World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an ongoing process. There has been absolutely no talks on Fletcher&#8217;s removal. But yes, it&#8217;s not a process where the day your contract expires, the very next day the papers are ready. It takes time.</p>
<p>&#8220;World Cup is still some distance away. In fact, we had a very fruitful discussion with Fletcher. We asked him as to what we can do to help him. He said about the requirement of an additional trainer. It was a very positive discussion and exchange of ideas,&#8221; Patel added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009852&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Arsenal&#8217;s record signing Mesut Ozil will be out for between three to six weeks with a hamstring injury, manager Arsene Wenger said on Friday.</p>
<p>Germany international Ozil, who cost 42.5 million pounds ($70.87 million) when he joined from Real Madrid in August, was substituted at halftime against Bayern Munich in the Champions League aggregate defeat on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the minimum is three, the maximum is six so let&#8217;s say four weeks out,&#8221; Wenger told reporters at a news conference of his playmaker&#8217;s prognosis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ozil had a very good game against Everton but he was handicapped early on in the Bayern game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arsenal have a number of injury concerns as they prepare for Sunday&#8217;s north London derby at Tottenham Hotspur &#8211; a game they need to win to stay in touch in the Premier League title race.</p>
<p>Aaron Ramsey, who has been out since December with a thigh injury, had been in contention for a return against Spurs but that has now been delayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He still has recurrent pains in his thigh, we have to be very cautious with him,&#8221; Wenger said.</p>
<p>Arsenal, who are seven points behind leaders Chelsea with a game in hand, are also without Jack Wilshere (foot) and long term absentees Theo Walcott (knee) and Abou Diaby.</p>
<p>Better news for the Gunners is the return to fitness of defender Nacho Monreal and midfielder Kim Kallstrom, who has yet to make an appearance since joining in January. Defender Kieran Gibbs and striker Yaya Sanogo may also be fit to feature on Sunday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009815&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Chris Jordan slammed an unbeaten 27 off nine balls and added three wickets and a sensational catch as England held its nerve to sneak a five-run victory over the West Indies in the third and final Twenty20 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jordan&#8217;s late blitz, which included four sixes in the final over, put the icing on an England total of 165-6 off 20 overs. The platform was set by openers Michael Lumb (63) and Alex Hales (38).</p>
<p>Medium-pacer Krishmar Santokie claimed 2-27 while fellow left-armer, pacer Sheldon Cottrell took 2-37 on debut.</p>
<p>The West Indies chase was rocked early by Jade Dernbach and Jordan before Lendl Simmons (69) and Denesh Ramdin (33) set up a grandstand finish.</p>
<p>But Dernbach was cool in a final over with the West Indies needing 17, and the hosts finished five short at 160-7 off 20 overs.</p>
<p>Dernbach bowled Dwayne Smith off the inside edge from the first ball of the chase and West Indies dipped to 28-3 when Jordan held a skied return catch off Johnson Charles and then forced Marlon Samuels to drag on.</p>
<p>Ravi Bopara (2-28) further put England on top by dismissing Dwayne Bravo and Andre Russell at 67-5.</p>
<p>Simmons and Ramdin, on his 29th birthday, revived the chase with a stand of 73 off 46 balls.</p>
<p>Simmons blasted seven fours and two sixes off 55 balls while Ramdin hit four fours and a six off 21 balls.</p>
<p>Jordan (3-39) returned to pluck out Ramdin&#8217;s leg stump and Simmons was run out in the final over leaving 13 needed from three balls.</p>
<p>West Indies skipper Darren Sammy kept the home crowd excited with a big six over square leg but Dernbach tied up the hosts with the final two deliveries.</p>
<p>Earlier, England got a flying start from left-hander Lumb, who slammed nine fours and two sixes, and Hales, whose innings was spiced with four fours and a six.</p>
<p>The pair added 96 off 10.5 overs but once Cottrell claimed both in successive overs, the visitors lost momentum.</p>
<p>Sunil Narine claimed captain Eoin Morgan cheaply and Santokie added the scalps of Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes.</p>
<p>But Jordan launched three offside sixes and one huge pull over midwicket off Dwayne Bravo&#8217;s last over that cost 26 to give England confidence going into the break.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009560&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lewishamiltonreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009551" alt="Lewis Hamilton's quickest edged out team mate Nico Rosberg by less than 0.157 seconds (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lewishamiltonreutersm.jpg" /></a> Lewis Hamilton&#8217;s quickest edged out team mate Nico Rosberg by less than 0.157 seconds (Reuters)
<p>Lewis Hamilton lent some credibility to the hype around Mercedes by posting the fastest time in Friday practice at the Australian Grand Prix, as the Formula One season kicked off with teams still battling reliability problems.</p>
<p>The 2008 world champion could not finish a lap in the first session due to an oil pressure sensor problem, but topped the timesheets in the second with a lap of one minute 29.625 seconds on a glorious sunny day at Albert Park.</p>
<p>Champions Red Bull, who arrived under a cloud after problems throughout winter testing, also made a promising start and breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel finished an encouraging fourth on the timesheets, with his new team mate Daniel Ricciardo sixth behind McLaren&#8217;s Jenson Button.</p>
<p>Hamilton&#8217;s quickest lap edged out team mate Nico Rosberg by 0.157 seconds as the pace of the two Mercedes&#8217; drivers carried on from their strong showing in winter testing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was trying to feel the car. I missed obviously P1 (first practice) which I felt like was a big back-step,&#8221; Hamilton told reporters in the paddock.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied with P2&#8230;Not the most perfect day but I&#8217;m really glad I got some run in P2 and just grateful I got some time to feel the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve still got a lot to improve on, a lot to find. Otherwise the balance doesn&#8217;t feel too bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teams struggled to come to terms with the new turbocharged hybrid engines during pre-season, and continued to battle glitches during practice, with drivers cooling their heels for long stretches in the garages, as technicians tinkered frantically.</p>
<p>Excursions onto the track saw plenty of over-steering at corners and skids into the grass as drivers fought to handle the new braking systems, extra torque and reduced downforce of the V6 power units.</p>
<p>Ferrari&#8217;s two-time world champion Fernando Alonso handled conditions better than most, posting the quickest lap of one minute 31.840 seconds in the first session and finishing third fastest in the second.</p>
<p>His new team mate Kimi Raikkonen, returning to Ferrari after four seasons away, had a low-key start, posting the seventh fastest time in the second session after being rolled back to the garage due to an aborted start at the exit of the pit lane.</p>
<p><strong>Heat problem</strong></p>
<p>German Vettel, bidding for a fifth successive F1 title, was forced to pit quickly in the first session due to a heat problem and survived a skid on the grass in the second but his 51 laps for the day was a third of his total mileage for the winter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite surprised today, both Dan (Ricciardo) and I did a lot of laps so that&#8217;s very good news, so let&#8217;s see what tomorrow brings,&#8221; Vettel said. &#8220;I learned a lot today, we&#8217;re in a much happier place already.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hamilton was left fuming when his car stopped at turn nine of his installation lap just five minutes into the first session.</p>
<p>With the vehicle hauled off by a tow-truck, the 29-year-old Briton walked back to the paddock without taking his helmet off and suffered the indignity of being stopped by security before retreating into his team&#8217;s tent.</p>
<p>Brazilian Felipe Massa was 12th fastest for Williams, outshone in his first drive for the British-based team by Finnish team mate Valtteri Bottas, who was eighth quickest in the second practice.</p>
<p>Lotus, who missed the first test of the season because their car was not ready on time, suffered a black day with only French driver Romain Grosjean able to post a lap time, his best only 18th from 19 cars in the later session.</p>
<p>McLaren&#8217;s Kevin Magnussen was the best of the three F1 rookies, the Dane ninth fastest in P2.</p>
<p>Kamui Kobayashi&#8217;s return to F1 with Caterham was forgettable, as both he and his debutant team mate Marcus Ericsson were unable to post a lap time in either session due to reliability issues.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009547&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/benficareutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009516" alt="Benfica's Luisao (L) scores a goal against Tottenham Hotspur during their Europa League soccer match at White Hart Lane in London (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/benficareutersm.jpg" /></a> Benfica&#8217;s Luisao (L) scores a goal against Tottenham Hotspur during their Europa League soccer match at White Hart Lane in London (Reuters)
<p>Mario Gomez dusted off his shooting boots to put Fiorentina in the driving seat with a 1-1 Europa League draw at Juventus while Benfica were too good for Tottenham Hotspur, winning their last-16 first leg 3-1 away on Thursday.</p>
<p>Germany striker Gomez had not scored since returning in February after five months out with a knee injury but tilted the tie in his team&#8217;s favour with a 79th-minute strike while Real Betis tore up the form book to win 2-0 at local rivals Sevilla.</p>
<p>Twice winners Porto beat Napoli 1-0 thanks to Jackson Martinez&#8217;s superb finish and Helton&#8217;s agile goalkeeping. Valencia played for more than an hour with 10 men but still beat Ludogorets 3-0 in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>The goals, however, dried up for the previous round&#8217;s big scorers Salzburg who were held to a 0-0 draw at Basel, ending a run of 14 successive wins in all competitions.</p>
<p>Juventus&#8217;s clash with Fiorentina was a replay of the 1990 UEFA Cup final and came four days after the two sides met in Serie A.</p>
<p>Juventus, three places and 27 points clear of their domestic rivals, won 1-0 on Sunday and took the lead after three minutes when the ball fell kindly at the feet of Arturo Vidal and he dispatched it powerfully into the net from 10 metres.</p>
<p>Yet their failure to kill off the tie gave hope to Fiorentina who grew in confidence and eventually punished their hosts late on.</p>
<p>Gomez, who tore ligaments in his right knee in September, came off the bench in the 67th minute and made a decisive impact, controlling a lofted pass before shooting through the legs of Juventus keeper Gianluigi Buffon.</p>
<p>Tottenham were hosting Benfica for the first time since they met in the European Cup semi-final in 1962.</p>
<p>Benfica, who are seven points clear at the top of the Portuguese championship, won that tie and were thoroughly on top when they went ahead after 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Rodrigo raced onto a terrific throughball from Ruben Amorim and picked his spot, curling his finish with his in-step into the far corner.</p>
<p>Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood told his squad they were playing for their futures after their 4-0 Premier League defeat to Chelsea at the weekend but the present looked bleak when Luisao headed home unmarked after 58 minutes.</p>
<p>Christian Eriksen curled in a free kick to reduce the deficit but Luisao struck again, pouncing on a rebound to shoot into the roof of the net from close range.</p>
<p>Tottenham defender Younes Kaboul refused to throw in the towel however.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is possible in football,&#8221; he told ITV. &#8220;We will go there to win and see what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Seville derby</strong></p>
<p>The first Seville derby in Europe did not go according to the script as Sevilla, seventh in La Liga, suffered a shock home reverse against their struggling rivals who are bottom of the domestic table.</p>
<p>Betis took the lead when Baptistao powered a header into the roof of the net after 15 minutes and Salvador Sevilla put the result beyond doubt in the 77th minute when he drove the ball into the far corner of the net.</p>
<p>Porto&#8217;s preparations for their tie against Napoli were undermined when they parted company with coach Paulo Fonseca last Wednesday, but they still looked a well-drilled unit against Rafa Benitez&#8217;s tactically-wily Italian side.</p>
<p>The Portuguese team survived an early second-half onslaught from Napoli thanks to the lithe reflexes of keeper Helton, who kept out a drilled shot on the turn from Gonzalo Higuain and blocked Raul Albiol&#8217;s header from close range.</p>
<p>Minutes later they went ahead when Martinez showed a fine scorer&#8217;s instinct to drop off his marker at the far post and rifle a volley into the net from 15 metres.</p>
<p>Bulgarians Ludogorets fell behind against a Valencia team unbeaten since matchday one of the group stage when Antonio Barragan fired a low drive into the bottom corner after five minutes.</p>
<p>The Spanish side were reduced to 10 men 19 minutes later, however, when Seydou Keita was dismissed for bringing down Roman Bezjak, who spared the visitors a double punishment by fluffing the resulting penalty.</p>
<p>Valencia made the most of the let-off when Fede Cartabia volleyed the ball low into the bottom corner after 33 minutes and Philippe Senderos grabbed his first goal for the club, heading home unmarked in the second half.</p>
<p>Juninho Quixada was sent off for Ludogorets with 10 minutes remaining for kicking out.</p>
<p>Salzburg were fresh from a 6-1 aggregate success over Ajax Amsterdam in the last 32 but found Basel a tougher nut to crack in Switzerland, with the Austrian side failing to score for the first time this season.</p>
<p>Gueida Fofana scored twice as Olympique Lyon comfortably beat Viktoria Plzen 4-1 and AZ Alkmaar won 1-0 at home to Anzhi Makhachkala.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009509&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Roger Federer charged into the semi-finals of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells on Thursday with a straight sets win over South African Kevin Anderson.</p>
<p>The Swiss master succeeded where others had failed by blunting the serve of the towering 6ft 8in (2.13m) Anderson to win 7-5 6-1.<br />
Federer faced only one break point in the entire match and reeled off seven games on the trot to clinch the opening set and race to a 5-0 lead in the second.</p>
<p>His reward for winning was a semi-final clash on Saturday with Ukrainian giantkiller Alexandr Dolgopolov, who continued his fairytale run in the Californian desert by defeating big-serving Canadian Milos 6-3 6-4.</p>
<p>In the women&#8217;s draw, China&#8217;s Li Na won her rematch with Slovakia&#8217;s Dominika Cibulkova to join Italian veteran Flavia Pennetta in the semis.</p>
<p>In her first meeting with Cibulkova since the Australian Open final in January, Li once again proved too strong for her younger opponent, winning 6-3 4-6 6-3 in a little over two and a half hours.</p>
<p>Pennetta booked her place in the last four by beating American Sloane Stephens 6-4 5-7 6-4 in a seesawing match played in gusting winds.</p>
<p>In a tournament that has been packed with surprises and high-profile casualties, the 32-year-old Li has been a model of consistency, ferociously battling through each round.</p>
<p>The Chinese top seed, in the absence of world number one Serena Williams, has struggled with her serve all week and committed eight double faults against Cibulkova, four in the opening set and four more in the third when the pressure was on.</p>
<p>The Slovak also made eight doubles while the pair combined for more than 100 unforced errors in a match that was longer and much tighter than their last meeting in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Li got the decisive break late in the third set and then served out for victory to stay on course for her first title at one of the biggest events outside the grand slams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is different than Australia. Of course score should be different,&#8221; said Li.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think today she played more aggressive. I was feeling if I try to go back like a little bit she was trying to step in to hit the ball.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also I was feeling in the second set I think I dropped down a little bit and gave her more chance. She can get a lot of winners.&#8221;<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Crazy wind</strong></p>
<p>Pennetta looked to be heading for the exit when she blew her first chance to win the match then fell behind in the deciding third set.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old was two points from victory when serving for the match in the second set when the wind suddenly started to blow a gale and her game started to unravel.</p>
<p>Stephens, 20, broke her serve and won six games in a row to jump out to a 3-0 lead in the third when Pennetta staged her own comeback, winning six of the last seven games to wrap up an extraordinary victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t play our best tennis,&#8221; Pennetta said. &#8220;Maybe in the beginning we played much better, and in the second one, but the third was a disaster for both of us.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy to get through this match, but I don&#8217;t have good feelings right now &#8211; it&#8217;s just crazy outside, the wind is just coming out of nowhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dolgopolov has been a revelation at Indian Wells since he was thrust into the spotlight when he scored an upset win over world number one Rafa Nadal in the third round.</p>
<p>Players who register shock wins often fail to maintain their form on but the 28th seed has gone from strength to strength, beating three seeds in succession.</p>
<p>Raonic, one of the biggest servers in tennis, beat Wimbledon champion Andy Murray on Wednesday but found Dolgopolov too hot to hold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just wish I could have served better. But other than that, he did the right things at the right times right away from the start of the match,&#8221; said Raonic.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a factor of why I didn&#8217;t serve as well as I would have liked as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only did Dolgopolov succeed in breaking the Canadian&#8217;s serve three times, including twice in the second set to overcome a 3-0 deficit, but showed he also has a serve to be reckoned with as he fired six aces, two more than his opponent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was really happy with that. And I was able to get more returns than usually you can against him,&#8221; said Dolgopolov.</p>
<p>&#8220;He serves really big and I knew I had to do that, and I&#8217;m quite pleased how I anticipated on his serve and have seen the toss of the ball and was really, really concentrated to get those serves back.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009500&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>World No 9 PV Sindhu reached the quarterfinals while Saina Nehwal won her opening round match in women’s singles at the USD 125,000 Swiss Open Grand Prix Gold. Sindhu fought hard for 54 minutes to beat World No 23 Michelle Li of Canada in three hard-fought games. The final score was 19-21, 21-16, 21-11 in favour of the lanky Indian girl. She will face world No 3 Wang Shixian of China in the last eight clash.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saina opened her campaign with a straight game win over qualifier Chisato Hoshi of Japan. The sixth seeded Indian beat her Japanese opponent 21-12 21-12 in 34 minutes to progress to the second round. Saina, who will be pitted against Sashina Vigneswaran in the pre-quarter-finals today dropped a place world rankings to No 8 due to her loss in the All England.</p>
<p>World number 36 Anand Pawar squandered a first game advantage to suffer a 21-14 12-21 12-21 defeat against Chinese Taipei’s Tien Chen Chou in a 51-minute men’s singles match. This was Anand’s third defeat to Chou. He had lost to the Taiwanese shuttler in German Open this year.</p>
<p>Pawar had fended off the challenge from another German Tobias Wadenka 21-11 21-4 in the first round. Top Indian male shuttler Parupalli Kashyap eased into the second round too, taking 33 minutes to dispose Lukas Schmidt of Germany 21-15 21-14.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009196&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alonsovettelreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009496" alt="Just how much trouble Vettel’s Red Bull may be in this season, is one of the questions waiting for an answer (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alonsovettelreutersm.jpg" /></a> Just how much trouble Vettel’s Red Bull may be in this season, is one of the questions waiting for an answer (Reuters)
<p>The prospect of seeing Sebastian Vettel beaten for the first time since last July is just one of the many novelties Sunday’s season-opening Australian Formula One Grand Prix promises to deliver. Just how much trouble Vettel’s Red Bull team might be in is one of the questions waiting for an answer as the sport’s unpredictable new turbo era whooshes into action at Melbourne’s Albert Park circuit.</p>
<p>The quadruple world champion won the last nine races of 2013 but the 26-year-old German spent much of his time during the pre-season tests in Spain and Bahrain watching the car being worked on in the garage. Red Bull are braced for a reality check as they and partners Renault work against the clock to fix the troublesome 1.6 litre V6 hybrid turbo engine and its complicated new energy recovery systems.</p>
<p>Rivals Mercedes, under new leadership following the departure of Ross Brawn, have been racking up the laps with far less hassle.</p>
<p>“Mercedes have got a bit of a march on people. They invested more, they invested earlier. They’ve got themselves into a good position,” said Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who now has Australian Daniel Ricciardo in the lineup following Mark Webber’s retirement.</p>
<p><strong>HAMILTON CONFIDENT</strong></p>
<p>Horner’s words may be a part of the pre-season mind games, repositioning Red Bull as underdogs but Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have sounded quietly confident about a car that is sleeker than many of its ‘ugly’ new-look rivals.</p>
<p>“With all the changes within the sport and the hard work that’s been going on within the team, I believe this can be our year to really show what we’re capable of,” said Hamilton, the 2008 world champion with McLaren.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m equipped with the tools I need to succeed. I can’t wait to get started,” added the Briton, whose win in Hungary last July was the last by anyone other than Vettel.</p>
<p>Ferrari will be hoping to challenge with their new lineup of champions following the return of Finland’s 2007 title winner Kimi Raikkonen — triumphant in Melbourne for Lotus last year — to partner Fernando Alonso. The cars will sound different without the old V8 engines and will also be far less reliable at first, with any repairs likely to take far longer due to the complexity of the power units.</p>
<p>How many cars will start from the grid, let alone finish the race now that fuel economy is a big factor, is another uncertainty. Some insiders have predicted that Sunday evening could see less than half the field reach the chequered flag.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009191&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viswanathananandfidem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009488" alt="Viswanathan Anand is one of eight participants in the Candidates tournament being played in Russia (Photo: FIDE)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viswanathananandfidem.jpg" /></a> Viswanathan Anand is one of eight participants in the Candidates tournament being played in Russia (Photo: FIDE)
<p>Viswanathan Anand threw the form book out the window with a stunning and largely unexpected win over pre-tournament favourite Levon Aronian in the first round of the Candidates tournament in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia. The three other games ended in draws, giving Anand an early lead in the fourteen-round tournament whose winner will go on to challenge world champion Magnus Carlsen in November this year.</p>
<p>Anand had white pieces against Aronian. Normally an advantage, this only seemed a small mercy against an imposing opponent. The Armenian has largely dominated Anand, except perhaps for a remarkable game at Tata Steel in 2013. Then, despite being in as bad a slum as he is in currently, Anand played one of the best games of his career, earning the Yearbook Novelty of the Year award, an entry in the pantheon of great attacking games, and a sweet win against an opponent who had, before the game, enjoyed a +5-1 record over him.</p>
<p>The game, however, did not spark Anand’s game back into life, nor did it turn his fortunes around in his personal battles against Aronian. The last time they played each other, Aronian brushed off Anand in the first round at Zurich early in 2014. Anand’s Wijk Aan Zee show was in danger of becoming a painful reminder that Aronian’s style so thoroughly threw his own game off its rails, that he had to play out of his skin to beat his nemesis.</p>
<p>Given their personal history and his own poor recent form, Anand may have settled for a draw against Aronian in the first round, and consider that a reasonable success. A tough delivery peaceably negotiated for a scampered single to leg. As it happened, Anand found himself with a pleasant advantage out of the opening. “When we got to c4 (white’s 21st move) I was surprised how strong my position was  not slightly better but clearly better,&#8221; he said in the post-match interview. The game panned out to a perfect script from Anand’s perspective, who generally relies on his extensive opening knowledge and quick, sharp play in middle games for an upper hand. Here, a strong advantage out of the opening (a Marshal setup, which strangely enough, considering how things went, is a preferred system of Aronian’s) was built on subsequently, while his opponent, slipping steadily towards a time-default, further weakened his position. By around the first time control, Aronian, with less than a minute on his clock for 7-8 moves, blundered away his knight in a deteriorating position. Anand completed the win in 47 moves.</p>
<p>That the rare win against a personal tormentor came without much fuss raises, once more, the prospect of Anand turning a corner with his form. It is something that will become evident as the 21-day long tournament progresses, but there was also a clue late in the first-round game. With the win seemingly wrapped up, Anand mis-calculated — a weakness that he has tried, unsuccessfully, to keep out of his game in the last few years. But fortunately for him, the error left the integrity of the position untouched and Anand found a way to win.</p>
<p>There is a danger that the bad result sets Aronian off on a downward spiral, like it happened at the Candidates tournament in London last year. But the top seed seemed in an equable mood after the game. “I’m kind of used to losing in the early stages of a tournament. Stats show that I start playing better after I lose one game. So I think this is an important event,” he said after the game.</p>
<p>In the next round, Anand will play with black pieces against Veselin Topalov, who drew a topsy-turvy game with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in round one. The game swung one way then the other until the players pulled the plug with a series of exchanges. This was not unlike what happened in the Sergey Karjakin-Peter Svidler draw, where players agreed to repeat moves when the position remained double-edged. Dimitry Andreikin, who has a surprisingly positive career record against Vladimir Kramnik, had to settle for a draw this time though, in what was the shortest game of the round.</p>
<p><strong>Round one results:</strong> Anand bt Aronian, Karjakin drew with Svidler, Andreikin drew with Kramnik, Mamedyarov drew with Topalov.</p>
<p><strong>Round two pairings:</strong> Topalov vs Anand, Kramnik vs Karjakin, Svidler vs Andreikin, Aronian vs Mamedyarov.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009186&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009184" alt="Hashim Amla’s was the only wicket to fall in the South Africa innings of the second T20.

The Durban match, won by Australia, was reduced to seven-overs-a-side due to rain. (AP)
<p>Brad Hodge’s back-to-back sixes off Wayne Parnell proved decisive as Australia beat South Africa by five wickets in a Twenty20 international that had been reduced to seven overs per side due to rain on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Australia went into the final over of a frenetic match at Kingsmead requiring 15 runs to reach a target of 81, and achieved it with two deliveries to spare thanks to Hodge’s lusty blows over deep midwicket.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old finished unbeaten on 21 from eight deliveries in his third match since returning to the Australian side after a six-year absence.</p>
<p>The result put Australia 1-0 up in the three-match series with one game to play after the first clash was washed out.</p>
<p>Despite Wednesday’s encounter being reduced in length, South Africa opted against sending some of its bigger hitters up the order after it lost the toss and was asked to bat, and arguably paid the price as Hashim Amla struggled up front.</p>
<p>The hosts scored just 11 runs for the loss of Amla in their first three overs, but recovered spectacularly as Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis took 69 off the last four.</p>
<p>De Kock finished unbeaten on 41 from 20 deliveries, while Du Plessis was 27 not out as South Africa finished on 80-1 from its seven overs.</p>
<p>Australia made the ideal start to its reply when Lonwabo Tsotsobe’s first over went for 21, as David Warner continued the excellent form he showed in the test series when he scored 543 runs in three matches.</p>
<p>“I don’t think he’s picked up a bat since the end of the tests, and then to come out and be as fluent and powerful as he was, he’s in beautiful touch at the moment and a great head space,’’ Australia captain George Bailey said.</p>
<p><strong>Improved prospects</strong></p>
<p>South Africa’s prospects improved when Warner was trapped lbw by JP Duminy for a quick 40 and powerful batsman Glenn Maxwell was dismissed in the same over. However Hodge brought his experience to bear when he hit the third and fourth deliveries of Parnell’s over for six, before a wide sealed the game for Australia.<br />
“A seven-over game is pretty hectic,” Du Plessis said. “You can’t look too much into it — you’re basically just trying to swing out your boots every ball and in the field just hoping for some luck.’’</p>
<p>The final match of the series is on Friday at Centurion.</p>
<p>Brief scores: South Africa 80/1 in 7 overs (Q de Kock 41 not out, F du Plessis 27 not out, H Amla 4; N Coulter-Nile 1/17) lost to Australia 81/5 in 6.4 overs (D Warner 40, B Hodge 21 not out; JP Duminy 2/5)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009176&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Lionel Messi struck to end Manchester City’s dreams of a famous comeback as Barcelona beat the English club 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Wednesday to reach the Champions League quarter-finals 4-1 on aggregate.</span></p>
<p>Barca looked far from the classic team who lifted the trophy in 2009 and 2011 but a stuttering version under Gerardo Martino that had lost two of their last three games was still far too strong for the Premier League club.</p>
<p>City, who lost the first leg of the last-16 tie 2-0 at home, were a constant threat to the Spanish champions, but they were left to rue missed chances by David Silva, Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta.</p>
<p>Captain Vincent Kompany levelled for the visitors on the night with a tap-in in the 89th minute, but Dani Alves responded by sweeping home the winner in the first minute of stoppage time.</p>
<p>City had been reduced to 10 men by then after Zabaleta was shown a second yellow card for dissent in the 78th minute.</p>
<p>The Argentine defender was incensed with referee Stephane Lannoy’s decision to ignore City’s strong penalty claims when substitute Edin Dzeko went down in the area under a challenge by Gerard Pique.</p>
<p>“It was a clear penalty,” Kompany told Sky Sports. “Dzeko was in position to shoot and his trigger foot was caught.</p>
<p>“We have got nothing left in the tank. You have to take your half chances against the best teams. Over the course of the two games there was not much between the sides.”</p>
<p>Messi put his side in front by producing a neat finish with the outside of his left boot from close range in the 67th minute after defender Joleon Lescott failed to stop a routine through-ball from Cesc Fabregas.</p>
<p>“We knew we had to score a goal to bring some calm to the tie, as we were aware of how dangerous City are,” Messi told Canal Plus. “I don’t think the tie was ever in danger for us, and we controlled the match very well. I think tonight we got back to being the Barcelona that we all want to see.”</p>
<p><strong>TENTATIVE GAME</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Barca had begun the game deeper than usual, looking to entice City to come at them so as to pounce on the counter. It was a tentative game early on as City held back and Barca’s passing lacked fluidity.</p>
<p>The first half ended in a flourish as Neymar took advantage of a slip by Aleksandar Kolarov and his shot was scrambled wide by Joe Hart, while he also had another effort cleared off the line by Fernandinho. In between, Nasri fired straight at Victor Valdes having been set up by Silva and the Spaniard also wasted a golden chance when he fired over with his favoured left foot from 15 metres out.</p>
<p>After the break Messi’s threat grew and in the 50th minute he cut in from the right and hit the post with a low left-foot shot from inside the area. Dzeko, who had replaced Sergio Aguero, had a header brilliantly clawed away by Valdes.</p>
<p>City were still in the contest until Lescott got in a tangle just inside his own area, and the English defender’s worst fears were realised when he turned round to see Messi latch on to the loose ball, deceive Hart with his finish, and send Barca on their way to the last eight for the seventh successive season.</p>
<p><strong>PSG ADVANCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paris:</strong> Paris St Germain made light of resting key players and an under-par display from Zlatan Ibrahimovic to sail into the join Barca in the Champions League quarterfinals with a 6-1 aggregate win over Bayer Leverkusen.</p>
<p>The French champions won 2-1 at the Parc des Princes having thrashed the German side 4-0 in the last-16 first leg, with Marquinhos and Ezequiel Lavezzi wiping out the visitors’ early strike by Sidney Sam.</p>
<p>Sami Hyypia’s Leverkusen, who finished with 10 men after Emre Can picked up a second yellow card in the 68th minute, were also hampered by Simon Rolfes’s missed penalty in the first half.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009180&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic cruised into the quarterfinals of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells on Wednesday after Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and Australian Open winner Stanislas Wawrinka fell in round four.</span></p>
<p>In a tournament full of surprises, Federer and Djokovic struck a blow for the old world order with Federer beating Germany’s Tommy Haas 6-4 6-4 and Djokovic coming back to down Croatia’s Marin Cilic 1-6 6-2 6-3. Federer and Djokivic are the only players ranked in the world’s top 10 to reach the quarter-finals after Wawrinka and Murray joined the big-name casualties when they both crashed to lower-ranked opponents on another day of upsets in the Californian desert.</p>
<p>Wawrinka suffered his first loss this year when his 13-match winning streak came to a shuddering halt as he was beaten 7-6(1) 4-6 6-1 by South African Kevin Anderson.</p>
<p>Murray was blown away by Canada’s Milos Raonic, one of the biggest servers in men’s tennis. Despite winning the first set, the Scotsman was unable to contain the raw power of Raonic, who triumphed 4-6 7-5 6-3 in a little over two hours.</p>
<p>Raonic blasted 15 aces past his bewildered opponent, who is one of the best returners in the game, and won a staggering 83 percent of points when he landed his first serve. Murray did break Raonic’s serve in the opening set and again in the deciding third to lead 2-1 but lost the next four games in a row against the 6ft 5in (1.96 metre) tall Canadian.</p>
<p>Raonic’s next opponent in the quarter-finals will be Ukrainian giant killer Alexandr Dolgopolov, who followed up his upset victory over Rafa Nadal on Monday with a comprehensive 6-2 6-4 drubbing of Italy’s Fabio Fognini.</p>
<p>Already a four-time champion at Indian Wells, Federer is now on a nine-match winning streak after taking the title in Dubai before heading to Indian Wells but said he was wary about Anderson, who has reached a career-high ranking of 18.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009179&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>India has been a second home for Muttiah Muralitharan. He is married to a Chennai girl, has been an Indian Premier League regular and now he has been drafted by the Cricket Association of Bengal as spin coach. Ahead of his visit to Kolkata, he spoke to The Indian Express about his new assignment, the upcoming World T20 event in Bangladesh and Ravichandran Ashwin’s slump. Excerpts.</em> <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/icc-world-t20/" target="_blank">(FULL COVERAGE: ICC World T20)</a></p>
<p><strong>Who approached you for Bengal job?</strong></p>
<p>Sourav Ganguly. He contacted me and asked me if I was interested. He said CAB was keen to nurture young talents. I’m excited to be a part of the programme.</p>
<p><strong>What is the nature of your role here?</strong></p>
<p>My role will be to help young kids grow into their job. I will guide them and will oversee their progress. The idea will be to train the youngsters in a way that at least one or two of them play for India.</p>
<p><strong>As one of the greatest spinners to have played the game, will it be tough for you to come down to the level of a young spinner and teach the complex art of spinning the ball?</strong></p>
<p>I didn’t become great in a year. It took me 20 years. This is exactly what I will tell the kids. I, too, was like them once. More than the technical side, I will try to make them believe in themselves. I will put more emphasis on the mental side of their game.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s move to World T20.  Who start as favourites?</strong></p>
<p>Sri Lanka. They’ve done well in these conditions. They’ve just returned home from Bangladesh after playing a bilateral series and the Asia Cup. They know the conditions inside out and have the belief after winning the Asia Cup. Most importantly, they’ve the team to win. They have wicket-taking options upfront, bowling at the death, spinners for middle overs and batters who know how to play when. There are other title contenders as well but my pick is Sri Lanka.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there a scarcity of spin-bowling talent in Sri Lanka after you?</strong></p>
<p>You can’t get a Muralitharan or a Shane Warne everyday. You’ve to support the young players. They will learn from their mistakes and will get better with experience. Ajantha Mendis is a very good bowler. He has had been unlucky with his injuries. Now that he has returned to the national team, I expect him to step up to the plate.</p>
<p><strong>The situation is pretty similar in India. There’s a void after Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh.</strong></p>
<p>Like Mendis, (Ravichandran) Ashwin too had a promising start to his (international) career. Then there was a slide, and it can happen. It would be unfair to compare him with Kumble and Harbhajan because both are great bowlers and Ashwin still is learning the ropes. If he’s going through a form slump then he must be supported during this difficult period. There would be ups and downs in cricket. We just have to be a little patient. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/icc-world-t20/" target="_blank">(FULL COVERAGE: ICC World T20)</a></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009159&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Amidst the hype from the converted and the disdain from the old guard, and the relentless search for the next big hitting poster boy, two factors will play a big part in determining who wins the ICC World T20 in Bangladesh. The marketing people won’t have much to do with it, and the wannabe celebs searching for the photo-ops won’t care for it either. But the square in the centre of the ground and the boundaries along the circumference will hold the attention of the teams more than anything else. There is a reason for it. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/icc-world-t20/" target="_blank">(FULL COVERAGE: ICC World T20)</a></p>
<p>I was at Mirpur for the last five games of the Asia Cup and on four of the five days, the pitches had a tired look to them. On one of the days 650 runs were scored but when the track was used again, it produced a completely different match. Now, while those pitches won’t be used at the ICC World T20, it is true that a square tends to play fairly identically across the pitches that constitute it.</p>
<p>The three central pitches, then well grassed, were set aside for this tournament but since they cannot be protected, they would have seen a lot of trampling on them. There has also been a lot of cricket played at Mirpur this season and during the tournament, those three pitches, unless a corner pitch is used occasionally, will see twenty one t20 games played on them. That is a lot of matches and the fear is that they will look increasingly worn out as the tournament progresses. Luckily with summer upon us, and the alternate days off, the groundsman will have time to repair them but the general feeling is that we might see slowish pitches.</p>
<p>The spinners will welcome that but they will need a bit of help with the boundaries. At the Asia Cup the boundaries were ridiculously short. We had sixes being awarded for 65 and 67 metre hits and with modern bats that should never ever be allowed. It doesn’t only reduce the effectiveness of spinners, it makes it a lesser sport when mishits clear the boundary.</p>
<p>At the ICC U19 World Cup in Dubai some of the boundaries were more than 80 metres long and it will be terrible if the kids have to play on big grounds while the big daddies play on sugar coated boundaries. So if we can get boundaries that are at least 75 metres away, the spinners could well call the tune in Bangladesh. (I must admit this article is more about Dhaka since I don’t know the conditions in Chittagong but being Bangladesh it cannot be too different!)<br />
Asian advantage?</p>
<p>On the face of it, it would seem the Asian sides would start with an advantage. That certainly was the case some years ago, notably when the Champions Trophy was played in Sri Lanka in 2002 for example, but that advantage has been eroded a bit in recent times as teams change character and play more and more on the sub-continent. Certainly the West Indies no longer mind playing on slower surfaces, since their game is now built around taking pace off the ball rather than imparting a lot on it as their great sides did while scaring the daylights out of the opposition! And Australia, the fourth team that plays the early games in Dhaka, is now a genuinely all weather side in T20 cricket.</p>
<p>So while it may not hurt the opposition as much as it used to, it will still allow India, Pakistan and, to a slightly lesser extent, Sri Lanka to raise their game. On flat batting surfaces India, for example, will start with a huge disadvantage given the bowling weaknesses but if the pitches make the ball stop and turn, India can not only play three spinners but also call on Yuvraj and Raina to bowl, potentially getting through 15 out of the 20 overs with spin.</p>
<p>I can see England being disadvantaged and, to a lesser extent, South Africa and New Zealand, but Sri Lanka, Pakistan and the West Indies will be quite happy to play on slowish pitches. They will like to play 150-160 kind of games.</p>
<p>However if the groundsman springs a surprise and produces batting beauties, expect a more open tournament with Australia, maybe, front runners and New Zealand, as the dark horses. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/icc-world-t20/" target="_blank">(FULL COVERAGE: ICC World T20)</a></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009148&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/haroonlorgatiem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2009062" alt="The adjudicator ruled that any restrictions on Haroon Lorgat's ability to perform his role as CEO of CSA should be immediately removed (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/haroonlorgatiem.jpg" /></a> The adjudicator ruled that any restrictions on Haroon Lorgat&#8217;s ability to perform his role as CEO of CSA should be immediately removed (File)
<p>The independent adjudicator appointed by the ICC has cleared Cricket South Africa CEO Haroon Lorgat of alleged involvement in the FTP manipulation charges levelled against the BCCI by his one-time legal adviser at the world body.</p>
<p>David Becker, who was the ICC legal adviser throughout Lorgat&#8217;s tenure as CEO of the world body, had last year issued a statement suggesting that the BCCI&#8217;s flouting of the FTP could have legal implications and that it was &#8220;improper&#8221; to allow a member body to &#8220;blatantly disregard an ICC resolution&#8221;.</p>
<p>In his October 2013 statement, Becker, also a former legal adviser of Cricket South Africa, had said that he had resigned from his ICC post because of what he considered &#8220;questionable governance&#8221; at the ICC and listed three examples, all relating to the &#8220;dominance of BCCI President N Srinivasan&#8221;.</p>
<p>Lorgat was accused by the BCCI of having the knowledge of Becker&#8217;s statement and, in fact, of its preparation, prompting the ICC to commission an inquiry into his role in that statement.</p>
<p>The controversy had also threatened to derail India&#8217;s tour of South Africa December last. BCCI had agreed to a shortened tour only after the CSA agreed to bar Lorgat from dealing with matters related to India and from attending ICC Executive Meetings as CSA representative.</p>
<p>The adjudicator, in a joint statement issued by the ICC and CSA, said that there was &#8220;no evidence to support the allegations made against Lorgat&#8221;.</p>
<p>As a result, any restrictions on Lorgat&#8217;s ability to act as CSA chief executive were removed. He can now resume acting as CSA&#8217;s representative on the ICC Chief Executive&#8217;s Committee and deal with affairs involving the BCCI.</p>
<p>&#8220;An independent Adjudicator, appointed by the ICC to look into the content and distribution of media comments made about ICC Board by David Becker, who at that time was acting as a legal consultant to CSA in respect of their ongoing dispute over FTP Schedule, and the subsequent attempts to have them withdrawn, and, in particular, role of Haroon Lorgat, CEO of CSA, in these matters has found no evidence to support the allegations made against Lorgat,&#8221; the statement said.</p>
<p>The independent adjudicator also exonerated Lorgat of the charge that he had allegedly tried to bribe and threaten journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Terms of Reference of the Inquiry provided that the allegations the Adjudicator was to inquire into were whether: (i) Mr Lorgat knew about the David Becker media statement and its contents prior to or at the time of its initial distribution,&#8221; the ICC and CSA statement said.</p>
<p>&#8220;(ii). Mr Lorgat was involved in the preparation of the David Becker media statement; and (iii) Mr Lorgat attempted to persuade a number of different journalists on separate occasions to delay and/or withdraw the story/David Becker media statement by offering to do something for them in return, allegedly bribing and eventually threatening the journalists,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>The adjudicator ruled that any restrictions on Lorgat&#8217;s ability to perform his role as CEO of CSA should be immediately removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This includes, but is not limited to: a) restrictions on Lorgat&#8217;s ability to represent CSA at ICC&#8217;s Chief Executives&#8217; Committee; and b) restrictions on Lorgat&#8217;s communications with or involvement in matters related to the BCCI.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a consequence of Adjudicator&#8217;s Report, Lorgat&#8217;s role as Chief Executive of CSA is fully restored,&#8221; the statement added.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Adjudicator&#8217;s decision, ICC President Alan Isaac said, &#8220;The ICC notes and accepts the decision of the independent Adjudicator. We are pleased that the matter has been resolved and that all parties can now move on in a spirit of mutual cooperation, working together constructively for the good of cricket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reacting to the development, Lorgat said, &#8220;With this unsavoury matter now behind us I look forward to getting on with the real challenges that we need to deal with.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a costly but necessary exercise once the allegations were made. I am pleased it is now behind us and I must thank my Board for their unequivocal support plus the many other people, including members of the public, who stood firm with me during this period.&#8221; he said in a separate CSA statement.</p>
<p>CSA welcomed the independent adjudicator&#8217;s findings, saying that the report fully exonerates Lorgat from all or any blame in relation to the allegations made against him.</p>
<p>CSA President Chris Nenzani said Lorgat will immediately be restored with his full powers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are satisfied that this matter has been properly investigated and resolved. As a consequence of the Adjudicator&#8217;s findings, CSA has no hesitation in immediately lifting the previous restrictions placed on Mr Lorgat in his role as Chief Executive of CSA,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is as clear as it gets and vindicates CSA and Lorgat&#8217;s determination that the investigation be properly concluded following recent offers to drop the investigation. It is only fair and just for both CSA and to Lorgat that the process was properly concluded,&#8221; Nenzani said.</p>
<p>The CSA chief said since all the allegations against Lorgat have been dismissed, his Board would reiterate its full trust and confidence in Lorgat as its Chief Executive.</p>
<p>&#8220;To date the Board has been satisfied and indeed impressed with the progress made under his leadership,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is also clear that allegations and insinuations made against Lorgat by certain journalists were unprofessional and do not fall within the bounds of fair or justifiable comment.</p>
<p>I hope these individuals or their organisations will now have the courage to issue an apology to both Lorgat and CSA.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009055&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em><strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who led India to World Cup triumph in the inaugural edition in 2007, enjoys the shortest format of the game. A look at some interesting numbers.</strong></em></p>
<p>* As skipper, Dhoni has registered five consecutive wins. The best being eight by England.</p>
<p>* Dhoni tops the list of the captains who have kept wickets. The Indian skipper has led India in 42 matches so far. He enjoys a healthy lead in this department as Sri Lanka&#8217;s Kumar Sangakkara is second best with 22.</p>
<p>* Surprise, surprise! Dhoni was out for a duck in his, and India&#8217;s, debut T20 match against South Africa in 2006.</p>
<p>We all know that the Ranchi dasher loves to get his runs in boundaries, especially in the shorter format, but how many goes over the fence? A look at the break up:</p>
<iframe style="border: none;" src="//e.infogr.am/how-dhoni-has-scored-runs-in-t20is" height="641" width="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<div style="width:550px;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center;"><a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am/how-dhoni-has-scored-runs-in-t20is" target="_blank">How Dhoni has scored runs in T20Is</a> | <a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am" target="_blank">Create Infographics</a></div>
<p>The T20 World Cup brought Dhoni and his captaincy into the limelight. He has covered a lot of distance since then. A quick glance at his captaincy record in the shortest format</p>
<iframe style="border: none;" src="//e.infogr.am/dhoni-as-captain-in-t20i" height="574" width="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<div style="width:550px;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center;"><a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am/dhoni-as-captain-in-t20i" target="_blank">Dhoni as captain in T20I</a> | <a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am" target="_blank">Create Infographics</a></div>
<p>T20 World Cup has not been a happy hunting ground for the inaugural champions as they have failed to reach the final in the following editions. How well has our skipper performed, with the bat?</p>
<iframe style="border: none;" src="//e.infogr.am/dhoni-in-icc-world-t20" height="406" width="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<div style="width:550px;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center;"><a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am/dhoni-in-icc-world-t20" target="_blank">Dhoni in ICC World T20</a> | <a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am" target="_blank">Create Infographics</a></div>
<p>When India is on song, in the T20 format, not always the skipper contributes with the bat, at least with hits over and to the fence. How?</p>
<p>* In the match where India hit the most sixes in an innings &#8211; 13 &#8211; Dhoni didn&#8217;t hit any. The match was played against New Zealand in 2009.</p>
<p>* Even in the match where India hit the most fours in an innings &#8211; 23 &#8211; Dhoni could only hit 2 to the fence.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2009038&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>India&#8217;s Asia Cup performance under his captaincy was a disappointment but star batsman Virat Kohli said he was ready for the hard grind of the Twenty20 World Cup, which begins in Bangladesh on Sunday. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/sports-gallery/ie-100-top-10-sports-personalities/#srinivasan-2" target="_blank">(PHOTOS: Kohli in IE Power List 2014)</a></p>

<p>India failed to reach the finals of the Asia Cup earlier this month at the same venue as they lost two of their round-robin matches to eventual champions Sri Lanka and Pakistan.</p>
<p>India could only beat minnows Afghanistan and Bangladesh in the league stage but that was not good enough for them to advance to the finals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/manchestercityapm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008909" alt="The League Cup Manchester City won at Wembley earlier this month was supposed to be an appetiser for the feast to come (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/manchestercityapm1.jpg" /></a> The League Cup Manchester City won at Wembley earlier this month was supposed to be an appetiser for the feast to come (AP)
<p>A few weeks ago, talk of an unprecedented Manchester City quadruple was doing the rounds with Manuel Pellegrini&#8217;s side in seemingly unstoppable form on all fronts.</p>
<p>After Wednesday&#8217;s <a title="Lionel Messi on target as Barcelona end Manchester City’s Champions League dreams" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/lionel-messi-on-target-as-barcelona-end-manchester-citys-champions-league-dreams/" target="_blank">2-1 Champions League last 16 defeat in Barcelona</a>, which sealed a 4-1 aggregate loss, the dream of a bumper springtime bounty for City is fading before their eyes.</p>
<p>The <a title="Manchester City sink Sunderland to win League Cup final" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/manchester-city-sink-sunderland-to-win-league-cup-final/" target="_blank">League Cup they won at Wembley</a> earlier this month with an unconvincing defeat of Sunderland was supposed to be an appetiser for the feast to come.</p>
<p>Now, with the Champions League and FA Cup gone and Chelsea storming nine points clear in the Premier League, there is a growing feeling it might be their only silverware this season.</p>
<p>That would represent an anti-climax for a City side that earlier this season was being lauded for playing the best football throughout Europe.</p>
<p>City&#8217;s Abu Dhabi owners have invested hundreds of millions of pounds into turning the once under-achieving club into a major European force but six years after they opened the cash tap there is clearly still a long way to go.</p>
<p>Reaching the business end of the Champions League &#8211; the quarter-finals and semi-finals as a minimum &#8211; is the benchmark for a club with ambitions of continental grandeur.</p>
<p>That is why Pellegrini, who did just that with unfashionable Villarreal and Malaga in Spain, was hired to replace Roberto Mancini, who could not even get City out of the group phase of the blue riband competition.</p>
<p>At least Pellegrini fared slightly better as City finished runners-up to holders Bayern Munich in their group &#8211; beating the German side away before Christmas.</p>
<p>The draw for the last 16 was not kind, although with cracks appearing in the once all-conquering Barcelona side City were expected to push the Catalans all the way.</p>
<p>As it turned out they bowed out meekly, producing a tame performance at home when losing 2-0 and never seriously threatened a fightback in the Nou Camp, where they had Pablo Zabaleta sent off shortly after Lionel Messi had put Barca ahead on the night to effectively kill the tie.</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>City&#8217;s captain Vincent Kompany said after the defeat on Wednesday that City would be stronger next season.</p>
<p>But the notion that City are slowly growing into the Champions League as if they were a collection of raw youngsters is beginning to wear a little thin.</p>
<p>At this rate they will take another four seasons to make a serious challenge when, in reality, they already have a capable squad that is the envy of any club in the world, barring perhaps Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern.</p>
<p>City&#8217;s assistant Ruben Cousillas faced the media on Wednesday with Pellegrini suspended by UEFA after criticising the referee in the first leg defeat to Barcelona.</p>
<p>He tried to shed a positive light on a disappointing exit, saying the season had already been successful and that their European demise would mean they will now concentrate all their efforts on hauling in Chelsea in the Premier League. They have three games in hand of Jose Mourinho&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been at the club only for eight months so our project is only in its early stages,&#8221; the Argentine said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve won our first title already. Until last weekend we were the only team playing in all four competitions &#8211; something which is very hard to accomplish because of the amount of games you have to play.</p>
<p>&#8220;We work for a big club, a club which gives us the best tools to work. We know the responsibility we have and we know how important it is to win the Premier League,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today the team proved that it&#8217;s improving and going back to a good level after a difficult period in February.</p>
<p>&#8220;We showed that we are alive and we&#8217;re going to fight for the Premier League and, like I said, our project is long term.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008902&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rogerfedererusatodaysportsm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008675" alt="Roger Federer is now on a nine-match winning streak after taking the title in Dubai before heading to Indian Wells (USA Today Sports)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rogerfedererusatodaysportsm.jpg" /></a> Roger Federer is now on a nine-match winning streak after taking the title in Dubai before heading to Indian Wells (USA Today Sports)
<p>Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic cruised into the quarter-finals of the PNB Paribas Open at Indian Wells on Wednesday after Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and Australian Open winner Stanislas Wawrinka both fell in the fourth round.</p>
<p>In a tournament full of surprises, Federer and Djokovic struck a blow for the old world order with Federer beating Germany&#8217;s Tommy Haas 6-4 6-4 and Djokovic coming back to down Croatia&#8217;s Marin Cilic 1-6 6-2 6-3.</p>
<p>Federer and Djokivic are the only players ranked in the world&#8217;s top 10 to reach the quarter-finals after Wawrinka and Murray joined the big-name casualties when they both crashed to lower-ranked opponents on another day of upsets in the Californian desert.</p>
<p>Wawrinka suffered his first loss this year when his 13-match winning streak came to a shuddering halt as he was beaten 7-6(1) 4-6 6-1 by South African Kevin Anderson.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t really on my mind that he had won Australia,&#8221; said Anderson, whose next opponent is Federer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels great to beat somebody who obviously has just won a grand slam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Murray was blown away by Canada&#8217;s Milos Raonic, one of the biggest servers in men&#8217;s tennis.</p>
<p>Despite winning the first set, the Scotsman was unable to contain the raw power of Raonic, who triumphed 4-6 7-5 6-3 in a little over two hours.</p>
<p>Raonic blasted 15 aces past his bewildered opponent, who is one of the best returners in the game, and won a staggering 83 percent of points when he landed his first serve.</p>
<p>Murray did break Raonic&#8217;s serve in the opening set and again in the deciding third to lead 2-1 but lost the next four games in a row against the 6ft 5in (1.96 metre) tall Canadian.</p>
<p>&#8220;To get broken two consecutive times in that situation isn&#8217;t good enough. I played poor tennis at that stage. I didn&#8217;t make enough balls and I missed some really easy shots,&#8221; Murray told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tough to win matches like that, because against him, he obviously wins a lot of free points with his serve. So over the course of the set, if you give up enough unforced errors on basic shots, then with the amount of free points he gets on his serve, that&#8217;s going to add up to a negative result.&#8221;</p>
<p>Raonic&#8217;s next opponent in the quarter-finals will be Ukrainian giant killer Alexandr Dolgopolov, who followed up his upset victory over Rafa Nadal on Monday with a comprehensive 6-2 6-4 drubbing of Italy&#8217;s Fabio Fognini.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the most important thing is obviously my serve and the beauty of that is nobody can affect me,&#8221; Raonic said.</p>
<p>Already a four-time champion at Indian Wells, Federer is now on a nine-match winning streak after taking the title in Dubai before heading to Indian Wells but said he was wary about Anderson, who has reached a career-high ranking of 18 after making the final of  his last two tournaments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how tough he is,&#8221; Federer said. &#8220;He&#8217;s the best here usually in the States, outdoors on the hard courts. That&#8217;s when he&#8217;s had his biggest success.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m aware that this is not going to be an easy match just because he&#8217;s not ranked in the Top 10.&#8221;<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Means a lot</strong></p>
<p>Djokovic had won each of his previous seven encounters with Cilic but his perfect record was in danger after he lost the opening set to the towering Croatian, winning just three points on return.</p>
<p>But the Serbian quickly got his act together, and broke Cilic twice in the second set then once in the deciding third to safely advance to the last eight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was composed and mentally calm, regardless of the score line,&#8221; Djokovic said. &#8220;I just accepted the fact that he came out of the blocks better than I did.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was very aggressive, not missing at all, serving incredibly fast and accurate. I couldn&#8217;t do much really. I was forced to back up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believed that I could come back. The second set was a whole new story. I reset myself and told myself it was the start of the match.</p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot about the first set and the second and third went really well. It was the intensity I want to have and I hope to keep it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Isner kept American hopes alive with a 7-6(3) 3-6 6-3 win over Spain&#8217;s Fernando Verdasco, while Latvia&#8217;s Ernests Gulbis defeated Roberto Bautista of Spain 7-6(0) 4-6 6-2.</p>
<p>A third Spaniard, Feliciano Lopez, was sent packing by unseeded Frenchman Julien Benneteau, losing 6-3 7-6(4).</p>
<p>In the women&#8217;s draw, second seed Agnieszka Radwanska booked her spot in the semi-finals after a two-and-a-half hour slugfest with Serbia&#8217;s Jelena Jankovic.</p>
<p>Radwanska looked to have regained control when she led 4-0 in the third set but only sealed the win by reeling off the last two games when Jankovic drew level at 4-4.</p>
<p>Jankovic actually won two more points than Radwanksa overall but still finished behind in their floodlit thriller.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have finished it a little bit earlier in the third set, but she was really fighting until the last point,&#8221; Radwanksa said.<br />
&#8220;I think I was just better in a couple of points today. I&#8217;m happy I could win this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Radwanska&#8217;s semi-final opponent on Friday is Romania&#8217;s Simona Halep after she cruised into the next round with a 6-2 6-2 victory over Australian qualifier Casey Dellacqua.</p>
<p>Halep only needed an hour to wrap up a lopsided victory and is poised to become the first Romanian woman to break into the top five when the updated world rankings are released on Monday.</p>
<p>The only other Romanian woman to make the top 10 were Virginia Ruzici, who won the French Open in 1978 and made it up to number eight in the world, and Irina Spirlea, who climbed as high as seven.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means a lot,&#8221; Halep said. &#8220;I&#8217;m now the best Romanian in history for rankings &#8211; but my goal is to win a grand slam, and then maybe I&#8217;ll be the best, because Virginia won the French Open.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008671&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Red Bull will put a &#8220;very different&#8221; car on the track for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix from the model which disappointed during the last test in Bahrain, reigning champion Sebastian Vettel said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Vettel, bidding for a fifth consecutive title, comes into Sunday&#8217;s race at Albert Park with his team scrambling to come to grips with the new hybrid turbo era in Formula One.</p>
<p>Red Bull, one of four teams using the troubled Renault power unit, was unable to finish a race simulation for either Vettel or his new Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo, and badly lagged rivals Mercedes and Ferrari in terms of mileage.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a very different car,&#8221; the 26-year-old told reporters at Albert Park.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, we had a lot of problems during the tests, we didn&#8217;t get to test a lot of stuff and we hope to do some more running here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Red Bull&#8217;s struggles to adapt to the new V6 engine have given rival teams hope of ending their four-year stranglehold on the constructors&#8217; and drivers&#8217; championships, or at a minimum end the German&#8217;s run of nine consecutive race victories.</p>
<p>Vettel, who has not lost a race since July, said little to lift the gloom hanging over his team&#8217;s garage, but was adamant that just finishing the race was not the limit of Red Bull&#8217;s ambitions in Melbourne.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that we are not in the best shape yet. There are a lot of things we need to sort,&#8221; said Vettel, a 2011 winner at Albert Park and third last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t solve all of them overnight. We&#8217;d love to but we cant. We really have to go step-by-step together with Daniel.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no secret you need very, very strong reliability to be a title contender.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going out of here not trying to just make it round, I&#8217;m going round here to push to the maximum and do the best I can, and then we&#8217;ll see where we are and how far we get.</p>
<p>&#8220;The target, for sure, is to finish, and the target for sure is to finish in the best possible position. That&#8217;s the mindset, it&#8217;s fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a strong team, good people on board &#8230; I&#8217;m confident we should progress as the season goes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>After an occasionally tempestuous five years with the plain-spoken Mark Webber, Vettel has a younger Australian team mate in the garage in Ricciardo, who graduated from sister team Toro Rosso.</p>
<p>Vettel joked that he had little advice to give the 24-year-old after pre-season testing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much, we didn&#8217;t drive that much this year, so there&#8217;s not much I could talk about,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously you do your own thing once you&#8217;re in the car.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having battled manfully through countless media appearances in the leadup to his home grand prix, Ricciardo will face a huge task holding his own against his more senior team mate out on the track.</p>
<p>&#8220;For now, (I&#8217;ll) just focus on what I&#8217;ve done for the last few years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just keep doing what I&#8217;ve been doing to get to this point and then see how it&#8217;s feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously I get a good view behind the scenes with the engineers, and also with how Seb works with his guys and understand a bit more through that but for now it&#8217;s just do my thing and see where I stand.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008588&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Australia fast bowler Mitchell Johnson has a right toe infection and his availability for the World Twenty20 tournament is in question.</p>
<p>Cricket Australia said Thursday a final decision on his inclusion in the squad is yet to be made and that his scheduled departure Sunday to Bangladesh may be delayed.</p>
<p>Johnson is receiving treatment in Perth for the infection, which developed from a cut following the third test against South Africa in Cape Town.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Johnson led Australia&#8217;s 5-0 Ashes home whitewash of England and then the 2-1 away victory over South Africa.</p>
<p>CA&#8217;s chief medical officer Justin Paoloni says the 32-year-old Johnson will be monitored closely over the next two or three days &#8220;until we are happy that the infection has resolved and his toe fully recovered.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008538&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Afridi played in the Asia Cup final on Saturday with painkillers after he hurt his hamstring with some powerful late hitting during two nail-biting victories against India and Bangladesh last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a captain I need a fit Afridi, and that&#8217;s why we have given him time to rehab,&#8221; Hafeez said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pakistan leaves for Dhaka on Thursday, and manager Zakir Khan said they hoped Afridi could join the team on Monday, meaning the allrounder will miss the warmup match against New Zealand.</p>
<p>Afridi&#8217;s fitness could be tested in the second warmup game against South Africa next Wednesday before the 2009 winners&#8217; first group match against India two days later.</p>
<p>Afridi is the most capped Twenty20 international player with 70 matches, bagging 73 wickets with his legspin bowling and scoring 1,044 runs at an impressive strike rate of 143.01.</p>
<p>Hafeez said fitness was one of the key issues with the team because it has been playing international cricket nonstop for five months.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you play back-to-back matches, the fitness of individuals counts a lot,&#8221; Hafeez said. &#8220;Fitness is the problem of the Pakistan team, but it needs to be improved at the grassroots level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pakistan has never won a match against India in an ICC tournament, including a loss in the inaugural World Twenty20 final in South Africa in 2007.</p>
<p>But the recent victory against India in the Asia Cup has raised the hopes of Hafeez, despite the fact India will be strengthened with the return of captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina, who all missed the Asia Cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;The India vs. Pakistan match is always a pressure match,&#8221; Hafeez said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a player and as a captain I am very happy that our first match is against India, and from there hopefully we will get a good takeoff in the tournament.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wherever you play against them (India), you have pressure from the media and your nation, but we will try to have a good start and build a good momentum.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dip in the form of Umar Gul, the second highest wicket-taker in T20s with 74, and Junaid Khan, worries Hafeez after both fast bowlers combined for only six wickets during the Asia Cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;The performance of the fast bowlers will be the key for us because they have to play their roles with both the new and old ball,&#8221; Hafeez said.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Bowling coach) Mohammad Akram is working hard with both of them in the nets, but in the end it&#8217;s up to them to go out and perform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fielding is another area of concern, as Pakistan dropped at least three catches in the Asia Cup final loss to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>The Pakistan Cricket Board hired former test opener Shoaib Mohammad as the fielding coach before the Asia Cup, but Hafeez said it will take time to implement the coach&#8217;s techniques.</p>
<p>&#8220;He (Mohammad) has never worked as a fielding coach with any national team,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He is giving us some new ideas and we are trying to adopt those things, but it will take some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pakistan has recalled allrounder Shoaib Malik, wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, left-arm fast bowler Sohail Tanvir and left-arm spinner Zulfiqar Babar in the four changes made from the team which played in the Asia Cup.</p>
<p>Australia, defending champion West Indies, and a qualifier are also in Pakistan&#8217;s group.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the most successful teams in the World T20 after winning the title in 2009 in England, reaching one other final, and two semifinals.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008523&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Brad Hodge&#8217;s back-to-back sixes off Wayne Parnell proved decisive as Australia beat South Africa by five wickets in a Twenty20 international that had been reduced to seven overs per side due to rain on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Australia went into the final over of a frenetic match at Kingsmead requiring 15 runs to reach a target of 81, and achieved it with two deliveries to spare thanks to Hodge&#8217;s lusty blows over deep midwicket.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old finished unbeaten on 21 from eight deliveries in his third match since returning to the Australian side after a six-year absence.</p>
<p>The result put Australia 1-0 up in the three-match series with one game to play after the first clash was washed out.</p>
<p>Despite Wednesday&#8217;s encounter being reduced in length, South Africa opted against sending some of its bigger hitters up the order after it lost the toss and was asked to bat, and arguably paid the price as Hashim Amla struggled up front.</p>
<p>The hosts scored just 11 runs for the loss of Amla in their first three overs, but recovered spectacularly as Quinton de Kock and Faf du Plessis took 69 off the last four.</p>
<p>De Kock finished unbeaten on 41 from 20 deliveries, while Du Plessis was 27 not out as South Africa finished on 80-1 from its seven overs.</p>
<p>Australia made the ideal start to its reply when Lonwabo Tsotsobe&#8217;s first over went for 21, as David Warner continued the excellent form he showed in the test series when he scored 543 runs in three matches.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s picked up a bat since the end of the tests, and then to come out and be as fluent and powerful as he was, he&#8217;s in beautiful touch at the moment and a great head space,&#8221; Australia captain George Bailey said.</p>
<p>South Africa&#8217;s prospects improved when Warner was trapped lbw by JP Duminy for a quick 40 and powerful batsman Glenn Maxwell was dismissed in the same over.</p>
<p>However Hodge brought his experience to bear when he hit the third and fourth deliveries of Parnell&#8217;s over for six, before a wide sealed the game for Australia.</p>
<p>&#8220;A seven-over game is pretty hectic, &#8220;Du Plessis said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t look too much into it — you&#8217;re basically just trying to swing out your boots every ball and in the field just hoping for some luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final match of the series is on Friday at Centurion.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008494&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lionelmessireutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008513" alt="Barcelona's Lionel Messi (C) scores a goal past Manchester City's goalkeeper Joe Hart (L) and Joleon Lescott during their Champions League last 16 second leg soccer match at Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lionelmessireutersm.jpg" /></a> Barcelona&#8217;s Lionel Messi (C) scores a goal past Manchester City&#8217;s goalkeeper Joe Hart (L) and Joleon Lescott during their Champions League last 16 second leg soccer match at Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona (Reuters)
<p>Lionel Messi struck to end Manchester City&#8217;s dreams of a famous comeback as Barcelona beat the English club 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Wednesday to reach the Champions League quarter-finals 4-1 on aggregate.</p>
<p>Barca looked far from the classic team who lifted the trophy in 2009 and 2011 but a stuttering version under Gerardo Martino that had lost two of their last three games was still far too strong for the Premier League club.</p>
<p>City, who lost the first leg of the last-16 tie 2-0 at home, were a constant threat to the Spanish champions, but they were left to rue missed chances by David Silva, Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta.</p>
<p>Captain Vincent Kompany levelled for the visitors on the night with a tap-in in the 89th minute, but Dani Alves responded by sweeping home the winner in the first minute of stoppage time.</p>
<p>City had been reduced to 10 men by then after Zabaleta was shown a second yellow card for dissent in the 78th minute.<br />
The Argentine defender was incensed with referee Stephane Lannoy&#8217;s decision to ignore City&#8217;s strong penalty claims when substitute Edin Dzeko went down in the area under a challenge by Gerard Pique.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a clear penalty,&#8221; Kompany told Sky Sports. &#8220;Dzeko was in position to shoot and his trigger foot was caught.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have got nothing left in the tank. We gave everything and a few times we could have scored and obviously that would have changed the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to take your half chances against the best teams. Over the course of the two games there was not much between the sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>Messi put his side in front by producing a neat finish with the outside of his left boot from close range in the 67th minute after defender Joleon Lescott failed to stop a routine through-ball from Cesc Fabregas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we had to score a goal to bring some calm to the tie, as we were aware of how dangerous City are,&#8221; Messi told Canal Plus.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the tie was ever in danger for us, and we controlled the match very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think tonight we got back to being the Barcelona that we all want to see and we were able to beat a very tough opponent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if the criticism (in the media after the La Liga defeat to Valladolid) was over the top. We are the first to criticise ourselves and we didn&#8217;t play the way we should have done there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t let the criticism affect us and we just focus on ourselves and try to turn things around and that&#8217;s what we did tonight, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Tentative game</strong></p>
<p>Barca had begun the game deeper than usual, looking to entice City to come at them so they could pounce on the counter. It was a tentative game early on as City held back and Barca&#8217;s passing lacked fluidity.</p>
<p>The first half ended in a flourish as Neymar took advantage of a slip by Aleksandar Kolarov and his shot was scrambled wide by Joe Hart, while he also had another effort cleared off the line by Fernandinho.</p>
<p>In between, Nasri fired straight at Victor Valdes having been set up by Silva and the Spaniard also wasted a golden chance when he fired over with his favoured left foot from 15 metres out.</p>
<p>After the break Messi&#8217;s threat grew and in the 50th minute he cut in from the right and hit the post with a low left-foot shot from inside the area.</p>
<p>At the other end Dzeko, who had replaced Sergio Aguero, had a header brilliantly clawed away by Valdes. City were still in the contest until Lescott got in a tangle just inside his own area, and the English defender&#8217;s worst fears were realised when he turned round to see Messi latch on to the loose ball, deceive Hart with his finish, and send Barca on their way to the last eight for the seventh successive season.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leo is the one whe makes the difference and that&#8217;s what he is there for,&#8221; said Xavi.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, this is the Champions League and you suffer at times during the game. They played well, they are a good team and they had their chances, but I think we dominated the match.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008394&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/poonam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008255" alt="Poonam Chaturvedi" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/poonam.jpg" /></a> Poonam Chaturvedi
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">“Papa says I’ll be fine.” That is 18-year-old Poonam Chaturvedi’s absolute faith in what her parents and coach have been telling her. She repeats this line while talking about Chhattisgarh’s triumph over the ‘big didis’ of women’s basketball, Indian Railways, who were handed their first defeat in 12 years at the national championship last week.</span></p>
<p>The title victory was the high point of the basketball player’s last three months, otherwise spent dealing with long spells of an excruciating headache. Chaturvedi was diagnosed with “a mild form of” brain tumour, but she continued to train and play. “My father says it is curable and I am looking forward to returning to the sport fit and healthy,” she says.</p>
<p>During Chhattisgarh’s final match against Railways, the headache returned a few minutes after she took the court to play, though it eased a few minutes later. When another player went out on five fouls, Chaturvedi was eager to return to the court. She spent the last few minutes of the game guarding the rebounds, even as her team effected the biggest upset of the nationals.</p>
<p>“Sar dard kar raha tha, magar main daudti rahi. Achha laga, final jeetna (My head was aching but I kept running. It felt good to win the final match),” she says.</p>
<p>Her father, Shriram, is a constable with the Uttar Pradesh Police. The family is considering treatment either in Delhi or Bangalore.</p>
<p>“We’ve found out that NIMHANS in Bangalore has a new radiation machine which will help treat the tumour located in the middle of her head,” says coach Rajesh Patel.</p>
<p>The Basketball Federation of India has promised to bear the medical expenses, and the Bhilai Steel Plant will chip in.</p>
<p>Though at 6 feet 11 inches, Chaturvedi is easily India’s tallest woman player, she has only come into her own this year, enjoying an astounding junior nationals earlier at Cuttack, where she tallied 323 points in seven matches, with a record high of 67 against Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>“When I’m not in pain, basketball is my life. Otherwise it’s very bad,” she says, adding, “I wish it would get over and I could return to playing without fear.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008251&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Diego Costa extended his rich vein of form with a double as Atletico Madrid thumped AC Milan 4-1 to send the seven-times winners packing and secure a place in the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time in 17 years. Costa, who struck in Atletico’s 1-0 win at the San Siro in the first leg of the last-16 tie and has seven goals in five appearances in Europe’s elite club competition, opened the scoring in the third minute with an acrobatic volley.</span></p>
<p>Kaka levelled with a header in the 27th as Milan briefly took control of the match before Arda Turan’s deflected effort sailed into the net five minutes before halftime to restore the home team’s lead. Raul Garcia headed Atletico’s third in the 71st minute and Costa struck again five minutes from time to seal a 5-1 aggregate success and crown a near-perfect night for the fans thronging Calderon stadium.</p>
<p>“We played very well as a team tonight,” Brazil-born Costa, who made his first appearance for adopted country Spain this month, said in an interview with Spanish television. “We are grateful for the support of the fans and the truth is that the team deserves congratulating for the way it has played,” he added. “We don’t really want a particular opponent in the next round. All the teams that will be in the quarter-finals will be tough prospects. For now we’ll just enjoy.”</p>
<p><strong>Best result</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Atletico, whose last appearance in the last eight in 1997 was with a team featuring current coach Diego Simeone, thoroughly deserved their victory, and they have matched their best result in the competition. “I knew that Milan could complicate things,” Simeone said. “We started better than them in the first half and it seemed we would go on and control the game after the first goal, but they got back into it,” added the Argentine. “However, my players were excellent in the second half.”</p>
<p>Milan’s exit means there will be no Italian side in the quarter-finals for the first time since 2009. The Serie A club are mired in mid table in their domestic league and face a real battle to secure a place in European competition next season. It was only the fourth time Milan have conceded four goals in the Champions League. New coach Clarence Seedorf, who took over when Massimiliano Allegri was sacked in January, has much to ponder.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to Atletico they deserved this victory, especially for the way they played in the second half,” Seedorf said. “We did not manage to maintain control of the game and their second goal came at our best moment,” he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008236&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Bayern Munich, a shadow of the team that have been so imperious in the Bundesliga this season, survived a shaky second half and missed a late penalty against Arsenal on Tuesday to reach the Champions League quarter-finals. The holders looked less than all-conquering in a 1-1 second-leg draw against Arsenal who were left with too much to do after losing 2-0 at home in the opening match of the last-16 encounter.</span></p>
<p>Bayern have dropped only four points in the Bundesliga, and blasted 15 goals in their previous three games, but were well below their best against the Londoners at the Allianz Arena. Bastian Schweinsteiger broke the deadlock in the 55th minute before Bayern old boy Lukas Podolski replied immediately for Arsenal who brought out goalkeeper Manuel Neuer’s eccentric side.</p>
<p>The Bavarians won a controversial penalty when Arjen Robben reacted theatrically to a foul by Laurent Koscielny in stoppage time and Thomas Mueller’s spot kick was stopped by keeper Lukasz Fabianski, ending a run of 13 straight wins in all competitions.</p>
<p>“We had to defend a lot in the first half but we knew that by being in the game at halftime we stood a good chance to win and I believe in the second half the opportunities were there,” said manager Arsene Wenger after Arsenal’s fourth successive last-16 exit.</p>
<p>“We never got them really under pressure, they suddenly became nervous but because we never managed to make it 2-1 you could not see how they would have responded,” he added.</p>
<p>Coach Pep Guardiola said on Tuesday that the lead Bayern held from the first leg prevented his team from going all out on the attack.</p>
<p>“We had a lot of control but the opponents didn’t push and in the head of the players we were already 2-0 ahead,” he explained. “You’re not always going to score lots of goals. This was a top-level team we were facing.”</p>
<p>Bayern spent most of the first half probing a resilient Arsenal defence that just about managed to hold out.</p>
<p>Javi Martinez’s goal was disallowed for offside in the 26th minute and Robben had two efforts cut out by Arsenal defenders as Bayern tried to turn the screw. Fabianski then got down to save Mario Goetze’s low shot seconds before the break.</p>
<p>Bayern finally broke through 10 minutes after the restart when Ribery laid the ball off for Schweinsteiger to finish. The home fans were stunned two minutes later when Podolski slammed the ball into the roof of the net. Neuer then had to head the ball clear. The keeper had the Bayern fans on edge again when he sent a clearance straight to Giroud but the Bundesliga leaders quickly regrouped.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008234&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/heenasidhum.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008491" alt="Heena Sidhu reckons she needs another 18 months to perfect her new technique (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/heenasidhum.jpg" /></a> Heena Sidhu reckons she needs another 18 months to perfect her new technique (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Former shooter Ronak Pandit is known for his incessant chattering but for his wife Heena Sidhu, his boisterousness is the ideal tool for what she calls ‘disturbance training’. Over the past month, Heena trained with him buzzing about in the background, getting accustomed to a noisy environment while preparing for the Asian Airgun Shooting Championship in Kuwait. She won with scores of 386 in qualifying and 200.3 in the finals. The training had paid off.</span></p>
<p>The couple also made use of ‘pressure training’, which involved setting a target score during practice and having Heena remorselessly achieve the target. The 24-year-old had trained for 384 and was thrilled to supercede that mark in competition.</p>
<p>“Ronak keeps talking when I’m practicing. He has to try to distract me and I have to keep shooting accurately,” Heena explains.</p>
<p>“Whether I have fever, a bad cold or I’m just feeling lazy, I have to get the at least the score we’ve set. That’s the minimum,” she adds.</p>
<p>Having become the first pistol-shooter from India to win the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) World Cup in Munich last November, in which she set the world record of 203.8, the onus has been on Heena to find new ways to keep improving her performance.</p>
<p>“Winning the World Cup was a mere benchmark. It was an indicator that the training was going in the right direction. But I still needed something new because after a big win, one can sometimes stop enjoying the sport,” she says, explaining a temporary lull in motivation.</p>
<p><strong>DIMINISHED HUNGER</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Heena points to that slightly diminished hunger to explain the technical problems she faced in Kuwait. Despite winning gold at the event for the first time, she is piqued by a technical glitch that saw her fire shots after five seconds.</p>
<p>“I normally shoot within three or four seconds. There was some uncertainty and that’s why the shots were late,” she says.</p>
<p>The Kuwait tournament was Heena’s first since her win in Munich. The disturbance and pressure training methods were introduced shortly after Munich in an attempt to refresh her interest the sport. Another change has been Heena trying her hand in the 25-metre sport pistol event.</p>
<p>“It’s not very different from the 10-metre air pistol. The guns have the same weight. Mentally, the air pistol is more challenging than the 25-metre event but you need more control on the muscles because it’s a longer format,” she says.</p>
<p>The new event has a five-shot series final, while her accustomed 10-metre game involves just one shot in the final. Her training began in September and Sidhu reckons another 18 months will be sufficient for her to perfect her technique. “It’s like you’re used to driving one car, and then switch to another. The basics are the same but it’s just a different feel,” she adds.</p>
<p>The additional event was a suggestion put forward by her Ukrainian coach, Anatoly Piddubnyl as, according to him, focusing on one event could be monotonous. “He said that one isn’t moving forward if one is practicing the same thing everyday. So, he advised (me to take up) the new event to make things fresh and more enjoyable. As a result, the scores (have) improved,” she says.</p>
<p>Heena is due to to participate in the World Cup qualifiers in the United States, which start on March 28. She will be competing in the 10-metre air pistol and 25-metre sport gun events.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008231&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Top Indian shuttlers P V Sindhu, Parupalli Kashyap and Anand Pawar got off to winning starts, notching up victories in their respective opening-round singles matches at the the $ 125,000 Swiss Grand Prix Gold tournament in Basel.</span></p>
<p>Sindhu posted a comfortable 21-18 21-15 victory over Malaysian Sannatasah Saniru in 32 minutes to enter the second round of the women’s singles event.</p>
<p>Kashyap and Pawar also reached the second round of the men’s singles competition with straight game victories.</p>
<p>But it was curtains for Kidambi Srikanth in the men’s singles, while Saili Rane failed to cross the opening hurdle in women’s singles.</p>
<p>Seventh-seeded Sindhu opened with a 3-0 lead and went on to extend it to 10-3 in the first game. But the Malaysian raised her tempo and managed to reduce the gap to 15-16 before making it 17-17. At 18-18 though, the 18-year-old Hyderabadi girl accelerated to pocket three straight points to wrap-up the opening game 21-18.</p>
<p>The second game was a neck-and-neck battle till 7-7 before the Malaysian opened up a 13-9 lead, but Sindhu held on to her nerves to make it 12-13 and then tie it at 14-14. There was no looking back for the Indian from there and she dominated the proceedings to seal the match in her favour.</p>
<p>The World No. 9 will take on winner of the match between Li Michelle of Canada and Russia’s Ella Diehl in the next round.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kashyap prevailed over The Netherlands’ Erik Meijs 21-17 21-15. Kashyap led 6-3 early on, before slipping to 9-11, but he raised his game and pocketed the first game. The second game was a more comfortable ride as Kashyap jumped from 5-4 to 10-4 and didn’t give a chance to his opponent and closed the door on Erik.</p>
<p>Anand, too, didn’t break much sweat before getting past Malaysia’s Kok Pong Loke 21-17 21-10 in 26-minutes.</p>
<p>However, Thailand Grand Prix Gold winner, Srikanth, could not reach the next stage after losing 21-19 18-21 17-21 against Sweden’s Henri Hurskainen. Third-seeded Shixian Wang of China outplayed young Indian Saili 21-8 21-9 in just 31 minutes.</p>
<p>The Indian mixed doubles pair of Tarun Kona and Ashwini Ponnappa also lost against the Polish combo of Robert Mateusiak and Agnieszka Wojtkowska 10-21 21-16 13-21.</p>
<p>In women’s doubles, Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa made an early exit as they lost to German pair of Isabel Herttrich and Carla Nelte 19-21, 21-13, 18-21.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008230&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Djokovic’s next opponent is the big-serving Croatian Marin Cilic, who recorded his 20th win this season with a 6-4 6-3 over Spain’s Tommy Robredo.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008228&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Normal service resumed at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells on Tuesday when Novak Djokovic safely booked his place in the fourth round of the men’s draw and Li Na moved into the women’s quarterfinals. Djokovic had a little hiccup, dropping the second set against Colombia’s Alejandro Gonzalez but was otherwise untroubled in winning 6-1 3-6 6-1.</span></p>
<p>“I thought I played really well from the start,” said Djokovic, a two-time champion at Indian Wells. “Then suddenly I just had a big loss of concentration and allowed him to win the second set for no reason. I bounced back better in the third.”</p>
<p>While the Serbian was not at his best, Djokovic did at least survive to fight another day in the Californian desert after the shock losses of world number one Rafa Nadal and Maria Sharapova on Monday.</p>
<p>Djokovic’s next opponent is the big-serving Croatian Marin Cilic, who recorded his 20th win this season with a 6-4 6-3 over Spain’s Tommy Robredo.</p>
<p>“I obviously cannot allow myself to have these particular concentration lapses in the match at this level especially in the next match when I’m playing Cilic, a guy who is in really good form and I think has gotten better in last couple of months working with (Goran) Ivanisevic.”</p>
<p>Li, the women’s top seed, beat Canada’s Aleksandra Wozniak 6-1 6-4 after a extraordinary final game where she struggled to close out the match.</p>
<p>Li raced through the opening set in just over half an hour then recovered from 3-0 down to serve for the match at 5-4 when she suddenly got the wobbles. The final game lasted 20 minutes as Li squandered 10 match points and took her tally of double-faults for the match to nine before she finally sealed the win.</p>
<p>“I think all the match I was feeling pretty good, except the last game,” Li was quoted as saying on the WTA website (www.wtatennis.com). “The funny thing was that in the beginning of the game I was feeling tight, nervous, and then I was like, ‘What’s going on? Why can’t I finish the match?’ and she wasn’t giving up, and was defending so well. It was really tough.”</p>
<p><strong>ARMADA ADVANCE</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>While Robredo lost to the towering Cilic, three of his compatriots all advanced with Fernando Verdasco upsetting world number nine Richard Gasquet of France 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 to leave Djokovic as the only top-10 player left in the bottom half of the men’s draw.</p>
<p>Roberto Bautista Agut held his nerve to beat Finland’s Jarkko Nieminen 6-2 4-6 7-6 (8-6) to move on before Feliciano Lopez joined the Spanish Armada with a 1-6 6-3 6-4 defeat of Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>In the women’s draw, Serbia’s Jelena Jankovic ended her five-match losing streak to Denmark’s Carolina Wozniacki, reeling off 10 consecutive games to win 6-3 6-1 and advance to the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>“At 3-1, I kind of found my way, found my rhythm, and I was striking the ball very well out there and took control of the points,” said Jankovic. “I just did not let her play what she plays. That was very important. So I was pretty pleased with the way I played and how composed I stayed.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008228&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viswanathananand.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1976310" alt="Viswanathan Anand will be a part of the eight-player, double round robin tournament to decide Carlsen’s challenger for the world title (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viswanathananand.jpg" /></a> Viswanathan Anand will be a part of the eight-player, double round robin tournament to decide Carlsen’s challenger for the world title (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It is a measure of how much chess has moved from the recent past that not one of the three world champions of the last decade in the fray will start the Candidates tournament in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, as the outright favourite. </span></p>
<p>Viswanathan Anand, Vladimir Kramnik and Vesalin Topalov have held the world title one time or another since 2000, including a period during which the chess world was still split and consequently had two champions simultaneously. Instead, ranking and form point in the direction of a as yet title-less Levon Aronian. The Armenian has perhaps been the only player recently to have made a case for himself to be considered a realistic challenger to the high-flying World No. 1 Magnus Carlsen for the world title.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/primecanditates.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2008482" alt="PrimeCanditates" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/primecanditates.jpg?w=462&#038;h=482" width="462" height="482" /></a></p>
<p>Fans of Kramnik will perhaps be aggrieved by this judgement. The Russian, ranked third in the world, is after all, only one rung below Aronian according to the latest ranking list, and had out-performed him in the last Candidates tournament. Kramnik had finished on the same points as Carlsen last year in London, and unfortunately for him, the rules broke the tie in favour of the Norwegian.</p>
<p>That Kramnik show in London had impressed Anand, watching the tournament to find out who his challenger would be, with the amount of new ideas the 38-year old brought to the board. But since the high at London, Kramnik has been up and down, having a few average tournaments interspersed with some great ones — he got past a fairly competitive field to win the the Chess World Cup last year.</p>
<p>All this presents the picture of a former champion not far off his peak, but the problem for Kramnik is that he will be competing against the prodiguously gifted Aronian, at a time when the Armenian is playing some of his best chess.</p>
<p>Aronian began 2013 with a second-place finish in Wijk Aan Zee, behind Carlsen, and then went on to win the strong Alekhine Memorial and the Bilbao Grand Slam that year. He hasn’t been too shabby this year either. He returned to Holland early in 2014 to win the Tata Steel Title. In comparison, Anand has won just one tournament in more than five years running. Aronian’s rankings, over the last couple of years, have soared, but its upward arc has been dwarfed only by the record run of Carlsen. Aronian’s current rating, a personal best of 2830, is the third highest since the introduction of the Elo system, only behind Carlsen’s 2882 and Garry Kasparov’s 2856.</p>
<p><strong>Twin chokes</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>At any rate, Aronian has been the best of the rest. If there is a blotch on his resume, it will be his twin chokes on the big stage. The first of these came in the 2012 Candidates (knock-out) tournament, when he went out at the quarterfinal stage. He lost a rapid play-off to the then World No. 15 Alexander Grischuk after failing to convert several winning positions during the four-match classical stretch. In his next go at the world title, in the 2013 Candidates (round-robin) tournament, Aronian started at a furious pace.</p>
<p>He worked up a handy lead over a field that included Carlsen and Kramnik, but imploded in the latter stages of the tournament. Three losses in the second half saw him drop down to fourth by the end. These disappointments are a big reason why Aronian hasn’t already risen to challenge for the world title; his rankings (persistently No. 2 to Carlsen for a couple of years now) indicate he ought to have.</p>
<p>Where does all this leave Anand? Players and pundits give the four-time champion only a notional chance. The Russian media has Grischuk saying he would be “very surprised” if Anand were to win.</p>
<p>World champion until a few months back, Anand has been left in the wake of the new, younger world order ushered in by the 22-year old champion Carlsen. Anand is in the middle of a prolonged rut, his tournament form poor and title defences unconvincing. Now 44, some say Anand has been in terminal decline for a few years.</p>
<p>When he lost his world title to Carlsen with a 3-5-6.5 scoreline late last year, it triggered rumours that Anand would perhaps turn down his ticket to the Candidates tournament this year, wishing to stay out of the world championship cycle for good.</p>
<p><strong>Slim pickings</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Anand eventually made an announcement that he would play in Russia. He clearly had a few things going for him. Anand had beaten Topalov (2011) and Kramnik (2009) in title bouts previously and should not be unduly troubled by the rest of the field, beyond Aronian. Being involved in the championship cycle for a couple of decades, he has the know how and the success. But his reign as the world champion has come to an end and has meanwhile slipped to a lowly eighth spot in the rankings. You know it has been slim pickings in the recent past for the 44-year old.</p>
<p>Even the gruelling schedule at Russia may test Anand, especially in the later stages of the tournament. The eight-player, double round-robin tournament has games coming at the rate of two in three days, for more than a fortnight. If Anand is to win the tournament, he will not just have to produce more results than he has managed to in the recent past, but also negotiate simultaneously his bete-noir Aronian. The Armenian has always troubled Anand over the board and will also be setting the pace in the event. In fact, Anand will have to contend with Aronian from the get-go, playing him in the first round.</p>
<p><strong>Round One games:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Dmitry Andreikin vs Vladimir Kramnik, Sergey Karjakin vs Peter Svidler, Shakhriyar Mamedyarov vs Veselin Topalov, Viswanathan Anand vs Levon Aronian</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008226&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/johnsonapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008608" alt="JohnsonAPM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/johnsonapm.jpg" /></a> At the Indian Premier League auction, Mitchell Johnson and Dale Steyn came with the biggest tags for their teams (AP)
<p>The format notorious for its unpredictability wasn’t desperate for another ‘uncontrollable’ but IPL Season 7 managed to add a blind turn to the T20 rollercoaster. So last month, when the best cricketing brains sat at the auction, they had at hand an unenviable task. They were to pick a team without knowing where the IPL was headed.</p>
<p>With South Africa too in the fray, along with UAE and Bangladesh, to co-host season 7, it was wise to have a Plan B. Stacking the team with express bowlers was a way to deal with the half-expected contingency keeping in mind the hard South African tracks.</p>
<p>So when on Tuesday it was finally announced that the <a title="Arabian nights: Indian Premier League 2014 to kick off in UAE, finish in India" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/arabian-nights-indian-premier-league-2014-to-kick-off-in-uae-finish-in-india/" target="_blank">IPL would be played in mostly India-like conditions</a> — Bangladesh and UAE too have slow and low tracks — the franchise strategists would have been glumly calculating the losses incurred over their South Africa speculation. Given a chance, every team would have been ready to trade their expensive pacers for a slow and stingy spinner.</p>
<p>At the auction, serious cash was splurged on those who could bowl in the 140s. Mitchell Starc had his lucky day as he went under the hammer first. With most team keen to fill up their pace department, Starc got Rs 5 cr. The Indian pacers Mohammad Sami (4.5 cr), Bhuvneshwar Kumar (4.5 cr), Vinay Kumar (2.8 cr), Umesh Yadav (2.6 cr), Ishant Sharma (2.6 cr) and Ashok Dinda (1.5 cr) too saw hectic bidding. Pace bowling all-rounder Corey Anderson at 4.5 cr was seen as a smart buy.</p>
<p>Mitchell Johnson and Dale Steyn came with the biggest tags for their teams. Eight fast bowlers making it to the Top 20 highest earners at the two-day auction, an unprecedented trend. Come April, it will be proved if the money spent on them was worth it.</p>
<p>The South Africa whisper was bad for spinners. Wrist spinners Amit Mishra, Piyush Chawla and Karan Sharma — those expected to turn the ball on any surface — got good money but the finger tweakers were out of favour. Ajantha Mendis, Johan Botha, Suraj Randiv and Rangana Herath went unsold.</p>
<p>Royal Challengers, Delhi Daredevials and Kings XI Punjab will be the most hit by the schedule. They don’t seem to have the bowling for local conditions. And like always, Chennai Super Kings seems to have got it right. They have the likes of Ashwin and Jadeja and they haven’t spent much on pacers. Their most-expensive new pacer this season is Ashish Nehra at Rs 2 crore.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/punjabvijayhazareptim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008478" alt="Chasingh 243, Punjab were all out for 105 (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/punjabvijayhazareptim.jpg" /></a> Chasingh 243, Punjab were all out for 105 (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Mandeep Singh is considered to be one of the brightest batting talents in the country, with the reputation of being a decent bat against pace. But Anureet Singh’s delivery, bowled from a fairly tight angle, started from well outside the off stump and curved in to knock the leg stump out. Mandeep looked back in disbelief and slowly trudged off the ground for a duck. A turnout of about 2,000, however, gave a rousing applause to a different player who walked in. It was Yuvraj Singh’s first match at Eden Gardens in more than a year. </span></p>
<p>It was just a Vijay Hazare Trophy quarterfinal against Railways. But out of the Indian ODI squad now, it was an opportunity for the 32-year-old left-hander to make a statement and also get into the groove ahead of the World T20. Punjab were reeling at 12 for three and were depending on him to get out of the woods. Krishnakant Upadhyay was bowling from the Club House end and welcomed Yuvraj with a shortish delivery around the off-stump. Two balls later another one was aimed at his rib cage.</p>
<p>Anureet, however, asked tougher questions from the other end with his swing and movement. Yuvraj initially struggled to put bat on ball but changed his strategy in the pacer’s next over. He stood well outside the batting crease and made Anureet alter his length. A gorgeous cover drive followed. Then a flick towards the deep square-leg boundary gave him three.</p>
<p>Then there was the accident. Yuvraj played a forward defensive shot to a Karn Sharma leg break and the ball went towards short leg. There was never a run in it but Gurkeerat Singh charged down from the non-striker’s end and Yuvraj had to react. He was late and was run out for 15 off 34 balls. Punjab were reduced to 51 for five, chasing 243 for victory.</p>
<p>From thereon, it was always going to be an uphill task for Harbhajan Singh’s men and they eventually folded for 105 in 33.4 overs, losing by 137 runs.</p>
<p>It was a big win for Railways, who started the game as underdogs. Anureet, their top wicket taker, was once again outstanding with the new ball. After a fantastic Ranji season, the 26-year-old has carried forward his form to the shorter format as well. He returned with two wickets for 26 runs in seven overs, but could have had a couple more scalps. Captain Mahesh Rawat pitched in as well, scoring his maiden List A hundred today — a run-a-ball 108 — and guiding his side to their highest total so far in this tournament. Jonathan Rongsen gave him good company with 58 in 78 balls and together they added 141 runs for the fifth wicket. Railways could have crossed 250, but Punjab medium pacer Siddharth Kaul took three wickets in his 11th over, finishing with five for 47 in 10.5 overs. That proved more than enough as Punjab surrendered tamely.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Railways 242 all out in 47.5 overs (M Rawat 108, R Jonathan 58; S Kaul 5/47, MS Gony 2/43) beat Punjab 105 all out (T Kohli 27 not out, G Khera 23; Ashish Yadav 3/12, K Upadhyay 2/14, Anureet Singh 2/26) by 137 runs.</p>
<p><strong>Pacers run through Services, help Jharkhand advance</strong></p>
<p>Press Trust of India</p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Rahul Shukla grabbed five wickets in an impressive pace bowling display as Jharkhand beat Services by 25 runs to set up a semifinal clash against Ranji champions Karnataka.</span></p>
<p>Shukla (5/61) and fellow pacer Jaskaran Singh (2/22) ran through the Services top order to shoot them out for 189 in 48.4 overs while chasing 215. Services were reduced to a precarious 62 for five at one stage before number seven batsman Soumya Swain (45 from 66 balls; 5&#215;4) and skipper Yashpal Singh (39 from 81 balls) rebuilt the innings before Jharkhand leg-spinner Ashish Yadav broke the 46-run sixth wicket stand by dismissing the latter.</p>
<p>Left-hander Swain and Suraj Yadav (28 from 35 balls; 3&#215;4) threatened to tilt the game in Services’ favour by adding a quickfire 35 runs from 33 balls to take the equation to 71 runs required from 63 balls. It was Shukla the fielder who came into the picture, running out the aggressive Swain to break the seventh wicket partnership. Man-of-the-match Shukla, who was given the extended quota, returned to dismiss the tail en route to his second five-for in List A matches as Services were bundled out for 189 in 48.4 overs.</p>
<p>Earlier, number nine Shukla scored 32 runs from 34 balls with two sixes after Kumar Deobrat (84 from 99 balls; 7&#215;4, 2&#215;6) and Keshav Kumar (41 from 74 balls; 3&#215;4) rescued Jharkhand from a top-order collapse with a 111-run fifth wicket partnership. Jharkhand also had a Services-like start to be reduced to 35 for five with their new ball bowlers Suraj Yadav (4/36) and Shadab Nazar (4/53) blazing all guns.</p>
<p>The task for Jharkhand in the semifinal against the champions will be cut out. Vinay Kumar has been in great form with the ball, and with the wicket supporting seam movement, the Jharkhand batsmen will have to come up with a better show than they did on Wednesday. In the second semifinal, Bengal will take on Railways.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Scores:</strong> Jharkhand: 214 in 48.2 overs (Kumar Deobrat 84, Keshav Kumar 41; Suraj Yadav 4/36, Shadab Nazar 4/53) bt Services 189 in 48.4 overs (Soumya Swain 45; Rahul Shukla 5/61).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2008221&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong></strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">West Indies rallied from a middle-order wobble to romp to a series-clinching five-wicket victory over England in the second Twenty20 International of the three-match series at Kensington Oval in Barbados.

<p>Cruising at 111 for two in the 15th over, the hosts lost three wickets for five runs before captain Darren Sammy belted an unbeaten 30 off just nine deliveries to take his team to 155 for five with seven balls to spare. With an unbeatable 2-0 lead going into the final match on Thursday at the same venue, the World T20 title-holders are looking for a strong finish in the Caribbean before heading off to Bangladesh for the defence of their crown.</p>
<p>“This is all about building towards the T20 World Cup,” said a delighted Sammy. “It’s good that all the guys are firing and when you sit down and plan, then execute on the field, it feels good.”</p>
<p>Handicapped by the absence of regular captain and key bowler Stuart Broad because of injury, England nevertheless proved far more competitive than in the first match on Sunday, although their poor start with the bat and inability to sustain the effort in the field eventually cost them dearly. “I though we were about 15-20 runs short at the end,” stand-in England skipper Eoin Morgan conceded.</p>
<p>They were labouring at 26 for three in the fifth over after Morgan chose to bat first before Buttler joined opening batsman Alex Hales in putting on 76 for the fourth wicket.

West Indies rallied from a middle-order wobble to romp to a series-clinching five-wicket victory over England in the second Twenty20 International of the three-match series at Kensington Oval in Barbados. Jos Buttler’s career-best 67 saw the tourists’ to a total of 152 for seven batting first with left-arm seamer Krishmar Santokie justifying his inclusion in place of injured spinner Sunil Narine by claiming four for 21 to earn the “Man of the Match” award on Tuesday.Cruising at 111 for two in the 15th over, the hosts lost three wickets for five runs before captain Darren Sammy belted an unbeaten 30 off just nine deliveries to take his team to 155 for five with seven balls to spare.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sebastianvettelfileapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007725" alt="SebastianVettelFileAPM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sebastianvettelfileapm.jpg" /></a> Aside from the likelihood of a Red Bull struggle, the pecking order for the Australian Grand Prix is anyone&#8217;s guess (File/AP)
<p>Formula One teams hate uncertainty. Formula One fans love it. At this weekend&#8217;s season-opening Australian Grand Prix, it&#8217;ll be the fans that get what they want.</p>
<p>After four years of an increasingly stultifying dominance by Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel, the only thing most experts agree on when discussing Sunday&#8217;s race at the Albert Park street circuit in Melbourne is that it won&#8217;t be those same blue cars at the front this time.</p>
<p>Aside from the likelihood of a Red Bull struggle, the pecking order for the Australian Grand Prix is anyone&#8217;s guess, with nobody quite sure how the teams will adapt to the switch to V6 turbo hybrid engines. The change of powertrain — engine, turbocharger and increasingly important battery-stored hybrid power — has been problematical for all teams in preseason testing, most notably the Renault-powered teams, and particularly Red Bull.</p>
<p>Throw into the equation the reduction in fuel loads from an average of 160 kilograms (353 pounds) of fuel per race to a maximum of 100 kilograms (220 pounds), add a dash of the usual first-race teething problems and driver rustiness, and then factor in forecasts of rain and Melbourne&#8217;s typical sudden shifts in temperature, and it becomes apparent why some observers are predicting that Sunday&#8217;s race will not even have ten finishers to fill the points positions.</p>
<p>Some have complained that F1&#8242;s rapid-fire regulation changes are becoming increasingly contrived and gimmicky — the double-points for the season&#8217;s last race has outraged the purists — but the sport&#8217;s officials can hardly be blamed for trying to shake up the sport.</p>
<p>Vettel, Red Bull and the team&#8217;s ace designer Adrian Newey are all capable of staging a recovery from the likely slow start and earn a fifth-straight title, but if so, it will definitely not be a cakewalk like last year.</p>
<p>Instead it&#8217;s Mercedes being freely tipped as the team to beat in the early races of the season after impressing in preseason testing, and hopes are high that the German mark can finally win its first-ever constructors&#8217; championship.</p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have been installed as favorites in betting markets for this weekend&#8217;s race, and Red Bull principal Christian Horner was already sounding defeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they were to finish two laps ahead of the opposition in Melbourne, that wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise, based on what we&#8217;ve seen in pre-season testing,&#8221; Horner said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They invested more, they invested earlier. They have got themselves into a good position.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferrari is always a center of attention in any race, but the scrutiny will be further heightened in Melbourne as it is the first race with Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen as teammates. Many seasoned observers have said the team is simply not big enough for the two of them, and Albert Park will be the first skirmish as each tries to establish himself as the top dog.</p>
<p>McLaren is targeting Melbourne as the start of a renaissance after a highly disappointing 2013 that cost team principal Martin Whitmarsh his job. His place will be filled at the management end by Ron Dennis, who returns to trackside after five years in the company&#8217;s management in England, and at the racing end by Eric Boullier, who has decamped from Lotus.</p>
<p>The loss of Boullier and Raikkonen from Lotus reflect the financial struggles of the team after the failure of a proposed takeover, and coupled with the Renault engine&#8217;s myriad problems in testing, it has made Raikkonen&#8217;s victory here last year already seem like another age.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be blunt, we are starting further back than we would like to be,&#8221; technical director Nick Chester said. &#8220;The first two races of this season will be very challenging for us, however it also depends on the solutions that Renault Sport F1 will be able to bring to the table too,&#8221; said Chester.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007719&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has raised question marks over the captaincy of Misbah-ul-Haq and said the PCB needs to appoint a brave and aggressive skipper for the 2015 World Cup.</p>
<p>The former seamer told reporters that while there was no question about Misbah-ul-Haq&#8217;s batting performances, the situation was not the same about his captaincy.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are question marks about his captaincy,&#8221; he said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Asked about the possibility of PCB appointing Shahid Afridi as captain for next World Cup, Wasim said this was something for the board to ponder and decide.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I would say is that we need to have a brave and aggressive captain for the World Cup. Because we need to play positive cricket to do well,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Wasim said Pakistan had adopted the wrong approach for the Asia Cup final where it was defeated by Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought the decision to bat first was not correct, we should have stuck with our winning formula throughout the tournament.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that Pakistan had failed to play proper positive cricket in the final and the result was a loss.</p>
<p>Talking about the forthcoming World T20 Cup in Bangladesh, Wasim termed Pakistan, India and West Indies as hot contenders to win the title.</p>
<p>&#8220;These three teams in my mind are favorites to win the title. Pakistan has a very good T20 squad but we need to play to our strength which is with aggression and positively.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also advised the team management to use the pace bowlers properly, pointing out that Junaid Khan was being under used.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my mind Junaid is your best bowler right now and he needs to be given his full quota of overs in any form of the game,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007695&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pd.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2008215" alt="The second half has been tentatively kept in Bangladesh but could be held in India if the BCCI manages to get the government's clearance. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pd.jpg" /></a> The second half has been tentatively kept in Bangladesh but could be held in India if the BCCI manages to get the government&#8217;s clearance (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Having played surrogate hosts to Pakistan’s ‘home’ matches over the last few years, the UAE is now all set to welcome the seventh edition of the IPL to its shores. The desert nation was chosen as the venue for the first phase of the T20 extravaganza—to be held from April 16 to April 30 —with 16 matches scheduled to be held there before the action shifts closer home.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">It was confirmed that the third and final phase, which includes the knockout stages of the tournament, will be held in India with the final scheduled for June 1 in Mumbai.</span></p>
<p>The BCCI though have kept Bangladesh as a stand-by option for the second phase of IPL 7—from May 1 to May 12—if they fail to convince the Home Ministry of providing the tournament with the necessary security. The BCCI press release though didn’t carry a detailed itinerary with the exact dates and venues to be decided in the coming days.</p>
<p>The announcement comes on the back of incessant speculation over the last two weeks regarding where the IPL would be headed this year. Just like it had five years ago, the issue had arisen due to the tournament clashing with the general elections in the country, scheduled to be held between April 7 and May 12. Back in 2009, the then IPL chairman Lalit Modi had shifted the entire tournament to South Africa.</p>
<p>This time around, however, the BCCI officials had repeatedly insisted that they were keen on hosting at least 70 per cent of the matches in India itself. Though the elections will still be on when the first phase concludes in the UAE, seven out of the nine phases would have been complete by the first week of May. And the board is confident of making a headway in their negotiations with the Home Ministry with one official telling the The Indian Express that the decision will now be taken by the state governments.</p>
<p>“We’re still hopeful of having all the May matches here in India. The only two phases of the election that will be left then will be in Uttar Pradesh, which is anyway not among the original IPL venues. The home ministry has said that if the state governments give the go-ahead they have no issue, because it’s they who have to deploy the security,” he said.</p>
<p>“We have only kept Bangladesh more as a back-up in case it doesn’t work out. But the business end of the tournament will be held in India, which is great,” he added.</p>
<p>While South Africa had emerged as a front-runner it lost out eventually with the BCCI opting to keep the tournament closer to the sub-continent. The official indicated that the similarity between the conditions, both in terms of weather and wickets, was what went in the favour of the UAE.</p>
<p>Bangladesh was ruled out as an option for the first phase as it would just have completed a hectic month of playing host to the Asia Cup followed by the World T20. At the same time, both the franchises as well as the sponsors are said to have been pleased with the move to the UAE.</p>
<p>“The conditions in the UAE are similar to India. And the franchises also thought that the proximity was essential. They wouldn’t have to travel that far. If it wasn’t just 16 matches, we would have considered South Africa. Moreover, all parties are delighted with the market for cricket in the UAE, which hosted the U-19 World Cup as well as the connectivity between the grounds there,” the official explained.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007626&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajanthamendisapgm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007621" alt="Ajantha Mendis is very effective when it comes to the shortest format of the game (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajanthamendisapgm.jpg" /></a> Ajantha Mendis is very effective when it comes to the shortest format of the game (AP)
<p>It seems Sri Lankan spinner Ajantha Mendis will be the player to watch out for in the upcoming edition of the ICC World T20 to be held in Bangladesh. When analysed over three parameters &#8211; economy rate, strike rate and wickets &#8211; Mendis is well ahead of the likes of Sunil Narine, Lasith Malinga and Dale Steyn. <strong><a href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/sports-gallery/icc-world-t20-bowlers-to-watch-out-for/#mohammadhafeezapg" target="_blank">(PHOTOS: Bowlers to watch out for in ICC World T20)</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Economy rate</strong></p>
<p>There is a lot of rush around the 6 runs per over mark here. While Sunil Narine is the most economical bowler of the lot, Lasith Malinga&#8217;s 7.37 runs per over is the most expensive.</p>
<iframe style="border: none;" src="//e.infogr.am/economy-rate-2042" height="661" width="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<div style="width:550px;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center;"><a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am/economy-rate-2042" target="_blank">Economy rate</a> | <a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am" target="_blank">Create Infographics</a></div>
<p><strong>2) Strike rate</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Now what do we mean by strike rate? </strong></em></p>
<p>Strike rate means the average number of balls bowled per wicket taken. Lower the strike rate, the better it is.</p>
<p>Here, Ajantha Mendis beats the lot by some distance. A brilliant strike rate of 13.2 gives him edge over Sunil Narine, who was the most economical bowler. Don&#8217;t even look at Ravindra Jadeja&#8217;s numbers here. His 37.2 is more than double of his competitors.</p>
<iframe style="border: none;" src="//e.infogr.am/chart-83717981143" height="661" width="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
<div style="width:550px;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center;"><a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am/chart-83717981143" target="_blank">Strike Rate</a> | <a style="color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;" href="//infogr.am" target="_blank">Create Infographics</a></div>
<p><strong>3) Wickets per match</strong></p>
<p>The business end. Number of wickets taken every match. While T20 is a game of only 20 overs a side, wickets still hold the key. It was 1-1 for Mendis and Narine, but Mendis towers over him and the rest in the final parameter. His 1.72 wickets per match is well ahead of Dale Steyn&#8217;s 1.39 &#8211; the second best in the list.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/novakdjokovicapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007378" alt="Novak Djokovic's next opponent is the big-serving Croatian Marin Cilic (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/novakdjokovicapm.jpg" /></a> Novak Djokovic&#8217;s next opponent is the big-serving Croatian Marin Cilic (AP)
<p>Normal service resumed at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells on Tuesday when Novak Djokovic safely booked his place in the fourth round of the men&#8217;s draw and Li Na moved into the women&#8217;s quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Djokovic had a little hiccup when he dropped the second set of his match with Colombia&#8217;s Alejandro Gonzalez but was otherwise untroubled in winning 6-1 3-6 6-1.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I played really well from the start,&#8221; said Djokovic, a two-time champion at Indian Wells.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then suddenly I just had a big loss of concentration and allowed him to win the second set for no reason. I bounced back better in the third.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the Serbian was not at his best, Djokovic did at least survive to fight another day in the Californian desert after the shock losses of world number one Rafa Nadal and Maria Sharapova on Monday.</p>
<p>Djokovic&#8217;s next opponent is the big-serving Croatian Marin Cilic, who recorded his 20th win this season with a 6-4 6-3 over Spain&#8217;s Tommy Robredo.</p>
<p>&#8220;I obviously cannot allow myself to have these particular concentration lapses in the match at this level especially in the next match when I&#8217;m playing Cilic, a guy who is in really good form and I think has gotten better in last couple of months working with (Goran) Ivanisevic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Li, promoted to the women&#8217;s top seed after winning the Australian Open and in the absence of Serena Williams, beat Canada&#8217;s Aleksandra Wozniak 6-1 6-4 but only after a extraordinary final game where she struggled to close out the match.</p>
<p>Li raced through the opening set in just over half an hour then recovered from 3-0 down to serve for the match at 5-4 when she suddenly got the wobbles.</p>
<p>The final game lasted 20 minutes as Li squandered 10 match points and took her tally of double-faults for the match to nine before she finally sealed the win.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only can say: Welcome to the crazy women&#8217;s tennis tour,&#8221; she told the crowd in a courtside interview.</p>
<p>While Robredo lost to the towering Cilic, three of his compatriots all advanced with Fernando Verdasco upsetting world number nine Richard Gasquet of France 7-6 (7-5) 6-1 to leave Djokovic as the only top-10 player left in the bottom half of the men&#8217;s draw.</p>
<p>Roberto Bautista Agut held his nerve to beat Finland&#8217;s Jarkko Nieminen 6-2 4-6 7-6 (8-6) to move on before Feliciano Lopez joined the Spanish Armada with a 1-6 6-3 6-4 defeat of Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>In the women&#8217;s draw, Serbia&#8217;s Jelena Jankovic ended her five-match losing streak to Denmark&#8217;s Carolina Wozniacki when she reeled off 10 consecutive games to win 6-3 6-1 and advance to the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>&#8220;At 3-1, I kind of found my way, found my rhythm, and I was striking the ball very well out there and took control of the points,&#8221; said Jankovic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just did not let her play what she plays. That was very important. So I was pretty pleased with the way I played and how composed I stayed throughout the whole match.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poland&#8217;s Agnieszka Radwanska, the second seed, breezed past Alize Cornet of France 7-5 6-3 while Slovakia&#8217;s Dominika Cibulkova brushed aside the challenge of Petra Kvitova, beating the Czech 6-3 6-2.</p>
<p>Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi came back to Earth with a thud when she was thrashed 6-2 6-1 by compatriot Flavia Pennetta less than 24 hours after she stunned Sharapova.</p>
<p>Romania&#8217;s Simona Halep qualified for the last eight with a hard-fought 6-2 1-6 6-4 win over Canada&#8217;s Eugenie Bouchard after trailling 4-3 in the deciding set.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t my best tennis today, but I was fighting a lot,&#8221; said Halep, ranked seventh in the world. &#8220;I did well. I think I came back in the third set very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Halep&#8217;s next match will be against Australian qualifier Casey Dellacqua, who got a walkover to the quarter-finals after her American Lauren Davis retired with gastrointestinal illness.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007374&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/darrensammyapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007336" alt="Darren Sammy slammed an unbeaten 30 off nine balls to power West Indies home (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/darrensammyapm.jpg" /></a> Darren Sammy slammed an unbeaten 30 off nine balls to power West Indies home (AP)
<p>Medium-pacer Krishmar Santokie claimed 4-21 to limit England and captain Darren Sammy slammed an unbeaten 30 off nine balls to power West Indies home by five wickets in the second Twenty20 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The West Indies took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series with the final match on Thursday, also at Kensington Oval.</p>
<p>Santokie, in only his fourth T20, helped to restrict England to 152-7 off 20 overs after the visitors won the toss.</p>
<p>Jos Buttler top-scored with 67 off 43 balls to lift England from the early damage of 26-3 after five overs.</p>
<p>Opener Alex Hales contributed 40 off 36 deliveries.</p>
<p>The West Indies got a flying start to the run chase as Dwayne Smith slammed three sixes and two fours in 30 off 16 balls and his opening partner Chris Gayle hit 36 off 30 deliveries.</p>
<p>The home side slipped up in mid-inning when Tim Bresnan got two wickets in two balls &#8211; Marlon Samuels for 28 and Andre Russell for 2.</p>
<p>But the England comeback was short-lived as Sammy slammed three sixes and two fours to dominate a sixth-wicket stand of 39 off 15 balls to see his side home at 155-5 with seven balls to spare.</p>
<p>Earlier, Santokie ripped through England&#8217;s top order by claiming Michael Lumb (4) and Moeen Ali (5) to plumb lbw decisions. Lumb missed a full toss and Ali, on debut, misread a slower ball.</p>
<p>When legspinner Samuel Badree got captain Eoin Morgan (3) to a catch at deep backward square leg, England was tottering at 26-3.</p>
<p>Buttler and Hales revived the innings in a fourth-wicket stand of 76 off 53 balls either side of a short rain delay.</p>
<p>Buttler, who hit five fours and three sixes, eventually top-edged to backward point off Santokie, who also got Ravi Bopara to a catch at long off.</p>
<p>There were also two wickets for Dwayne Bravo.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007331&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bayern Munich, a shadow of the team that have been so imperious in the Bundesliga this season, survived a shaky second half and missed a late penalty against Arsenal on Tuesday to reach the Champions League quarter-finals.</p>
<p>The holders looked less than all-conquering in a 1-1 second-leg draw against Arsenal who were left with too much to do after losing 2-0 at home in the opening match of the last-16 encounter.</p>
<p>Runaway leaders Bayern have dropped only four points all season in the Bundesliga, and blasted 15 goals in their previous three games, but were well below their best against the Londoners at the Allianz Arena.</p>
<p>Bastian Schweinsteiger broke the deadlock in the 55th minute before Bayern old boy Lukas Podolski replied almost immediately for Arsenal who grew in confidence and brought out goalkeeper Manuel Neuer&#8217;s eccentric side.</p>
<p>The Bavarians won a controversial penalty when Arjen Robben reacted theatrically to a foul by Laurent Koscielny in stoppage time and Thomas Mueller&#8217;s spot kick was superbly stopped by keeper Lukasz Fabianski, ending a run of 13 straight wins in all competitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to defend a lot in the first half but we knew that by being in the game at halftime we stood a good chance to win and I believe in the second half the opportunities were there,&#8221; said manager Arsene Wenger after Arsenal&#8217;s fourth successive last-16 exit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We never got them really under pressure, they suddenly became nervous but because we never managed to make it 2-1 you could not see how they would have responded,&#8221; the Frenchman told reporters.</p>
<p>Arsenal lost to the Germans on away goals at the same stage last season despite winning 2-0 in Munich.</p>
<p>Coach Pep Guardiola said on Tuesday that the lead Bayern held from the first leg prevented his team from going all out on the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a lot of control but the opponents didn&#8217;t push and in the head of the players we were already 2-0 ahead,&#8221; the Spaniard explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not always going to score lots of goals. This was a top-level team we were facing.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Resilient defence </strong></p>
<p>Bayern spent most of the first half probing a resilient Arsenal defence that just about managed to hold out.</p>
<p>It was touch and go for Wenger&#8217;s men especially when Franck Ribery was free down the left and sent the ball into the middle where Robben failed to connect properly.</p>
<p>Javi Martinez&#8217;s goal was disallowed for offside in the 26th minute and Robben had two dangerous efforts cut out by Arsenal defenders as Bayern tried to turn the screw.</p>
<p>Fabianski came to the rescue when he got down to save Mario Goetze&#8217;s low shot seconds before the break.</p>
<p>Bayern finally broke through 10 minutes after the restart when Ribery sneaked into the area and laid the ball off for Schweinsteiger  to finish from eight metres.</p>
<p>The home fans were stunned two minutes later when the referee allowed play to continue even though Podolski seemed to push Philipp Lahm in the box and the Arsenal forward slammed the ball into the roof of the net.</p>
<p>Neuer then had to come out of his box to head the ball clear after Tomas Rosicky tried to send Olivier Giroud clean through.</p>
<p>The Germany keeper had the Bayern fans on edge again when he sent a clearance straight to Giroud but the Bundesliga leaders quickly regrouped.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2007306&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shikhardhawaniem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007221" alt="Shikhar Dhawan made only 76 runs in four innings in South Africa (IE Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shikhardhawaniem.jpg" /></a> Shikhar Dhawan made only 76 runs in four innings in South Africa (IE Photo)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Opener Shikhar Dhawan has said that he learnt from his failure during the Test series in South Africa, which proved to be a stepping stone to his success in New Zealand. Dhawan made 215 runs in four innings in New Zealand but had made just 76 in South Africa in the same number of innings. </span></p>
<p>“From South Africa, when I didn’t score that much, I analyzed my game that as a batsman, or as an opener, what shots I have to play at the start or what shots I shouldn’t play,” Dhawan told cricinfo.com. “Every pitch is different. We were playing in India a lot that time. Then when I went there (South Africa), it was a setback. I wouldn’t say a failure, but the setback helped me a lot to become a more mature player,” Dhawan added.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old said that he realised that he needs to start leaving the bouncers rather than trying to have a go at the short ball.</p>
<p>“Then I realised, ‘Okay on these kinds of tracks I need to play these kind of shots. And I have to leave bouncers (alone) at the start because the bounce is different, and it is hard to keep the ball down.’ That’s what I did and brought those things into my practice. When I went to New Zealand that practice became my instinct, and that’s how I scored big runs there.”</p>
<p>It has been nearly a year since Dhawan made his Test debut by hitting 187 against Australia at Mohali. Talking about the March of 2013, Dhawan said: “One year is over already. It went so quickly. Good time always flies really fast. I celebrated on my own, the first anniversary with the Indian team. It’s a great feeling. We won so many series, and of course we saw a bit of down time too.</p>
<p>“But that’s how it is. You see ups and downs both. It is a beautiful journey. I had a bit of a lean patch too. That lean patch made me stronger, and made me realise the areas I had to improve on. Made me a more mature player. That’s the best thing. It is a beautiful thing that I scored a lot of centuries and half-centuries.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006936&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cheteshwarpujarafilem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007205" alt="Cheteshwar Pujara has only played two ODIs and warmed the bench during the Asia Cup (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cheteshwarpujarafilem.jpg" /></a> Cheteshwar Pujara has only played two ODIs and warmed the bench during the Asia Cup (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Cheteshwar Pujara running in a few paces and rolling his arm over at net sessions isn’t a new sight. But the intensity of the exercise certainly has picked up of late. Nowadays, it’s not just about getting some warm-up before batting practice. Pujara, in fact, is polishing his bowling skills in a bid to bring more to the table in the shorter formats of the game. </span></p>
<p>“I’m bowling more in the nets as I want to contribute to the team’s cause more. I want to help my team with my part-time bowling if the captain wants me to,” he said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I am also looking to bring other improvements in my game, most important playing on the rise. It will help me in the longer run,” Pujara added.</p>
<p>These skills, he expects, will help him in the upcoming IPL. And a good show with the Kings XI Punjab, who bought him for rs 1.9 crore, may boost his ODI career.</p>
<p>“If I can prove myself in the IPL, I am confident that I can get success in ODIs too. I had played a couple of good innings for my last franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore which proved that I have the talent to excel in the shortest format also. It’s all about getting more opportunities in the coming future. I am looking forward to have a successful IPL,” the middle-order batsman said.</p>
<p>Pujara has only played two ODIs and warmed the bench during the Asia Cup, a move that attracted widespread criticism. “It’s all about getting more and more opportunities. I have the ability to perform in all three formats of the game,” he said.</p>
<p>While he has been typecast as a ‘Test’ batsman, Pujara says will challenge this assertion during the IPL. “It’s a perception. I have a good ODI domestic record. I have scored runs at an impressive strike rate in domestic matches. So, I don’t think it would be a problem for me adjusting to the T20 format,” he said.</p>
<p>“In Twenty20, people expect big shots from you. I need to be aggressive from the first ball. I have to take my chances. I have started my preparation and the good part is there’s still a month left before the tournament gets underway,” he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006934&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/zaheerkhaniem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007228" alt="Zaheer Khan's fielding is a liability for the team, says Prasad (IE Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/zaheerkhaniem.jpg" /></a> Zaheer Khan&#8217;s fielding is a liability for the team, says Prasad (IE Photo)
<p><em>Former India pacer and bowling coach of the Indian team that won the inaugural World T20 in 2007, Venkatesh Prasad, considers Dhoni and Co. as a major title contender in the upcoming edition of the event in Bangladesh. In an interaction with The Indian Express, Prasad spoke about India’s medium pacers and said it was time to help Zaheer Khan make a decision about his future. Excerpts:</em></p>
<p><strong>On Zaheer</strong></p>
<p>If you look at his technique, the seam position is fantastic. I wish all bowlers had that near-perfect seam position like him. I have seen him struggle in the second spell in the longer formats of the game, his fielding is a liability for the team and he is not much of a batsman. He is outstanding in his initial spell but later on he struggles a bit, and that’s obviously due to the age factor, wear and tear and the injuries he has gone through in the span of 14 cricketing years. He debuted when I was part of the team in 2000 ICC Champions Trophy in Nairobi. We need to give him credit and help him in the decision (regarding his future).</p>
<p><strong>On India’s bowling Attack</strong></p>
<p>The bowlers have a good thought process, but the execution under pressure is what matters. They need to create more situations by challenging the batsmen. Varying pace in this format is important and so is the length. They need to be more consistent in the death overs, bowl more yorkers and use the slower one. They need to train in an environment where you are constantly trying variations.</p>
<p><strong>On Shami</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>He is a fantastic bowler and a great find. We need to handle him with care, which does not mean wrap him up in cotton and wool but rather manage his training and bowling schedules. He needs to be playing a lot of cricket at this point of time. This is his age to play cricket, no point giving him a rest.</p>
<p><strong>On Kumar</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>He is a great prospect for the team. It’s important to give him confidence. He has this great ability to swing the bowl both ways and that’s his strength. We need to emphasise more on his strengths rather than pointing out his mistakes. Nobody is a complete player. We need to work on those strengths that he has got as a bowler.</p>
<p><strong>India’s World T20 prospects</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>T20 format is all about good and intelligent cricket. It’s not just about hitting the boundaries but you need to build the innings. We have the batting depth and some young good bowlers. We did it in 2007 with a fairly young side, and that too in South Africa. In the Asia Cup, we did struggle but going into the World T20, we have a better understanding of the conditions, pitches, venues and weather in Bangladesh, so it might help.</p>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mohammedshamiptim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007201" alt="Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Mohammed Shami celebrate a wicket (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mohammedshamiptim.jpg" /></a> Laxmi Ratan Shukla and Mohammed Shami celebrate a wicket (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Mohammed Shami came onto bowl after Ashok Dinda had finished his first over. The India discard, Dinda, straightaway hit a perfect length and making the ball move away from the right-hander.</span></p>
<p>Shami took time to find his rhythm. Shami’s first over was not very impressive. He bowled a couple of feet short. There was no stand-out delivery.</p>
<p>But Shami’s plus point is that he can produce a wicket-taking delivery out of no where, and on an Eden Gardens green-top, his pace was always going to trouble the Tamil Nadu batters.</p>
<p>Bengal were defending a paltry total and Shami didn’t have much time to settle down. He took two overs to get his first wicket — a peach of an inswinger, which trapped Baba Aparajith in front. The delivery was too sharp for the young Tamil Nadu No.3, who was beaten for pace. A wicket under his belt, Shami became almost unplayable. Ravichandran Ashwin offered no stroke to another inswinger that was pitched well outside the off stump. But little did Ashwin realise that the delivery would cut back off the surface.</p>
<p>S Badrinath was outclassed by an off-cutter. Shami had rocked Tamil Nadu by the time he was done with his first spell of six overs. About 2,500 fans, who were in attendance, gave him a standing ovation. Shami took one more wicket in his second spell to finish with four for 25 in 8.5 overs.</p>
<p>Shami has been playing non-stop since making his Test debut in November and towards the end of the Asia Cup, the 24-year-old seemed jaded. However, he said that he preferred to play after a short break rather than rest. “I returned from the Asia Cup five days ago and thought that playing this game would help me stay match-fit. I’m someone who stays fit with regular game-time, rather than taking rest. I tend to get lazy when I take rest,” Shami said.</p>
<p>Shami is leaving for Bangladesh with his India teammates on Friday. The job there would be a lot tougher than running through the Tamil Nadu top and middle-order.</p>
<p>“I always bowl my heart out. I always try to improve. It’s important to bowl well as a unit. It’s important to complement each other. I and (Ashok) Dinda supported each other very well in this match.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006910&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ashokdindam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007192" alt="Bengal's Ashok Dinda took three wickets for 13 runs in the quarterfinal match against Tamil Nadu on Tuesday (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ashokdindam.jpg" /></a> Bengal&#8217;s Ashok Dinda took three wickets for 13 runs in the quarterfinal match against Tamil Nadu on Tuesday (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Up against one of the most experienced batting line-ups of the tournament, and with only 167 runs to defend, Bengal looked out of the Vijay Hazare trophy at the half-way stage of their quarterfinal match against Tamil Nadu at the Eden Gardens on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>But it wasn’t over yet. Thirteen overs into the second innings, their fast bowlers, Mohammed Shami and Ashok Dinda, had turned the game on its head, leaving Tamil Nadu reeling at 25 for five. It was all but over now.</p>
<p>Tamil Nadu were eventually bowled out for 90 in 33.5 overs and Bengal secured a berth in the semifinal, where they await the winners of the Punjab versus Railways match.</p>
<p>Dinda started the rout with a fantastic outswinger that saw Anirudha Srikkanth poke at it and offer a sharp catch to Sudip Chatterjee at second slip. Another outswinger got rid of the IPL million-dollar man Dinesh Karthik, who was caught behind. In between, Shami spat venom and made the Tamil Nadu batters hop and jump with his incoming deliveries. Baba Aparajith was beaten for pace and was trapped plumb in front.</p>
<p>Ravichandran Ashwin offered no stroke to an in-cutter and was adjudged leg before. Tamil Nadu captain Subramaniam Badrinath mis-timed an on-side flick to give a return catch to Shami. Soon after the fast bowler was taken out of the attack and his first spell read: 6-0-13-3. Dinda complemented him very well with the figures of 7-3-12-2. Both Shami and Dinda later returned to take one more wicket each.</p>
<p>Only Murali Vijay resisted the duo a bit at what were extremely seamer-friendly conditions, but he got no help from the other end. And after playing 85 balls for 24 runs, Vijay too lost patience and top-edged a pull of Veer Pratap Singh to deep fine leg where Sayan Sekhar Mondal latched on to a difficult catch.</p>
<p>After the opener’s wicket, only formalities remained.</p>
<p>Earlier, Bengal won the toss and chose to bat first but suffered a collapse against Yo Mahesh. The Tamil Nadu medium pacer bowled a perfect length and moved the ball both ways and was rewarded with four wickets. Other bowlers also supported him well.</p>
<p>Bengal batting lacked the will to fight out the tough conditions. Saurasish Lahiri (32) and Dinda (21 not out), however, added vital runs towards the end.</p>
<p>Manoj Tiwary looked pretty organised in his first national-level match after a seven-month injury lay-off. The six over long-on off Ashwin was contemptuous. But Mahesh snuck one through his defence and Tiwary was out after a 33-ball 25.</p>
<p>His two wickets notwithstanding, Ashwin didn’t look convincing. He bowled just one over in his first spell and gave away 11 runs. The offie was brought back only after the Bengal top order was gone. Still, there was more than a hint of concern the way Dinda smashed him for fours at the death.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Bengal 167 all out in 42.1 overs (S Lahiri 32, M Tiwary 25; Yo Mahesh 4/23, Rahil Shah 2/18) beat Tamil Nadu 90 all out in 33.5 overs (M Vijay 24, M Mohammed 14; Mohammed Shami 4/25, A Dinda 3/13) by 77 runs</p>
<p><strong>Uthappa, Nair hit tons</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kolkata:</strong> Robin Uthappa and Karun Nair hit individual centuries to lead Karnataka’s recovery before skipper Vinay Kumar grabbed a five-wicket haul to guide the the Ranji Trophy champions to a 27-run win over Gujarat in their quarterfinal match on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Vinay Kumar returned figures of five for 85 in his 12 overs to dismiss Gujarat for 274 in 48.2 overs. Karnataka had scored 301 for seven in 50 overs after being invited to bat at the Jadavpur University Complex ground. Karnataka were struggling at 31/4 in the eighth over before opener Uthappa (132 not out) and Nair (120) put up a marvellous batting effort and stitched a 209-run partnership. Uthappa faced 135 balls and hit 10 fours and three sixes, while youngster Nair hit 14 boundaries and a six in his 121-ball knock, which turned out to be his maiden List A century.</p>
<p>The duo consolidated the partnership after Jasprit Bumrah (4/58) and Kamlesh Thakor (2/57) claimed two wickets apiece to rattle Karnataka. Bumrah and Thakor removed top-order batsmen — Mayank Aggarwal (0), Manish Pandey (8), Ganesh Satish (0) and K L Rahul (0).</p>
<p>Karnataka will face the winners of Services and Jharkhand in the semifinals. <strong><em>(Press Trust of India) </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Brief Scores:</strong> Karnataka 301 for seven in 50 overs (Robin Uthappa 132 not out, Karun Nair 120; Jasprit Bumrah 4/58) beat Gujarat 274 in 48.2 overs (Akshar Patel 93, Rujul Bhatt 67; R Vinay Kumar 5/85, Abhimanyu Mithun 3/51) by 27 runs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006893&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arsenalm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007245" alt="Chelsea were the only English club to score in the first leg of the CL last-16 as Arsenal, City and United all lost 2-0 (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arsenalm.jpg" /></a> Chelsea were the only English club to score in the first leg of the CL last-16 as Arsenal, City and United all lost 2-0 (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A year ago, there was continual consternation among a large cross-section of English soccer fans. For the first time since 1996, no English teams had advanced past the Round of 16 in the European Champions League, a reality that irritated and embarrassed the country’s passionate followers. Probing questions were asked. Strong opinions were offered.</span></p>
<p>As winter turns to spring again, it seems very little has changed. With the Champions League nearing the end of its first knockout stage, the story line is bleakly familiar for the British: Spain and Germany again are dominant, and the requisite hand-wringing is all but sure to follow.</p>
<p>In many ways, it has already begun. Arsenal and Manchester City play the second legs of their two-game series against Bayern Munich and Barcelona this week. Both teams lost the first legs, at home, by 2-0. The prospects for either club to overturn the deficit are slim.</p>
<p>Next week, Manchester United will play its second leg against Olympiakos. United, which is staggering through an ugly season under its first-year manager, David Moyes, was stunned by the Greeks, 2-0, last month in Piraeus. Barring a stirring comeback, Old Trafford figures to have what is fast becoming its customary funereal feel, too. Already, there have been dire predictions among the country’s news and social media.</p>
<p>Chelsea, the final English team involved in Europe’s top club competition, is in much better shape by comparison; it actually scored in its first leg against Turkey’s Galatasaray, and enters the second leg at home with a 1-1 record. The Blues’ situation, which still might be described as delicate, is what amounts to hope these days around London.</p>
<p>Reactions to the so-called European slide in England generally seem to fall into one of two categories.</p>
<p>Some say that the overall quality of play from English clubs has declined; that despite the riches of the Premier League and its reach, the level of play, particularly when it comes to style and scoring, has not kept up with tactical advances in leagues on the continent.</p>
<p>Roy Keane, a former star for Manchester United and now a television commentator, was outspoken in calling the notion that the Premier League was still the creme de la creme outlandish. Fans, he said on ITV, have been “brainwashed” into thinking the Premier League is the best in the world, and the recent results against Europe’s best are proof of it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some not only disagree with Keane but also assert the opposite.</p>
<p><strong>Depth hurting clubs</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In reality, they say, English clubs are hurt by the depth of the Premier League, in which teams at the bottom of the standings regularly challenge the best clubs. This parity, the theory goes, makes it even more challenging for English teams playing in Europe to be at their best for the midweek games, too.</p>
<p>Arsene Wenger, the Arsenal manager, is among those with this view.</p>
<p>“It is the most level league,” he said recently. “Spain was a good league as well. But this season, I think, the English league is the most difficult. Maybe as well we pay a little bit the price.”</p>
<p>There is no disputing that the gaps between the best and worst teams in England are tighter than in other top European leagues. Through 24 games, Bayern Munich is 20 points ahead of second-place Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga; Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid are separated by 4 points total and are 12 points ahead of the next-closest pursuer in La Liga; Juventus is 14 points beyond Roma, 17 ahead of Napoli in Serie A.</p>
<p>The top nine teams in England are separated by 24 points and the top five by 13. Chelsea leads with 66; Liverpool and Arsenal have 59; Manchester City, which may be in the best position to catch Chelsea, has 57, but has played three fewer games.</p>
<p>The Premier League’s global popularity also means that marquee games are often moved to accommodate television broadcasts, often with no regard for the team’s coming schedule.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/barcelonaapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007251" alt="FC Barcelona’s Ibrahim Afellay, Alex Song, Daniel Alves, Neymar and Xavi Hernandez at a training session before the second-leg of their last-16 Champions League match (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/barcelonaapm.jpg" /></a> FC Barcelona’s Ibrahim Afellay, Alex Song, Daniel Alves, Neymar and Xavi Hernandez at a training session before the second-leg of their last-16 Champions League match (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Sergio Aguero has a proven scoring record against Barcelona and the Manchester City forward may have a crucial role to play if his side are to upset the odds and reach the Champions League quarterfinals for the first time.</span></p>
<p>City trail 2-0 ahead of Wednesday’s last-16 second-leg at the Nou Camp, a Lionel Messi penalty and a late Daniel Alves goal in Manchester last month putting the Spanish champions on the brink of their seventh consecutive appearance in the last eight of Europe’s elite club competition.</p>
<p>Aguero, who missed the first leg through injury but returned for City’s English Capital One (League) Cup final victory on March 2, scored five goals in 10 La Liga games against Barca for Atletico Madrid between 2006 and 2011.</p>
<p>They included a dramatic winner, his second of the match, in a 4-3 success at the Calderon in the 2008-09 season that prompted the kind of wild celebrations he unleashed with the goal that sealed the Premier League title for City in 2012.</p>
<p>The player, known as “Kun” after a Japanese cartoon character, also netted a double in the same La Liga fixture a year earlier, a 4-2 win for Atletico.</p>
<p>He has never tasted victory at the Nou Camp though in six visits but did score in a 1-1 draw in 2006-07.</p>
<p>“As always in important games the individual performance of players is key,” City coach Manuel Pellegrini, who has labelled Aguero the third best player in the world behind his Argentina team mate Messi and Portugal forward Cristiano Ronaldo, said on the club’s website (www.mcfc.co.uk) on Monday.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s difficult,” added the Chilean. “But I don’t have any doubt that we are going to Barcelona thinking that we can do it, that we can beat them in Camp Nou and we will try to have our revenge there.”</p>
<p><strong>Squaring off with history</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Pellegrini also has experience of Barca’s daunting arena, Europe’s biggest stadium. He faced them 22 times during his La Liga coaching career but only managed four victories, most recently a 2-1 win for Villarreal at the Nou Camp in March 2008. He lost both “Clasicos” against Barca as Real coach in the 2009-10 season, 1-0 away and 2-0 at home.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult because they are a very good team with great players and that’s the most important thing,” Pellegrini said. “We will try to get the tempo we need to score goals. If we can score a goal early Barcelona may be more nervous.</p>
<p>Pellegrini’s players will take heart from a fine performance in Germany in their last European away game when they came from two goals down to beat Group D rivals and defending champions Bayern Munich 3-2 with both teams already through to the last 16.</p>
<p><strong>History is against them, however.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Only twice in Champions League history has a team recovered from a first-leg defeat at home to go through, Ajax Amsterdam achieving the feat in 1995-96 and Inter Milan following suit in 2010-11.</p>
<p>Both City and Barca are coming into the match after surprise defeats, Barca going down at lowly Real Valladolid and slipping to third in La Liga and City losing to second tier Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup quarter-finals.</p>
<p>“It was a strange game (at Valladolid), but we have to put it behind us now and not feel sorry for ourselves,” Barca’s Chile forward Alexis Sanchez said on Monday. “We have to be positive because we have an important game ahead.”</p>
<p><strong>LAST TANGO IN PARIS</strong></p>
<p><strong>PARIS:</strong> Bayer Leverkusen will resist the option of fielding a second-string team despite taking an almost insurmountable 4-0 deficit to Paris St Germain on Wednesday for their Champions League last-16 second-leg.</p>
<p>“We cannot just throw this game away because otherwise we can go ahead and send the Under-23 team,” Leverkusen coach Sami Hyypia told reporters. “I am really looking forward to the game and every player should feel the same.”</p>
<p>The former Liverpool defender’s team have been struggling since the winter break, a German Cup exit to second division Kaiserslautern last month followed by three straight Bundesliga defeats.</p>
<p>Leverkusen are without midfielder Jens Hegeler who tore ankle ligaments in the 1-1 draw against Hanover 96 on Saturday and is out for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>PSG have been in rampant form since their first-leg rout, netting nine goals in three Ligue 1 outings.</p>
<p><strong>Up against IBRA</strong></p>
<p>Laurent Blanc’s side have won their last five matches in all competitions. Led by talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic, they have scored 16 goals and conceded twice.</p>
<p>The Sweden striker already has 38 goals in all competitions this season — more than one-third of PSG’s tally (102).</p>
<p>“We have many alternatives. When one player goes out, another comes in and it’s still the same rhythm, the same quality, and that is what a big team is about,” said Ibrahimovic.</p>
<p>PSG will have striker Edinson Cavani back after he spent time in Uruguay dealing with a personal issue.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006880&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Down 0-1, Advani shifted gears and made a 51-break in the second frame to draw parity. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006877&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Eight-time world champion Pankaj Advani overcame a stiff challenge before prevailing over World No.25 Xiao Guodong in the first round of the Haikou World Open in China. </span></p>
<p>The Chinese played in front of a home crowd that was keen to see him come through but were sportingly appreciative of a dynamic display of snooker by the Indian pro in a close contest held in the Hainan province capital. The recently crowned Indian snooker champion was at sea in the first frame, struggling to adjust to the conditions that were contrasting in nature to that of the Indian National Championship conducted in Lucknow last week.</p>
<p>Down 0-1, Advani shifted gears and made a 51-break in the second frame to draw parity. The third frame was unusual by nature as it ended in the Indian’s favour even though he was trailing by over 20 points. Guodong made a break of 62.</p>
<p><strong>Fouls-and-misses </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>While Advani was fighting back, the Chinese made three consecutive fouls-and-misses. According to professional snooker rules, that amounts to a frame being awarded to the opponent. The rare misfortune for the Chinese presented Advani with a 3-1 lead before the former fought back with a 70 to make it 3-2.</p>
<p>Advani clinched the sixth frame and was close to the finish line in the best-of-9 encounter. However, the resilient Chinese, one frame away from defeat, proved his class and made frame-winning breaks of 61 and 63 rin the next two to make the scoreline 4-4, enforcing the decider.</p>
<p>With the shift of momentum, the local favourite was on the brink of a remarkable comeback but Advani had other plans. His reputation to raise his game to the next level was on show yet again as he scored a match-winning 80 break, clearing the table. After overcoming the second highest ranked Chinese, Advani is likely to face China’s No.1 Ding Junhui.</p>
<p>The other Indian, Aditya Mehta, however did not make it and lost in the first round to a lesser-ranked player in England’s Michael White, 3-5.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006877&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A Diwakar Ram hat-trick helped hosts Uttar Pradesh beat Orissa 5-2 in their opening match of the 4th Hockey India Senior Men’s National Championship 2014 (Division A) at the Dhyan Chand Stadium, Lucknow, on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>UP forward Amir Khan netted the first goal in the 10th minute in this Pool C match. Ram made full use of a penalty-corner awarded to UP in the 33rd minute to make the half-time score 2-0. In the 44th minute, Ajit Pandey sounded the board to increase the lead.</p>
<p><strong>Pulling one back </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>However, four minutes later Amon Mirash Tirkey dodged past defenders and succeeded in reducing the margin to 3-1.</p>
<p>However, Ram capitalised on another penalty-corner awarded in the 54th minute. Joseph Topno scored the second goal for Orissa in the 61st minute.</p>
<p>Ram netted another goal through a penalty-corner in the 64th minute to make the score 5-2 in favour of the hosts.</p>
<p>In another Pool C match, a hat-trick of goals by Birshu Bhengra — in the 57th, 63rd and 68th minute — paved the way for a 3-0 win for Hockey Jharkhand against Hockey Bhopal. And in a Pool D game, Railways beat FCI 3-0.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006873&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maheshbhupathisaniafilem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2007232" alt="India’s Sania Mirza has signed up for the Mahesh Bhupathi-led ITPL, which is set to take place between November and December (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/maheshbhupathisaniafilem.jpg" /></a> India’s Sania Mirza has signed up for the Mahesh Bhupathi-led ITPL, which is set to take place between November and December (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The Women’s Tennis Association, which has turned to Asia to grow its sport, is unclear how the Indian Tennis Premier League is going to pan out.</span></p>
<p>“We are still learning about it, just as the world and the media is,” said Melissa Pines, Vice-President, Asia-Pacific on the sidelines of its new announcement to bring the season-ending BNP Paribas WTA Championships to South East Asia for the first time this year.</p>
<p>The Mahesh Bhupathi-promoted ITPL, following its recent draft in Dubai, announced that among the women players who have signed up are Serena Williams, Victoria Azarenka, Ana Ivanovic, Caroline Wozniacki, Daniela Hantuchova, Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza.</p>
<p>Continuing on the ITPL, Pines said, “We feel exhibitions can be good but the athletes need to strike a balance between professional and financial needs. They need to look to recovery and preparation for the coming season.”</p>
<p>She said the WTA was still learning about the event through media reports and did not have a clear picture. Pines also said that she and the WTA looks forward to India becoming ‘priority market’ in the near-future.</p>
<p>“We are always looking at inquiries at hosting new events and certainly India is a key market to spread women’s tennis.”</p>
<p>Women’s tennis in Asia is at a very interesting stage with Li Na as the World No.2 and Peng Shuai as No.1 in women’s doubles. Also Hsieh Su-wei of Chinese Taipei is World No.2 in women’s doubles and India’s Sania Mirza, who was as high as No.7 in 2012, is now No.11.</p>
<p>Australian Open champion Li Na has decided to skip the inaugural ITPL, presumably because of a packed calendar. Li Na is being used by the WTA to push its sport in Asia.</p>
<p>The Asia-Pacific region has around 17 WTA events, and these include many new events in China and the season-ending event in Singapore. There is also talk of a new top-level event in Li Na’s home city of Wuhan.</p>
<p>The ITPL is due to take place in the off-season between November 27 and December 14 and will feature matches across the four host cities — Bangkok, Mumbai, Singapore and Dubai. This is also the period when most top players on the men’s and women’s tours prefer to rest and recover.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the WTA signed a five-year deal with BNP Paribas once again and the championships will move from Istanbul to Singapore this November.</p>
<p><strong>Focus Asia</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Asia is the new focus area for the Women’s Tennis Association, which today brought its year-end WTA Championships to South-East Asia for the first time, as it announced a five-year tie-up with BNP Paribas in a high-profile launch in Singapore.</p>
<p>Also present at the announcement for the event promoted by World Sport Group, was Pierre Veyres, Chief Executive Officer of BNP Paribas Singapore Branch and Regional Head for South East Asia, who said, “As a leading international financial institution in Asia Pacific and a long-time partner of tennis worldwide, we are excited to bring tennis to a whole new level with Singapore positioned as a world class sports hub.</p>
<p>“Our title sponsorship of the BNP Paribas WTA Championships reflects our continued commitment to the sports community across continents with the hope to connect this region to the rest of the tennis world.</p>
<p>“The focus of the WTA Championships, Singapore is on growth of the sport and the event is being transformed into a 10-day sports entertainment experience of competition, exhibitions and activities for the fans of women’s tennis.”</p>
<p>The BNP Paribas WTA Championships will be staged at the state-of-the-art USD 1.3 billion Singapore Sports Hub from October 17-26, 2014 &#8211; the first time an Asia-Pacific city has played host.</p>
<p>Singapore will become the ninth different city to host the WTA Championships following Boca Raton (1972-1973), Los Angeles (1974-1976, 2002-2005), Oakland (1978), New York City (1977, 1979-2000), Munich (2001), Madrid (2006-2007), Doha (2008-2010) and Istanbul (2011-2013).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006870&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Rafa Nadal and Maria Sharapova were both knocked out of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells on Monday after stunning upsets at one of the world’s biggest tournaments outside the four Grand Slams.</span></p>
<p>Nadal was sent packing by Ukraine’s Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3 3-6 7-6 (7-5) after Sharapova fell to Italian qualifier Camila Giorgi 6-3 4-6 7-5 as last year’s men’s and women’s singles champions both crashed out.</p>
<p>Nadal blew a 4-2 lead in the deciding tiebreak after the Spaniard had fought his way back into the match. Nadal beat Dolgopolov in the final of the inaugural Rio Open last month but the Ukrainian got his revenge on the world number one in the Californian desert.</p>
<p>Giorgi, a 22-year-old ranked 79th in the world made the fourth round of the U.S. Open last year as a qualifier, but her win over the world number five Russian was the biggest of her career.</p>
<p>“I did not play a good match at all,” said Sharapova, who dropped serve eight times and committed 58 unforced errors. “(I’ve) never played against her, but she’s someone that doesn’t give you much rhythm. She’s quite aggressive, but some shots she hits incredible for a long period of time. Sometimes they go off a bit. But, if I’m speaking about my level, it was nowhere near where it should have been.”</p>
<p>Giorgi will play her countrywoman Flavia Pennetta in the next round after she beat Australian Sam Stosur 6-4 3-6 6-1.</p>
<p>There were no other major surprises although Britain’s Andy Murray was forced to dig deep to see off promising Czech Jiri Vesely and avoid a similar fate.</p>
<p>The Wimbledon champion won 6-7 (7-2) 6-4 6-4 but only after clawing back from the brink of defeat against the 20-year-old Vesely.</p>
<p>Murray lost the opening set despite going up an early break but then struggled on serve against the left-handed Vesely, ranked 77th in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Surviving many breaks</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The Scotsman was broken six times in the match and trailed in both the second and third sets but fought back each time, reeling off four consecutive games to seal victory.</p>
<p>“It was just one of those matches where there wasn’t one period where I thought that the level of tennis from both of us was high at the same time,” said Murray. “That can create a lot of breaks and a lot of sort of back and forth swings in the match. It wasn’t just the start of the match that was frustrating. The whole match was.”</p>
<p>Murray will play Canada’s big-serving Milos Raonic in the next round as he bids to win one of the few North American hardcourt titles to have eluded him.</p>
<p>Switzerland’s former world number one Roger Federer also advanced after he was pushed all the way by Russia’s Dmitry Tursunov before winning 7-6 (9-7) 7-6 (7-2). Federer, who won his 78th career singles title in Dubai earlier this month, will play either German Tommy Haas or Japan’s Kei Nishikori in the fourth round.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m in a good place,” said Federer, a four-time champion at Indian Wells. “I know what my solid level is. Even if I won 6 and 6 today, I just feel like I was calm and served for the set. “Okay, got broken. Still managed to stay calm. Down &#8230; in the second; stayed calm and came back. So those are the moments where you feel there is confidence around somewhere.”</p>
<p>China’s Li Na, the top seed in the women’s draw, had no problems booking her place in the fourth round, beating Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic 6-3 6-4. Despite dishing up nine double-faults and having her own service broken twice, Li was far too strong and streetwise for Pliskova, wrapping up the win with an ace.</p>
<p>“At least I could win the last point and stay in the tournament,” Li said. “If you’re a tennis player, you’ll make double faults. At least I can improve my serve even more from here.”</p>
<p>Li is looking to win her first Indian Wells title and continue her great start to the year after capturing the Australian Open. Her next opponent is Canada’s Aleksandra Wozniak, who defeated Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-1 6-7 (3-7) 6-0.</p>
<p><strong>Stepanek-Paes advance</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Leander Paes and Radek Stepanek downed Jonathan Erlich and Richard Gasquet in straight sets to reach the quarter-finals of the Indian Wells Masters. The fourth seeded Indo-Czech pair quelled the challenge of the wild card opponents 6-3 7-5 in one hour and 16 minutes in the second round.</p>
<p>They will now fight out it with Swiss legend Roger Federer and his partner Stanislas Wawrinka, the singles Australian Open champion.</p>
<p>If Paes and Stepanek could cross the Federer-Wawrinka hurdle, it would be their best show of the season. <em>(PTI)</em></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006855&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mariasharapovaapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006612" alt="Maria Sharapova committed 58 errors in her first loss to a player ranked outside the top 30 since Wimbledon last year (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mariasharapovaapm.jpg" /></a> Maria Sharapova committed 58 errors in her first loss to a player ranked outside the top 30 since Wimbledon last year (AP)
<p>Defending champions Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova were upset in the third round of the BNP Paribas Open on Monday.</p>
<p>First, Sharapova went down to qualifier Camila Giorgi, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, giving the young Italian her first victory over a top-five player. Then, Nadal followed on the main stadium court, losing 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (5) to Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Nadal staged a furious rally in the third. He won three straight games, including a break of Dolgopolov, to tie it at 5. Both players held serve to send the match into the tiebreaker.</p>
<p>They slugged it out from the baseline accompanied by a noisy soundtrack, with fans yelling and cheering. Los Angeles Lakers star Pau Gasol watched nervously from Nadal&#8217;s box. Nadal led 4-2 before Dolgopolov won three straight points to take a 5-4 lead. The Ukrainian hit two forehand winners and came up with a big service winner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had enough breaks to win the match, but I didn&#8217;t play enough well from the baseline then to be solid with my serve,&#8221; Nadal said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t go for the points. I played with too many mistakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nadal evened it at 5-all, but he hit the ball long to set up match point. Dolgopolov served what he thought was an ace, but it was called out. He challenged the call and it showed the ball barely missed tagging the T. Dolgopolov put his second serve into play and produced a cross-court forehand that the world&#8217;s top-ranked player couldn&#8217;t return.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a moment for the people to be proud a little bit for someone from their country,&#8221; Dolgopolov said, referring to the political upheaval going on between Ukraine and Russia. &#8220;It&#8217;s good to make some results and make the people forget a little bit and have some happy moments in the news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dolgopolov had more errors (49) than winners (36).</p>
<p>Last month, Nadal defeated Dolgopolov to win the Rio de Janeiro title. The Ukrainian has risen quickly in the ATP Tour rankings, going from No. 57 to 31st after a strong February, posting three wins against top-20 players in Rio and made the semifinals in Acapulco.</p>
<p>Before Nadal was sent packing, Sharapova committed 58 errors in her first loss to a player ranked outside the top 30 since Wimbledon last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s someone that doesn&#8217;t give you much rhythm,&#8221; Sharapova said. &#8220;She&#8217;s quite aggressive, but some shots she hits incredible for a long period of time. Sometimes they go off a bit. If I&#8217;m speaking about my level, it was nowhere near where it should have been.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ranked 79th in the world, Giorgi made it through qualifying to play Indian Wells for the first time. She improved to 3-2 against top-10 opponents. The 22-year-old led 4-2 in the final set, but Sharapova broke Giorgi twice to tie it at 5.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was trying to just play my game, and maybe I accelerate more than the other set,&#8221; Giorgi said. &#8220;I just play more aggressive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Giorgi then broke Sharapova at love before serving out the match, overcoming her 11th double fault to set up match point. Giorgi had 48 unforced errors and 24 winners.</p>
<p>Awaiting Giorgi in the fourth round will be fellow Italian Flavia Pennetta, who beat No. 16 seed Sam Stosur 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.</p>
<p>American Sloane Stephens was to play Ana Ivanovic, and Tommy Haas took on Kei Nishikori of Japan in night matches.</p>
<p>Tied 4-all in the third, Sharapova was broken when her forehand was called long and Sharapova raised her arms. The chair umpire took the gesture to mean Sharapova was challenging the call, and the call showed the ball was out.</p>
<p>Sharapova argued she was only throwing her arms up as if to ask, &#8220;Who made the call?&#8221; But the umpire disagreed, and Sharapova retreated to her sideline chair trailing 5-4.</p>
<p>Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka routed 29th-seeded Andreas Seppi of Italy 6-0, 6-2.</p>
<p>Andy Murray outlasted Jiri Vesely of the Czech Republic 6-7 (2), 6-4, 6-4 in his second straight three-set match, and four-time tourney champion Roger Federer defeated 27th-seeded Dmitry Tursunov of Russia 7-6 (7), 7-6 (2) with an ace on match point.</p>
<p>Murray had 47 of the 99 unforced errors during the nearly three-hour match in the 80-plus-degree heat of the Southern California desert. The third set featured six service breaks, with Murray taking the last two.</p>
<p>Top-seeded Li Na defeated Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-4, while American Sloane Stephens beat 11th-seeded Ana Ivanovic 7-6 (3), 6-4.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006608&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[With Yadav spitting fire in tandem with Shrikant Wagh, Services would require a miracle to close in on the imposing target. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006082&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Rajat Paliwal walked in to bat with Services reeling at 29 for three in Kolkata. Chasing 284 to stay in the competition and with Vidarbha’s international face in Umesh Yadav bowling at the speed of knots, Paliwal could sense that side were on the verge of imploding. Another wicket, he thought to himself as he marked his guard, and all the hard work that his side had done in the group stages of the Vijay Hazare would be undone.</span></p>
<p>With Yadav spitting fire in tandem with Shrikant Wagh, Services would require a miracle to close in on the imposing target. However, luckily for Services, they had two individuals who believed in making their own luck.</p>
<p>Paliwal and Yashpal Singh have been the pillars of the Services batting line-up for over the past couple of seasons. Both started slowly, adjusting to the Jadavpur University wicket, but soon were at home, on the placid track, which Paliwal believed to be on the slower side.</p>
<p>Neither Paliwal (112) nor Yashpal (81) were there at the very end. But if not for their fourth wicket stand of 195 runs, Services surely wouldn’t have given themselves a chance at winning the match by the narrowest of margins — by one wicket off the last ball of the innings.</p>
<p>“We did not have the luxury of a free-flowing start, so the plan was simple. We decided to just rotate the strike and make sure that we scored off the loose balls,” said Paliwal, who scored his second successive century in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. The first helped knock defending champions Delhi out of the North Zone preliminaries itself. The second put his side into the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a match for the weak hearted. Batting first, Vidarbha scored 283 for six with skipper Shalabh Srivastava scoring an 89-ball 84 and Urvesh Patel contributing 59. In reply, Paliwal and Yashpal steadied the ship and gave it great wind with their whirlwind stand. But in the end, it was the last wicket pair of Abhishek Sinha and Avishek Sakuja who did outstandingly well to hold their nerves for a last-delivery win.</p>
<p>Paliwal, however, was courteous enough to credit his partner, Yashpal, for the win. “Batting with Yashpal bhai is always a comforting thing. He doesn’t tell you too many things but makes sure that your confidence is up. That helps you get into a better frame of mind, allowing you to properly play your natural game,” he said.</p>
<p>Confidence, then, has perhaps been Paliwal’s fuel in this limited-overs season. His List A average is a more-than-healthy 67.66. Paliwal is also the highest run-getter in this edition of the competition. His 406 runs in six hits have come at 101.50 and were scored at a strike-rate of 90.82. Not bad for a man who is a sergeant in the Indian Air Force. But none of his rigorous Air Force training could have prepared him for the tension of watching the final minutes of Monday’s match.</p>
<p>Off the very last ball, Services and Abhishek Sinha needed two runs. Services would have done well to settle for a tie, but as the Shrikant Wagh ball was smashed for a four, the Services dressing room exploded. “We wanted to show people that we belonged at this level and we had it in us to beat good teams,” said the 22-year-old Paliwal. “Ever since we started training for this competition, there was this determination amongst the entire group, to make a mark.”</p>
<p><strong>Brief Scores:</strong> Vidarbha 283/6 in 50 overs (Shalabh Srivastava 84, Urvesh Patel 59, Abhishek Sakuja 2/43) lost to Services 286/9 in 50 overs (Rajat Paliwal 112, Yashpal Singh 81, Umesh Yadav 3/54) by 1 wkt.</p>
<p><strong>Railways hammer listless Baroda</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kolkata:</strong> Railways put up an all-round performance to down Baroda by 93 runs and set up a quarterfinal clash with Punjab in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. For Railways, who won the toss, Chanderpal Saini put up a fine show as the No 8 batsman’s unbeaten 45 in a 64-run partnership with Karn Sharma (41), propelled his side to 230/9 after they were reduced to 126/6 in the 31st over.</p>
<p>Defending the modest total, Railways were given a fine start when pacer Anureet Singh’s wicket-maiden first over in which he dismissed Saurabh Wakaskar before Amit Mishra (3/22), Krishnakant Upadhyay (2/29) and Saini (2/13) bundled out Baroda for 137.</p>
<p>The intent was missing from Baroda’s batting. Ambati Rayudu was out for two, while the Pathan brothers disappointed too as Yusuf, who had a 66 and 100 in previous two matches, was dismissed for 19 by leg-spinner Karn Sharma while Irfan was bowled by Upadhyay for 38. <strong>(PTI)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brief Scores:</strong> Railways 230/9 (Chanderpal Saini 45 not out, Amit Paunikar 42; Vishwanath Parmar 4/50, Munaf Patel 2/27) beat Baroda 137 in 43.3 overs (Irfan Pathan 38; Amit Mishra 3/22) by 93 runs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006082&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shakibapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006542" alt="Mistakes, Bangladesh have made on the cricket field in the past, especially while playing a big match at home (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shakibapm.jpg" /></a> Mistakes, Bangladesh have made on the cricket field in the past, especially while playing a big match at home (AP)
<p>As Bangladesh prepares to host its biggest sporting event yet in the 2014 World T20 (during the 2011 World Cup, they were just one of three co-hosts), their most prolific player, Shakib Al Hasan, has asked the team’s supporters to be a bit realistic about their chances.</p>
<p>“As the tournament is at home, we will have the support but there shouldn’t be too much expectation,” Shakib is quoted as saying in an interview with ESPNcricinfo. “I have heard people say, ‘Let the cup stay at home.’ But I think we have to tone that down a bit.”</p>
<p>Bangladesh are not in the best of forms, having recently been blanked 3-0 by Sri Lanka in their backyard before losing all their matches while hosting the Asia Cup, including to ODI newbies Afghanistan. Incidentally, Bangladesh open their World T20 campaign against the same side. “We should fear everyone because we don’t know much about Nepal and Hong Kong,” the all-rounder added. “Say we score 160 but someone from the other side scores a hundred. Scotland have done that to us in the past. We have to be careful in all the games. It is hard to recover from a mistake in a T20.”</p>
<p>Mistakes, Bangladesh have made on the cricket field in the past, especially while playing a big match at home. During the 2011 World Cup, they put up a fight against India in the opening game, before being bowled out for just 58 against the West Indies. Then, having beaten England a week later, they crumbled against South Africa soon after. Shakib, hence, is rather wary of how the fans react when the team blows hot and cold. “Too much expectation does put undue pressure on us,” he said. “Please support us, the team will do better. But everyone has to take the result sportingly.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006081&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/misbahapm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006528" alt="Pakistan is one of the most successful teams in the shortest format of the game (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/misbahapm1.jpg" /></a> Pakistan is one of the most successful teams in the shortest format of the game (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq said Monday his players’ performance in the Asia Cup had raised his hopes for the team in the upcoming World Twenty20. Pakistan pulled off stunning run chases against India and Bangladesh, but lost the lopsided final to Sri Lanka.</span></p>
<p>Misbah said the run-scoring by the likes of Ahmed Shehzad, Umar Akmal and Shahid Afridi on Bangladesh wickets indicated the team can perform well when that country hosts the World Twenty20 from March 16. “There’s a disappointment that we couldn’t win the final, but the morale of the team is very good,’’ Misbah said after arriving home from Bangladesh. “We have a very good chance (in World Twenty20) &#8230; especially the batsmen are in good form.’’</p>
<p>Pakistan is in a challenging group for the World Twenty20; facing India, Australia, defending champion West Indies and a qualifier. Afridi hit successive sixes in last over for a one-wicket win against India and then his robust fifty off 18 balls earned Pakistan its biggest ever every chase of 327 against Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the most successful teams in the shortest format of the game, having qualified for the inaugural World Twenty20 final in 2007 and then two years later won the event in England. While 39-year-old Misbah continues to play in the domestic Twenty20, he quit T20 internationals in 2012 and was replaced by Mohammad Hafeez as the captain.</p>
<p>Soon after the loss to Sri Lanka on Saturday, former Pakistan cricketers — Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Yousuf and Sikander Bakht — called for change in captaincy for country’s one-day team too. “We need aggressive captain in one-day internationals and for that we should once again make Afridi as captain,’’ Yousuf and Bakht told private Geo Television.</p>
<p>However, Akhtar’s choice was Saeed Ajmal, who took 11 wickets and was the joint leading wicket-taker in the Asia Cup with Sri Lanka’s pace ace Lasith Malinga. Pakistan sorely missed 7-foot-1 injured fast bowler Mohammad Irfan. “It wasn’t an easy tour, especially for fast bowlers,’’ Misbah said. “You know in Asia conditions are conducive for spin bowlers and it doesn’t help fast bowlers.’’</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006076&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Twitter diplomacy — or, Twiplomacy — came to the rescue of star English cricketer Kevin Pietersen, as he got an Indian visa within hours of him complaining about the lack of one on the micro-blogging site.</span></p>
<p>Pietersen, who tweets from the handle @KP24, wrote on his twitter page that his passport is lying with the Indian embassy in the UK for the past 10 days for a job that he claimed requires barely 24 hours, and subsequently requested the MEA to help him in this regard.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Trying to travel to India urgently &amp; the Indian Embassy has had my passport for 10days for a 24hr service. Help <a href="https://twitter.com/MEAIndia">@MEAIndia</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/IndianDiplomacy">@IndianDiplomacy</a>?</p>
<p>— Kevin Pietersen (@KP24) <a href="https://twitter.com/KP24/statuses/442962911867469824">March 10, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>While the @MEAIndia is the twitter handle of official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, Syed Akbaruddin, the @IndianDiplomacy is the handle for the Public Diplomacy division — also headed by Akbaruddin.</p>
<p>Pietersen’s tweet was re-tweeted over 100 times, and the MEA official spokesperson swung into action.</p>
<p>It is learnt that Akbaruddin immediately sent a DM (direct message) to Pietersen, and asked him for the visa application details and contact number. Upon getting the required details, the MEA spokesperson asked the Indian High Commission in London to look into the matter.</p>
<p>Akbaruddin, meanwhile, answered the batsman’s query, explaining to him about the requirement of necessary approval from the Union Sports Ministry.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>. <a href="https://twitter.com/KP24">@KP24</a> Event requires approval of Sports Ministry. Mission will give Visa promptly once organisers of event obtain necessary approval.</p>
<p>— Syed Akbaruddin (@MEAIndia) <a href="https://twitter.com/MEAIndia/statuses/443004318262636544">March 10, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The Indian High Commission in UK worked the phones, and by about 7pm IST, the official clearance was granted. And Pietersen was contacted and informed about the visa approval.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>. <a href="https://twitter.com/KP24">@KP24</a> Good news. Twiplomacy works!! Necessary clearance just received from Sports Ministry. Mission to grant visa soon. C u in India soon</p>
<p>— Syed Akbaruddin (@MEAIndia) <a href="https://twitter.com/MEAIndia/statuses/443015511589126144">March 10, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Pietersen, who has been retained by Delhi Daredevils, will be available for the entire season of the seventh edition of the IPL. This was made possible after the England and Wales Cricket Board had formally announced that Pietersen will no longer be selected to play for England.</p>
<p>He is likely to come to India by the end of this month as the Daredevils will be officially unveiling their new jersey for the 2014 season. New coach Gary Kirsten is also expected to attend the promotional event.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006069&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/samuels.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006150" alt="Tim Bresnan made an unbeaten 47 during England’s unsuccessful chase of 171.AP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/samuels.jpg" /></a> Tim Bresnan made an unbeaten 47 during England’s unsuccessful chase of 171. AP
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">West Indies returned to winning ways in the shortest variety, defeating England by 27 runs in the first T20 International of a three-match series at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown. Marlon Samuels, the star when the Caribbean side defeated Sri Lanka in the final of the last World T20 in Colombo 17 months ago, led the home team’s effort with an unbeaten 69 as the West Indies totalled a competitive 170 for three on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>Samuels finished off a good afternoon’s work in front of a celebratory full house with two wickets to seal the man of the match award. Wrist-spinner Samuel Badree put the tourists on the back foot early on with three wickets and although all-rounders Tim Bresnan (47 not out) and Ravi Bopara (42) made useful contributions, England were always struggling to keep up with the required rate and were restricted to 143 for nine.</p>
<p>“We didn’t get going today but that’s something that can happen in Twenty20 cricket, especially when you’re chasing a decent score,” said England captain Stuart Broad. “It’s certainly not something to panic about.”</p>
<p><strong>Broad injury worry</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Broad did suggest however that he is likely to miss the remaining two matches of the series on Tuesday and Thursday because of tendonitis in his knee. For the West Indies, the celebrations over a victory that sends a message to all challengers for their World T20 title in Bangladesh later in the month would have been tempered by concerns over the fitness of ace spinners Sunil Narine and Badree.</p>
<p>Narine only bowled two overs and left the field after jarring his right knee trying to make a save on the boundary while Badree, who claimed three for 17 off his allotted four overs, injured the fingers of his bowling hand attempting to take a return catch just before completing his spell.</p>
<p>“He’ll be going for a scan this evening so hopefully he’ll be okay,” said West Indies captain Darren Sammy in commenting on Narine’s injury. “We’re already without Kieron Pollard so we can’t afford to lose another key player so close to the World Cup.”</p>
<p>Injury has also limited Chris Gayle’s appearances for the West Indies over the past two months, but he returned on Sunday, contributing a typically robust 43.</p>
<p>However, it was his opening partner Dwayne Smith who stole the show at the very start, hoisting the first delivery of the match off Broad out of the ground and taking 19 runs off that opening over.</p>
<p>Smith eventually was first to go for 27, one of two wickets for Bopara who, together with the spinner James Tredwell, were England’s best bowlers.</p>
<p>Samuels’ 46-ball innings (10 fours, 1 six) was not without moments of good fortune. Missed on 37 by a leaping Eoin Morgan at backward-point off Broad, he had even greater luck when Tredwell dropped a straightforward chance at extra-cover off Jade Dernbach at the start of the 18th over.</p>
<p>As if to rub salt in England wounds, the Jamaican right-hander smashed the next five deliveries for boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> West Indies 170/3 in 20 overs (Marlon Samuels 69 not out, Chris Gayle 43, Ravi Bopara 2/23); England 143/9 in 20 overs (Tim Bresnan 47 not out, Bopara 42, Samuel Badree 3/17, Samuels 2/21).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006066&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Cristiano Ronaldo helped Real Madrid reclaim sole possession of the Spanish league on Sunday, scoring one goal and setting up another in a dominant 3-0 victory over 10-man Levante at the Santiago Bernabeu. Ronaldo recorded his league-leading 24th goal of the season to get Madrid rolling in the 11th minute.</span></p>
<p>The Ballon d’Or winner then passed for Marcelo to score in the 49th and ensure Madrid extended its undefeated streak in all competitions to 29 straight matches. With Madrid firmly in control, the game turned testy with several bookings until David Navarro saw a direct red for tackling Ronaldo from behind in the 64th.</p>
<p>Ronaldo went close to getting another goal when he hit the crossbar after Levante defender Nikos Karabelas had already turning in an own goal in the 82nd. Madrid’s win came a week after Ronaldo scored to salvage a draw at Atletico Madrid, and it lifted Carlo Ancelotti’s side three points clear of its crosstown rivals at the top of the table.</p>
<p>Barcelona was left four points adrift of the pacesetters following Saturday’s stunning 1-0 defeat at Valladolid.</p>
<p>Madrid’s outing was tarnished when fullback Dani Carvajal collapsed with a leg injury and had to been carried off in the 90th, leaving the hosts with 10 men for stoppage time. Bilbao drew 1-1 at Valencia to increase its hold on fourth place and the last Champions League berth.</p>
<p>Sevilla routed Almeria 3-1 to earn its third consecutive victory, while Espanyol also eased to a 3-1 home win over Elche. Levante was without its two first-choice midfielders in Papakouly Diop and Simao Mate, but it arrived on an eight-round unbeaten run, largely thanks to the outstanding play of goalkeeper Keylor Navas.</p>
<p>After a power outage that had left Mestalla stadium in the dark, Valencia struck first through Pablo Alcacer’s goal in the 23rd. But Aritz Aduriz leveled in the 53rd with a penalty kick after Sofiane Feghouli fouled Ander Herrera in the area as Bilbao inched seven points clear of fifth-place Villarreal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006060&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pepriberyapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006566" alt="Bayern head coach Pep Guardiola of Spain, left, talks to Franck Ribery of France during during a training session in Munich (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pepriberyapm.jpg" /></a> Bayern head coach Pep Guardiola of Spain, left, talks to Franck Ribery of France during during a training session in Munich (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Pep Guardiola is well known to be a perfectionist and even Saturday’s 6-1 win at VfL Wolfsburg has failed to fully satisfy the demanding Bayern Munich manager. Guardiola complained that his team allowed Wolfsburg too much possession in the first hour and has told them they cannot afford to make the same mistake in Tuesday’s Champions League last 16 tie against Arsenal.</span></p>
<p>“We scored four or five goals in a 20 minute spell but they were all on the counter-attack,” said Guardiola, whose side host Arsenal in Tuesday’s second leg with a 2-0 lead from the first match.</p>
<p>“We did not dominate the match in the way we have dominated previous games,” he said. “I know Arsenal very well. They are good enough to keep possession for a long time,” added the Spaniard. “We must dominate them with the ball.</p>
<p>“If we have the ball, we will get to the quarter-final. If Arsenal have the ball, they will get to the quarter-final.”</p>
<p>On paper, Arsenal appear to have an almost hopeless task against Bayern, who are threatening to better last season’s treble-winning performance when they won the Bundesliga, German Cup and Champions League.</p>
<p>The Bavarians have won their last 16 Bundesliga matches and scored 26 goals in their last six. They have played 39 matches this season, including the German Supercup, European Supercup and Club World Cup, and won 34 of them, losing only twice. But there are some grounds for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger to be hopeful as they attempt to avoid a fourth successive round of 16 exit.</p>
<p><strong>ENGLISH DEFEATS</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Bayern’s last three matches against English sides at their Allianz Arena have ended in defeat. They were beaten on penalties by Chelsea in the 2012 Champions League final after a 1-1 draw, although the stadium was officially classed as a neutral venue for that game.</p>
<p>Bayern lost 2-0 at home to Arsenal at the same stage of the Champions League last season, after they had won the first leg 3-1. Then, Manchester City came from two goals behind to win 3-2in this season’s group stage.</p>
<p>Arsenal’s 4-1 win over Everton in the FA Cup on Saturday has given Wenger renewed optimism. “It was important for us to win, to put us in a good mind on the psychological front,” said Wenger.</p>
<p>“We can be inspired by our focus on the day, by our desire and go to Bayern with the same spirit. The statistics go against us when we go to Bayern, but let’s make sure that the performance goes for us. Then we have a chance.”</p>
<p><strong>Live matches:</strong> Atletico vs Milan (12.30 am on Ten Sports); Bayern vs Arsenal (12.30 am Ten Action).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006056&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Satpal Singh, India’s famous wrestling coach, was accustomed to the milk-and-dryfruit concoction thandaai while training all of his early akhada life. However, he suffered massively in his first few international tournaments when he failed to find his usual diet of 10 litres milk and badaam when competing abroad — submitting meekly against even lesser opponents. </span></p>
<p>By the time, his disciples Sushil and Yogeshwar started competing away from home, Satpal had made it a habit that as coach he would scout out Indian families in cities of the competing venues who could provide his charges their staple, no matter what corner of the world.</p>
<p>This was a coach who wouldn’t allow his wards to suffer. Wrestling fetched two Olympic medals in London, and the minute attention to such details became the sport&#8217;s folklore. A handful of India&#8217;s ex-athletes are following up their active competition years with careers in coaching, and bringing all their experience to the table. As far as improving the quality of coaching goes, some believe this to be the best way forward.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s pistol star from the last deacde Jaspal Rana states it’d be simply unfair to not pass on knowledge athletes have spent so many years to gain. “In pistol shooting, weather, surroundings and technique are things that a coach who’s played at the highest level will know better than someone who has not played at that level.”</p>
<p>For a generation that figured things out by trial-and-error or watch-and-improve, this is the chance to pass on knowledge and the nitty-gritties of competing at the highest level, and spare the next generation the tribulations. “The psychology and the pressure at the highest level and recovery and diet is better known to someone who&#8217;s actually been in that sport and played it,” says MK Kaushik, 1980 hockey Olympic champion.</p>
<p>For India’s most-succesful contemporary Olympic sport shooting, this is the time to reap the benefits of the first generation&#8217;s struggle. Deepali Deshpande, national junior rifle coach, says, “The coach is always seen as an expert and advisor even by the administration. You can see things from the athlete’s point of view and are also the bridge between the federation and athletes. In shooting, you can&#8217;t see anything, it&#8217;s all about the feel. And ex-shooter understands that.”</p>
<p>However, success-stories are very few: Satpal and P Gopichand amongst those who have ensured their wards reach the next level. Surprisingly, turning to coaching isn&#8217;t the most preferred career move.</p>
<p>“It’s an important career but not one that has been encouraged that often in India,&#8221; says Kamlesh Mehta, TT icon. The 53-year-old is adamant that the player-to-coach switch doesn&#8217;t come with the same degree of respect in Indian sport. “Saying you&#8217;re a coach isn&#8217;t as commanding as being an engineer or doctor,&#8221; he laments. &#8220;The salaries are low. At the end of the day, you have a family to feed,” he adds.</p>
<p>Kaushik elaborates: &#8220;They are not really given that much respect in soceity. They say coaches are just someone getting paid for their services. The pay is also not that attractive. Coaches aren&#8217;t given credit.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a backseat — not the easiest place for athletes who are accustomed to being in command at all times. “As a player, you motivate yourself. As a coach you motivate another, and beyond a point you can&#8217;t control the whole situation. You move into an observational role,&#8221; Mehta says. Frustrating tales of confronting red-tape when setting up academies and dealing with paperwork are in abundance for players-turned-coaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;You train thousands of players and out of them only a few will win medals. When they do that at a higher level, the effort is all worth it,&#8221; Jaspal concludes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006049&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/saicoachesm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006595" alt="Lack of coaches is not the only issue SAI is facing" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/saicoachesm.jpg" /></a> Lack of coaches is not the only issue SAI is facing
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The Sports Authority of India centre in Kokrajhar, Assam, houses some of the most promising wushu talents from the counry. But their training regimen has come to a halt. Reason? They have no coaches. It’s the same case with cycling in Andaman and Nicobar. The island state is home to one of the top woman cyclists of the country, Deborah. They, too, have several cycling trainees but no coaches.</span></p>
<p>This is not a problem peculiar to these sports. Even as the sports ministry continues to splurge thousands of crore in countless schemes – Rahul Gandhi inaugurated Rs 9,000 crore worth Rajiv Gandhi Khel Abhiyan on Friday – one of the most essential areas continues to be severely ignored: coach development.</p>
<p>SAI is at least 1,000 coaches short across all disciplines, according to a data compiled by them this month. Currently, they employ only 1,154 coaches for more than 10,500 athletes who train at 100-plus centres (classified as Regional Training Centres, SAI Training Centres, Army Boys Sports Centres, Extension Centres) across the country.</p>
<p>At several centres, athletes have been recruited for training programmes but there are no coaches available. In the first week of February, SAI recruited 174 coaches in 16 disciplines. It was for the first time in two decades that SAI had appointed a coach, highlighting the extent to which this area has been ignored.</p>
<p>SAI director general Jiji Thomson said they knew that the number of accredited coaches were not enough did not expect the shortfall to be so severe. “It is for the first time that we have compiled such data. We were aware that we do not have enough coaches but this has helped us realize that we are terribly short,” Thomson said. “Our objective was to quantify the number of trainees and coaches for every sport. We have been a bit reckless in the past in this regard. We have opened new centres and recruited young athletes but do not have coaches to train them.”</p>
<p>The core disciplines — which include sports such as boxing, badminton, wrestling, shooting, etc — are not directly affected because of the substantial funding they get from the government. They have the muscle to employ coaches directly without depending on SAI. However, the lesser sports, like the ones mentioned above, that do not enjoy the same privilege are severely impacted. Most of the trainees at the SAI centres are aged between 12 and 18, considered crucial for athlete development.</p>
<p>Lack of coaches is not the only issue SAI is facing. The coaching syllabus too is outdated; in fact it has not been upgraded even once in last two decades at least. “That is something we are working on. We have signed a MoU with Sports Coach UK and will also be sending 40 coaches to Hungary so that they can learn modern methods,” Thomson said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006047&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sainanehwalptim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1968607" alt="Saina Nehwal, the London Olympic bronze medallist, had clinched the title in 2011 and 2012 (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/sainanehwalptim.jpg" /></a> Saina Nehwal, the London Olympic bronze medallist, had clinched the title in 2011 and 2012 (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Ace Indian shuttler and two-time champion Saina Nehwal would look to put behind the disappointment of last week&#8217;s All England Championship and focus on the $125,000 Swiss Open Grand Prix Gold, which gets underway at St Jakobshalle here on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>Saina, the London Olympic bronze medallist, had clinched the title in 2011 and 2012 and the Indian will look for a repeat performance when she starts her campaign against a qualifier in the women&#8217;s singles competition on Wednesday. Seeded sixth, Saina, who had reached the semifinals last year, is coming into the tournament after crashing out in the quarterfinals of the All England Open in Birmingham, UK last week.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old Indian is likely to face World No.1 and top seed Yihan Wang in the quarterfinals if she manages to cross the first two rounds here. It was at the London Olympics where Saina had faced Yihan last time. The Chinese had retired from the play-off because of a knee injury, thus paving the way for the Indian to win the coveted bronze.</p>
<p>However, Saina holds a rather unimpressive 1-6 record against Yihan. World No. 9 PV Sindhu too will be eager to get over her forgettable All England debut when she plays in the Swiss Open. Her first round opponent Beatriz Corrales of Spain has already withdrawn and Sindhu is likely to sail into the quarterfinals. The World Championship bronze medallist, Sindhu is seeded seventh and is likely to face the newly-crowned All England Champion Shixian Wang in the quarterfinals.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006031&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[However, the association led by cabinet minister Lal Thanzara, younger brother of CM Lal Thanhawla, has a grievance.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006023&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">There was a sense of collective joy in-and-around the Aizawl Civil Hospital compound and adjoining private hospitals on Sunday night as Mizoram won its maiden Santosh Trophy with a 3-0 verdict over Indian Railways. What made the victory even more sweeter was that Mizoram were unbeaten in the eight matches in the zonal and final rounds of the national championships.</span></p>
<p>“For those 90 minutes, it was not a hospital. It was a stadium,” recalled Vanlalfakzuala, who was recovering after an operation but watched the live telecast of the final with fellow-patients.</p>
<p>“I will be out of the hospital by Monday, so obviously I’ll be present to receive them (the winners) when they arrive,” Vanlalfakzuala added.</p>
<p>The victory did have its impact around the state. Governor Vakkom Purushothamam, leading a long list of public congratulations, offered to the Mizoram team and political parties, NGOs, students’ unions and sports associations also indulging in lavish praise.</p>
<p>According to government sources — Wednesday — the day the team is expected to arrive in Aizawl, will be declared a state holiday. All roads are expected to lead to the Lengpui Airport, the only domestic terminal. The Mizoram Football Association, meanwhile, spent much of the day discussing how the team is to be welcomed. An open truck will ferry the squad through the 30 kilometre stretch of National Highway 54 — from Lengpui Airport to Aizawl.</p>
<p>The open truck will come to a halt at the Assam Rifles football field, in the heart of Aizawl, where a celebratory concert will be held under floodlights.</p>
<p>However, the association led by cabinet minister Lal Thanzara, younger brother of CM Lal Thanhawla, has a grievance. The grouse being that DD Sports, which showed the match live, did not show the prize distribution ceremony.</p>
<p>For now though, the focus is on welcoming their heroes. Indeed, it was not entirely unexpected for Mizoram to do well in the Santosh Trophy. Die-hard supporters knew that the team was in reasonable form after they won the Dr T Ao Memorial — considered the North-East’s top football tournament.</p>
<p>MFA secretary Lalnghinglova Hmar said, “As an association, winning the Santosh Trophy has been the most important goal for several years now. Our local tournaments finished early in order to allow our players to be fit and ready for the Santosh Trophy.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006023&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mizoramm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2006642" alt="Malsawmtluanga, the first footballer from Mizoram to become a top professional, congratulates the team" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mizoramm.jpg" /></a> Malsawmtluanga, the first footballer from Mizoram to become a top professional, congratulates the team
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">As far as Indian football is concerned, Mizoram has remained nothing more than a stat. And not just in terms of the number of players it has produced. Being one of the smallest regions in terms of area and population, the involvement of the tiny North-Eastern state has been restricted only to the pilot projects conducted by FIFA and All India Football Federation (AIFF) ahead of launching country-wide developmental programmes.</span></p>
<p>Manipur and Sikkim have always gotten away with being the leading lights of the region. But it’s Mizoram where the most effective revolution has been silently taking place.</p>
<p>On Sunday, they reinforced this point after being crowned the national football champions for the first time by beating Railways 3-0 in a one-sided final of the Santosh Trophy.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to term it as a fluke but Mizoram’s triumph is a culmination of a decade of hard work, overcoming the challenges posed by almost negligible infrastructure and the language barrier. In the last fortnight, they have asserted the point by brushing aside challenges from domestic giants like Kerala, Maharashtra, Manipur and Tamil Nadu en route to their maiden title.</p>
<p>“So far, we did not have the results to back up our potential. But in the last few years, we have worked very hard. Our growth was not noticed by the national media,” says Lalnghinglova Hmar, the general secretary of Mizoram Football Association.</p>
<p>Barring a brief upswing in the 1980s, when a semi-professional league consisting of government units was formed, the state has had no structure despite the game ranking high in public interest.</p>
<p>Shlo Malsawmtluanga, considered to be the pioneering professional in Mizo football, says the conservative mindset of the locals too hampered the growth. “It was tough to believe that you could make football a profession; playing the game was considered waste of time and everyone stressed on studies,” Shlo says.</p>
<p>It isn’t surprising, considering that Mizoram has a 92 percent literacy rate, highest in India after Kerala.</p>
<p>But despite the high literacy, language has been a roadblock. The majority Christian population speaks only Mizo, very few can talk in English and even less in Hindi. “So even though the players were talented, they lacked confidence in venturing out of the state,” Shlo adds.</p>
<p>Lack of corporate backing and professional clubs almost spelled the death knell for the local game. The game’s custodians back then did not feel they were good enough to compete with the rest of the country and whenever they sent the team for a tournament, they got thrashed.</p>
<p><strong>Professional contract </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>But the landscape slowly changed. In 2002, Shlo became the first footballer from the state to sign a professional contract with a NFL team (East Bengal). The following year, their under-16 team won the Mir Iqbal Hussain Trophy, their first-ever domestic title at any level. Nearly half-a-dozen players from that team were picked in the junior national team and one of them, Zaidin Mawin, went on to captain the junior India team.</p>
<p>These incidents triggered development, which reached its peak in the last five years. From having virtually no proper ground to play football, the state now boasts of four artificial turfs sponsored by the state government.</p>
<p>Improved facilities resulted in a proper local structure and in 2012, the Mizoram Premier League was established, which consists of eight teams and is telecast live on local television.</p>
<p>“This (Santosh Trophy win) is a direct result of having a strong league. In fact, we are also reigning junior national champions, which is a testimony to our robust developmental program,” Hmar says. The impact is also visible on the national scene. Around 20 players from Mizoram play for different clubs in the I-League with Dika and Dempo’s Jeje Lalpekhlua being the most prominent faces. And in the under-19 Asian Championships last October, five players in the squad of 23 were from Mizoram.</p>
<p>“In fact, the likes of Dika and Jeje are not even the best players we have. They are the fortunate ones who got the break. There are many other good players who do not get the chanceto play at the higher level,” Hmar says.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2006018&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>A South African court blocked all live broadcasts of graphic post-mortem details of Oscar Pistorius&#8217;s slain girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in the star sprinter&#8217;s murder trial that is receiving worldwide coverage.</p>
<p>&#8220;There shall be no live broadcast of the evidence of Professor Saayman,&#8221; Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled before the testimony of Gert Saayman, who conducted the post-mortem examination on the 29-year-old model and law graduate.</p>
<p>&#8220;That applies to Twitter,&#8221; Masipa added.</p>
<p>As a compromise media suggested to compile a summary of the testimony and only broadcast after the state and defence agreed on the content. Masipa said she would rule on the application Tuesday.</p>
<p>Professor Saayman earlier asked that his testimony not be broadcast for ethical reasons.</p>
<p>He said the graphic nature of the autopsy report may infringe on Steenkamp&#8217;s dignity and harm unsuspecting members of the public who saw or heard the testimony.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that it goes against the good morals of society for us to make information of this nature available in a manner that vulnerable or unsuspecting people in society may be exposed,&#8221; Saayman told the court.</p>
<p>Pistorius, charged with the pre-planned murder of Steenkamp on Valentine&#8217;s Day last year, says he mistook his girlfriend for an intruder when he fired four shots through a locked bathroom at his home in the dead of night.</p>
<p>Media organisations won unprecedented rights to broadcast on television large chunks of the court proceedings, while audio of the whole trial is allowed.</p>
<p>But the Paralympic athlete&#8217;s own testimony, as well as that of witnesses who do not want their images published, will not be available on television.</p>
<p>The ban followed one earlier on Monday which forbade all publication during the trial of photos of witnesses who don&#8217;t want their images made public &#8212; even if they were sourced elsewhere.</p>
<p>Last week media organisations had broadcast and published photos of the state&#8217;s first witness, University of Pretoria lecturer Michelle Burger, found on other websites.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am warning the media, if you do not behave, you will not be treated with soft gloves,&#8221; the judge said at the time.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s photo ban extended witness protection much further than usual, after Judge Masipa came under fire for failing to do enough to protect witnesses from intrusive media coverage and defence lawyers&#8217; aggressive interrogation.</p>
<p>The debate over media coverage of the trial has taken up a lot of court time and set several precedents in South African legal history.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005844&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>World Championship silver winner Amit Kumar Dahiya will spearhead the Indian challenge in their maiden Freestyle World Cup in Los Angeles from March 15-16 in the absence of Olympic medallists Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt.</p>
<p>The Indian contingent, comprising of Dahiya (57kg), Bajrang (61kg), Rajnesh (65kg), Amit Dhankar (70kg), Praveen Rana (74kg), Pawan Kumar (86kg), Satyavrat (97kg), Krishan Kumar (125), along with three coaches Anil Mann, Anil Kumar and Vinod Kumar, left for the American city last night to attend a preparatory camp, which will conclude on March 13.</p>
<p>Two-time Olympic champion Sushil and London Games bronze medallist Yogeshwar have been given rest by the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) from national duties.</p>
<p>The two celebrated grapplers haven&#8217;t taken the mat since their medal-winning feat at London Games in 2012 and both are eyeing return at the Commonwealth Games in July this year.</p>
<p>Before the Commonwealth Games, Sushil and Yogeshwar are expected to compete in two invitational tournaments in May-June in Italy. Sushil will compete in 70kg while Yogeshwar will be seen in action in 65kg.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a good chance of winning the medal in all eight weight categories. We had a good pre-tournament preparation at the Sonepat centre and all the boys are ready to take on the world&#8217;s best at the championship,&#8221; chief national coach Vinod Kumar told PTI before leaving for Los Angeles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a strong team and I am confident that boys will make us proud in our first appearance at the event,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>India had earned a maiden World Cup berth on the back of its best-ever sixth-place finish in men&#8217;s free-style at the World Championships in Budapest last year in September. The World Championship acted as a qualifying event for the World Cup.</p>
<p>India finished the tournament in the men&#8217;s freestyle category with 23 points, which catapulted the country to sixth in rankings behind Iran, Russia, Georgia, Ukraine and USA.</p>
<p>As per FILA rules, the top eight teams in the World Championship automatically qualify for the World Cup and Dahiya&#8217;s silver medal in the 55-kg and Bajrang&#8217;s bronze in the 60-kg freestyle category had ensured India their maiden World Cup appearance this year.</p>
<p>Prior to this, India&#8217;s best-ever finish in the World Championship in men&#8217;s category came in 2009 when it finished 10th, while the country finished 13th in 2010 and 31st in 2011.</p>
<p>&#8220;There would be two groups with five nations in each pool at the World Cup. It&#8217;s a team event and we are expecting some tough competition from Iran, Russia and Ukraine. The last tournament at Colarado Springs has benefited our wrestlers immensely and the experience will definitely hold us in good stead,&#8221; said Kumar.</p>
<p>Kumar also informed that after the World Cup, the Indian team will leave for Oklahoma city on March 17 to participate in a two-day invitational tournament beginning March 18.</p>
<p>The invitational tourney will see participation from 8-10 countries, said Kumar.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005830&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rajasthan Royals appointed star Australian all-rounder Shane Watson captain of the Jaipur franchise for the upcoming Indian Premier League in place of the retired Rahul Dravid who was anointed its mentor.</p>
<p>Former India captain Dravid, who retired from all forms of cricket last year, will be involved in all aspects of cricket strategy &#8211; mentoring the team and guiding youth and talent development initiatives for the franchise, Royals announced on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am honoured to lead the Rajasthan Royals, an extraordinary team which has always given me amazing opportunities,&#8221; said the 32-year-old Australian on his new appointment for the upcoming IPL season scheduled to start next month.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Compatriot) Shane Warne and Rahul Dravid had a lot of faith in me while they were captains and gave me opportunities that helped improve my cricket. I hope to live up to the confidence shown in me by the franchise and give our fans an exciting season of cricket,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to thank our fans for showing trust in me through their votes on the digital medium. The Royals are one big family and I feel very privileged to be a part of such a special franchise,&#8221; he added about the franchise&#8217;s initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;My aim will be to continue playing our best cricket and maintain the winning momentum. We all want to repeat the 2008 IPL success and last season, we were quite close to that. I am confident that we can do it again,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Welcoming Watson&#8217;s elevation, Dravid described the burly Aussie as a player with top notch leadership skills.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to congratulate Shane Watson on his appointment as the Captain of the Royals. He is not only one of the world&#8217;s best all-rounders, but a leader par excellence,&#8221; the team&#8217;s new mentor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watson has been with the team since the first season and is familiar with the players and the staff. The Royals Squad is a bunch of extremely energetic and talented players who know their roles perfectly well and I am sure they will thrive<br />
under Watson&#8217;s inspiring leadership,&#8221; Dravid added.</p>
<p>Watson has been with the Royals since the inaugural season in 2008.</p>
<p>Watson&#8217;s strong performances helped the Royals win the IPL in its debut year, when he played under Shane Warne.</p>
<p>The strongly built Australian displayed his all-round skills and match-winning performances in crucial ties, and was eventually adjudged Player of the Tournament.</p>
<p>The Queensland-based all-rounder continued to play an integral part in subsequent editions and, in 2012, he played under Dravid.</p>
<p>Last year, Watson scored his first century in IPL and Twenty20, playing against Chennai Super Kings at the latter&#8217;s fortress &#8211; the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chepauk.</p>
<p>His took the team to the play-offs that year, with Watson winning his second Player of the Tournament award. Watson was won the prestigious Allan Border Medal in 2010 and 2011 awarded by Cricket Australia, becoming the second player, after Ricky Ponting, to achieve the feat.</p>
<p>He was also the Player of the Tournament in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 for scoring a total of 249 with an average of 49.80, while taking 11 wickets with the ball.</p>
<p>Watson has been Royals&#8217; best all-rounder, notching 1,785 runs in 55 matches, scoring one century and 11 half-centuries at a strike rate of 145.59. In bowling, he claimed 48 wickets with a best figure of 3/10.</p>
<p>Royals CEO Raghu Iyer praised Watson&#8217;s gritty demeanour.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are delighted to announce Watson as Captain. He epitomises all the values of the Royals franchise with his true grit and never-say-die attitude. His skills and experience will surely help the team build on the superb performance last season. His presence in the team will also help young players like Sanju Samson, Unmukt Chand, James Faulkner, Steve Smith and Tim Southee,&#8221; said Iyer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d also like to thank our fans who have supported us unstintingly and came out strongly on the digital medium in favour of Watto as Captain for the upcoming seasons,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For the 2014 IPL season before the players&#8217; auction, the Royals had retained Watson, Ajinkya Rahane, James Faulkner, Stuart Binny and Sanju Samson.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005711&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/uweroslerapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005707" alt="Rosler, who has helped steer the club back into promotion contention, said he had watched and learnt from Wigan's loss to City in the Premier League in April (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/uweroslerapm.jpg" /></a> Rosler, who has helped steer the club back into promotion contention, said he had watched and learnt from Wigan&#8217;s loss to City in the Premier League in April (AP)
<p>Former manager Roberto Martinez and FA Cup final hero Ben Watson were the inspiration behind Wigan Athletic&#8217;s quarter-final <a title="Wigan Athletic stun Manchester City again in FA Cup" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/wigan-athletic-stun-manchester-city-again-in-fa-cup/" target="_blank">upset win over English Premier League aristocrats Manchester City</a>, victorious manager Uwe Rosler said.</p>
<p>The holders were given little hope of repeating their 1-0 final win over City in May, masterminded by now Everton boss Martinez and sealed with a Watson header in stoppage time which gave them their first major trophy.</p>
<p>But the Championship (second tier) club were not overawed by the task and produced a majestic, fearless display to dispel the doubters with Jordi Gomez&#8217;s 27th penalty giving them a shock lead before James Perch doubled the advantage minutes into the second half.</p>
<p>Sami Nasri cut the lead with 20 minutes left but Wigan, relegated from the Premier League despite their cup exploits last term, somehow held firm against a barrage of attacks from the home side to set up a last four meeting with Arsenal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drained. Happy,&#8221; former City striker Rosler told reporters of his feelings after the final whistle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very happy for my players and staff and for Ben Watson, because he was a big incentive for us to do well for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watson, who missed most of last season through injury before returning to net the Wembley winner against City in May, missed Sunday&#8217;s memorable away success after suffering a double leg break in last month&#8217;s league win at Barnsley.</p>
<p>Also proving an outside aide was popular former coach Martinez, whose Everton side were knocked out of the cup on Saturday by Arsenal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last season was an unbelievable achievement from Roberto and his men to win the FA Cup and put Wigan on the map worldwide,&#8221; said Rosler, who left third tier Brentford to replace Owen Coyle at Wigan in December.</p>
<p>&#8220;But to follow that up and reach the semi-final of the FA Cup is equally strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosler, who has helped steer the club back into promotion contention, said he had watched and learnt from Wigan&#8217;s loss to City in the Premier League in April, less than a month before the FA Cup final success.</p>
<p>&#8220;I studied Roberto&#8217;s tactics. He put out a very brave gameplan. I saw the league game where City won in the last five minutes 1-0 and Roberto&#8217;s team played periods to perfection.</p>
<p>&#8220;We tried to replicate part of it but bringing our own identity, pressing and counter-attacking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt in the first half we surprised Manchester City because a lot of teams show Manchester City respect deservedly. Our only chance was to keep the ball in tight areas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The visitors, though, struggled to keep the ball in the closing stages and their fine work looked to have been undone in the 84th minute when City substitute James Milner squared the ball for Edin Dzeko to knock into an empty net.</p>
<p>But somehow, Wigan defender Emmerson Boyce angled a long leg in front of the City striker and deflected the shot from five metres over the crossbar as the visitors hung on against the odds.</p>
<p>&#8220;That tackle was a match-winning, decisive moment for us,&#8221; Rosler said. &#8220;That has shown the desire and willpower we have shown today.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only take my hat off.

<p>Novak Djokovic remained on course for his first title of the season with a second round victory over Victor Hanescu 7-6 6-2 at the BNP Paribas Open on Sunday.</p>
<p>Djokovic, the second ranked player in the world, is off to a slow 2014 and has only defeats at the Australian Open and the Dubai Duty Free Championship to show for thus far.</p>
<p>He failed to reach the final in either event, but does bring positive vibes to Indian Wells, California where he is a two-time champion.</p>
<p>Facing the Romanian Hanescu, Djokovic fended off five break points during the competitive opening set before dominating the tiebreaker and taking complete control of the match from there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t make any returns in the first set. (In the) Second set I also struggled with the return, which is one of my better sides in the game generally speaking,&#8221; Djokovic told reporters after registering his 550th career win, the sixth active player to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first match and it takes a little bit of time to get used to the center court. I haven&#8217;t played on it this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Djokovic will next face Alejandro Gonzalez who made the third round by defeating Ivan Dodig 6-4 2-6 7-6.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the draw, a couple of high seeds were sent home packing early.</p>
<p>Fourth seed Tomas Berdych was upset by Spain&#8217;s Roberto Bautista Agut 4-6 6-2 6-4.</p>
<p>Berdych had been in strong form, winning 11 matches in a row in February, but slipped up in the early loss.</p>
<p>Sixth seed Juan Martin del Potro withdrew because of a left wrist injury that had also forced him out of the Dubai tourney last week.</p>
<p>Ninth seed Jo-Willfried Tsonga, of France, also bowed out in a 6-4 6-4 loss to fellow countryman Julien Benneteau.</p>
<p>Eighth seed Richard Gasquet and 12th seed John Isner advanced after surviving a volatile day.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005673&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/misbahapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005669" alt="Pakistan is one of the most successful teams in the shortest format of the game (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/misbahapm.jpg" /></a> Pakistan is one of the most successful teams in the shortest format of the game (AP)
<p>Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq said Monday his players&#8217; performance in the Asia Cup had raised his hopes for the team in the upcoming World Twenty20.</p>
<p>Pakistan pulled off stunning run chases against India and Bangladesh, but lost the lopsided final to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Misbah said the run-scoring by the likes of Ahmed Shehzad, Umar Akmal and Shahid Afridi on Bangladesh wickets indicated the team can perform well when that country hosts the World Twenty20 from March 16.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a disappointment that we couldn&#8217;t win the final, but the morale of the team is very good,&#8221; Misbah said after arriving home from Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a very good chance (in World Twenty20) &#8230; especially the batsmen are in good form.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pakistan is in a challenging group for the World Twenty20; facing India, Australia, defending champion West Indies and a qualifier.</p>
<p>Afridi hit successive sixes in last over for a one-wicket win against India and then his robust fifty off 18 balls earned Pakistan its biggest ever every chase of 327 against Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Pakistan is one of the most successful teams in the shortest format of the game, having qualified for the ianugural World Twenty20 final in 2007 and then two years later won the event in England.</p>
<p>While 39-year-old Misbah continues to play in the domestic Twenty20, he quit T20 internationals in 2012 and was replaced by Mohammad Hafeez as the captain.</p>
<p>Soon after the loss to Sri Lanka on Saturday, former Pakistan cricketers &#8211; Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Yousuf and Sikander Bakht &#8211; called for change in captaincy for country&#8217;s one-day team too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need aggressive captain in one-day internationals and for that we should once again make Afridi as captain,&#8221; Yousuf and Bakht told private Geo Television.</p>
<p>However, Akhtar&#8217;s choice was Saeed Ajmal, who took 11 wickets and was the joint leading wicket-taker in the Asia Cup with Sri Lanka&#8217;s pace ace Lasith Malinga.</p>
<p>Pakistan sorely missed 7-foot-1 injured fast bowler Mohammad Irfan, given that fit-again pace bowler Umar Gul struggled on the slow wickets of Bangladesh, taking just five wickets in five matches with an expensive economy rate of 6.23.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t an easy tour, especially for fast bowlers,&#8221; Misbah said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know in Asia conditions are conducive for spin bowlers and it doesn&#8217;t help fast bowlers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor fielding also hurt Pakistan in the final with Akmal, Sharjeel Khan and Hafeez dropping catches.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean that coaches aren&#8217;t working or the boys are not doing hard work in the field,&#8221; Misbah said. &#8220;We try our best but unfortunately in important matches we missed a few chances.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005662&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Real Madrid took full advantage of Barcelona&#8217;s shock loss at Real Valladolid with a 3-0 home win over 10-man Levante on Sunday that put Carlo Ancelotti&#8217;s in-form side three points clear at the top of La Liga.</p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo, the leading scorer in Spain this season, took his tally to 24 goals when he headed the opener from Angel Di Maria&#8217;s corner in the 11th minute and Marcelo added a second from Ronaldo&#8217;s assist four minutes after the break.</p>
<p>David Navarro was harshly shown a straight red card in the 64th minute for an innocuous-looking tackle on Ronaldo and fellow Levante defender Nikos Karampelas put the ball into his own net nine minutes from time.</p>
<p>Ronaldo, who became Portugal&#8217;s leading scorer with a double against Cameroon in Wednesday&#8217;s 5-1 friendly victory, came close to a second in the 90th minute when he headed against the underside of the crossbar and Gareth Bale whistled a low shot just past the post in added time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was a perfect game but we were close,&#8221; Marcelo said in an interview with Spanish television broadcaster Canal Plus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were a bit weaker in the first half than the second but the important thing was that we didn&#8217;t concede any goals and in that respect we have improved a lot,&#8221; added the Brazil international.</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t afford to stumble today and of course it&#8217;s better when the others lose but we are focusing on ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Real, unbeaten in 29 matches in all competitions, have 67 points with 11 matches left and Atletico Madrid are three behind in second after they won 2-0 at Celta Vigo on Saturday.</p>
<p>Champions Barca, who play at Real in the La Liga &#8220;Clasico&#8221; in two weeks time, turned in one of their worst performances of the campaign on Saturday at Valladolid, who are battling relegation, and slipped to third on 63 points.</p>
<p>Seventh-placed Sevilla boosted their chances of qualifying for Europe again this season with a 3-1 win at Almeria, while mid-table Espanyol stayed in the hunt for a place in continental competition with a 3-1 success at home to Elche.</p>
<p>Fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao can move nine points clear of Villarreal, who lost 2-0 at Granada on Saturday, with a win at Valencia later on Sunday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005607&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marlon Samuels blasted an unbeaten 69 off just 46 balls to spur West Indies to an easy 27-run victory over England in their first Twenty20 international at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Sunday.</p>
<p>Samuels helped West Indies compile an impressive total of 170 for three after Chris Gayle got the innings off to a flying start with a quickfire 43.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been working hard, but the hard work is paying off,&#8221; Samuels said in a post-match interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love to play cricket in Barbados, the pitch was one you could play your shots on, so we had to back ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>England, who beat the West Indies 2-1 in their three match one-day series, could only muster 143 for nine in reply and never really  looked like getting to their target.</p>
<p>All-rounder Tim Bresnan top scored for England with 47 not out off 29 deliveries but his late blast counted for little after the tourists had slumped to 73-6 in the 12th over.</p>
<p>Spinner Samuel Badree was the pick of the West Indian bowlers, taking 3-17 off four overs, including the stumpings of Alex Hales and Luke Wright in successive balls after Sunil Narine only managed two overs because of injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t get going today, but that can happen in T20 when you a chasing a good score,&#8221; said England captain Stuart Broad, who also struggled with a sore knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a touch of patellar tendonitis and may not play the next two games to get ready for the World T20.&#8221;</p>
<p>The teams will meet again at Bridgetown on Tuesday and Thursday as part of their preparations for the fifth Twenty20 World Cup, starting in Bangladesh later this month.</p>
<p>West Indies are the defending champions after winning the last World Cup in 2012 while England won the previous title in 2010, defeating Australia in the final at Kensington Oval..</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005602&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Manchester City&#8217;s hopes of an unprecedented quadruple were in tatters on Sunday after holders Wigan Athletic repeated their FA Cup heroics with a stunning 2-1 victory in their quarter-final at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>Jordi Gomez&#8217;s first-half penalty and a tap-in by James Perch gave Wigan, who beat City 1-0 in the FA Cup final at Wembley last May, a place in this semis against Arsenal. City, who won the League Cup last Sunday and need to overturn a two-goal deficit to Barcelona in the second leg of their Champions League tie, looked jaded against their second-tier opponents until they staged a thrilling late fightback.</p>
<p>Frenchman Samir Nasri made City&#8217;s breakthrough in the 68th minute with a sweet 20-metre left-foot strike. Substitute Edin Dzeko came within inches of forcing a replay, but Emmerson Boyce produced a remarkable last-ditch block and Wigan, managed by former City favourite Uwe Rosler, held on.</p>
<p><strong>Sheffield dream on</strong></p>
<p>English third-tier club Sheffield United kept alive their FA Cup dream when two goals in as many minutes gave them a 2-0 victory over Charlton Athletic and a place in the semi-finals. They were joined in the last four by Hull City, who overcame a missed penalty by Sone Aluko to trounce Sunderland 3-0 in their all-Premier League quarterfinal.<br />
Hull&#8217;s Curtis Davies, David Meyler and Matty Fryatt scored in a nine-minute spell, capitalising on two wretched mistakes by Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole as Steve Bruce&#8217;s club advanced to the semis for the first time since 1930.</p>
<p>At Bramall Lane, second-half strikes from Ryan Flynn and John Brayford caught second-tier Charlton cold, as the Blades became the first third-tier team since 2001 to reach the semis.</p>
<p>Midfielder Flynn put four-times Cup winners United ahead in the 65th minute, when he sneaked in at the far post to nudge home from a left-wing cross from man-of-the-match Jose Baxter.</p>
<p>One minute, 42 seconds later the home side doubled their lead. Jamie Murphy&#8217;s surging run down the left set up defender Brayford, whose low 20-metre effort took a cruel deflection off the visitors&#8217; Richard Wood and rolled into the net.</p>
<p>Charlton &#8211; who were aiming to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 1947, when they won the Cup &#8211; were left to rue a glaring miss by Callum Harriott when the score was still level.</p>
<p>Marcus Tudgay burst on to a quick free kick and hooked the ball back into the danger area, but with the United keeper out of position and half of the goal at his mercy, Harriott sidefooted wide.</p>
<p>Hull also advanced to the semifinals by beating Sunderland 3-0 in an all-Premier League clash. Tigers captain Curtis Davies rose highest in the 68th to head in Tom Huddlestone&#8217;s free kick, before David Meyler supplied a cool finish four minutes later after chasing down a punt upfield from George Boyd. Lee Cattermole played a shocking back pass which left the lurking Matty Fryatt with the simplest of chances just minutes later.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tigerwoodsusatodaysportsm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005466" alt="Tiger Woods’6-under-66 was the lowest round of the tournament so far (USA Today Sports)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tigerwoodsusatodaysportsm.jpg" /></a> Tiger Woods’6-under-66 was the lowest round of the tournament so far (USA Today Sports)
<p>Patrick Reed had a 3-under 69 in tamer conditions to take a two-shot lead on Saturday into a Cadillac Championship final round that will prominently feature Tiger Woods for the first time this year.</p>
<p>Reed rolled in a 40-foot eagle putt on No. 8, and started the back nine with consecutive birdies. He drove the green on the par-4 16th for a two-putt birdie and wound up with a two-shot lead over US PGA Championship winner Jason Dufner (68) and Hunter Mahan, who bogeyed his last hole for a 71.</p>
<p>Woods delivered the low round of the tournament and his best round of the year. He made three birdie putts of about 15 feet or longer on the back nine, including a 35-footer down the slope on the par-5 15th, and had a 6-under 66. His goal was to get back to even par for the tournament and hope to be within five shots of the leader. It turned out much better.</p>
<p><strong>Under-par Woods</strong></p>
<p>WOODS was one of five players who were under par, and he goes into Sunday only three shots behind as he tries to win at Doral for the fifth time. Jamie Donaldson of Wales escaped from the palm trees right of the 18th and made par for a 71 to share fourth place with Woods. “It was nice to get back in the tournament again,&#8221; Woods said.</p>
<p>Reed will be going for his third win in his last 14 starts dating to the Wyndham Championship in August. He was at 4-under 212, the highest score to lead after 54 holes at Doral since a three-way tie at 212 in 1985. The lack of big wind certainly helped with scoring and attitudes. The average score was 72.6, compared with 76.0 in the second round, allowing for plenty of movement on the leaderboard on a sunny afternoon in Miami. “Now it&#8217;s playing more like a normal course,&#8221; Woods said.</p>
<p>A dozen players were within five shots of the lead going into Sunday. Dustin Johnson failed to birdie three of the par 5s and chopped up the 14th hole, which featured one shot he hit left-handed. He birdied the last hole for a 73 that put him at even-par 144, along with Miguel Angel Jimenez (69) and Zach Johnson (71).</p>
<p>Jimmy Walker, already a three-time winner this season who is starting to feel like contending is a habit, had a 67 and was in the group five shots behind with Bubba Watson, Graeme McDowell and Matt Kuchar. “The tournament will not be over until the last putt drops on 18,”Mahan said. “That always happens, but it seems like you just can&#8217;t coast in here. You can&#8217;t have a big enough lead going into 18 this week. So I don&#8217;t think anyone is going to be too bothered if someone gets out to a three- or four-shot lead, because there&#8217;s so much golf out there. And there&#8217;s so much that can happen — good and bad.”</p>
<p><strong>Early move</strong></p>
<p>Woods made his move early and late, pouring four birdies in eight holes to go out in 33. Looking confident with the putter, he made birdie putts of 15 feet on No. 11, 20 feet on the par-5 20th, and then followed his long birdie putt on the 15th with a bunker shot that narrowly cleared the clip and settled a few feet away for birdie on the 16th. His only blunders came on par 3s — a three-putt bogey on No. 4 and taking two shots to get out of the bunker on No. 13.</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy was only one shot out of the lead when he went just long on the seventh hole with a pitching wedge and made bogey. He then hit into the water on the par-5 eighth with his second shot, and the par-5 10th with his tee shot. He made double bogey both times and only a chip-in birdie on the 18th salvaged his hopes. He had a 75 and was seven shots behind. Much like Reed, Dufner did his damage in one span. It started with a shot that kissed off the pin on No. 5. That was the start of six birdies in eight holes, though he had to settle for six pars at the end.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005229&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/andymurrayapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005471" alt="Andy Murray was down a set and a break against Lukas Rosol. He eventually won 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/andymurrayapm.jpg" /></a> Andy Murray was down a set and a break against Lukas Rosol. He eventually won 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 (AP)
<p>Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka won their opening matches Saturday in the BNP Paribas Open. Federer, the four-time champion seeded seventh, beat French qualifier Pail-Henri Mathieu. The Swiss star was coming off his 78th career title last week in Dubai. “It&#8217;s important to win,&#8221; he said. “It&#8217;s a lot different from Dubai. You have to force a bit more, but I&#8217;m satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a late match, the top-seeded Nadal rallied to beat Radek Stepanek 2-6, 6-4, 7-5. “He is not the right player to play against in the first round,&#8221; Nadal said. “He&#8217;s not the right player because what you want to find in the first round is rhythm and against him every point is different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nadal is 41-6 in his 10 appearances here and has made it to the semifinals or better for the past eight years. But he said worries about his back affected his serve during the 2-hour, 24-minute contest. “With my serve I was doing nothing. When that happens, the opponent is able to play more aggressive, play more confident and in the end, eight double faults, I give him an opportunity to win a lot of free points,&#8221; Nadal said.</p>
<p>The fifth-seeded Murray topped Lukas Rosol 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, and the third-seeded Wawrinka, playing for the first time since winning the Australian Open, beat Ivo Karlovic 6-3, 7-5. Kevin Anderson and Tommy Haas also moved into the third round. Anderson spoiled two-time tournament champion Lleyton Hewitt&#8217;s bid for his 600th career match win, topping the Australian 7-6 (5), 6-4. Haas, who will be 36 on April 3, rolled to a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Jeremy Chardy.</p>
<p>In women&#8217;s play, top-seeded Na beat Chinese compatriot Zheng Jie 6-1, 7-5, and fourth-seeded Maria Sharapova opened her title defense with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over Julia Goerges. Fifth-seeded Angelique Kerber dropped out, falling 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4 to Maria-Teresa Torro-Flor. Aleksandra Wozniack also beat No. 15 Sabine Lisicki 7-5, 1-6, 7-6 (5).</p>
<p>Murray reached the final in 2009, but has mostly struggled in the event. “I think it&#8217;s important sometimes to think about it, because when you&#8217;re not expecting it to happen and then it does, that&#8217;s when it can kind of take you by surprise and you might panic a little bit or worry,&#8221; Murray said.</p>
<p>Li is playing her second event since winning the Australian Open. “This is the first match after Doha, two weeks, and of course for I cannot be 100 percent for the first match,&#8221; Li said. “But I was happy. At least I can learn something.&#8221;</p>
<p>Li will face Karolina Pliskova, a 7-5, 6-2 winner over No. 28 Klara Zakopalova. Eighth-seeded Petra Kvitova, No. 11 Ana Ivanovic and No. 12 Dominika Cibulkova also won early matches.</p>
<p><strong>Sania-Cara in QF</strong></p>
<p>FIFTH seeds Sania Mirza and Cara Black reached the quarterfinals of the WTA Paribas Open following a straight sets victory over Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears. The Indo-Zimbabwean pair beat the unseeded American combo 6-3 6-4 in one hour and 12 minutes in the second round of the hard court Premier WTA tournament.</p>
<p>Sania and Cara saved five of the eight break chances they faced while converting  five of the nine chances they got. Sania and Cara have not gone beyond the quarterfinals in four tournaments they have played this season. At Australian Open and Doha they reached the last-eight stage while at the season-opener in Sydney and in Dubai they made first round exit.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005222&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/samueletoapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005442" alt="Samuel Eto’o brings out the ‘walking stick’ celebration after his 300th career goal, taking a dig at coach Mourinho, who had said: “I have Eto'o, but he is 32 years old, maybe 35, I don't know,” a few weeks back (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/samueletoapm.jpg" /></a> Samuel Eto’o brings out the ‘walking stick’ celebration after his 300th career goal, taking a dig at coach Mourinho, who had said: “I have Eto&#8217;o, but he is 32 years old, maybe 35, I don&#8217;t know,” a few weeks back (AP)
<p>Chelsea kept up its remorseless march to the English Premier League title with a 4-0 thrashing of Tottenham on Saturday, while a rejuvenated Mesut Ozil helped Arsenal secure a place in the FA Cup semifinals for the first time since 2009.</p>
<p>With none of its title rivals — Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City — in league action this weekend, Chelsea provisionally extended its lead to seven points after capitalizing on a woeful second half from Spurs to score all its goals in the final 34 minutes.</p>
<p>Samuel Eto&#8217;o opened the scoring and then was fouled in the area by Younes Kaboul, earning the French defender a straight red card. Eden Hazard converted the 60th-minute penalty, and substitute Demba Ba added two late goals in the space of 75 seconds.</p>
<p>Liverpool and Arsenal are seven points behind the leaders with a game in hand but Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho still thinks Manchester City, which is nine points adrift in fourth place having played three matches less, is the title favorite.</p>
<p>“We don&#8217;t have control of our destiny,” Mourinho said, “if we win all our matches then maybe we are not champions. If Man City win all their games, they are champions.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in a truncated league program, beleaguered champion Manchester United eased past West Bromwich Albion 3-0 to climb to sixth and keep alive its faint hopes of finishing in the Champions League positions.</p>
<p>Arsenal beat Everton 4-1 at Emirates Stadium to become the first team through to the last four of the FA Cup, with substitute Olivier Giroud scoring two of the hosts&#8217; three goals in the final 22 minutes.</p>
<p>Yet it was the display of Ozil that stood out, the Germany playmaker responding to criticism of his lackluster recent performances by scoring the opening goal in the seventh minute, setting up Giroud&#8217;s second and working tirelessly for the team.</p>
<p>“Physically he looked regenerated, with more power in his runs,” Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said, “and, as well, what I liked is he did a lot of dirty work for a player like him.”</p>
<p>Arsenal is without a trophy since 2005, with the FA Cup its likeliest chance of ending the drought after a drop in form in the league and a 2-0 loss to Bayern Munich in the first leg of the Champions League last 16.  The other FA Cup quarterfinal matches are on Sunday.</p>
<p>Tottenham&#8217;s 24-year winless run at Stamford Bridge extended to 27 matches after the team imploded after a dominant first-half display. Spurs stayed in fifth, four points behind City having played three games more, but manager Tim Sherwood believes finishing in the top four is out of the question.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of character: coach</strong></p>
<p>“The club talks about fourth —wake up,” Sherwood said. “You can&#8217;t legislate for the capitulation, you can&#8217;t have that. Lack of character, too many of them too nice to each other and you need to show a bit more guts and not want to be someone&#8217;s mate all the time.”</p>
<p>Mourinho is a game closer to winning the title in his first season back at Stamford Bridge and Chelsea&#8217;s run-in is easier than all its rivals, with Arsenal at home and Liverpool away the only tough matches — on paper, at least.</p>
<p>With seven clean sheets in its last 10 league games and unbeaten in 14 matches, the team is ekeing out wins even when it isn&#8217;t playing well. “We&#8217;re grinding out results like the old Mourinho teams,” Chelsea captain John Terry said.</p>
<p>The game turned on a mistake by Spurs defender Jan Vertonghen, who slipped and compounded his error by trying to hook the ball back to his goalkeeper. Eto&#8217;o nipped in and slotted a low finish into the corner. Kaboul&#8217;s red card then spelt the end for Tottenham.</p>
<p>Phil Jones, Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck scored for Man United at The Hawthorns, boosting confidence in the team that dropped to a season low after losing 2-0 at Olympiakos in the Champions League 11 days ago.</p>
<p>“We were hurt after losing to Olympiakos and we wanted to come and show everyone we&#8217;re a good team,”Rooney said. “We played with great energy and we always looked a threat.”</p>
<p>United is nine points behind City, which plays defending champion Wigan in the FA Cup on Sunday in a repeat of the 2013 final.</p>
<p>In other league games, Fulham stayed in last place after losing 3-1 at fellow struggler Cardiff, which is third from bottom but level on points with fourth-bottom West Brom. Southampton won 1-0 at Crystal Palace thanks to Jay Rodriguez&#8217;s goal and Norwich drew 1-1 with Stoke.</p>
<p><strong>Dortmund consolidate</strong></p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl scored the only goal as his team consolidated second place in the Bundesliga with a 1-0 win at his former club Freiburg on Sunday.</p>
<p>Kehl&#8217;s goal came against the run of play in the 58th minute when he swept the ball over Freiburg goalkeeper Oliver Baumann from around 25m with his left foot.</p>
<p>The result prevented Freiburg from escaping the relegation zone with a win. It would have been the club&#8217;s 100th home win in 500 Bundesliga games. Dortmund restored its 20-point gap behind runaway leader Bayern Munich, who are 20 points ahead. &#8220;Whoever wins these sorts of games becomes champions, but that doesn&#8217;t apply (this season),&#8221; Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp joked, referring to Bayern&#8217;s unprecedented form. Both Dortmund and Freiburg canceled each other out in a first half of few real threats, and there weren&#8217;t many more chances in the second.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a lucky win for us. You have to say that,&#8221; Dortmund defender Mats Hummels said. Dortmund&#8217;s Sokratis was fortunate to escape with just a yellow card at the end of the first when he appeared to take down the surging Philipp Zulechner.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he showed a card at all, it should be red as he was the last defender,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005211&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bhar-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005207" alt="Pacer Brainder Singh Sran switched from boxing to cricket with some success. He was a part of Punjab’s Vijay Hazare squad." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/bhar-m.jpg" /></a> Pacer Brainder Singh Sran switched from boxing to cricket with some success. He was a part of Punjab’s Vijay Hazare squad.
<p>Few Indian sportspersons have switched tracks from one sport to a completely different one like Brainder Singh Sran. Fewer still have done it as successfully as this Punjab left-arm seamer, who, by his own admission, was once not just another boy pursuing a career in boxing; he was an up-and-coming one at India’s punching nursery — Bhiwani.<br />
In 2009, when he was just 17 years old, Brainder — a cricket fanatic — was desperate to make something of himself. Living in Sirsa, the boxing academy in nearby Bhiwani allowed him to channelise his youthful energy in a positive way. Not long after he had enrolled to become a pugilist, Brainder realised that he was pretty good at it.</p>
<p>“I picked up the sport really quickly,” says Brainder. “What took most kids six months to learn, I mastered in a couple of months.” That knack of his caught the attention of Jagdish Singh, a coach who has honed several Olympic level talents, such as 2008 bronze medallist Vijender Singh. In fact, Brainder, weighing 75 kilos back then, found himself in the same weight category as India’s most famous pugilist.</p>
<p>“With Jagdish sir spending more time with me, I began improving drastically. He made sure that I trained hard and prepared thing like my diet charts and training schedule as well. And because I was a left-hander, he was sure that I would go on to do something big in the sport,” he says.</p>
<p>A renowned name, he perhaps might have become. But just a year into his coaching, Brainder fled Bhiwani without informing his coach. Why, you ask. Because the cricket fanatic saw something of an opportunity, when the Kings XI Punjab announced a talent hunt in Mohali, back in 2010. Coach Jagdish, as you would have guessed by now, was not a happy man.</p>
<p>“He is yet to speak to me since,” says Brainder. “His anger is justified as I just left suddenly without even informing him. He had done so much for me including the fact that I had been selected into the SAI training programme, where I could have stayed with the national-level boxers and trained. But I chose cricket, my passion, and decided to leave.”<br />
A door may have shut on one career but much to Brainder’s delight, another one had opened. Just two days after the trials at the talent hunt ended, Brainder made it to the IPL franchise’s probables, courtesy his sharp in-swingers and terrific speed. Although KXIP didn’t come through in the long run, Brainder had impressed many with his talent, including state-level coaches and more importantly, the selectors of the Punjab Cricket Association.</p>
<p><strong>Represnting punjab</strong></p>
<p>To date, Brainder has represented Punjab in first-class cricket in four matches, all of which arrived in 2011. Just when he was making a name for himself with as many as 14 wickets to his name, the fast bowler injured his thumb. He hasn’t played Ranji Trophy since, but was included in Punjab’s Vijay Hazare Trophy side during the North Zone leg of the ongoing event.</p>
<p>“It took me a year to heal my thumb. But I was not disheartened, because I know it takes at least four-five years at this level to grow into a decent fast bowler,” he says. “At just 21, I still have time on my side.”</p>
<p>So what are his plans for the rest of this season, which has already reached its fag end? “Once the season gets over, I am thinking to go back to Bhiwani to meet Jagdish sir,” he says. “It will help mend broken bridges and with my fitness.” Won’t coach Jagdish, though, have a problem with that plan of his? “Yes. But I don’t think he will recognise me instantly. Four years is a long time. But when he does, I know that he will be really angry,” he says, chuckling.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005206&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/chongweiapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005437" alt="This was the strongest final line-up at the All England in years, with all five categories boasting of the respective World No 1s in the summit clash (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/chongweiapm.jpg" /></a> This was the strongest final line-up at the All England in years, with all five categories boasting of the respective World No 1s in the summit clash (AP)
<p>Li Xuerui had pipped Shixian Wang when Chinese coaches picked their three challengers for the Olympics women’s singles two seasons back, despite being ranked lower given the former’s sturdier mental strength in the qualification period.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Shixian announced she could display the same ruthlessness as the Olympic champion, as she beat her Chinese team-mate 21-19, 21-18 employing a fine mix of dogged defending and deception.</p>
<p>Twice in the course of the final, Shixian’s cocked wristed, deft drops left Xuerui scrambling to reach the shuttle, and the World No 1 was down on all fours — palms and knees, as she fell back on the big points. Shixian’s new-found aggression supported her superior fitness as the London Games champ failed to find chinks to exploit as Shixian — seeded fourth, ranked 3 — picked her second All England title.</p>
<p>However, the most exciting match of the day saw Malaysia’s No 1 ranked Lee Chong Wei beat Chinese World No 2 Chen Long in an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation that saw much drama at the net where the two took turns hovering menacingly over each other. The Malaysian 33-year-old prevailed in most of those to claim his third All England title.</p>
<p>Chong Wei, playing in what could be his last All England (he could retire end-season), brought his experience into the game, wearying out his opponent’s patience in the longer rallies and exacting revenge for times past when the Chinese, his junior, had outmuscled him in finals, including last year’s championship match here.</p>
<p>Chong Wei, who has long been second-best to Lin Dan, was easily the tactical master showing the younger Chinese he wasn’t fading out soon.  This was the strongest final line-up at the All England in years, with all five categories boasting of the respective World No 1s in the summit clash.</p>
<p>Chinese women’s doubles’ world top-ranked Xiaoli Wang and Yang Yu got the better of Jin Ma and Yuanting Tang 21-17, 18-21, 23-21 in a marathon 1 hour 20 minute encounter, while Indonesian World No 1 pair Hendra Setiawan-Mohammad Ahsan beat Japanese No 2 combine of Hiroyuki Endo-Kenichi Hayakawa 21-19, 21-19. Indonesian Tontowi Ahmad was brilliant in the company of his mixed doubles partner Lilyana Natsir as they spat out some power-packed smashes to get the better of Chinese World No 1 Nan Zhang &#8211; Yunlei Zhao 21-13, 21-17. The Indonesians won with an identical scoreline as last year, for a three-peat at All England.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005203&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yusuf-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005200" alt="Yusuf Pathan has turned in a string of good performances for Baroda, with both bat and ball, in the Vijay Hazare group stages." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yusuf-m.jpg" /></a> Yusuf Pathan has turned in a string of good performances for Baroda, with both bat and ball, in the Vijay Hazare group stages.
<p>Services benefitted from a bizzare final round North Zone group game, where Delhi rested all their star players in a must-win match, to proceed to the knock out stages of the Vijay Hazare limited overs tournament, at the expense of the defending champions. They will have to do it all on their own as the pre-quarterfinals kick off in Kolkata on Monday.</p>
<p>Services take on Vidarbha while Baroda will play Railways in the other round of 16 fixture.</p>
<p>With the likes of Mumbai and Delhi out early and Karnataka and Tamil Nadu not playing their quarterfinal games until Tuesday, the star quotient, as much as it is applicable to the Vijay Hazare tournament, will come from the Baroda-Railways game. The Pathan brothers have pulled their weight for Baroda in the tournament — Yusuf  has 229 runs at an average of 76.33 to go with his three wickets while Irfan averages over 40 with the bat and has picked up seven wickets so far in the tournament.</p>
<p>Add to the mix the experience of Munaf Patel and the form of Kedar Devdhar, whose two hundreds puts him third on the runs list, and you have a competent outfit. In fact, it was the Pathans and Devdhar that were the major contributors in Baroda’s win against Maharashtra in the final West Zone league game, the one that ensured progress.</p>
<p>Railways, though, do not have the luxury of a band of players that it can rely on. Put together, the entire squad has just one score of more than fifty, courtesy wicket-keeper Mahesh Rawat. But it is in the bowling department that Railways have leaned heavily on one performer, medium pacer Anureet Singh.</p>
<p>Anureet Singh ran through Rajasthan with a six-for in Railways’ last game against Rajasthan and picked up four in the game before that against Madhya Pradesh. His 13 wickets in three games puts him third on the bowlers’ list. No other Railways bowler has more than three. All put together, Baroda will start the game as favourites.</p>
<p>Services, in their game against Vidarbha, will look no further than 22-year old Rajat Paliwal to get them going. The No. 4 batsman has enjoyed a good start to his List A career, averaging 62.12. But it is still early days for the batsman from Haryana, who has played just 11 List A games so far.</p>
<p>What they have lacked in batting prowess, Services have made up in the bowling department, with left arm orthodox bowlers Avishek Sinha (12 wickets), Avishek Sakuja (10 wickets) keeping batsmen in check and picking up wickets simultaneously.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen, though, if the Kolkata track will have too much to offer for the slow bowlers. Umesh Yadav will man the lines for Vidarbha, who seem lacking in both departments, and will hope the pacer does enough to see them through to the quarters.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005196&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/miz-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005189 " alt="For Mizoram, Zico Zoremsanga scored either side of half time, while F Lalrinpuia sealed the win with a late goal, in injury time to beat Railways. Mizoram had steamrolled opponents right through the event to make for a convincing triumph. (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/miz-m.jpg" /></a> For Mizoram, Zico Zoremsanga scored either side of half time, while F Lalrinpuia sealed the win with a late goal, in injury time to beat Railways. (PTI)
<p>Mizoram blanked Railways 3-0 in a one-sided final of the 68th National Football Championship for the Santosh Trophy. Zico Zoremsanga scored on either side of half-time and a second half injury time strike from F Lalrinpuia helped the north eastern state to romp home in style.</p>
<p>Railways — who had not won the Santosh Trophy since 1966 — came closest in the 43th minute when Rajesh S’s close-range header came off the horizontal. Courtesy their triumph, Mizoram bagged a purse of Rs 5 lakh while runners-up Railways got richer by Rs 3 lakh. The match started at a good pace with both the outfits looking for an early goal.</p>
<p>Railways earned three quick corners to keep the rival defence on their toes while at the other end their goalkeeper Ehtesham Ahmed — oozing confidence after his penalty heroics in the semifinal — flung to keep Lalnunmawia and Lalbiakhlua’s shots at bay.</p>
<p>With Railways missing their first choice centre-backs Vimal Kumar and Rajiv Boro due to suspension, Mizoram looked to take advantage but first-timer Akhil Rajbanshi and makeshift stopper-back Dipankar Das stood firm.</p>
<p>David Larinmuana found Lalnumawia free on the left with a good-looking ball from midfield but the latter was well marked by Dipankar and right-back Y Raju Singh. Lalbiakhlua then tried to be cheeky minutes into the half hour mark, trying to dink Ahmed from just outside the box on the right flank.</p>
<p>But the hero of the previous night had his near-post covered with the attempt also landing onto the roof of the net.</p>
<p>It was end to end stuff with the action mostly concentrated in the final third. The match’s best chance fell to Railways when striker Rajesh S hit the bar from close. Kisku tried his luck from the rebound but his effort was blocked. Moments later, Mizoram took the lead.</p>
<p>F. Lalrinpuia crossed for Zico inside the box. The striker who has found the back of the net three times already in the tournament trapped the ball and swiveled past his marker to slot home into the far corner with the goalkeeper at full stretch.</p>
<p>It was Mizoram who called the shots after the break. Three minutes into the half, Lalrinpuia unleashed a powerful left-footer which was fisted out by Ahmed but only as far as Lalnunmawia who side-netted his close range effort off the rebound. But the red shirts who have been the flavour of the 68th Nationals did not have to wait for long to double their advantage and take a giant stride towards their maiden title.</p>
<p>Zico was in the thick of things again as Mizoram broke on the counter. Lalbiakhlua teed up the goalscorer who did exceptionally well to round the goalkeeper and shoot into an empty net. The second goal deflated Railways’ spirit and the three-time champions looked to have thrown in the towel with their high-flying counterparts dominating possession.<br />
F Lalrinpuia pinched their opponents’ emotion at the death with a third goal from close in injury time to complete the memorable victory.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005187&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Angelo Mathews couldn’t have put it better than with his ‘barrier of finals’ coinage to describe his team’s Asia Cup triumph on Saturday night. For, Sri Lanka have seemed to suffer from a hoodoo at the final hurdle in recent years. The Asia Cup title was the first the islanders had won since 2008 in a tournament involving more than three teams.</p>
<p>Including the time they were crowned world champions in 1996, Sri Lanka have reached the finals in three out of the last five 50-over World Cups and two out of four World T20s. That puts them on par with Australia for most ‘finals’ appearances in global events in that period. And they have done so in different conditions and climes around the world.</p>
<p>You probably weren’t aware of these stats, but don’t blame yourself. That has been the true story of Sri Lankan cricket — a side that has been more consistent than any other in limited-overs cricket, but one that struggles to capture world cricket’s collective imagination.</p>
<p>More than being bridesmaids, Sri Lanka have been like guests who always get a seat at the wedding but never a special mention during the toast. So as the build-up begins towards next years’ World Cup Down Under, we’ll speak about Australia’s home advantage, India’s batting might, the unpredictability of Pakistan and West Indies, the Kiwis’ quadrennial dark horse status and how South Africa and England are due a major prize. But what about Sri Lanka, the runners-up from the last two editions? Well, they’ll show up anyway.</p>
<p>But why look as far as 2015, when the World T20 gets underway next week. But once again, they are more likely to be clubbed with the other sub-continent teams as strong contenders, rather than be singled out as being a ‘front-runner’, despite having made the finals in two out of last three World Twenty20s.</p>
<p>Finishing second best never leaves a lasting impression. But even here, Sri Lanka have not been given their due. No one calls the Lankans as ‘chokers’, even after having suffered the jitters more than any other team in crunch matches. That privilege is reserved solely for South Africa.</p>
<p>Maybe it has to do with the fact that they are not the attention-grabbing kind. Except Lasith Malinga for his unorthodoxy and trend-setting hairstyles, the spotlight has continued to evade the Lankans. Even Test bigwigs Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene are unlikely to feature too high up in ODI power-lists.</p>
<p>Breaking the ‘barrier of finals’ more often as clinically as they did in Dhaka could help. Or maybe not.</p>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graemesmithreutersm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005405" alt="Graeme Smith announced his retirement during the third and final Test against Australia in Cape Town last week (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graemesmithreutersm1.jpg" /></a> Graeme Smith announced his retirement during the third and final Test against Australia in Cape Town last week (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">South Africa captain Graeme Smith, who last week announced his retirement from international cricket, was influenced by his family in taking the decision, media reported on Sunday. Smith, 33, told the Sunday Times newspaper that he knew he had made the right decision while at the hospital bedside of his 18-month-old daughter, who had suffered burns from hot water.</span></p>
<p>He says the toddler reached out to him and touched his Proteas badge.</p>
<p>“That’s all she’s known of me really. She sees me on the TV and that was a moment where I realised I’m pretty happy with the decision I’ve made,” he said.</p>
<p>Smith’s daughter, Cadence Christine Smith, who was born in July 2012, was burnt in an accident during the second Test match against Australia in Port Elizabeth last month.</p>
<p>Smith had been with his wife Morgan at his daughter’s bedside at Life Kingsbury Hospital in Claremont shortly before the start of the fourth day’s play of the third and final Test &#8212; his last international game.</p>
<p>Cadence went into surgery shortly before 8am and Smith was back at Newlands when Australia resumed their second innings at 10am.</p>
<p>The Proteas captain stunned the cricketing world last Monday when he announced he would quit international cricket at the end of the Test series against Australia. “I’ll have more time to see my children grow and I’ll be mentally more there.”</p>
<p>Smith is the most capped Test captain in the history of the game with 9,262 Test runs at an average of 48.49 with 27 hundreds and 38 half-centuries. He has captained the Proteas for 12 years since the age of 22. “As a captain, even when you are at home your brain is still elsewhere a lot of the time,” he said.</p>
<p>The batsman, who married Irish pop singer Morgan Deane in 2011 also has an Irish citizenship, but says he has no plans of playing for his second country.</p>
<p>“I won’t be picking up a bat for that country. I won’t be playing for Ireland. If am going to play for anyone, it would be the Proteas,” he said.</p>
<p>He said breaking the news of his decision to his team was difficult, and he struggled to get his words out. “After I’d said my piece, I had to get out and get some fresh air because I was a bit of a wreck.”</p>
<p>The skipper said his wife has carrying the load of raising their two young children while he played cricket. “I think of her with the two kids travelling to wherever I am in the world, and making it work. She is a strong woman.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005158&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dhaka.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2005156" alt="Decorative lights for the World T20 in a Dhaka street on Sunday. The event begins in Bangladesh on March 16." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dhaka.jpg" /></a> Decorative lights for the World T20 in a Dhaka street on Sunday. The event begins in Bangladesh on March 16.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Even if it is just a 20-km journey to the Hazrat Shah Jalal airport in Dhaka, the traffic ensures that the journey takes more than two hours. The good thing is that the locals have learnt to embrace obstacles with a smile — the cabbie doesn’t charge anything extra for the hardship.</span></p>
<p>Bangladesh, however, aspires to change and change for the better, and the country has projected the upcoming ICC World T20 tournament as the beginning of a new dawn. The government has come forward with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and together they’ve been working overtime to give everything a facelift &#8211; from infrastructure to stadiums and practice grounds.</p>
<p>“The World T20 is by far the largest ICC event we’ve ever hosted alone,” BCB director Mahbubul Anam told The Indian Express. “We definitely had to upgrade a lot of our facilities and we did it. Everything was co-funded by our government and the BCB. The government has spent USD 20-30 million over construction and renovation of the venues while the BCB has spent about USD 10 million. The government has also spent a lot on infrastructure and road-building. In fact, USD 30 million have been spent exclusively for the Dhaka city development. Flyovers have been built.</p>
<p><strong>‘Money well spent’</strong></p>
<p>“Earlier it used to take two hours from Dhaka to Fatullah which is about 37 kilometres away. Now it takes just a little over half an hour. We’ve also built eight new grounds, including practice venues. Overall, about USD 70-80 millions were spent but I can assure you that the money is very well spent.”</p>
<p>Bangladesh has just finished bidding goodbyes to its Asia Cup guests. World T20 comes close on their heels. Uncertainty had loomed over both events due to political turmoil. It considerably delayed the preparations. “Yes, the official go-ahead from the ICC came late. We had to race against time. But we’ve made it. By the time, the T20 world cup starts on March 16, everything will be ready,” Anam assures. Basically, World T20 is an opportunity for this small country and everyone has jumped on the bandwagon. Tourism is going to benefit the most.</p>
<p>“The Bangladesh Tourism Board is an official partner of the event and it is running their own campaign. Some of the venues are pure tourist attractions like the one in Sylhet, which is located inside a tea garden. Not just tourism, the World T20 will give a big boost to the whole economy, the organisers hope. And to woo the fans, the ICC has decided to keep the ticketing prices reasonable. The lowest category is priced at BDT 50 which is less than a dollar and the highest is BDT 3,500 which is less than 45 dollars,” says Anam.</p>
<p>The BCB and the government want to include the fans for this big event and don’t want to make their visits uncomfortable through heavy security measures without really compromising on the safety of the players or the spectators.</p>
<p>All said and done, Bangladesh cricket team have to do well to make the event a success. They’ve been on a downward spiral and have lost seven ODIs in a row — three in the bilateral series against Sri Lanka and four in the Asia Cup, including the loss to Afghanistan. They will have to qualify for the World T20 proper. Their journey starts on March 16 at Mirpur against Afghanistan and it might be tricky business.</p>
<p><strong>Revenge match</strong></p>
<p>“This a new tournament in a different format and that is going to be a revenge match for us,” Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim threw down the gauntlet, exactly a week before the start of the event. “We now have all our experienced players back — Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal, Mashrafe Mortaza. We will start the tournament with renewed confidence.”</p>
<p>Three days before they play their first match, an evening gala at the Bangbandhu National Stadium will see rapper Akon and composer A R Rahman performing. The job for the Bangladesh cricketers would be not to turn the mood sour.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2005149&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">India&#8217;s Virat Kohli has reclaimed the number one position in the latest ICC Player Rankings for ODI Batsmen, which were released on Sunday after the conclusion of the Asia Cup.</span></p>
<p>Kohli had entered the Asia Cup, trailing number one ranked South African batsman AB de Villiers by two ratings points. Kohli&#8217;s tournament aggregate of 189 runs in three innings with 136 against Bangladesh as his series best earned him 12 ratings points, which has put him ahead of South Africa&#8217;s ODI captain by nine ratings points.</p>
<p>Following his knock of 136, Kohli had achieved his career high rating of 886, but finished with 881 ratings points after scores of 48 (against Sri Lanka) and five (against Pakistan). He didn&#8217;t bat against Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Kohli was last ranked number one just before the ODI series against New Zealand in January. Other Indian batsmen to head in the right direction include Shikhar Dhawan in eighth (up by three place), Rohit Sharma in 22nd (up by one place) and Ravindra Jadeja in 50th (up by 12 places).</p>
<p>Strong batting performances in the Asia Cup have resulted in a reshuffle of the positions, with Sri Lanka&#8217;s Lahiru Thirimanne, who won the player of the tournament, making the biggest progress. The left-handed opener has jumped 29 places to a career-best 39th position.</p>
<p>In the ICC Player Rankings for ODI bowlers, India spinners &#8211; Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandaran Ashwin &#8211; are the biggest gainers inside the top 20. Jadeja has earned four places and is now in fifth position after claiming seven wickets in four matches, while Ashwin&#8217;s nine wickets in the series has given him a lift of seven places that has put him in 14th position.</p>
<p>Amit Mishra has also gained five places to be at 36th. Meanwhile, India team has been guaranteed to retain its number two position in the ICC ODI Team Rankings at the 1 April cut-off date. India finished with 113 ratings points, just one ahead of third-ranked Sri Lanka, to walk away with a prize of USD 75,000.</p>
<p>There was no other change in the table with all sides retaining their positions. Australia were assured of the number one ranking on the cut-off date in January after India lost their ODI series against New Zealand 0-4. The Aussies will receive the ODI Shield as well as a cheque of USD 175,000.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004834&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Harbhajan Singh has cut out the jump from his run-up while Yuvraj Singh’s trigger movement now is not as pronounced as it was earlier. <strong>Siddhartha Sharma</strong> takes a close look at the two out-of-favour Punjab cricketers who are using their time on the domestic circuit, looking to reinvent themselves and ressurect their careers.</em></p>
<p><strong>BIG STEP, SMALLER STRIDE</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s late evening. The Punjab-Jammu and Kashmir Vijay Hazare game has just ended. The Jamia Millia Islamia University ground’s stands have gone from sparsely-occupied to nearly-deserted. A few fans do hang around to pay respects to a couple of India stars in Punjab colours. The dressing room too has an end-of-the-day feel to it. Tired fingers are busy on fancy phones while exhausted bodies are sprawled over easy chairs. That’s when Yuvraj Singh’s purposeful walk to the central square, in the company of a few spinners, disturbs the  unhurried atmosphere.</p>
<p>Dropped from the India one-day side, Yuvraj missed the tour to New Zealand and the Asia Cup in Bangladesh. But in about a week’s time, the left-hander will be wearing the India colours once again as part of the World T20 squad in Bangladesh. About seven years back, in the inaugural edition of the event, he built a reputation for himself. Even today they use him, and Stuart Broad’s 36-run over, not to forget the six sixes, to sell the diet World Cup.</p>
<p>The ODI team, minus Yuvraj, hasn’t been in the best of form and the blame partly rests with the young middle-order. Yuvraj is surely aware about the openings available and wants to be at his best. And since this could probably be the 32 year-old’s last chance to extend his international career, he wants to iron out all his flaws.</p>
<p>At Jamia, Yuvraj is putting in the extra hours and going the extra mile to overcome a batting problem that has been bothering him of late. Far too often, he’s been trapped in front of the wicket by the slow bowlers with his front-foot getting in the line of the delivery. As a strict coach (like his father Yograj) would say, ‘what his bat should be doing, his pad is doing.’</p>
<p><strong>Fatal flaws</strong></p>
<p>Since the time he played the NKP Salve Challenger Trophy in Indore last September, Yuvraj has committed this fatal flaw four times. Interestingly, Delhi’s Rajat Bhatia has been his conqueror on three of those occasions during the domestic season. Medium pacer Bhatia foxed him at the Challenger Trophy first and later got him twice in the Ranji Trophy games. According to Punjab coach Bhupinder Singh Sr., Yuvraj has been working extra-time to eliminate this weakness.</p>
<p>“Having played at the highest level, Yuvraj knows how to analyse his batting. I remember when he joined the team a day before the Delhi game, he said that he was getting hit on the pads quite often. So he had that issue in mind. He asked me if he was playing half-cocked or if he wasn’t going forward enough. I told him that he needs to have a smaller trigger step. And then if he needs to play on the front foot, he can always stretch it a little more,” says the coach.</p>
<p>The change the two worked on is visible in his stance and strokes these days. The Yuvraj-trademark long stride forward is still there but his trigger movement, which earlier saw his right foot getting planted too far forward, is now not so pronounced. Once committed it was difficult to move out of the ball’s way. Slow bowlers, such as the likes of Bhatia, exploited this weakness by bowling in the line of the stumps to dismiss him leg before.</p>
<p>The new Yuvraj stands almost still, till the bowler has released the ball. He moves only when the ball is in the air. The trigger movement is just enough to break his inertia. He is now less committed and the footwork is less fixed and more flexible.<br />
Old-timers have often spoken about how domestic games gave them enough time to tweak their technique and reinvent their batting to face new challenges. Yuvraj, who for most of his career has been caught up with Team India’s busy calendar, finally had time at hand. After getting dropped from the ODI squad after the South Africa series, he hit the domestic circuit not just with the purpose of scoring runs but also with an eye on honing his skills.</p>
<p>Those who saw his hundred in the BCCI Corporate Trophy and the painstaking unbeaten 96 against Delhi on a sluggish Kotla track in the Vijay Hazare Trophy say that Yuvraj is a changed batsman. The earlier Yuvraj was more entertaining; today he’s more effective. For Punjab, he is now a finisher, who will be around till the winning runs are scored. In a young Punjab middle order, Yuvraj has been a reassuring presence.</p>
<p><strong>From star to mentor</strong></p>
<p>But he hasn’t done so by being solely obsessed with his own cricket. Coach Bhupinder speaks about how, even off-the-field, Yuvraj has started taking the responsibility of mentoring the young side. “This year he is a changed man. He has been helping by sharing his ideas about how the team can improve, how individuals can deliver. Now he is more involved than he used to be,” he says.<br />
The senior citizens of the Punjab dressing room have also seen a telling change in their long-standing teammate’s demeanour in the pavilion. They say Yuvraj isn’t the prankster he once used to be. That is a result of him being too pre-occupied about his batting and his focus on a return to the national side. “He doesn’t miss a training session. His fitness regime is tremendous. Mostly, he keeps to himself,” says a player close to him.</p>
<p>But there are times when he goes back to being the lovable rascal of the Punjab camp. He also doesn’t mince words when a youngster doesn’t stick to the game-plan.</p>
<p>In the game against J&amp;K, the young Punjab opener Manan Vohra, batting in his fifties, played a rash stroke and barely survived. Yuvraj, sitting in the dressing room with his pads on, rose from his chair and walked to the boundary ropes. In chaste Punjabi and at the top of his voice, he gave the youngster an idea about the terrible fate that would await him in the dressing room if he got out playing a loose stroke. Vohra, who has learnt the ropes at Yuvraj’s father Yograj’s academy, got the message. He went on to play a match-winning knock for his side.</p>
<p>Another next-generation Punjab batsman, Gurkeerat Mann, too got the Yuvraj treatment when he played a reverse sweep against Himachal while batting in his forties. Mann got the signal and eventually scored 83 to confirm Punjab’s participation in the knock-outs.</p>
<p>Against Services at Palam, it was Taruwar Kohli’s turn. Prior to Yuvraj’s intervention the young right-hander was struggling to cope with the slow wicket and was finding it tough to pierce the in-field. At the drinks break, he was asked to take his chances by his mentor. The youngster changed gears and stepped up the run rate.</p>
<p>“The bowlers were slow and so was the track. He told me to be enterprising and take the initiative or else it would get tough for the batsmen to follow. He insisted that you have to put the team first when batting and to do that, you have to do something special,” says Kohli.</p>
<p>Bhupinder, who has seen Yuvraj since his early days, talks about his star ward’s dramatic transformation in recent months. And he takes a very pragmatic view of it.</p>
<p>“With the passage of time, personal growth and maturity comes. When you are young your priorities are different. You are more active and energetic. But when you are 30-32 you don’t want to react to stupid things,” says Bhupinder. “After his illness, he got a close look at life. I guess he has started loving it and valuing it much more than he used to earlier.”</p>
<p><strong>CUTTING THE HOP TO BOUNCE BACK</strong></p>
<p>There’s something different about Harbhajan Singh these days. Since the time he broke into the Indian team in the late ’90s, the pugnacious off-spinner had always turned heads with his unique action. If Shane Warne had the ‘I’ve-got-your-number’ smirk, Muttiah Muralitharan the bulging eyes and Anil Kumble the bouncing approach to the crease, Harbhajan had the hop — the one that would follow the initial two steps with his hands unfolding like a bird preparing to take flight. The little skip gave Harbhajan the momentum that would translate into the heavy tweak which would finally result in the ball turning or bouncing.</p>
<p><strong>Now, the hop is gone.</strong></p>
<p>“Without it, I have a fraction of a second more to watch the movement of the batsman,” says Harbhajan. “I know the hop in my run-up is my originality and it gave me momentum, but even without it, I am able to complete my follow through and to pick the batsmen’s movement with the same rhythm. There’s also better balance now.”</p>
<p>Harbhajan last played for India close to 12 months ago in a Test against Australia at Hyderabad. He finished with two wickets in what was a comprehensive victory by an innings for his team. With very few longer version games to play, Harbhajan has had to prove himself with the ball in the shorter formats. Here, he feels his new action, which provides him with a slightly prolonged view of the batsman’s movements, really has come in handy. In Harbhajan’s opinion, it’s all about dot balls in the shorter formats.</p>
<p>“I feel that controlling the run flow is very important. Dot balls are crucial. Secondly with the wickets being so placid, I keep varying my bowling, keeping the off-spinner as my stock ball. I do use the doosra and the straighter one but those are just variations. In one day cricket, once you contain the runs, wickets come easily,” Harbhajan explains.</p>
<p><strong>Credit to IPL</strong></p>
<p>The veteran of nearly 350 international matches is also not ashamed to talk about having to reinvent his plans to keep abreast of the changing climes of world cricket. “It’s all about evolution. You can’t keep doing exactly the same always. Compared to what I was doing 10 years earlier, I am able to handle situations much better now,” he says.</p>
<p>For now, the new action has brought some joy for Harbhajan. In the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy, he has been economical and has picked up seven wickets in the bargain. He had 24 wickets at 25.58 in the Ranji Trophy this season, including 17 from his first two games. At the back of these numbers, Harbhajan is hoping for a recall.</p>
<p>The man with the most number of Test wickets among contemporary cricketers, believes that he owes the IPL some credit for that. Last year, Harbhajan topped the wicket-taking charts for champions Mumbai Indians and that too at an economy of 6.51.</p>
<p>“When the IPL began, I thought I knew how to bowl there. You could bowl yorkers. After the first year I realised I was wrong.</p>
<p>Batsmen over the years have learnt how to play yorkers and I feel there are much more chances of getting wickets with your stock ball than the dart balls. In the 2007 World T20, I bowled six yorkers in an over but batsmen started to go after my bowling,” he recalls.</p>
<p>While he’s convinced that the new routine is here to stay in the shorter formats, Harbhajan is not ruling out a return to the ‘hop’ in first-class cricket.</p>
<p>He says: “I will see when I feel the need to use it again. If I feel that my body is not getting that rhythm, I may revert back to it. But preferably in longer formats, as I then have time to bowl longer spells and do not have to worry about batsmen playing unnecessary strokes.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004525&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">American Hunter Mahan eagled his penultimate hole to grab a share of the halfway lead at the WGC-Cadillac Championship on Friday as the Blue Monster showed its true colours, with more than 100 golf balls ending up in the water.</span></p>
<p>On a gruelling day that some players described as a survival test, Mahan eagled the par five eighth in fading light for a second round of two-over 74 that left him tied for the lead with his compatriots Dustin Johnson (74), Patrick Reed (75) and Matt Kuchar (74) at one-under par.</p>
<p>Northern Irishmen Rory McIlroy (74) and Graeme McDowell (71), Italian Francesco Molinari (75) and Welshman Jamie Donaldson, who posted the low round of the day with a two-under 70, were all lurking one shot further back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt stressed all day because I knew every shot had a big penalty written all over it, staring at bogey or worse I thought at a well struck shot,&#8221; Mahan told reporters. &#8220;It was a really tough day. There wasn&#8217;t an easy shot out there and you know, you&#8217;re going to have to find a way to make some putts. One of those rounds where it could go south pretty fast so you&#8217;ve got to grind it out and find a way to get a number up there and get to the weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long regarded as one of the PGA Tour&#8217;s great layouts, the Blue Monster course underwent a massive $251 million renovation that made it even more frightening and almost unplayable when the winds whipped across the sprawling layout on Friday.</p>
<p>With most players arriving early to complete their rain-delayed opening rounds, exhausted golfers slumped off the course after a day of battling brutal winds and fatigue. Only three players managed to break par during a wild second round that saw 113 balls find a watery grave while the average score was four-over 76.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just brutally difficult,&#8221; said McDowell. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve played in conditions this difficult in the US. It&#8217;s an Open Championship day. It&#8217;s a real Friday afternoon at St. Andrews in 2010 before they called it. It was hard out there, really, really hard, and part of me feels ecstatic to be off the golf course right now.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Top class showdown</strong></p>
<p>One of the intriguing sub-plots at the $9 million event was expected to be a showdown between world number one Tiger Woods and a Australian world number two Adam Scott for top spot in the rankings. Scott could have a chance to replace Woods as number one if he wins on Sunday but the two men have spent much of the opening two rounds slugging it out closer to the bottom of the leaderboard.</p>
<p>Woods, who had a blazing finish to his rain-delayed first round making three successive birdies before he gave a shot back with a bogey at 18, was quickly on the charge in the afternoon. The 14-time major winner carded birdies on his opening two holes but was soon sliding back down the leaderboard with four bogeys.</p>
<p>The highlight for the round came on the fourth when Woods rolled in a massive 92-foot birdie putt which was followed by another birdie at the fifth but the fight back would end with four straight pars and a one-over 73 to sit on five-over. &#8220;That was a tough golf course today,&#8221; said Woods, who found the water three times during the second round. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that we expected the golf course to be that hard that fast, but it kept getting quicker and quicker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott, who arrived on Friday sitting one shot off the lead at two-under, finished his opening round at three-over and continued to lose ground in the afternoon with a 73 to reach the midway mark at four-over. Phil Mickelson, another former-champion, looked headed for trouble when he began his second round with a par and three consecutive double-bogeys before he scrapped his way to a 75 to join Woods on 149, six shots behind the leaders.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004373&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Railways will try to break their 48-year old jinx while Mizoram will look to become first-time lucky when the two sides cross swords in a high voltage title clash of the 68th National Championships for Santosh Trophy here Sunday.</p>
<p>Railways last triumphed in the Santosh Trophy way back in 1966. On the other hand Mizoram — who had not surfaced on the football scene back then —would be chasing their maiden title since the Northeastern side&#8217;s emergence in the mid eighties.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been 48 years since we last won the Santosh Trophy, and 27 years since our last Final appearance. Tomorrow&#8217;s match means so much to us. A win can bring us back in the fold,&#8221; Railways head coach Souren Dutta, who was only a year old in 1966, said.</p>
<p>Railways last made it to the final in 1987. They have previously won the tourney thrice, finishing second best on five occasions. &#8220;It is a great opportunity for Mizoram also to get their name in the history book. They have been the best team in the tournament so far and have won all their matches. It will be a difficult match,&#8221; Dutta added.</p>
<p>Railways will be without the services of their two first choice centre-backs Vimal Kumar and Rajiv Boro, both suspended for the final owing to double booking. &#8220;It will be a miss for sure having to play without your regular stoppers. But that cannot be an excuse. This is the time for the others to step up,&#8221; Dutta said.</p>
<p>Centre-back Akhil Rajbanshi and either of midfielder Dipankar Das or full back Mohd Sayeed are set to replace the suspended duo. Mizoram have no injury or suspension concerns as such ahead of the match slated to be held at the Kanchenjunga Stadium. Talking about their strategy for the final, Dutta informed: &#8220;We will look to block them in midfield catch them on the counter. They attack all out so if we can try and hurt them on the break.&#8221;</p>
<p>His counterpart, H Vanlalthlanga did not reveal much. &#8220;We will play our natural game and according to our philosophy. Railways are a very fast side and I have seen them improving with every match. They will be high on confidence after that morale-boosting semifinal win. It will be a good match,&#8221; the coach said.</p>
<p>Mizoram have won all their eight matches leading up to the final. Railways on the contrary have had hitches en route, losing to Assam in the Zonals and then dropping four points in the final round which eventually did not matter as they trounced Goa 3-0 to qualify for the semifinal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004370&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Unseeded American Lauren Davis secured the first big upset of the BNP Paribas Open when she ousted third seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus in the second round in Indian Wells on Friday.</span></p>
<p>Davis broke serve seven times en route to 6-0 7-6(2) victory as she pounced on the 2012 champion&#8217;s second serve. Azarenka, who was hampered by a foot injury, did not help her cause with 12 double faults. It is the first time 20-year-old Davis, ranked 66th in the world, has beaten an opponent inside the top 20.</p>
<p>Earlier in California, second seed Agnieszka Radwanska earned a belated birthday present when she broke the serve of British qualifier Heather Watson seven times to win their second round match. Radwanska was not exactly dominant, dropping serve five times herself, but she had enough of an edge to beat Watson 6-4 6-3.</p>
<p>The top seeds received a first round bye and most of the big names will not make their first appearances until the weekend. But some notables were in action on Friday including Dane Caroline Wozniacki, the 10th seed, who beat Bojana Jovanovski 6-1 6-3. Wozniacki broke Jovanovski five times as she preyed on her Serbian opponent&#8217;s weak second serve. Top seed Li Na will start her campaign on Saturday against Chinese compatriot Zheng Jie.</p>
<p>In the men&#8217;s doubles, Swiss grand slam winners Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka teamed up for the first time in 18 months and entertained a large crowd in beating Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi 6-2 6-7 (4) (10-6). The Swiss pair and defending champion and top seed Rafa Nadal will also be in men&#8217;s singles action on Saturday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004369&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Two goals from late substitute Olivier Giroud and one apiece by Mesut Ozil and Mikel Arteta secured Arsenal&#8217;s place in the FA Cup semi-finals with a 4-1 win against Everton at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. </span></p>
<p>Ozil gave Arsenal a seventh minute lead, after a precise through ball from Santi Cazorla but Everton equalised after a surging run from Ross Barkely resulted in a Romelu Lukaku tap-in after 32 minutes. The teams went into the half level with Everton coach Roberto Martinez attempting to become the first manager to win the FA Cup in two successive seasons with different teams.</p>
<p>He had won the trophy with Wigan Athletic last year, though the side was subsequently relegated in the season. Martinez&#8217;s hopes were soon dashed when Arsenal regained the lead in the 68th minute after Gareth Barry tripped Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the box and Mikel Arteta converted the penalty. Striker Olivier Giroud, who had come off the bench just then, was ruled to have caused an infringement when the penalty was taken, which means Arteta had to re-take the penalty.</p>
<p>However, the midfielder made no mistake to make it 2-0. Girourd made amends with two late goals, in the 83rd and 85th minutes, to keep Arsenal on course for their first trophy for nine years.</p>
<p><strong>United beat West Brom</strong></p>
<p>Champions Manchester United rediscovered a touch of their old swagger to beat West Bromwich Albion 3-0 on Saturday and record back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since December. The win was also a revenge for United, who had lost earlier in the season to West Brom at home.</p>
<p>Phil Jones headed home a Robin van Persie free kick in the first half, Wayne Rooney finished a sweeping passing move with another header after the break, with the assist coming from full back Rafael. Danny Welbeck added a third, thanks to a Rooney assist that came at the end of United&#8217;s best passing move of the game, to secure the points against a woeful West Brom side.</p>
<p>United moved up to sixth in the table with 48 points while West Brom stay one place above the relegation zone. -Reuters</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004368&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ace Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal was outplayed by Chinese nemesis Shixian Wang in a lop-sided quarterfinal, bringing to an end India&#8217;s campaign in the All England Badminton Championship.</span></p>
<p>The world number 7 Indian lost 17-21 10-21 against fourth seed and world number 3 Shixian Wang in a duel which lasted 43 minutes.</p>
<p>In a one-sided contest, Wang, against whom Saina had a 4-2 overall record heading into the match, dominated all through to set up a clash against compatriot and second seed Yihan Wang. Wang beat Korea&#8217;s Yeon Ju Bae 21-8 21-13 in her quarterfinal contest. Wang is the reigning world champion besides being a silver-medallist at the World Championships. Saina, who had lost to Shixian in their most recent encounter in the Swiss Open last year, was off-colour from the word go.</p>
<p>Her trademark smashes were nowhere to be seen and, in fact, the Indian, a semifinalist in the previous edition of the event, failed to pull off even one of them in either of the two games. The Olympic bronze-medallist, who entered the tournament claiming that she was back to her best after clinching the Syed Modi Indian Open, fought for a while in the opening game but collapsed completely in the second.</p>
<p>Saina was the only Indian left in the championships as World No. 10 P V Sindhu found the going tough on her debut and lost to Sun Yu of China in the first round.</p>
<p><strong>TOWARDS A HAPPY ENDING</strong></p>
<p>China&#8217;s holder Chen Long and his girlfriend Wang Shixian are on track for a happy ending to their love affair with the All England Open Badminton Championships after reaching the singles semi-finals on Friday.</p>
<p>Chen kept his title defence alive by overcoming an early scare to beat Denmark&#8217;s Hans-Kristian Vittinghus, who showed his pedigree to win the first game 21-18.</p>
<p>However, Chen composed himself at the break and then showed his qualities to take the next two games 21-11 21-14.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was worried especially during the first game because my opponent is a great player so I did feel quite a lot of pressure at one point,&#8221; said Chen. &#8220;But I think both of us performed really well so I think in the end I was really lucky to progress. This is a very unique place and many players want to win.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s a fine line between winning and losing so I just want to try my best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chen next faces compatriot Zhengming Wang who beat South Korean Dong Keun Lee 21-13 16-21 21-17 in his quarter-final.</p>
<p>Wang, who eased past Saina, knows that to match her partner Chen&#8217;s achievement of reaching the final last year she must be confident. &#8220;I think for every athlete confidence is the key thing and every time I win a match it gives me a boost,&#8221; said Wang. &#8220;Even though the scoreboard might not have said it, it was a very tough match for me. I need to go into every match with confidence because that is the only way that I can beat my opponents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chris and Gabby Adcock, hoping to become the first English husband-and-wife team to win the mixed doubles title at the Yonex championships since the 1930s, went out to Olympic champions Zhang Nan and Zhao Yunlei in the last eight.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004365&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of taking charge as Pakistan’s chief selector and Pakistan Cricket Board’s anti-corruption head, Rashid Latif has invited former India captain Rahul Dravid to lead the fight against corruption. The former Pakistan captain and ‘keeper has recently been appointed for the dual role and will assume office after the World T20. Latif maintains that corruption is not only his country’s problem, but a global problem. “Such a beautiful game of cricket is now the hub of gambling. The ICC, PCB, BCCI, IPL&#8230;They’ve to try to minimise corruption. I think a 30-second delay in live coverage could change a lot of things,” Latif said.</p>
<p>“Former captains and cricketers must stand united in the fight against corruption. Their efforts can make a huge impact. India are a super power in cricket and we need someone from them. Rahul Dravid is the ideal person. I invite him to lead the way,” said Latif.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004360&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ungainly but effective, Fawad Alam’s Shivnarine Chanderpaul-like stance is helping him in his search for redemption. Credit goes to Alam’s National Bank team coach Dr Jamil who advised the change. And his success at the Asia Cup suggests, it has reaped rich dividends.</span></p>
<p>On Saturday, the left-hander scored his maiden ODI hundred. It was an innings of caution but Alam reached the landmark in style, chipping Thisara Perera over deep mid-wicket for a maximum.</p>
<p>For close to four years the 28-year old southpaw had to spend his time on the sidelines, but now, given the opportunity again, he looks to be determined to make up for the lost period. Alam was rated highly in Karachi as a young batting talent but found international cricket a little too tough to handle after making his ODI debut seven years ago.</p>
<p>The first 10 innings yielded just one half-century and that too against lowly Hong Kong. Things didn’t improve in the next phase either. Except for a fighting 63 against Australia at Perth in 2010, the middle-order batsman had very little to show for and was duly dropped from the national team.</p>
<p>But Alam put his head down and earned his recall with a string of good scores in the domestic circuit.</p>
<p>Still, Alam was picked against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup only because Sharjeel Khan was recovering from a leg injury. But he grabbed the opportunity with both hands and became an automatic choice for the final.</p>
<p>The comeback has turned out to be sweet. He anchored Pakistan to victory with a 70-ball 74 in the last game against Bangladesh. It was his first match for Pakistan in exactly 39 months. But his task in the final was more daunting. At 18 for three, his team was staring down the barrel. The primary target was to see off Lasith Malinga and then forge a partnership with captain Misbah-ul-Haq.</p>
<p>The first ball he faced was a Malinga yorker but Alam dug it out well towards mid-wicket. He was ready to play a waiting game and took 12 balls to score his first runs. He, however, targeted Sachithra Senanayake well and pounced on anything loose from the Sri Lanka off spinner.</p>
<p>A 122-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Misbah gave Pakistan some breathing space. After Umar Akmal came on and became the aggressor, Alam wisely resorted to play second fiddle.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004357&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Sri Lanka were runners-up in the 2007 and 2011 50-over World Cups as well as in the World Twenty20 in 2009 and 2012.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004355&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Sri Lanka have not won a major title for a long while and captain Angelo Mathews today said that his side were happy to have broken the “barrier of finals” by defeating Pakistan in the summit clash to lift the Asia Cup here. Sri Lanka were runners-up in the 2007 and 2011 50-over World Cups as well as in the World Twenty20 in 2009 and 2012. They were also the runners-up in the 2010 edition of the Asia Cup.</span></p>
<p>“We wanted to break the barrier between us and the finals. Big victory not only for me, but for the whole team. Haven’t won a major tournament for a while,” Mathews said after Sri Lanka regained the Asia Cup title which they had last won in 2008.</p>
<p>“I thought the toss wasn’t crucial and Lasith (Malinga) set us up wonderfully. It was a very good run-chase,” he added. Asked about leaving out spinner Ajantha Mendis, who had nine wickets from three matches in the tournament, Mathews said, “Very tough call to leave Mendis out because he performs well whenever we ask him to. But we wanted an extra death bowling option and Lakmal was brilliant,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Plans foiled</strong></p>
<p>Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq attributed the loss to his side’s inability to execute the plans. “It was not the pressure of the final. Just didn’t execute our plans. We wanted not to give Lasith any wickets and in the end he took all our wickets,” he said.</p>
<p>“I think losing the first three wickets so quickly we were under pressure. We recovered well after that, but we could have added 25-30 runs more. Just could not build enough pressure with the ball.” Misbah said his batsmen did a decent job in the tournament but found wanting in the bowling department. “You need partnerships in the bowling as well. Saeed (Ajmal) was bowling really well, but we were leaking runs in the other end. Batting was a positive sign in the series, Shehazad and Afridi and Alam and Akmal and Hafeez all played really good knocks. They batted sensibly and contributed really well.”</p>
<p>He said Pakistan would do well in the upcoming Twenty20 World Cup as they have acclimatise well with the conditions. “Most of the guys in the T20 side are in good form and we’ve been playing here for a while so we have a great chance in the World T20,” said Misbah, who is not in the Pakistan T20 squad.</p>
<p>Sri Lankan opening batsman Lahiru Thirimanne, who hit 101 today and was adjudged Player of the Series, said, “Actually, I just wanted to play the anchor role today. We knew 260 was gettable but one man has to take up the responsibility and play through the innings. I am happy I did that. The ball was skidding onto the bat and I used the pace. It’s my first Man of the Series and I’m very happy about it.”</p>
<p>Man-of-the-Match for his 5/56 effort, Lasith Malinga said he stuck to the basics. “Last couple of days we were training hard. It was a big final and I just stuck to the basics,” he said. “Just tried to bowl good line and length and it worked for me and the team. The last few games I’ve done well against Pakistan.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004355&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>Malinga five-for, Thirimanne ton guide team to their first major win since the Asia Cup in 2008.</em></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In the end, Sri Lanka did it in style, making the contest fairly lop-sided and winning the final against Pakistan by five wickets with 22 balls to spare. They’ve been easily the best team of the tournament and an unbeaten streak of five matches gave them the Asia Cup for the fifth time.</span></p>
<p>The foundation was laid by Lasith Malinga with an initial burst of three wickets that dented Pakistan’s hopes of getting off to a flying start batting first. Malinga returned to remove Misbah-ul-Haq in the batting power-plays and accounted for Umar Akmal at the death to return with a five-for and the Man of the Match award. Lahiru Thirimanne, with a hundred, and Mahela Jayawardene, with a fifty, ensured that the fast bowler’s efforts were not wasted.</p>
<p><strong>Class Act</strong></p>
<p>Thirimanne is widely regarded as the finest young batting talent in Sri Lanka. On Saturday he gave a glimpse of his class before Saeed Ajmal breached his defence later on. By then the Sri Lankan opener had 101 runs (108 balls, 13X4) against his name and the match was in Sri Lanka’s pocket. It was his third century in 62 ODIs.</p>
<p>“Thirimanne has to step into the big shoes when the time will come. Today he did his job very well,” Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said.</p>
<p>The youngster finished the tournament with 279 runs from five matches. His opening partner Kusal Perera was agricultural but effective, taking on Umar Gul upfront and putting Pakistan under pressure at the start of the chase. Sri Lanka raced to 56 in 10 overs before the first wicket fell.</p>
<p>Ajmal was brought on inside the powerplay overs as the match was slipping out of Pakistan’s grip. And the off-spinner found his magic in his second over, striking twice in two balls. Perera was fooled by the one that held back a little as the batter charged down the wicket. Akmal had an easy stumping.</p>
<p><strong>Golden duck</strong></p>
<p>Kumar Sangakkara was sent packing for a golden duck with a doosra that caught him plumb in front. Out of form Mahela Jayawardene came in with Ajmal on a hat-trick and was beaten by another doosra, but the ball hit him above knee roll and he survived.</p>
<p>Jayawardene, who has struggled through this tournament, returned to form at the perfect time for Sri Lanka. The 36-year-old assembled all his experience to counter Ajmal’s threat and though he struggled initially, getting beaten a few times he went on to find his touch later. Thirimanne protected him well during that period and allowed his senior partner to settle to his own pace. Thirteen balls into his innings, Jayawardene found his touch. A sublime late cut off Ajmal went past the short third man to the fence.</p>
<p><strong>A Vicious doosra</strong></p>
<p>The bowler came up with a vicious doosra the very next ball, but Jayawardene negotiated it well. It was a fascinating contest but Pakistan suffered from the lack of support to Ajmal.</p>
<p>Shahid Afridi conceded a four in his first over and bowled a half-tracker to Jayawardene in his second, which was dispatched with disdain over the deep mid-wicket boundary. Mohammad Hafeez too couldn’t make his presence felt and the seamers bowled a wrong length on this easy-paced Sher-e-Bangla Stadium wicket. Umar Gul, Junaid Khan and Mohammad Talha finished with the economy rates of 7.33, 6.22 and 8.84 respectively.</p>
<p>A couple of dropped catches made matter worse for Misbah’s men. Both Jayawardene and Thirimanne were given reprieves. Jayawardene got out to a skier to Sharjeel Khan off Talha but a 93-ball 75 and a 156-run partnership with Thirimanne turned the match in Sri Lanka’s favour.</p>
<p>Earlier, Malinga ran through the Pakistan top order with three wickets in his first three overs. He dismissed Sharjeel Khan with a slower ball and then got rid of Ahmed Shehzad and Hafeez with a couple of away-goers. From 18 for three, Fawad Alam initiated a fantastic recovery with Misbah by his side. Together they added 122 runs for the fourth wicket to avert a collapse. But the run-scoring was slow.</p>
<p><strong>No Mendis</strong></p>
<p>Without Ajantha Mendis, dropped in favour of medium pacer Suranga Lakmal, Sri Lanka ostensibly lost a wicket-taking option in the middle-overs and the Pakistan duo went about their task of rebuilding without much pressure.</p>
<p>Misbah departed on 65, but Alam reached his maiden ODI hundred and remained unbeaten on 114. Akmal upped the ante with 59 in 42 balls, but ironically, Afridi, who passed a fitness test this morning to be available, didn’t get a chance. He walked out to bat with just two balls left and remained unbeaten without scoring. Pakistan’s total of 260 for five was always about 25 runs short.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004351&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two goals from late substitute Olivier Giroud and one apiece by Mesut Ozil and Mikel Arteta secured Arsenal&#8217;s place in the FA Cup semi-finals with a 4-1 win against Everton at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ozil gave Arsenal a seventh minute lead, after a precise through ball from Santi Cazorla but Everton equalised after a surging run from Ross Barkely resulted in a Romelu Lukaku tap-in after 32 minutes.</p>
<p>Arsenal regained the lead in the 68th minute after Gareth Barry tripped Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the box and Mikel Arteta converted the penalty.</p>
<p>Striker Olivier Giroud then came off the bench to score twice in two minutes, in the 83rd and 85th minutes, to keep Arsenal on course for their first trophy for nine years.</p>
<p>In an end-to-end cup tie it looked as though the visitors might force a replay but Arteta&#8217;s penalty was the turning point in the game, forcing Everton to push forward in search of another equaliser, leaving themselves open at the back.</p>
<p>The Spanish midfielder, who left Everton for Arsenal in August 2011, was forced to retake his initial penalty after Giroud encroached into the box and admitted it was a big moment for him against his former club.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I had to retake the penalty it was just about keeping my concentration level high,&#8221; Arteta told ITV after the game. &#8220;It was a massive moment and I&#8217;m just happy I scored.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We dominated the game and had the better chances but Everton showed their quality when they broke in the first half so overall we are happy to be at Wembley.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arsenal now enter the draw for the semi-finals at Wembley with high hopes of winning their first major trohpy in nine years. They won the FA Cup in 2005.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be amazing if we can win it. We&#8217;re in the semi-final, have a good chance and want to do it,&#8221; Arteta said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I missed the final at Wembley with Everton (2009) when I was with them because of a cruciate injury so playing there in the semi-final will be a good moment for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of the FA Cup quarter finals will be played on Sunday.</p>
<p>Sheffield United host Charlton, while Sunderland travel to Hull City, and Manchester City welcome Wigan Athletic in a repeat of last year&#8217;s FA Cup final.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004214&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Champions Manchester United rediscovered a touch of their old swagger to beat West Bromwich Albion 3-0 on Saturday and record back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since December.</p>
<p>Phil Jones headed home a Robin van Persie free kick in the first half, Wayne Rooney finished a sweeping passing move with another header after the break and Danny Welbeck added a third to secure the points against a woeful West Brom side.</p>
<p>United, whose difficult season was compounded by a demoralising Champions League defeat to Olympiakos in their last outing, moved up to sixth in the table with 48 points.</p>
<p>West Brom and manager Pepe Mel, winless since taking over in early January, stay one place above the relegation zone.</p>
<p>Leaders Chelsea host Tottenham Hotspur in the big game of the day later on Saturday while at the other end of the table Cardiff City welcome Fulham, Crystal Palace are at home to Southampton and Norwich play Stoke.</p>
<p>United manager David Moyes shuffled his pack after their poor showing in Europe, adding a youthful complexion to their defence where Jones was paired with Chris Smalling.</p>
<p>For most of the first half the pair looked unconvincing at the heart of the back four as United struggled to find any rhythm or tempo, but at the other end of the pitch Jones made a decisive contribution.</p>
<p>After Rafael had forced United&#8217;s former keeper Ben Foster to tip his header onto the bar, Jones opened the scoring by powerfully heading home a Van Persie set piece after 34 minutes.</p>
<p>West Brom, who have now won one of their last 19 matches in all competitions, predictably laboured in attack, but looked mildly threatening from set pieces with Claudio Yacob heading over from close range.</p>
<p>The second half began with controversy as Van Persie escaped a second yellow card when he slid into a reckless challenge only to receive a final warning from the referee.</p>
<p>The more the hosts pushed forward, however, the more they looked vulnerable to the counter and Rooney effectively sealed the points in the 65th minute, heading in a cross from Rafael after a sweeping passing move from the Moyes&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>United&#8217;s exciting attacking talents, who have flattered to deceive at times this season, began to strut like their old selves, with Welbeck finishing off an intricate passing move with angled shot beyond Foster to complete the scoring.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004207&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/huntermahanusatodaysportsm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004197" alt="Mahan eagled the par five eighth in fading light for a second round of two-over 74 that left him tied for the lead (USA Today Sports)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/huntermahanusatodaysportsm.jpg" /></a> Mahan eagled the par five eighth in fading light for a second round of two-over 74 that left him tied for the lead (USA Today Sports)
<p>American Hunter Mahan eagled his penultimate hole to grab a share of the halfway lead at the WGC-Cadillac Championship on Friday as the Blue Monster showed its true colours, with more than 100 golf balls ending up in the water.</p>
<p>On a gruelling day that some players described as a survival test, Mahan eagled the par five eighth in fading light for a second round of two-over 74 that left him tied for the lead with his compatriots Dustin Johnson (74), Patrick Reed (75) and Matt Kuchar (74) at one-under par.</p>
<p>Northern Irishmen Rory McIlroy (74) and Graeme McDowell (71), Italian Francesco Molinari (75) and Welshman Jamie Donaldson, who posted the low round of the day with a two-under 70, were all lurking one shot further back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt stressed all day because I knew every shot had a big penalty written all over it, staring at bogey or worse I thought at a well struck shot,&#8221; Mahan told reporters. &#8220;It was a really tough day.</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t an easy shot out there and you know, you&#8217;re going to have to find a way to make some putts.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of those rounds where it could go south pretty fast so you&#8217;ve got to grind it out and find a way to get a number up there and get to the weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long regarded as one of the PGA Tour&#8217;s great layouts, the Blue Monster course underwent a massive $251 million renovation that made it even more frightening and almost unplayable when the winds whipped across the sprawling layout on Friday.</p>
<p>With most players arriving early to complete their rain-delayed opening rounds, exhausted golfers slumped off the course after a day of battling brutal winds and fatigue.</p>
<p>Only three players managed to break par during a wild second round that saw 113 balls find a watery grave while the average score was four-over 76.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just brutally difficult,&#8221; said McDowell. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve played in conditions this difficult in the U.S..</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an Open Championship day. It&#8217;s a real Friday afternoon at St. Andrews in 2010 before they called it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was hard out there, really, really hard, and part of me feels ecstatic to be off the golf course right now.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Top ranking showdown</strong></p>
<p>One of the intriguing sub-plots at the $9 million event was expected to be a showdown between world number one Tiger Woods and a Australian world number two Adam Scott for top spot in the rankings.</p>
<p>Scott could have a chance to replace Woods as number one if he wins on Sunday but the two men have spent much of the opening two rounds slugging it out closer to the bottom of the leaderboard.</p>
<p>Woods, who had a blazing finish to his rain-delayed first round making three successive birdies before he gave a shot back with a bogey at 18, was quickly on the charge in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The 14-time major winner carded birdies on his opening two holes but was soon sliding back down the leaderboard with four bogeys.</p>
<p>The highlight for the round came on the fourth when Woods rolled in a massive 92-foot birdie putt which was followed by another birdie at the fifth but the fight back would end with four straight pars and a one-over 73 to sit on five-over.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a tough golf course today,&#8221; said Woods, who found the water three times during the second round.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that we expected the golf course to be that hard that fast, but it kept getting quicker and quicker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott, who arrived on Friday sitting one shot off the lead at two-under, finished his opening round at three-over and continued to lose ground in the afternoon with a 73 to reach the midway mark at four-over.</p>
<p>Phil Mickelson, another former-champion, looked headed for trouble when he began his second round with a par and three consecutive double-bogeys before he scrapped his way to a 75 to join Woods on 149, six shots behind the leaders.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004194&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/timsherwoodapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004192" alt="Tim Sherwood believes Tottenham Hotspurs are in a similar position to when Rodgers took charge of Liverpool in June 2012 (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/timsherwoodapm.jpg" /></a> Tim Sherwood believes Tottenham Hotspur are in a similar position to when Rodgers took charge of Liverpool in June 2012 (AP)
<p>Tottenham Hotspur head coach Tim Sherwood is looking to the example set by Brendan Rodgers&#8217; resurgent Liverpool as he plots for the future despite not receiving long-term assurances about his own position.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Northern Irishman Rodgers, Liverpool have been in electrifying form this season and sit second in the Premier League table on 59 points from 28 matches.</p>
<p>With the Merseyside club now on course to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2009, Sherwood believes Spurs are in a similar position to when Rodgers took charge of Liverpool in June 2012.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a good example is Brendan at Liverpool, seventh they finished last year,&#8221; Sherwood told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at where he is now and it&#8217;s a great example &#8211; that team plays exactly how he wants them to play.</p>
<p>&#8220;But they had to take a step back, we are talking about Liverpool, a team who has won the Champions League&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liverpool lost a lot of games last year, a lot of home games as well, and everyone was pointing the fingers, look at the rewards now.</p>
<p>&#8220;The season&#8217;s not finished, they have still got it all to do, but they&#8217;re in good knick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sherwood has steadied the ship at White Hart Lane since taking over from Andre Villas-Boas in December and, with Spurs fifth in the table, he wants to be given time to develop his own style of play.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see myself as more of a manager who builds something over a period of time,&#8221; said Sherwood, who has been on the coaching staff at Tottenham since he was appointed by former manager Harry Redknapp in 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I recognise at the moment that&#8217;s not possible because I have been dealt a hand here and I have to try and win games.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not 100 percent how I want to play but unfortunately I don&#8217;t have the time, the club don&#8217;t have the time and the fans don&#8217;t have the patience for all that project stuff &#8211; you need to win games.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the moment it is a balancing act and hopefully I get that opportunity to be able to build something for the future after the season finishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sherwood, who has lost twice in the league since taking charge, feels he is doing a good job, but acknowledges that other managers would like to replace him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The club are going to keep their options open and decide what they want to do in the future,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the club feel like they want to back me then it&#8217;s up to them, if they don&#8217;t then I&#8217;m just cracking on, I&#8217;m not going to be a different person for it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone wants to take this job. I have got the job at the moment and it is up to me to try and keep it.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004189&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/xavimessim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004188" alt="Xavi (left )has made more than 700 appearances for the Catalan club (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/xavimessim.jpg" /></a> Xavi (left )has made more than 700 appearances for the Catalan club (File)
<p>Playmaker Xavi, who has won 22 trophies in 16 glittering seasons with Barcelona, said on Saturday that he would love to take over as head coach one day.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old has made more than 700 appearances for the Catalan club, winning three Champions Leagues and seven La Liga titles since making his debut in August 1998.</p>
<p>Xavi&#8217;s contract at the Nou Camp expires in 2016 and the Spain midfielder wants to move into management once his playing days are over.</p>
<p>Asked in an interview with Britain&#8217;s Daily Mail newspaper if he would like to coach Barcelona in the future, Xavi replied: &#8220;I&#8217;d love to, yes &#8230; but that is for the future. Right now I love to play football.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re a kid playing, you enjoy having the ball don&#8217;t you? All I ever want to do is have the ball at my feet, bossing the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to remain in football forever and it would always have to be with Barcelona. That&#8217;s where my heart and feelings are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Xavi joined Barca&#8217;s academy as an 11-year-old in 1991 and was given his first-team chance under Dutch coach Louis van Gaal in a side featuring a young Carles Puyol, the player he now shares the club captaincy with.</p>
<p>Puyol said earlier this week that he would be leaving the Spanish champions at the end of the season after a persistent battle with a knee injury but Xavi has no intention of following suit.</p>
<p><strong>Excellent generation</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Barcelona through and through and have always wanted to stay here,&#8221; the playmaker said.</p>
<p>Xavi added that suggestions Barcelona were approaching the end of their era of dominance were wide of the mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an excellent generation of players,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Since (former coach Johan) Cruyff changed the history and philosophy of Barcelona, over the last five years that philosophy has gone &#8216;boom&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really exploded and we have made history but Barcelona can carry on winning trophies. This is a spectacular crop of players.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at their ages: (Cesc) Fabregas, (Lionel) Messi, (Andres) Iniesta, (Dani) Alves, Jordi Alba and (Gerard) Pique &#8211; they are all around 26, 27, 28, 29.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barcelona are chasing a treble this season.</p>
<p>They are second in La Liga, a point behind Real Madrid with 12 games remaining, and also meet their title rivals in the final of the King&#8217;s Cup next month.</p>
<p>Barca travel to struggling Real Valladolid in the league later on Saturday and host Manchester City on Wednesday in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie, defending a 2-0 lead.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004184&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ace Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal was outplayed by Chinese nemesis Shixian Wang in a lop-sided quarterfinal, bringing to an end India&#8217;s campaign in the All England Badminton Championship.</p>
<p>The world number 7 Indian lost 17-21 10-21 against fourth seed and world number 3 Shixian Wang in a duel which lasted 43<br />
minutes.</p>
<p>In a one-sided contest, Wang, against whom Saina had a 4-2 overall record heading into the match, dominated all through to set up a clash against compatriot and second seed Yihan Wang.</p>
<p>Wang beat Korea&#8217;s Yeon Ju Bae 21-8 21-13 in her quarterfinal contest. Wang is the reigning world champion besides being a silver-medallist at the World Championships.</p>
<p>Saina, who had lost to Shixian in their most recent encounter in the Swiss Open last year, was off-colour from the word go.</p>
<p>Her trademark smashes were nowhere to be seen and, in fact, the Indian, a semifinalist in the previous edition of the event, failed to pull off even one of them in either of the two games.</p>
<p>The Olympic bronze-medallist, who entered the tournament claiming that she was back to her best after clinching the Syed Modi Indian Open, fought for a while in the opening game but collapsed completely in the second.</p>
<p>Saina was the only Indian left in the championships as World No. 10 P V Sindhu found the going tough on her debut and lost to Sun Yu of China in the first round.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2004081&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/thirimannejayawardeneapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004222" alt="Lahiru Thirimanne and Mahela Jayawardene stitched a crucial partnership in the middle (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/thirimannejayawardeneapm.jpg" /></a> Lahiru Thirimanne and Mahela Jayawardene stitched a crucial partnership in the middle (AP)<span style="line-height:1.5;"> </span>
<p>Sri Lanka regained the Asia Cup trophy with a comfortable five-wicket victory over defending champions Pakistan, riding on Lasith Malinga&#8217;s five-wicket haul and opener Lahiru Thrimanne&#8217;s fluent century.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka were clinical as they restricted Pakistan to a modest 260 for five and then overhauled the target with 22 balls to spare to lift their fifth Asia Cup title. The last time they won the regional championship was in 2008.</p>
<p>Malinga pegged Pakistan back as he demolished the rival top order with his fierce pace and it was Fawad Alam&#8217;s magnificent unbeaten 114 that guided the holders to a decent total after deciding to bat.</p>
<p>Pakistan skipper Misbah ul Haq (65) and Umar Akmal (59) too batted with determination with fighting half-centuries as none of other Lankan bowlers could take a wicket.</p>
<p>Alam added 122 runs for the fourth wicket with Misbah and 115 with Akmal for the fifth at Shere Bangla stadium.</p>
<p>The Island nation had started brilliantly but spinner Saeed Ajmal removed Kusla Perera (42) and Kumar Sangakkara (0) off successive balls in the 11th over to take the fight to the rival camp.</p>
<p>However, Mahela Jayawardene (75) perfectly timed his return to form as he joined Thirimanne at the crease and added 156 runs for the third wicket in 27 overs. The partnership pushed Sri Lanka close to win.</p>
<p>Thirimanne scored 101 runs, his third ODI century, and faced 108 balls in his innings which was laced with 13 fours.</p>
<p>The left-handed batsman was bowled by Ajmal when Sri Lanka were just 14 runs away from the win. Bowling his final over, Ajmal beat the defense of Thirimanne with a &#8216;doosra&#8217;.</p>
<p>For Jayawardene, it was his first notable contribution for Sri Lanka in this tournament and it could not have come at a better time. He was dropped on 52 by Mohammed Hafeez off Umar Gul but was dismissed when he attempted a big shot off Mohammad Talha and found Sharjeel Khan.</p>
<p>His 75-run knock came off 93 balls with 10 boundaries including a six while Thrimanne.</p>
<p>The Lankan openers, Thirimanne and Perera, ensured that gave them a decent start, putting on 56 runs in 10 overs.</p>
<p>Ajmal briefly turned the match around for Pakistan when he had Perera stumped and trapped the in-form Sangakkara with a doosra in the next ball to bring on an out-of-form Jayawardene.</p>
<p>The former Lankan captain, who had 36 runs from his last four innings, lived up to the team&#8217;s faith as he calmly went about the chase with Thirimanne playing the lead role.</p>
<p>Luck too aided the Lankans when Thriminnne was dropped on 36 by wicketkeeper Akmal while Jaywardene&#8217;s appeal was turned down by umpire Bruce Oxenford in the same 20th over.</p>
<p>For some strange reason, Pakistan&#8217;s main weapon in Ajmal was taken out of the attack after the 15th over in a seemingly defensive strategy, a move that did not work.</p>
<p>Ajmal returned in 27th over but it was too late as by then Thirimanne had sprinted to 64 from 63 balls, while Jayawardene looked to have got his silken touch back having hit four boundaries and one six to be on 40 from 55 balls.</p>
<p>From there on it was a match for Pakistan to lose and nothing went in their way &#8212; from a flurry of dropped catches to lack of sloppy fielding.</p>
<p>Having completed his half-century with a boundary to Gul, Jayawardene top edged one but this time Hafeez slipped the skier.</p>
<p>Earlier, Fawad Alam&#8217;s struck his maiden ODI century after Malinga made early inroads. Alam struck eight boundaries and three sixes en route to his first hundred from 29 matches.</p>
<p>Alam mostly played in front of the wicket and ran between the wickets hard. Barring one reprieve he got when he was dropped on 92 by Chaturanga de Silva at midwicket, it was a chanceless innings from Alam, even as Malinga ran with a second five-for against them in the tournament.</p>
<p>Alam cruised to the three-figure mark by pulling Thisara Perera for a six over midwicket.</p>
<p>In Umar Akmal, he found a perfect partner and the duo added 115 runs for the fifth wicket, something that ensured Shahid Afridi (0 no) remained stranded without getting strike for a single ball in the final.</p>
<p>First, it was the Lankans&#8217; bold strategy to drop out mystery spinner Ajantha Mendis, perhaps in a move to counter Shahid Afridi&#8217;s belligerent form, that surprised many as they went with a batting combination in the most important match of the tournament.</p>
<p>Malinga was back to get the new ball so was Sharjeel Khan after recovering from an injury as the Pakistan opener punched the Lankan pacer for two boundaries in the first over.</p>
<p>But Malinga had the last laugh as the aggressive looking Sharjeel looking for a third boundary was caught brilliantly by a Perera at mid on.</p>
<p>Malinga was on a roll taking a second and third wickets in his next two overs with the Pakistan&#8217;s top order of Sharjeel, Ahmed Shehzad and Mohammad Hafeez getting out for 8, 5 and 3 respectively.</p>
<p>While Sharjeel threw his wicket away looking to step up the momentum, Shehzad and Hafeez perished to some genuine outswingers as Malinga put Sri Lanka on top in his first three overs.</p>
<p>While Malinga was doing the damage, Lakmal impressed at the other end as he bowled with pace, and in the right areas to tighten the proceedings.</p>
<p>Lakmal conceded just 10 runs from his first spell of five overs that included two maidens including one to Pakistani skipper Misbah who took utmost caution with his last three innings read an woeful 0, 1 and 4.</p>
<p>Thankfully for Misbah, he found a perfect ally in lefthanded in form batsman Alam who looked impressive with his 74 in their last match against Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Alam looked compact even with his wide open stance and never had any trouble as the left-hander smartly rotated the strikes with Misbah in Pakistan&#8217;s mission recovery.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003956&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The much-awaited hearing on betting and spot-fixing scandal in IPL was adjourned with the Supreme Court posting the case for March 25 when it would take cognisance of its probe panel report indicting BCCI chief N Srinivasan’s son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan in the scam.</span></p>
<p>A bench headed by Justice A K Patnaik said the case will be heard on non-miscellaneous day as the hearing would take time. It also agreed to consider contents of a sting operation which a news channel wanted to place before it on the scam.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court-appointed committee has said Meiyappan’s role in CSK as the team official and his involvement in betting during the IPL matches stands proved.</p>
<p>The report of the committee, headed by former Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Mukul Mudgal, however, said allegations of fixing against Meiyappan require further investigation and also left it to Supreme Court the issue of conflict of interest against Srinivasan, who heads India Cements that owns CSK.</p>
<p>“The role of Gurunath Meiyappan in Chennai Super Kings(CSK) as the team official stands proved and the allegations of betting and passing of information against Meiyappan stand proved,” said the report of the committee presented to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“However, the allegations of fixing require further investigation,” the committee, also comprising Additional Solicitor General N Nagehswar Rao and Assam Cricket Association member Nilay Dutta, had said.</p>
<p>The over 100-page report went into various issues like suspected involvement of six India-capped players in fixing,betting allegations against Rajasthan Royals owners and the need to bring discipline in players.</p>
<p>Under the Franchise Agreement and IPL’s anti-corruption code, CSK runs the risk of facing disciplinary action including ban for the acts of Meiyappan, who was its Team Principal, for bringing the game into disrepute.</p>
<p>“The committee is of the view that the material on record clearly indicates that Meiyappan was the face of CSK and the team official of CSK,” the report had said, while rejecting Srinivasan’s contention that he was merely a cricket enthusiast.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003734&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/australiaplayersreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003944" alt="Mark Taylor believes Australia are the best team in the world at the moment, never mind the Test rankings (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/australiaplayersreutersm.jpg" /></a> Mark Taylor believes Australia are the best team in the world at the moment, never mind the Test rankings (Reuters)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The resounding thud of South Africa’s fall on home soil capped an intriguing season of Test cricket that has seen the establishment rocked and an ambitious Australia return to court with a swagger.</span></p>
<p>Starched whites dispensed, the game now descends into a morass of short form matches before the World T20, but the impact of Australia’s epic win at Newlands on Wednesday may echo long after the Bangladesh carnival wraps up.</p>
<p>Australia’s 2-1 series triumph, following their 5-0 whitewash of England at home, has seen Michael Clarke’s team leapfrog India into second place in the world Test rankings.</p>
<p>For this, they also owe thanks to their gritty neighbours New Zealand, whose triple-century scoring captain Brendon McCullum helped them secure a 1-0 series win over poor tourists India.</p>
<p>A wounded South Africa retain their spot at the pinnacle of Test cricket but captain Graeme Smith’s retirement has left the team rudderless and vulnerable.</p>
<p>“If you go back to my era, before the rankings existed, we always felt if you beat the number one in their own backyard you took over their mantle,” former Australia captain Mark Taylor said in comments published by Fairfax Media on Friday.</p>
<p>“I think using the same yardstick, Australia can certainly say they are the equal of South Africa at this stage. And now that &#8230; they have lost Smith you would probably have to say Australia (are top).”</p>
<p>While lacking the trauma of England’s 5-0 loss to Australia, which saw spinner Graeme Swann retire and batsman Kevin Pietersen sacked, South Africa’s braintrust also face a period of soul-searching.</p>
<p>Few other teams have been so defined by their leader, and Smith’s retirement after a decade in charge comes hot on the heels of the exit of Jacques Kallis, arguably the game’s greatest all-rounder, and coach Gary Kirsten.</p>
<p>The net loss of decades of experience compounds South Africa’s more tangible problems of bedding down an opening batsman to replace the hard-bitten Smith and finding another bowling option to compensate for Kallis ahead of a two-test series against Sri Lanka slated for July.</p>
<p>England, who have been dropped to fourth in Test rankings, have a chance to reel in third-ranked India when they host the team in July and August following two home Tests against Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Australia, however, will have to wait until a two-Test series away to fifth-ranked Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in October to improve their ranking points.</p>
<p>While Australia’s resurgence against England was largely down to their Mitchell Johnson-fired pace attack, their batting lineup shared the load in South Africa, with David Warner plundering 543 runs at an average of over 90 in the three-match series.</p>
<p>“In Australia it was more about the bowlers bowling them out and batters probably not doing their role well enough (in) the home series but here they were outstanding,” Australia coach Darren Lehmann said in Cape Town.</p>
<p><strong>Sustained excellence</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A tilt at South Africa’s top spot will require sustained excellence from both batsmen and in the field, he added.</p>
<p>Much will rest on the creaking bones of a greying Australian side, with 34-year-old paceman Ryan Harris set for major knee surgery and captain Clarke’s aching back an ongoing lottery.</p>
<p>Opening batsman Chris Rogers and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin will also be pushing 38 by the time Australia ready for next year’s Ashes series against England.</p>
<p>“If they’re playing well they’ll play,” Lehmann said. If they’re not they won’t. It’s pretty simple.”</p>
<p><strong>Aussies panned for boorish behaviour</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sydney:</strong> Australia’s media has acclaimed its cricket team’s epic series win over South Africa, but not the manner in which they achieved it. Their aggressive brand of cricket under coach Darren Lehmann was rebuked by sections of the media on Friday over their on-field behavior during the final Cape Town Test. “Darren Lehmann has guided the Australian cricket side to the top of the world.</p>
<p>His next challenge is to control it,” News Ltd cricket columnist Robert Craddock said.</p>
<p>“Australian fans like to see their side play tough cricket but social media in Australia yesterday had strong feedback from fans wanting their side to behave better.</p>
<p>“The sight of Michael Clarke angrily confronting umpires and Australian fieldsmen barking like dogs at batsmen left a lot of people cold and alienated from the team and its success.” <strong>(PTI)</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003732&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahidafridiapm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003940" alt="Pakistan's Shahid Afridi and Umar Gul stretch during a practice session in Dhaka on Friday (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahidafridiapm1.jpg" /></a> Pakistan&#8217;s Shahid Afridi and Umar Gul stretch during a practice session in Dhaka on Friday (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">On Friday morning, at the Sher-e-Bangla stadium, the Pakistan team had a kickabout ahead of their net session. On the sidelines, Shahid Afridi gingerly lowered himself onto a chair inside the team tent. Then, after the players were sufficiently warmed up and the cricket session started, Afridi eased himself up and walked off the training ground with Pakistan team physio Richard Feher by his side and an ice pack in his hands. </span></p>
<p>If Afridi was disappointed on missing out on training, it would pale next to what Pakistan’s management would feel if the all-rounder’s hip flexor doesn’t heal in time for the final.</p>
<p>Afridi is uncertain for Saturday’s final as he is carrying what team officials say is a grade one injury. He jarred the muscle during Pakistan’s last match against Bangladesh and was clearly limping when he was run out to a direct hit, attempting a sharp single. Afridi has since been under the physio’s surveillance and while he had said on Wednesday that he was confident of playing, there is no guarantee of that happening. As such, the question on everybody’s mind’s is whether he can make it.</p>
<p>The official reaction, however, is guarded.</p>
<p>“We will assess his situation tomorrow morning and will take a call,” said team manager Zakir Khan. However, even if Afridi is not hundred percent, the temptation to play Pakistan’s biggest match-winner would be massive. Without his 18-ball 34 not out against India and 25-ball 59 against Bangladesh, the defending Asia Cup champions would have been back home by now.</p>
<p>While Afridi’s may appear to be the most pressing injury concern for Pakistan, it isn’t the only one. Opener Ahmed Shehzad, who struck a century in Pakistan’s record chase against Bangladesh three days ago, is nursing a left shoulder injury. His partner Sharjeel Khan, however, is recovering well from a leg injury that ruled him out of the Bangladesh game. Among the bowlers, pacer Umar Gul has a stiff back.</p>
<p><strong>‘Plan B in place’</strong></p>
<p>But captain Misbah-ul-Haq is keeping a brave front. “We have back-up plans. Obviously, the replacements won’t be like Afridi but they can do the job for us,” he said. If the injuries take their toll and if Pakistan do lose players for the final, they will clearly be underdogs against a side who have reached the final with an all-win record in the group stage.</p>
<p>Beyond the injury concerns, three factors might decide the outcome of the final. These would be the spin contest between Saeed Ajmal and Ajantha Mendis; how well Pakistan’s batting tackles Lasith Malinga and finally whether Kumar Sangakkara continues his good form.</p>
<p>The spin duel first. The 36-year-old Ajmal has been concentrating on his economy this tournament and has picked eight wickets while giving away just 4.51 an over, despite bowling many spells at the death. Mendis, on the other hand, is on a comeback trail and he, too,has had a successful outing so far, picking up nine wickets from three matches at an economy rate of 4.84.</p>
<p>The last time the two teams played — in the group stage — Pakistan lost the match essentially to Malinga’s death-overs bowling. At 242 for four in the 43rd over chasing 297, they were in cruise control. Then Malinga changed everything with a five wicket burst over 14 deliveries as Pakistan fell12 runs short. Pakistan like to build their innings upfront to allow them a late charge. It would be interesting to see if they change their plans as a counter-ploy to the Malinga-factor.</p>
<p>Sangakkara is the highest scorer of the tournament with 248 runs, including a century and two half-centuries. The Sri Lankan master will once again mark his guard with the intention to bat through the innings.</p>
<p>Spare a thought for Mahela Jayawardene as well. The experienced middle-order batsman is going through a form slump with just 36 runs in four matches. In three of the four games, the fall of his wicket has triggered a collapse. Sri Lanka need him to get into the groove to hold together the middle order.</p>
<p>Pakistan have won the Asia Cup four times and Sri Lanka have won it twice. But this is a new game and at Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium; they’ve prepared a new pitch for the final which looks like it may not support the spinners as much as in the previous games. Unfortunately, the final may not be played out in front of a big crowd. Bangladesh is still in mourning over their team’s limp show.</p>
<p><em>Live on Star Sports 1: 1:30 pm</em></p>
<p><strong>Pakistan will continue to get better, says Abbas</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Despite his official designation as Pakistan’s chief cricket consultant, Zaheer Abbas doesn’t have a problem offering advice to the young Indian batsmen, should they approach him. And ask Mohammad Azharuddin and Sourav Ganguly, and they will doff their hats to the Pakistan legend. Both had sought him out for help during their playing days and were immensely benefited. In an interview with The Indian Express, Abbas spoke about his new role, managing Shahid Afridi and Indian batting. Excerpts:</span></em></p>
<p><strong>What’s the role of a consultant?</strong></p>
<p>My job is to detect the problems and try to resolve them as soon as possible. Pakistan batting has had its shortcomings. There’s room for improvement. But the process has started and things have already improved. We will continue to get better, but it will take some time. So it’s a challenge which I’m thoroughly enjoying. It’s a great challenge for me to show some knowledge. The boys need to understand each and everything, and they’re doing so. So far the results are good. It’s an exam everyday but the whole process will take a year or so. The way we are progressing, I’m very hopeful.</p>
<p><strong>Is it tough to work in a completely different cricket culture as the game has changed so much from your era?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing has changed, if you ask me. You still have to bat for 50 overs. And if you’re able to bat for the full 50 overs, you improve your chances of winning. It’s a matter of keeping the scoreboard ticking. The main thing is to take singles.</p>
<p><strong>So there’s no generation gap?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Why generation gap? We were part of the Packer revolution. We were the first set of players to use coloured clothing and white ball. Things change with time. You have to keep pace.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you so averse to playing lofted shots?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The basic idea about playing your shots in cricket is to find the gaps. It’s not that they’re barred from playing lofted shots. I’ve suggested them to play every ball on its merit. If you spend some time in the middle, you can improvise. You can play lap shots and ramp shots, or whatever you like. But you’ve to follow a simple rule to score runs — make the most of the bad balls and respect the good ones.</p>
<p><strong>You must be happy to see Shahid Afridi back in form. Any specific advice for him?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Afridi is a confidence player. All he needs is an arm around his shoulder. He usually bats in the last 10 overs. I just keep telling him, if you give yourself a little bit of time, no harm done.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003730&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sarfarazkhanm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003970" alt="Sarfaraz Khan was one of India’s best players in the Dubai U-19 World Cup " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sarfarazkhanm.jpg" /></a> Sarfaraz Khan was one of India’s best players in the Dubai U-19 World Cup
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">For two weeks, Sarfaraz Khan enjoyed a rare and unique fling with the spotlight. Being the cynosure on a cricket field might not have been that new an experience for him, considering his gargantuan achievements in school cricket. But this was his first time grabbing eyeballs on television. And during the course of the U-19 World Cup it was the 16-year-old who proved to be India’s go-to man, whether it was while orchestrating eye-catching cameos with the bat or snaring acrobatic catches in the outfield. </span></p>
<p>The Indian colts, who went into the tournament as defending champions, made an early exit but not before Sarfaraz had lit up the tournament with his hard-hitting exploits.</p>
<p>For now, life has returned to normal. The Indian jersey is now tucked away safely in the cupboard at his home in Kurla. Sarfaraz is back in his grime-ridden whites, grime accumulated from the maidaans of Mumbai. Back under the stringent vigil of his father, Naushad, at his club’s nets at Azad Maidan.</p>
<p>The loss to England in the World Cup quarterfinals though still rankles. And he only echoes the sentiments of the entire Indian team when he admits that the team too never expected to be shown the door so prematurely.</p>
<p>“We went there on the back of four series wins and it took one day to spoil a whole year’s hard-work. After the defeat against England, I just went in and broke down. My team-mates asked me to accompany them for post-match presentation but I just couldn’t. I kept crying for a long time,” says Sarfaraz.</p>
<p>What hurt more was that the Indian bowlers had failed to defend a decent total, one that had been set up by the youngster’s death-over heroics, as he smashed an unbeaten 52. That knock was in many ways symptomatic of his contributions throughout the World Cup. In the pressure game against Pakistan, Sarfaraz had walked in with his team in trouble and following a nervy beginning produced a match-winning 74. He then had shown nerves of steel in guiding his team in a tricky run-chase against Scotland, scoring an unbeaten 45, having walked in at 22 for 5.</p>
<p><strong>Feeling the pinch</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“I was under pressure before going to the World Cup. I had just one hundred but that too had come in a crunch situation in Vizag. I wasn’t carrying the same form as the others were,” he adds.</p>
<p>He does admit to have been slightly overawed by the big stage, especially when he came up against Pakistan. For the first 15 balls, he was all at sea. “I told myself enough is enough after that start. There was no point getting dismissed while simply trying to block the ball. My opponents thought that I wasn’t good at the sweep-shot but I showed them that it was instead my favourite shot,” adds Sarfaraz.</p>
<p>His sweep shot was a result of the many matches he had played on the many grounds around Mumbai that have short square boundaries. Father Naushad had taught him the techniques of preparing a wicket.</p>
<p>“Once you know how to make a pitch, you start reading it better. The ones in Dubai were on the slower side. On those kind of wickets, you have to be dead sure about moving forward or back as a batsman. But I had done my homework,” the youngster explains.</p>
<p>Unlike some of his U-19 teammates, Sarfaraz will not now get to showcase his impressive skills on the IPL stage. He’ll have to wait another 12 months to do that as he was yet to play a first-class match for his state team. But he could soon be on the brink, considering immediately after his return from Dubai, Sarfaraz was called up to the Mumbai side for the Vijay Hazare Trophy.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003724&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">India’s top badminton star Saina Nehwal laboured past American Beiwen Zhang in three tough games to reach the women’s singles quarterfinals of the All-England badminton championships.</span></p>
<p>The seventh seed Saina defeated the American qualifier 24-22, 18-21, 21-19 in an hour in the second round contest to remain as the only Indian in the prestigious championship.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Games gold medallist next faces fourth seed Chinese Wang Shixian, who brushed aside the challenge of Ireland’s Chloe Magee of 21-15, 21-12 in her second round match.</p>
<p><strong>Form, a concern</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Ratchanok Intanon, the youngest-ever World singles champion, moved to within one win of a probable All-England Open showdown with Li Xuerui, the Olympic champion, before admitting her patchy form is scary.</p>
<p>The two women battled into the quarterfinals on Thursday, with the 19-year-old Thai coming from behind for the second day in succession and then producing a confessional about her mental state.</p>
<p>At one stage Ratchanok was a game down and the scores were tied at 11-11 all, before getting past Han Li, the World No.19 from China, by 18-21, 21-14, 21-11.</p>
<p>The day before she was within three points of defeat against the Singaporean Gu Juan. Honing her survival instincts in this way despite a patchy performance may be crucial, as the seven months since she overcame Li in the world final have, she admits, been hard to handle.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone’s target</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Everyone has been trying to beat me and I have been putting myself under pressure and been scared of the losses,” said the Thai teenager. “So I try to concentrate on practising. I try not to think about the World championships because I am not the World No.1.”</p>
<p>That of course is Li, who earlier made a great escape for the second successive day by coming from a game and 8-13 down against Minatsu Mitani, the World No.16 from Japan, also drifting to within three points of defeat before winning 14-21, 21-19, 21-15.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003718&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sebastianvettelapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003953" alt="Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel helps push his Red Bull back to the garage after breaking down during pre-season testing in Bahrain, earlier this week. The 2014 season begins in Melbourne a week from now (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sebastianvettelapm.jpg" /></a> Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel helps push his Red Bull back to the garage after breaking down during pre-season testing in Bahrain, earlier this week. The 2014 season begins in Melbourne a week from now (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">If the tough get going when the going gets tough, then the Formula One season starting in Australia next week should offer Sebastian Vettel ample opportunity to roll up his sleeves and play the paddock hard man.</span></p>
<p>On the evidence of pre-season testing, the quadruple champion and his Red Bull team are up against it as the sport braces for an unpredictable new hybrid turbo era in Melbourne.</p>
<p>“Right now it is not an easy situation, but there is no reason to hang the head,” said the 26-year-old German, who is bidding to become only the second driver after compatriot Michael Schumacher to win five titles in a row, as Red Bull wrapped up a troubled final test in Bahrain. “When I listen to some media we are right in the middle of a huge disaster&#8230;but we will fight through it. Everybody in the team &#8211; including me &#8211; is ready to fight,” Vettel said.</p>
<p>The glamour world of Grand Prix racing is in the throes of a revolution, one that will be televised around the world, and Vettel is a young king whose throne is most definitely threatened in what could be a rollercoaster year. Success-starved rivals can sense their time has come, spurred on by rare signs of weakness from the once dominant team.</p>
<p><strong>Biggest change</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The technical change is the biggest most of the sport’s engineers and mechanics have ever seen thanks to the introduction of a new turbocharged V6 engine with energy recovery systems.</p>
<p>In this brave new world, Red Bull’s preparations have been little short of shocking with neither Vettel &#8211; who won the last nine races of 2013 and has not been beaten since July &#8211; nor his new and ever-smiling Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo completing a race simulation.</p>
<p>All the Renault-powered teams have struggled to log as much mileage as their Mercedes and Ferrari rivals &#8211; Cosworth having now disappeared as an engine supplier &#8211; after experiencing problems bedding in the new power unit.</p>
<p>Reliability is a key concern for all teams, and the early races could be full of surprises with fuel economy coming to the fore and drivers playing a game of hare and tortoise to get to the finish.</p>
<p>The big question is how quickly Red Bull will be able to overcome their problems and whether testing is an accurate reflection of what will come when the lights go out in Melbourne.</p>
<p><strong>Early favourites</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Lewis Hamilton, whose Mercedes team are already the early favourites, expects Red Bull to be firing on all cylinders sooner than might be expected.</p>
<p>“They look like they have a stunning car, and usually the more beautiful it is the faster it is so I’m sure they’ve got a pretty quick car this year,” said the Briton who won his 2008 title with McLaren.</p>
<p>“Once they get the engine sorted, or the systems that they might be struggling with, I think they’ll &#8211; as always &#8211; be very hard to beat.”</p>
<p>Mercedes-powered Williams &#8211; who have signed a rejuvenated Brazilian Felipe Massa from Ferrari to replace Venezuelan Pastor Maldonado &#8211; have also looked strong in testing after scoring just five points in a dismal 2013.</p>
<p>Ferrari, reunited with 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen in a lineup of champions with Fernando Alonso, have kept their cards close to their chest but the engine has looked reliable.</p>
<p>Expect sparks between those two fire and ice characters, the first champions Ferrari has paired since 1954, if the car proves to be a championship contender.</p>
<p>The same applies to Mercedes, where Hamilton and Nico Rosberg’s friendship could be sorely tested.</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid racing</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Nothing, however, can be taken for granted. “We have seen cars struggle to do a race distance in pre-season but then finish the first race on the podium. We have seen it countless times and it can happen again,” Mercedes engine chief Andy Cowell told autosport.com. “ Melbourne is a very exciting step into this new world of hybrid F1. I really don’t know how it is going to unfold.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cwgm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003949" alt="Fearing that coaches will be called away on polling duty, SAI’s Thomson has requested the chief electoral officer to allow training to continue as per schedule (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cwgm.jpg" /></a> Fearing that coaches will be called away on polling duty, SAI’s Thomson has requested the chief electoral officer to allow training to continue as per schedule (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The director general of the Sports Authority of India, Jiji Thomson, has requested the chief electoral officer of Delhi to spare his officials who might be called up to assist during the Lok Sabha elections.</span></p>
<p>In the past, the bulk of SAI staff, as government of India officials, have been called in to assist with election related work. Last year, during the Delhi assembly elections held in December 2013, 232 SAI personnel — including officers and secretarial staff — were deployed to help out in polling and other details.</p>
<p>Fearing a similar number of officials would be forced to help out with the elections this time too, Thomson has written a letter to special chief electoral officer Shurbir Singh to spare his officers this time around. Instead, he has requested that only 88 staff members (the list with their contact numbers has been attached with the letter), who are mostly lower rung employees, be deployed in poll-related duties.</p>
<p>With the Commonwealth Games just 150 days away, Thomson said that the removal of his project officers, stadia-in-charges and accounts officers will affect the training of the Indian athletes, currently on-duty at various national camps.</p>
<p>“We just cannot afford to lose momentum in training as we are left with less than 150 days for the Commonwealth Games. Even a temporary disruption will adversely affect the training schedule and, I am afraid, this would have a dampening effect on our medal hunt,” Thomson’s letter to Delhi’s chief electoral officer read. “I would be grateful if you could kindly consider this aspect while detailing the officers on poll duty,” Thomson added.</p>
<p>When contacted, Thomson said that national camps were affected during last year’s Delhi Assembly polls too, when coaches were taken away for poll duties. “Suppose some of our accounts officers are called up, who will replace them? Payments have to be made and if for some reason the dietary supplements do not reach athletes because the payments weren’t made in time, what do you think will happen? Who will be blamed for not doing the job?</p>
<p>“Also there are specialised jobs, where replacing people are impossible. No one can replace a video analyst if he is missing for poll duty. I cannot replace a stadia in-charge with a lesser officer,” he said.</p>
<p>Thomson is worried on a different count too. At the moment, SAI is also compiling the Annual Calendar for Training and Competition (ACTC) for 2014-15 for all sporting disciplines. Disbursement of funds to these disciplines is a part of the discussions. The process has to finish before the end of March and if any of the project officers, who liaison between SAI and the federations, are called up for election duty, the planning process will be severely hit.</p>
<p>“We have to finalise this (ACTC) as soon as we can. Both the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games are near and any delay will hit our preparations,” Thomson added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003713&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tigerwoodsapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003973" alt="A spectator lifts up a rope for Tiger Woods after play was suspended due to inclement weather (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tigerwoodsapm.jpg" /></a> A spectator lifts up a rope for Tiger Woods after play was suspended due to inclement weather (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">American Harris English birdied his final hole in fading light to grab the clubhouse lead at the weather hit WGC-Cadillac Championship on Thursday with most of the field still on the course when play was suspended due to darkness.<br />
</span></p>
<p>English, who returned a three-under 69 on the revamped Blue Monster course was joined at the top of a crowded leaderboard with compatriots Hunter Mahan, Jason Dufner, Patrick Reed and Italian Francesco Molinari also on three-under, though they still have to complete their first rounds.</p>
<p>The redesigned course was put to an early test as a violent storm swept across south Florida drenching the Doral resort causing a two hour, 24 minute weather delay that allowed only six of the 68 players to complete their rounds.</p>
<p>English, who has four top 10 finishes in his last five PGA Tour starts, ended his day in spectacular style rolling a 47-foot birdie putt on the par-three ninth to complete an error free back nine.</p>
<p>“We were pretty much running to the tee on nine.” English said. “Jonas (Blixt) had just birdied eight and he said he wanted to hit, and Brendon (De Jonge) and I were very happy with that.</p>
<p>“It was getting really dark, very quickly, but I wanted to finish the hole, because it really changes the way you approach the day, waking up and playing one hole at 8:00 in the morning and then waiting around for three or four hours for your tee time. (It) is tough to do.</p>
<p>“That way in the morning, we can have a normal day.”</p>
<p>Dufner, who got his round off to a blazing start with four successive birdies from the 11th, missed a chance to hold the outright lead when his six-foot par putt on the seventh rolled past the cup to take a bogey with two holes still to play. Mahan will have four holes to complete, Molinari five and Reed seven when first round action resumes on Friday.</p>
<p>Lurking one shot behind the leaders on two-under is a pack of seven golfers led by Australian world number two Adam Scott, who will have a chance replace Tiger Woods at the top of the rankings if he wins on Sunday. While Woods struggled with his putter, Scott reeled off seven successive pars to open his round before picking up his first birdie at the eighth then draining in a 12-footer at the ninth.</p>
<p><strong>Woods struggles</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Woods laboured to two-over slumping off the course with a bogey at the 10th to leave him five behind the leaders and eight holes required to complete his round. “Warmup was good and I felt good all day even through the delay,” said Woods. “I’m ready to go back out tomorrow and play well. Hopefully tomorrow I can get back out there in the morning, play well and work back to even par by the end of the first round. Then shoot a low one in the afternoon.”</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy got his day off to a flying start with birdies on three of his opening four holes. But after a bogey-birdie wobble at 14 and 15 the Northern Irishman suddenly lost his form finishing his first nine with back-to-back bogeys. Another bogey at the fourth and the double major winner found himself among another large group at one-under with four to play.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003708&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pankajadvaniie.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003991" alt="Pankaj Advani and Vidya Pillai with their trophies (Express Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pankajadvaniie.jpg" /></a> Pankaj Advani and Vidya Pillai with their trophies (Express Photo)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Eight time world champion Pankaj Advani of Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) outclassed Kamal Chawla of Railways 6-3 (85(84)-00, 38-88, 70-15, 90(69)-03, 36-64, 100(61)-05, 23-85(85), 86(64)-00, 139(139)-00) to bag the men’s snooker title in the Manisha Billiards and Snooker Nationals, in Lucknow on Friday. </span></p>
<p>Twenty-eight-year-old Pankaj had made his intentions very clear from the very initial stages of this snooker competition. He had opened his campaign with a clearance break of 145 and in Friday’s final he nearly managed to match his career high with a break of 139.</p>
<p>Advani didn’t have it all his way however. After he lost the first frame, Kamal levelled the scores in the very next frame. Advani once again edged forward over the next two frames to take a 3-1 lead but Chawla hit back once again to decrease the margin.</p>
<p>But as the match progressed, Advani began hitting his stride and he took the title in style with the massive break. Advani however will have little time to celebrate his snooker win. He now has billiards on his mind for on Saturday, Pankaj flies to China where he plays the Haikou Open from March 10 to 16.</p>
<p><strong>Pillai wins women’s title</strong></p>
<p>The women’s snooker crown went to Vidya Pillai of Karnataka who defeated statemate Chitra M by 4-3 (38-67, 16-55, 63-29, 96(76)-08, 36-70, 56-42, 56-47), to clinch her eighth title. The result was doubly special for Pillai as she had returned to the game recently after taking a break when pregnant. “I have a two-year-old son. I had taken a break of seven months when I was expectant and had started playing again only when he was six-month old. It is not very easy when you return after a long break but I am happy that I was able to excel again,” she says.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003705&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lionelmessiapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003979" alt="Lionel Messi vomits during the friendly game against Romania in Bucharest on Wednesday (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/lionelmessiapm.jpg" /></a> Lionel Messi vomits during the friendly game against Romania in Bucharest on Wednesday (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Recent episodes of vomiting suffered by Barcelona forward Lionel Messi are “not normal” but they do not affect his performance and there is no cause for alarm, coach Gerardo Martino said on Friday. Messi was sick during Argentina’s 0-0 draw with Romania on Wednesday and the four-times World Player of the Year said it was something that had occurred several times at Barca but was nothing to be concerned about.</span></p>
<p>“It happens to him regularly and he has even gone to see specialists at certain times,” Martino said ahead of Barca’s La Liga game at Real Valladolid on Saturday. “They haven’t solved the problem but it isn’t a cause for concern. It doesn’t affect him at all in terms of doing his job,” he added.</p>
<p>Barca, chasing a fifth title in six years, can pull two points clear of Real Madrid at the top with a win at Valladolid, who are battling relegation down in 18th. Real are at home to eighth-placed Levante on Sunday, while Atletico Madrid, three points off the top in third, play at Celta Vigo, who are 11th, on Saturday.</p>
<p>Martino has Gerard Pique back after the Spain defender was declared fit.</p>
<p>He missed the world and European champions’ 1-0 win at home to Italy on Wednesday due to a minor calf problem.</p>
<p>Andres Iniesta withdrew from the squad on Friday “for personal reasons” and has been replaced by midfielder Ibrahim Afellay, Barca added. They did not explain the reasons.&#8217;</p>
<p>With an eye on Barca’s packed calendar in March, including Wednesday’s Champions League last 16, second leg against Manchester City, Martino said he had decided to rest left back Jordi Alba for the Valladolid trip. Alba was out for more than two months with a hamstring injury before Christmas and was briefly sidelined by a similar thigh problem last month. Barca lead City 2-0 from the first leg.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003704&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/josemourinhom.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003995" alt="Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea are unbeaten in 13 league games since the start of December last year (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/josemourinhom.jpg" /></a> Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea are unbeaten in 13 league games since the start of December last year (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has spent most of the season downplaying his team’s chances of winning the English Premier League title. One good result this weekend and he may have to revise his opinion.</span></p>
<p>With Liverpool inactive and fellow title rivals Arsenal and Manchester City in FA Cup action, Chelsea can extend its lead in the Premier League to seven points by beating Tottenham at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. City’s focus will be on defeating second-tier club Wigan in the FA Cup quarterfinals in a repeat of last year’s final. The other big last-eight match is Arsenal vs. Everton.</p>
<p>Mourinho has labeled Chelsea the “little horse” in the title race, perceiving his squad to be full of young talent with little championship-winning experience. Unbeaten in 13 league matches since the start of December, the team is looking more and more like a thoroughbred.</p>
<p>Boasting the league’s tightest defense, the Blues haven’t been hindered by a shortage of goals from their strikers as at least one of their slew of attacking midfielders, be it Eden Hazard, Oscar, Willian or Andre Schuerrle, seems to deliver when it matters. Defeating Tottenham would put Chelsea nine points clear of Man City, considered by many to be the other title favorite, although City would have three games in hand.</p>
<p><strong>A bridge too far</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Spurs have a dreadful record at Stamford Bridge — they haven’t won there since 1990, when Gary Lineker was their match-winner — and Mourinho still has never lost a league match at the ground. Twenty four years have passed and 15 managers have come and gone at the north London club since Tottenham last won at Chelsea — a miserable sequence that even the most optimistic Spurs fans would struggle to believe will end on Saturday. Tim Sherwood’s side have picked up 29 points on the road this season, winning nine games out of 14. Chelsea have been strong at home, though, winning 12 and drawing two as Mourinho’s incredible statistic of never having lost a league game at Stamford Bridge rolls on.</p>
<p>West Bromwich Albion claimed its first league win at Old Trafford in 35 years by beating Manchester United 2-1 in September, one of a string of poor results for the champions this season. Another defeat to West Brom, this time on Saturday at The Hawthorns, would surely end United’s faint hopes of finishing in the top four and qualifying for next season’s Champions League. David Moyes’ side heads into the game 12 points behind fourth-place Man City, having played a game more. And its last match was a 2-0 loss to Olympiakos in the Champions League, earning the team widespread criticism.</p>
<p><strong>Arsenal&#8217;s last hope</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The FA Cup looks to be Arsenal’s best chance of ending a nine-year wait for silverware. A 1-0 loss to Stoke last weekend dented the Gunners’ Premier League hopes, leaving them four points behind in-form Chelsea after leading the standings for much of the season.</p>
<p>And Arsenal has an extremely tough task to qualify for the quarterfinals of the Champions League, having lost 2-0 at home to Bayern Munich in the first leg of the last 16. The FA Cup was the last trophy lifted by Arsenal, in 2005 when it beat Man United on penalties.</p>
<p>Fulham coach Felix Magath will be without winger Damien Duff, who may have played his last match for the club, when his side faces Cardiff City in a must-win Premier League relegation scrap on Saturday.</p>
<p>Fulham, who are bottom of the standings on 21 points with 10 matches remaining, face a Cardiff side who are just one point and one place above them and were thumped 4-0 at home by Hull City in their last home match.</p>
<p><strong>Fulham’s strikers’ block</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>They have also failed to score in four of their last six home matches and have not scored in any of their last four league games, home or away. Fulham have not won in the league since New Years Day and are four points away from safety.</p>
<p>“It’s the most difficult because now we are behind the other teams. We have developed in the last 14 days and the team is growing together and that is what makes me sure we can avoid relegation,” Magath said.</p>
<p>Magath’s first two matches at Fulham helm have ended in a 1-1 draw at West Bromwich Albion and last week’s 3-1 defeat at home to Chelsea, although Fulham looked an improved side for the first hour.</p>
<p>“The best confidence you can get is if you win,” he said. “We need a win for our confidence. If I look at the schedules, I know we have quite a good schedule in the last 10 games. Everybody has to put in a shift and push the team to give their best.”</p>
<p>However Duff, who has a knee injury is out of the side and may have played his last match for the club.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old former Ireland winger who has been at Fulham since 2009, has made 18 appearances this season but not played since the FA Cup defeat to Sheffield United last month. Duff is out of contract at Craven Cottage at the end of the season and it is unclear whether he will sign a new contract.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2003702&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Shahid Afridi is the man in demand after his back-to-back match-winning efforts against India and Bangladesh. Ahead of the final against Sri Lanka on Saturday, he is, however, nursing a groin strain which is hampering is movement. But Afridi is very confident of playing the final. Two days before the big game, he spoke about his batting heroics and inconsistency. Excerpts:</span></em></p>
<p><strong>On last two knocks</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It feels nice to score runs when the team required them most. I’ve already said this is a very important tournament for us. After this, we’ve the (T20) World Cup as well. I’m happy to contribute at a crucial juncture.</p>
<p><strong>On pressure</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It’s impossible not to have pressure. The position I bat, it’s very usual to face an asking rate of around nine-ten runs per over. Positive decisions were taken in the last two matches and we were determined to win.</p>
<p><strong>On inconsistency</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It’s impossible to perform everyday with the bat. I’ve concentrated a lot on my bowling. Batting or bowling, I want to contribute. I’m past the phase when retaining your place in the team takes precedence. This is a stage of my career when contributing to team’s cause becomes more important.</p>
<p><strong>Batting Philosophy</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>If I start to think, I won’t be able to perform.</p>
<p><strong>On next target</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The 2015 World Cup is a big affair for me and my team. As long as I’m fit, I will continue. When I will feel I’ve become a passenger, I will step down on my own. I would never give an opportunity to anyone to decide my fate.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002898&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Strike bowler Lasith Malinga started the Asia Cup on a grand note, taking five wickets against Pakistan to guide Sri Lanka to a win the opener. However, his form tapered off thereafter and he could manage only one wicket from the next two outings. Rested for the match against Bangladesh on Thursday, Malinga, is ready to have another crack at Misbah-ul-Haq’s team. Excerpts from an interview with The Indian Express: </span></p>
<p><strong>Do you think that quitting Test cricket is helping your limited-overs game?</strong></p>
<p>My body was struggling to stand the rigours of the longer format. So I decided to quit Test cricket and concentrate solely on the shorter formats. I think I took the right decision. It helped me stay fit. Now I can consistently play T20 and 50-overs games. The preparation and training methods for the limited-overs game are different and suit my body.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a big year ahead, starting with the World T20 and culminating in the World Cup. Any specific plans to keep yourself fit and maintain the intensity?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I always take it series by series, or rather, match by match. It’s important to concentrate on the next assignment and not to look too far ahead. I always follow this method and it has helped me.</p>
<p><strong>After two new balls were introduced in the ODIs, reverse swing has almost gone out of the equation. But your bowling hasn’t been affected by the change. What’s the secret?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I still manage to reverse it a bit because I practise this a lot in the nets. I take a ball which is about 15 overs old and practise reverse swing and try to hit the blockhole. So, when I go to a match, I carry the belief with me. My yorkers in the last couple of matches were not that accurate. So today I practised harder.</p>
<p><strong>Your take on the Asia Cup final and the Afridi factor?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I’m not concerned about him. I never think about the other players. It’s important to think about how you should approach the game without being too concerned about your opponents. I don’t think they’re thinking too much about me (either).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002896&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/angelomathewsapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004001" alt="Captain Angelo Mathews made 74 (not out) to dig Sri Lanka out of a hole in a low-scoring chase (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/angelomathewsapm.jpg" /></a> Captain Angelo Mathews made 74 (not out) to dig Sri Lanka out of a hole in a low-scoring chase (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Sri Lanka rested Lasith Malinga for this inconsequential final group leg affair. It didn’t matter much because the wearing Sher-e-Bangla Stadium pitch gave enough purchase to their spinners and the Islanders strangled Bangladesh with their spin. The slow bowlers triggered a middle-order collapse that saw the hosts only manage 204 for nine in 50 overs.</span></p>
<p>The target was never going to pose a threat to Sri Lanka despite the fact that Bangladesh bowlers kept it tight for most of the innings and also made early inroads. Sri Lanka lost their first three wickets for eight runs and then lost half the side with just 75 runs on the board. But they were always one substantial partnership away from the target.</p>
<p>Skipper Angelo Mathews and Chaturanga de Silva provided that with an 82-run stand for the sixth wicket and the former stayed till the end to secure a three-wicket win with six balls to spare. Sri Lanka finished the group stage with an all-win record.</p>
<p>Mathews’ 103-ball 74 not out was all about top-class application in difficult conditions. He picked the gaps perfectly and never looked to be in a hurry. The first boundary, a six in fact, arrived after he played 16 balls. He then went into a shell again. Mathews had time on his side and Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim allowed his partnership with De Silva to flourish by holding back his better bowlers.</p>
<p>Shakib Al Hasan and Mahmudullah were brought back to bowl in tandem only after 35 overs but by then Sri Lanka were safe. It has to be said, though, that De Silva’s 52-ball 44 put pressure on the opposition and allowed his captain to play at his own pace. Though there were only a few balls left at the end, Sri Lanka were always in control.</p>
<p><strong>Wickets in a heap</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Earlier, Bangladesh failed to survive Sri Lanka’s spin-punch and lost wickets in a heap in the middle-overs. Ajantha Mendis started the damage with the wicket of opener Shamsur Rahaman, who till then, was going slow but steady. But a looping off-spinner from Mendis caught him plumb in front and Bangladesh lost their first wicket with 74 runs on the board in 18.2 overs.</p>
<p>Mominul Haque departed just two runs later, missing a straight delivery from Mendis to lose his off stump. Skipper Mushfiqur Rahim tried to improvise but misjudged the length of a De Silva delivery to be out leg before. Anamul Haque, who batted well for his 49, departed to a spectacular diving catch from Lahiru Thirimanne at mid-wicket. Part-time off spinner Ashan Priyanjan was the bowler.</p>
<p>Shakib tried to up the ante but was caught at short mid-wicket by Mathews off Priyanjan. Bangladesh slumped to 119 for five in 33.2 overs and there was always very little chance of a proper recovery, though Nasir Hossain and Mahmudullah added 55 runs for the sixth wicket.</p>
<p>Bangladesh now have lost seven ODIs in a row — three in the bilateral home series against Sri Lanka and all four in the Asia Cup. They have to rectify their performance soon to qualify for the World T20 proper. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have been the most dominant side of the tournament. But Mahela Jayawardene’s run-less stint remains a concern ahead of the final against Pakistan on Saturday. The experienced middle-order batsman was run out today for a duck. He has scored just 36 runs in four innings in this tournament.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002895&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rohitsharmaapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2003998" alt="The Indian team management sent Rohit Sharma at No. 3 against Afghanistan to allow him some batting practice in a different situation (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rohitsharmaapm.jpg" /></a> The Indian team management sent Rohit Sharma at No. 3 against Afghanistan to allow him some batting practice in a different situation (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">From South Africa to New Zealand and the Asia Cup, it is a hat-trick of losses for the Indian side. For the team management, though, the alarm bells aren’t ringing. Despite the losses, the powers that be believe that the team building is on the right track and the self belief is not affected.</span></p>
<p>The Indian cricketers left Dhaka in batches. As they checked out of the team hotel Thursday morning, they weren’t carrying the excess baggage of their early exit from the Asia Cup, if a source in the team management is to be believed.</p>
<p>The management was criticised for not playing the likes of Cheteshwar Pujara, Ishwar Pandey and Varun Aaron in the dead rubber against Afghanistan and a team insider gives the reason.</p>
<p>“We wanted to maintain continuity. It was not a case of playing the last match of the Asia Cup. It was about continuing with the process of preparing for the next tournament. We will be returning here (for the World T20) in just over a weeks’ time and we had to focus on a few things.” He elaborated: “Ajinkya Rahane is a part of the World T20 squad. He batted at No. 4 in the last few matches, but opening has been his natural position. So we sent him to open the innings (against Afghanistan) which allowed him to play his natural game. It also allowed us to have a look at the options available for the next tournament.”</p>
<p>He went on: “Rohit Sharma is a player who could be used anywhere. Of late, he has been struggling a bit, opening the innings. But Rohit is an integral part of our combination and we decided to send him at No. 3 to allow him some batting practice in a different situation. Older ball and a spread-out field offer scopes for singles and twos, and we wanted Rohit to rotate the strike to get into his batting rhythm.”</p>
<p>But what about bowling, especially the seamers?</p>
<p>“Mohammed Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar are still learning at this level — bowling upfront, bowling at the death. Also in these conditions, we always wanted all three spinners to play.</p>
<p>Defeats haven’t demoralised the team management because there’s “significant progress”. “You’ve to put things in perspective. This is a transitional phase. Look at Australia and England. Team building doesn’t happen overnight.</p>
<p>“Our Asia Cup team had only one player (Kohli) from the last World Cup. And this is not the final squad. There could be changes in the lead-up to the next World Cup. Results are not always important at this stage. We must take pride from the fact that the youngsters stood up to be counted and put the opponents under serious pressure. Some of them had their first overseas tours,” said the team source.</p>
<p>Coach Duncan Fletcher is copping flak for India’s series of losses. But the news from the camp suggests that the Zimbabwean is not unduly perturbed because he has the respect of the players.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002894&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Or whatever else suits you.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002890&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pakistan zindabad. There, I said it. Now sue me. Or do whatever you deem is right, just like you labelled those Kahmiri university students in Meerut anti-national.</p>
<p>The choice, my friend, is all yours.</p>
<p>The other day, a couple of my colleagues and I clapped at our seats as Shahid Khan Afridi did what Shahid Khan Afridi does from time to time &#8211; remind you of just why you once fell in love with this sport, or a sporting contest in general. Against India (yes, our India), Afridi smoked a few sixes off Ravichandran Ashwin to beat the world champions in the last over. And momentarily, everything seemed right with the game. We cheered, many glared.</p>
<p>The glare had nothing to do with patriotism (misplaced, if it were), India, or the team’s precarious position in the Asia Cup after the loss. Hardly. The glare questioned our audacity at rooting for the ‘arch-rivals’ in a public space. For when we did it again a couple of days later, as Afridi began turning a lost cause around against Bangladesh, the piercing glances returned.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, those stares have been around since the beginning of my cricket-viewing &#8211; since a neighbour asked me not to return to his house after I had danced when Imran Khan hoisted a crystal globe. I was seven and of course didn’t understand the bile. Twenty-one years later, I still find it hard to.</p>
<p>How could you not have fallen in love with the Class of ‘92, consisting of boys handpicked off the streets by Imran (who later admitted that his drive to win the World Cup came from his fundless and yet-to-be-built cancer hospital)? How can you not adore a system that lays as much emphasis on talent-scouting fast bowlers from tape-ball cricket as the rest of the world does in structured pace academies?</p>
<p>It’s hard not to romanticise both the good and the ugly. Do you not feel deeply for a bunch of players that haven’t played in front their home fans for the last four years? Umar Akmal, for example, has represented Pakistan in 16 Tests and 93 ODIs. A home match for him has been everywhere from Yorkshire to Sharjah, Christchurch to Colombo. Everywhere but Pakistan.</p>
<p>Beyond the boundary and within as well, Pakistan cricket has been in a state of unrelenting turbulence for a long, long time.</p>
<p>But when an Akmal or an Afridi tell you why you mustn’t give up on them just yet, it’s impossible to resist the urge to stand up and applaud. Come Saturday, as they take on Sri Lanka in the final, we’ll perhaps be at it again.</p>
<p>So, go ahead and call us seditonaries. Or whatever else suits you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes small conversations can reveal a lot about cultures and a differing outlook on ostensibly similar matters. I was reminded of that quite by chance as I waited with Wasim Akram to begin our pre-match programme on the India-Pakistan game at the Asia Cup.</p>
<p>Pakistan were going to leave out an all-rounder, either Anwar Ali or Bilawal Bhatti, for Mohammad Talha a bowler who can, well, bat a bit. My first thought was that it might weaken their batting if they played him and so I asked Akram whether Talha could bat. Yes he could, he said, and added quickly that he was sharp and might trouble the Indian batsmen. He would, effectively, have been a sixth bowler and with Shahid Afridi’s then indifferent form, I thought it would have left the Pakistan batting a bit thin.</p>
<p>When I thought back to that conversation later it struck me that I had looked at the selection from a very Indian perspective. “Can he bat?” was my first question because that is something we always seem to ask each other. Our cricket culture, especially in the last two decades, has been deeply rooted in batting. And, dare I say, in insecurity. We are always worried about failure and therefore the question about batting insurance.</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/umeshyadavm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2004058" alt="Umesh Yadav has hardly played a game for India in the last few months (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/umeshyadavm.jpg" /></a> Umesh Yadav has hardly played a game for India in the last few months (File)
<p>Akram looked at it from a Pakistani perspective. “He was quite quick and might get wickets”. Of course if he got wickets, the batsmen wouldn’t have that much to do and so his was the more aggressive bowling-oriented approach. It is no coincidence that Pakistan have always been a very good bowling side, while India have tended to understand batting much better. And so the Pakistan bowlers always look more complete while India’s batsmen look readier.</p>
<p>Varun Aaron struggled and Bhuvaneshwar Kumar didn’t quite look world class, while Ambati Rayudu looked quite polished and mature in the middle order. In that game Talha and Junaid looked ready for the level they were playing at while the batsmen like Sharjeel Khan and Sohaid Maqsood clearly have some distance to go.</p>
<p>To be a world class side you need to have both skills equally represented but since there seems to be a skew in both countries it is worth asking which of those you would rather have if one was all you could. And maybe I am again influenced by the kind of cricket I have seen, and the result of that culture, but I believe a better bowling side will always give you a better chance of winning than a better batting side.</p>
<p>And there is evidence around the world. Australia’s recent ascent has been in spite of the fact that this is one of their more suspect batting line-ups in recent times. But because Mitchell Johnson has been knocking out the opposition quickly, he is ensuring that those cracks are papered over (and of course that the bowlers are always fresh since they don’t spend long hours in the field!). South Africa have remained the No.1 Test team in the world, and India retreated quickly from that summit, because of the respective quality of bowling.</p>
<p>But to return to Akram and to our conversation as it veered to what you look for in bowlers. For the last two years he had been talking about picking Mohd Shami, not because he had worked with him but because he had pace. ‘If you have that you can learn everything else’ he says and so has little time for India’s polite new ball users. ‘You can’t teach pace’ he keep saying.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago India had Virat Kohli and Umesh Yadav as two bright talents who we thought would go places. I looked at Pakistan and I saw Junaid Khan and Umar Akmal. Two years later Junaid has taken giant strides while Yadav has hardly played a game for India in the last few months. Kohli has emerged as among the best in the world and while Akmal plays the sporadic match winning innings, he is far far away from becoming the player he should have been.</p>
<p>So will we remain a batting country and continue to let the odd fast bowler who comes through slip through our hole filled sieve? I greatly fear so. Certainly till as long as we continue to ask whether a bowler can bat as opposed to whether he can bowl quick!</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002886&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A stroke-filled maiden century by Denesh Ramdin just wasn&#8217;t enough as England held on to defeat the West Indies by 25 runs in the deciding third and final one-day international.</span></p>
<p>Ramdin&#8217;s 128, the first ODI hundred by a West Indies wicketkeeper, lifted the home side from 43 for four in pursuit of a daunting target of 304 when he was last out with the total on 278.</p>
<p>Earlier, Joe Root battled through the considerable pain of a sore right thumb —the result of a blow inflicted by fast-medium bowler Ravi Rampaul at the start of his innings — to stroke his first hundred in this form of the game while Jos Buttler fell one run short of his own first ODI ton to take England to 303/6.</p>
<p><strong>Record stand</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Root, who was named man of the match, and Buttler put on 175 for the fifth wicket after the innings was at a crossroads when Sunil Narine bowled the experienced Eoin Morgan to reduce England to 116 for four in the 24th over.</p>
<p>West Indies captain Dwayne Bravo finished with three wickets. Wicketkeeper-batsman Buttler was left to rue an attempt to sneak his 100th run in the final over as he only succeeded in spooning a catch back to the bowler Rampaul. The West Indies batting again failed to fire and not even the inclusion of Marlon Samuels seemed capable of halting the slide.</p>
<p>However Ramdin played the innings of his life, dominating half-century partnerships with Bravo and Darren Sammy before taking on the improbable task on.</p>
<p>Two sixes in one over off James Tredwell took him to the century-mark, yet just when it seemed England were poised to self-destruct under the pressure, Bresnan produced the perfect yorker to end Ramdin&#8217;s effort and seal victory.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002885&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Kartik Kumar</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A 168-run partnership between Services’ Rajat Paliwal and skipper Yashpal Singh scripted a major upset as defending champions Delhi crashed out of Vijay Hazare Trophy. Services beat the hosts by 44 runs at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium.</span></p>
<p>With only two sides progressing from each group to the knock-out stages, the Delhi vs. Services game was a virtual knockout fixture as both teams were tied on 12 points. Punjab also advanced after a two-wicket win over Himachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>Delhi played a noticeably weak side as Virender Sehwag (flu), Rajat Bhatia (back), Mithun Manhas (hamstring), Ishant Sharma (ankle) and Ashish Nehra (back) were ruled for this crucial tie.</p>
<p>“The team management has conveyed to me that Nehra was fatigued after playing four matches in a row and hence didn’t feature in this game. Ishant has a swelling on his ankle, while Manhas also has an injury issue. Ideally, we would have wanted these senior players to play this game but we cannot force anyone,” chairman of selectors Chetan Chauhan said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Delhi was set a target of 258, and openers Gautam Gambhir and Unmukt Chand started the innings positively and Delhi scored 50 runs in 12 overs. However, Chand was dismissed leg before on 20 and his wicket led to a top-order collapse as Gambhir and wicket-keeper Punit Bisht fell in quick succession to leave the side at 51 for 3.</p>
<p>Jagrit Anand and Milind Kumar were able to resurrect the chase by putting on 69 runs for the fifth wicket till Milind was caught behind for 30 by left-arm spinner Avishek Sinha. His wicket caused another batting collapse as the last seven wickets fell for 98 runs.</p>
<p>Jagrit Anand waged a lone battle and scored 69 runs of 82 balls which included three boundaries. Services bowlers maintained a disciplined performance as almost all of them finished with an economy rate of less than five runs per over. In addition the fielding was of high standard. Seven Delhi batsmen were out caught and Yogesh Nagar was run out by Soumya Swain.</p>
<p>Earlier, Gautam Gambhir won the toss and elected to field. Services were off to a terrible start as they lost the first three wickets for just 36 runs. The initial hour of play assisted the seamers with swing movement and all three dismissals were caught behind to wicket-keeper Puneet Bisht.</p>
<p>Despite the early break-through Gambhir opted to set a defensive field which played into the hands of in-form Rajat Paliwal and Yashpal Singh as the duo took the team score from from 36 for 3 to 204 for 4, which included 11 boundaries between them. Another miscalculation was that Parwinder Awana who bowled seven overs for just 17 runs and was not brought on to bowl for the powerplay overs and instead, part-time spinners Milind Kumar and Yogesh Nagar were chosen, which resulted in more than 9 runs an over in that spell.</p>
<p>Eventually, Services posted a formidable total. Services captain Yashpal Singh said: “We were heavily disappointed after our relegation from the Ranji Trophy last season. This season we got back together and tried to not repeat the previous mistakes. There was a change in the attitude of the team and ever since we have been extremely dedicated.”</p>
<p><strong>Brief Scores:</strong> SSCB: 257 for 5 in 50 overs (Rajat Paliwal 105 n.o., Yashpal Singh 75, Milind Kumar 1/35) vs Delhi: 213 in 48.2 overs (Jagrit Anand 69, Milind Kumar 30, Avishek Sinha 2/29, Suraj Yadav 2/45)</p>
<p><strong>Other matches</strong><br />
<strong>Brief Scores:</strong> Haryana: 152 for 5 in 20 overs (Rahul Dewan 45, Nitin Saini 42, Parvez Rasool 3-34, Ramdayal Punia 1-32) vs J&amp;K: 108 in 20 overs (Waseem Paray 33, Imran Haroon 19, Yuzvendra Chahal 3/18, Harshal Patel 2/15)<br />
<strong>Brief Scores:</strong> Himachal: 247 for 6 in 50 overs (Prashant Chopra 109 n.o., Nikhil Gangta 63, Siddarth Kaul 2/56, Yuvraj Singh 1/18) vs Punjab: 248 for 8 in 48 overs (Gurkeerat Singh 83, Himanshu Chawla 64, Gurvinder Singh 3/54, Rishi Dhawan 3/71)<br />

		<description><![CDATA[Says conflict-of-interest issue beyond scope of probe but agrees to most suggestions.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002879&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The BCCI on Thursday said that the Supreme Court-appointed panel had gone beyond the scope of its probe while touching on the issue of BCCI president N Srinivasan’s conflict of interest with regard to the Indian Premier League.</span></p>
<p>In its reply to the two volumes of the panel’s report, one authored by Justice Mukul Mudgal and L N Rao and the other by Nilay Dutta, the BCCI has said that Mudgal’s report “has made a reference to a matter which is beyond the purview of the probe, as set out by the Supreme Court.”</p>
<p>It pointed out that while Mudgal’s report did not say anything more than raising the issue of the conflict of interest, Dutta’s report was completely silent on this aspect. “It is submitted that as to what would amount the conflict of interest is found in the the Rules of the BCCI itself and in point of fact, one of the Rules of the BCCI is under challenge in the Bombay High Court&#8230;alleging the very same issue of the conflict of interest,” stated its reply, which will be taken up by the court on Friday.</p>
<p>The BCCI said that since this matter was not within the Terms of Reference of the committee, it was not commenting on it in the present proceedings before the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The apex cricketing body also complained that “vicious and motivated” criticism has dented the BCCI’s image and that “scandalous” materials was being produced for broadcast that has affected the reputation of “some of our most beloved cricketers.”</p>
<p><strong>Sealed envelope</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The BCCI has hence requested the court not to share the “confidential” material submitted in a sealed cover by the panel with the parties in the case. “Speculative and baseless charges against leading cricketers have already been made by unscrupulous news channels under the guise of ‘sting operations.’ Specualtion is rife that the said sealed cover contains names of some current members of the National Team. The Honb’le Court would kindly take steps to staunch any further damage to the image and reputation of innocent cricketers and the BCCI&#8230;” stated the affidavit.</p>
<p>On the issue of taking action against Srinivasan’s son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan who had been held guilty by the panel of illegal betting and passing on information during the 2013 IPL, the BCCI has pointed out the difference of opinion between the two reports over the manner in which they required to proceed. It has therefore left it to the court to mandate as to how the cricketing body should proceed.</p>
<p>As far other recommendations by the panel were concerned, the BCCI has concurred with most of them. It has however expressed its dissent over making IPL a standalone entity completely disassociated with the BCCI.</p>
<p>It reminded the panel that the “IPL is a BCCI tournament” wherein it had comercial contracts with the franchisees and broadcasters as also with various other entities not involved in the IPL directly. It added that the BCCI was not only promoting the IPL tournament, it has also been able to nurture talent in the IPL to the level of participation in the Indian team.</p>
<p><strong>Player agent</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The BCCI also differed with the panel&#8217;s view that the players should not be allowed to own any stakes or interests in player agencies or companies, involved with cricket, unless such interests are in the nature of sponsorship or endorsements.</p>
<p>Dhoni had recently courted controversy for his alleged conflict of interest for reportedly having stakes in Rhiti Sports Management, which also managed cricketers Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja and Pragyan Ojha. The firm had later said that Dhoni was a shareholder only for a brief period, and currently had no stakes.</p>
<p>On the issue of players&#8217; stake in sport agencies managing current cricketers, the BCCI said it will have examine the feasibility of having a prohibition incorporated in the players&#8217; contract. However, on employment of players in corporate bodies, the BCCI said that this should not be discouraged since there was no basis to believe that owner of a sports franchise may influence his employee who may play for another franchise.</p>
<p>The BCCI admitted that its investigative tools seemed “deficient”.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002879&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">After a large part of the Indian contingent exited the All England Championship on Day One, it was the turn of World No. 10, Sindhu late Wednesday. </span></p>
<p>Sindhu’s debut at the All England was spoilt by Sun Yu of China in a women’s singles match. Sindhu, who held a 2-1 record against Sun before the match, suffered a 16-21 15-21 loss in 47 minutes. Sindhu had a difficult time against Sun as she lagged behind 5-9 early on and though she clawed back at 12-12 and then at 15-15, the Chinese reeled off five points on the trot to win the opening game. In the second game too, Sun moved to a 11-7 lead and though Sindhu caught up at 12-13, the Chinese was successful in staving off her challenge.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect for no.1</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It was a near perfect day for Malaysia’s world number one Lee Chong Wei at the All England badminton championships on Wednesday as he cruised through the first round while his main rivals struggled. Lee, a silver medallist at the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games, played within himself to dispose of Thailand’s Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk 21-15 21-17 and book his place in the second round.</p>
<p>While Lee was in cruise control, world number three Tommy Sugiarto was dumped out of the tournament by China’s Gao Huan. Gao took the first game 21-13 but Sugiarto smashed through the second 21-10. While many expected the Indonesian to go on to seal the win, it was Gao who took the decider 21-18. Another of Lee’s main rivals, Chen Long, also looked in danger of an early exit when he lost his first game 21-10 to Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen.</p>
<p>Chen, who defeated Lee in last year’s final here, was trailing in the second game but fought back to win it 21-15, then completed the victory 21-12 in the deciding game.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002878&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">High flying Mizoram will look to extend their seven-match winning streak when they take on Tamil Nadu and a buoyant Railways face Maharashtra in the two semifinals of the 68th National Championships for Santosh Trophy at the Kanchenjunga Stadium on Friday.</span></p>
<p>Mizoram are the form side of this year’s nationals, steamrolling opponents en route the semifinal. The North Eastern side has won all four of their Final Round matches from Group A. Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, have won two and lost two in the final round. Finishing second in Group A with six points from 4 matches, the two-time finalists will look to exploit the only chink in Mizoram’s armour, their inexperience at this level.</p>
<p>H Vanthalthangla coached Mizoram’s best performance is the final round appearance in the 2012 edition of the Santosh Trophy in Cuttack. “Mizoram have been playing really well. They are very fast and have some fleet-footed players. We have to bring all our experience into play and capitalise on our chances,” Tamil Nadu coach CM Ranjith said.</p>
<p>The second semifinal could be a battle of attrition in the middle of the park with both Railways and Maharashtra boasting of a strong midfield. “It will be a touch and go affair,” Maharashtra coach Irenio Vaz said. “The battle will be won in midfield as both teams are very strong in the middle. I have been watching them for the last three games and I feel we have a slight advantage in defense but all that can go haywire on the given day,” Vaz added.</p>
<p>The Maharashtra midfield boasts of holding midfielder Praneel Mendon, central medios Vijith Shetty and former United Sikkim player Linekar Machado, former Churchill Brothers, Pune FC, and Air India man Paresh Shivalkar and in-form Shahbaz Pathan who has scored two crucial goals for his side the final round.</p>
<p>Railways also have a strong midfield with the likes of Dipankar Das, and Somi PT as fulcrums and former Kerala man Kenistan C and Sibra Narjary out wide. Narjary has been instrumental for Railways, scoring a stoppage-time winner against Tamil Nadu and also teeing up Jitendra Bramha for the all-important equaliser in the last minute of their tie against West Bengal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002875&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[In final round of friendlies before World Cup, host Brazil thrash South Africa 5-0.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002871&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Brazil showed its national team is in better shape than the country’s stadiums with a 5-0 thrashing of South Africa on Wednesday, and defending champion Spain overcame Italy 1-0 in its final big test before the tournament kicks off, as teams prepared for the World Cup in a series of friendly matches.</span></p>
<p>With less than 100 days before the opening game, four World Cup stadiums are still under construction in Brazil and much work outside the venues remains to be done. But in Johannesburg, the five-time world champions proved they are more than ready on the pitch, dispatching the Bafana Bafana with a ruthless display at Soccer City as Barcelona striker Neymar claimed his second career hat trick for the Selecao.</p>
<p>Pedro Rodriguez scored Spain’s second-half winner in a rematch of the 2012 Euro final that Italy lost 4-0. It was Spain’s final game before coach Vicente del Bosque names his squad to defend its title.</p>
<p>Argentina superstar Lionel Messi couldn’t break Romania’s defence as his team was held to a goalless draw. Cristiano Ronaldo was more prolific, as the Ballon d’Or winner became Portugal’s all-time leading scorer Wednesday, netting twice in a 5-1 win over Cameroon.</p>
<p>Ronaldo took his international tally to 49 and overtook Pauleta, who retired in 2006 after scoring 47 goals in 88 games. Ronaldo was making his 110th appearance.</p>
<p>Former World Cup winners England and Germany put on lame performances but still managed to win. Belgium, tipped as a serious contender in Brazil, drew 2-2 against Ivory Coast. Having struggled both on and off the field since reaching the 2006 World Cup final, reaching its nadir at the 2010 World Cup when the team went on strike, France showed an attractive face to end the Netherlands’ 17-match unbeaten run with goals from Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema and Blaise Matuidi.</p>
<p>France regained some credibility with the prestigious win and Benzema continued his fine form. The former Lyon striker has scored 11 in his past 13 games with Real and is winning over the fans after several months of doubt during which he lost his place for France.</p>
<p><strong>Sturridge winner</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>At Wembley, Roy Hodgson’s team had a poor game and was held until the 82nd minute when Adam Lallana beat two men and crossed the ball for Daniel Sturridge to head it home.</p>
<p>Germany looked like a shadow of itself at home against Chile but eked out a 1-0 win, with Mario Goetze scoring against the run of play in the 16th minute.</p>
<p>Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari fielded a team similar to the one that won the Confederations Cup last year for his players’ final friendly before the announcement of the World Cup squad. Neymar took his international tally to 30 goals, with Chelsea playmaker Oscar and Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho also getting on the scoresheet.</p>
<p>Having lost his momentum at Manchester United, where he only plays intermittently, Shinji Kagawa scored from the spot and had an assist as Japan continued its preparations for Brazil with a comfortable 4-2 win over New Zealand. The hosts were 4-0 by the 17th minute after Shinji Okazaki scored a brace and Masato Morishige added another goal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002871&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viratkohliapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996844" alt="Virat Kohli led India at the Asia Cup, where they failed to reach the final (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viratkohliapm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli led India at the Asia Cup, where they failed to reach the final (AP)
<p>Virat Kohli slipped two places to 10th while Australian David Warner jumped to a career-best fifth spot in the latest Reliance ICC Rankings released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Warner, who slammed hundreds (135 and 145) in both innings of the series-deciding Cape Town Test, has moved up five places to be the highest-ranked Australia batsman, with his skipper Michael Clarke in ninth position being the only other in the top 10.</p>
<p>The batting table is still headed by AB de Villiers, with Kumar Sangakkara in second place and Shivnarine Chanderpaul in third position. Kohli is also the lone Indian in the top 10 among batsmen.</p>
<p>In the Reliance ICC Player Rankings for Test Bowlers, Ryan Harris, who ended with a match haul of seven for 95 in Cape Town, has moved up two places to a best-ever second position.</p>
<p>Harris has now moved ahead of Vernon Philander and teammate Mitchell Johnson.</p>
<p>Philander, who picked just one wicket in the Cape Town Test, is down a place to third, while Johnson has dropped down a place to fourth. The bowlers’ table is still headed by Dale Steyn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only solace for South Africa from the Cape Town Test was in the fact that Philander has now become the number-one ranked all-rounder on the Reliance ICC Player Rankings for Test all-rounders.</p>
<p>Philander, who scored 37 and 51 not out in either innings, has moved up two places to top of the all-rounders&#8217; table, pushing India&#8217;s Ravichandran Ashwin to second.</p>
<p>Philander is now on 376 ratings points, just three ahead of Ashwin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Graeme Smith signed off on his impressive Test career in 16th place in the batting table. Smith reached a career high of second position after his match-winning century against England in Johannesburg in January 2010. That was also when he achieved a best-ever 843 ratings points.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002591&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afridi2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997607" alt="Shahid Afridi further said he was looking forward to doing well in the 2015 World Cup (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afridi2.jpg" /></a> Shahid Afridi further said he was looking forward to doing well in the 2015 World Cup (AP)
<p>Hitting out at his critics for questioning his place in the Pakistan team, all-rounder Shahid Afridi said he would quit the game the day he feels himself a burden to his team.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will sideline myself, the moment I start thinking that I&#8217;m becoming a burden on my team. I will not let anyone an opportunity to talk. As long as I&#8217;m fit and give my life to cricket, I&#8217;ll continue playing the sport,&#8221; Afridi told reporters ahead of Pakistan&#8217;s Asia Cup summit clash against Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to give something to my country with my performance. There is no such thing that you will score runs with the bat every day. I&#8217;ve given my focus to bowling as well. I want to get myself ready in such a way that I deliver to the team, be it in batting or bowling,&#8221; he said at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium.</p>
<p>Afridi had to face a lot criticism for his inconsistency as many experts back home in Pakistan had questioned his place in the team. The 34-year-old replied at his critics with a 34 not out against India and a 25-ball 59 against Bangladesh to take the defending champions into the Asia Cup final.</p>
<p>Asked to rate his two latest knocks, Afridi said, &#8220;There are many reasons that I won&#8217;t like to rate them but both of them were very important for me as well as for the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Afridi said he knew best what he was doing and he did not need a coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve said earlier also, having played at this level for so many years, I don&#8217;t need a coach. Mein apna coach behter hoon (I am better off with coaching myself). I know what to do and what not to do. It&#8217;s about having the right people to back you and support you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about the current Pakistani support staff, he said, &#8220;It was different earlier, it&#8217;s not that it was not good. It was better earlier so also today. The support team that we have now are all knowledgeable and keeps you positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a thrilling last over finish against India, Afridi smashed Ravichandran Ashwin for two sixes in the last over to seal a one-wicket victory on March 1, much the similar way Javed Miandad had done against Chetan Sharma in a Sharjah humdinger in 1986.</p>
<p>But after that Miandad heroics, Pakistan had suffered a string of defeats against India. Asked whether it will have the same effect this time around also, he said (with a smile), &#8220;It&#8217;s up to the Indian team how do they take these sixes)&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Afridi further said he was looking forward to doing well in the 2015 World Cup. &#8220;Obviously, the World Cup 2015 is going to be a huge thing for me and my team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidentally, it was in Australia, Pakistan had tasted their lone World Cup triumph in 1992.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of time to go for 2015. We have a lot of big series coming up. The management is supporting, if we continue to have the right kind of combination, and with God&#8217;s blessings, we hope to win the World Cup,&#8221; Afridi said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002588&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Harbhajan Singh said he is not competing with Ashwin for a place in the Indian team.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002585&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/harbhajan480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1964404" alt="Harbhajan Singh" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/harbhajan480.jpg" /></a> Harbhajan Singh has been out of the India team for one year (IE Photo)
<p>Ravichandran Ashwin&#8217;s shoddy overseas performance in recent times might have enhanced Harbhajan Singh&#8217;s chances of a return to the national side but the experienced off-spinner says he is &#8220;not competing&#8221; with the Tamil Nadu tweaker for a place in the Indian team.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all these years, I have only had one competitor. That&#8217;s me myself. I have never liked competing with anyone (read Ashwin) and it has remained like that over the years. International sport is a lonely journey. You compete with one&#8217;s self and try to grow as a cricketer,&#8221; said the off-spinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;No point in competing with two, three or four people. Try your best and leave it for others to judge. Also I don&#8217;t want to say a single word about a current India player,&#8221; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>Ashwin was ineffective during India&#8217;s disastrous tours of South Africa and New Zealand and received flak from former spinners Maninder Singh and Narendra Hirwani. Infact, former captain Sourav Ganguly called for Harbhajan&#8217;s return to the national team.</p>
<p>Harbhajan has been out of the India team for one year but the 33-year-old spinner as always is relishing the challenge to fight his way back into national side.</p>
<p>Ask if he had set any time-frame for himself, he replied, &#8220;The operative word here I believe is not age but motivation. Age is just a number. If someone can perform at 45, who will stop that fellow from playing top-level cricket.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, it&#8217;s the motivation and passion to play the game at the highest level. I still want to play for India and it&#8217;s important to realise how badly you want that. I will continue playing as long as I can enjoy playing for India,&#8221; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>For the man, who has nearly 700 international wickets across three international formats including 413 in Tests, it has been a &#8220;learning experience&#8221; of grinding it out in domestic cricket match after match after having enjoyed hero like-status in the Indian team for more than a decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is tough to play domestic cricket after playing more than 100 Tests (101) and 200-odd ODIs (229). But then adverse situations are testimony to one&#8217;s character. Either you face the challenges in life head on or back out. And I am not someone to back out from challenges,&#8221; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not the only person to face these tough career situations. There has been numerous examples of sportsmen fighting it out gutsily. Only person who can wriggle me out of this situation is myself. I am working hard and getting results also. There are concerned people (selectors) who will take a call as to when I can be brought back in the national side,&#8221; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>Ask him about his philosophy of attacking bowling, he explains that it&#8217;s not only about having close-in fielders.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a wrong concept that you become an attacking bowler by placing close-in fielders. Your field placings are based on match situations. If you are playing on a track that doesn&#8217;t offer turn and bounce, it&#8217;s useless to keep a close-in fielder. The ball will never get to him,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are playing on flat tracks, fielders should be kept in positions where batsmen can offer you catch while driving. If there are four fielders outside the circle, then strategy is completely different from when you have five fielders outside the circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, making my intent clear to the batsman before he stamps his authority is important. Playing with his mind is a way of attacking rather than setting attacking fields,&#8221; Harbhajan elaborated.</p>
<p>Harbhajan has so far taken six wickets in four List A matches in the Vijay Hazare Trophy after 22 wickets in six first-class matches this season.</p>
<p>The feisty off-spinner has bowled well in the four matches so far, coming to bowl often in the Power-plays.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, each and every game is an opportunity. In the last one year, I have not done badly in the domestic matches that I have played. My endeavour has been to work hard and get better at my game. After Vijay Hazare, there will be Mushtaq Ali Trophy followed by IPL. Each and every tournament is a platform to get back into India team,&#8221; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>Harbhajan was disappointed that he sustained a shoulder injury just after he had got 17 wickets from the first two Ranji Trophy games and had to remain out of action for nearly six weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the best time to get injured. In fact there is no right time for an injury (laughs). I had worked a lot during my pre-season and was starting to get wickets which is a result of that hardwork. But then my shoulder gave away and I had to take leave for month and a half. Ideally, I would have liked to get close to 50 wickets in Ranji Trophy,&#8221; Bhajji said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, my comeback to competitive cricket was a good one as I nearly got a century (92) in the quarter-finals against Jammu and Kashmir. I didn&#8217;t bowl much in the match (19.2 overs in all for two wickets) as my pacers did a splendid job on a greenish track (17 of 20 J&amp;K wickets were taken by trio of Sandeep Sharma, MS Gony and VRV Singh)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Harbhajan has been bowling a lot with fielding restrictions on in the One dayers and he is loving it.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a senior bowler and captain of the side, I need to lead from the front. I have to try and bowl in Power-plays as I have the confidence to restrict the batsmen. I have bowled 12 overs in two matches as I felt I had a better chance to keep the batsmen quiet in slog overs by mixing it up. I am happy with my economy rate (4.21 runs per over) in four games,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002585&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ajinkya Rahane played the role of an opener against Afghanistan but the Indian batsman wants to perform well in the upcoming Twenty20 World Cup while batting at number four, a batting position he finds more challenging.</p>
<p>Rahane scored 56 runs and added 121 runs with fellow opener Shikhar Dhawan in an easy chase of 160 against the minnows.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an opener, you get first 10 overs, and new ball. I like to back my instincts and play my shots. At No 4, sometimes situation is like 30 for 2 or 40 for 2 and sometimes it&#8217;s like 120 or 150/2. You have to play under different situations when you bat at No 4. It&#8217;s very crucial to rotate the strike and play your shots, back your instincts. No 4 is really a challenging position,&#8221; Rahane told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;In T20 and domestic, I used to open. I am learning a lot at No 4. With world cup coming up, I&#8217;m looking forward to this challenge,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s win against Bangladesh on Tuesday had already sealed India&#8217;s fate in the Asia Cup. They signed off with a comfortable eight-wicket win over Afghanistan with 106 balls to spare.</p>
<p>Hailing the bowlers effort to bundle out Afghanistan for a paltry 159, he said: &#8220;It always feels good when you score runs. But we&#8217;re obviously disappointed that could not qualify. Overall, we played two close games. Credit goes to bowlers. it&#8217;s not easy to bowl on these condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially I want to mention the bowlers, Mishra, Jadeja, Ashwin and then Bhuvenshwar and Shami all bowled very well. The credit goes to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rahane said they missed skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni but added that stand-in skipper Virat Kohli did a great job.</p>
<p>&#8220;Playing under Virat is also a good experience. He&#8217;s doing well in all formats. He&#8217;s also learning a lot from Dhoni bhai. He did really well. He really handed the team well team. Also we missed Dhoni bhai. His experience as captain we missed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team will fly out of Bangladesh on Thursday before returning here for the World Twenty20 in less than a fortnight&#8217;s time and Rahane said their experience here has prepared them well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking forward obviously. We really learnt a lot from the two tours in New Zealand and South Africa and here. As a team we played really well. Obviously we did not win but as a young unit, we approached every game very well. The attitude was good. That&#8217;s what matters. Happy that the boys are putting in effot. I&#8217;m happy for that.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002382&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/neymarreutersm-copy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002377" alt="Brazil's Neymar celebrates his goal against South Africa during their international friendly soccer match (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/neymarreutersm-copy.jpg" /></a> Brazil&#8217;s Neymar celebrates his goal against South Africa during their international friendly soccer match (Reuters)
<p>Neymar&#8217;s hat-trick lit up a powerful Brazil performance as the 32 nations taking part in this year&#8217;s World Cup tested out their squads on a busy night of friendlies on Wednesday which also brought victories for Spain, Germany and France.</p>
<p>Barcelona forward Neymar was unstoppable for tournament hosts Brazil as they demolished a poor South Africa side 5-0 in the Soweto Soccer City stadium which hosted the 2010 final between Spain and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It was also a good day for Real Madrid&#8217;s Cristiano Ronaldo who scored twice in Portugal&#8217;s 5-1 win over Cameroon, making him his country&#8217;s all-time leading scorer with 49 goals.</p>
<p>But Neymar&#8217;s Barcelona team mate Lionel Messi had an off-colour night for Argentina in Romania, vomiting on the field early in a dull 0-0 draw in Bucharest.</p>
<p>Home advantage makes Brazil slight favourites to win a sixth World Cup this year, but a host of usual suspects will travel to the south American country with genuine hopes of gate-crashing the Samba party which starts in 99 days.</p>
<p>World and European champions Spain are chief among them and they underlined their pedigree with a 1-0 victory over Italy in a repeat of the Euro 2012 final.</p>
<p>Pedro scored the game&#8217;s only goal in Atletico Madrid&#8217;s Calderon Stadium.</p>
<p>Germany, also bidding to become Europe&#8217;s first winner of a World Cup in south America, edged past Chile 1-0 and 1998 winners France, who struggled through qualifying, beat the Netherlands 2-0.</p>
<p>Mario Goetze was on target for Germany in Stuttgart but they were jeered by unhappy fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a lucky win,&#8221; said captain Philipp Lahm. &#8220;I can understand the fans, the people paid for their tickets and they wanted to see something.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got work to do and we know that (but) &#8230; we were up against a good Chile team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karim Benzema and Blaise Matuidi sealed France&#8217;s impressive win over the Dutch in Paris.</p>
<p>Neymar was the day&#8217;s outstanding performer, though, scoring once in the first half and twice after the break to take his tally for his country to 30.</p>
<p>Chelsea&#8217;s Oscar had opened the scoring and Fernandinho completed the rout.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt that we are ready,&#8221; PSG&#8217;s Thiago Silva said on O Globo&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gives us great morale, great motivation. Now we can rest the mind in these three months remaining.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Provisional squads</strong></p>
<p>With time running out for players to book their places in World Cup squads, Wednesday&#8217;s friendlies provided a valuable opportunity for coaches to examine their options for the last time before naming their provisional squads.</p>
<p>England manager Roy Hodgson was one of them.</p>
<p>He watched his side labour to a 1-0 win over Denmark with Liverpool&#8217;s Daniel Sturridge scoring late to ensure they did not lose three friendly matches in a row at Wembley having been beaten by Germany and Chile in November.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking at performances, you would have to be a harsh critic to say anybody played poorly tonight,&#8221; Hodgson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been very happy with the attitude and the desire to get on that plane and grab a shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>World Cup dark horses Belgium drew 2-2 with African qualifiers Ivory Coast, for whom Didier Drogba was on target, while Switzerland and Croatia also shared four goals.</p>
<p>Tim Cahill scored twice to become Australia&#8217;s all-time top goalscorer, although his side squandered a 3-0 lead to lose 4-3 against Ecuador in a thrilling clash in London.</p>
<p>Uruguay, who are in a World Cup group with fellow former champions England and Italy, were held 1-1 in Austria.</p>
<p>Ukraine and Russia, the two countries involved in a tense military standoff in Crimea, were both in action.</p>
<p>Fabio Capello&#8217;s Russia beat Armenia 2-0 in Krasnodar and Ukraine, who missed out on qualification, enjoyed a morale-boosting 2-0 victory over the United States in a match moved from Kharkiv to Larnaca in Cyprus.</p>
<p>First-time World Cup finalists Bosnia suffered a jolt as they were beaten 2-0 by Egypt in Innsbruck.</p>
<p>Asian qualifiers Japan and South Korea enjoyed victories against New Zealand and Greece respectively.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002372&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/joerootapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002369" alt="England's Joe Root celebrates scoring a century against West Indies during their third one-dayer (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/joerootapm.jpg" /></a> England&#8217;s Joe Root celebrates scoring a century against West Indies during their third one-dayer (AP)
<p>Joe Root completed his first one-day international century to help guide England to a 25-run victory over West Indies on Wednesday in the deciding match of their three-game series in Antigua.</p>
<p>Root made 107 off 122 balls to help the tourists compile an imposing total of 303 for six after opener Moeen Ali had laid the foundations with 55 and wicketkeeper Jos Buttler added 99 late in the innings.</p>
<p>West Indies, in reply, were bowled out for 278 in the 48th over to concede the series 2-1 despite an heroic batting performance by Denesh Ramdin.</p>
<p>The home side were in early trouble after slumping to 43 for four in the eighth over when Ramdin came to the crease. The West Indian keeper proceeded to blast a career best 128 off 109 deliveries, pummelling 12 boundaries and five sixes.</p>
<p>His explosive innings threatened to turn the match around but the West Indian fightback ended when he was the last man out, bowled by a yorker from all-rounder Tim Bresnan (3-45) that knocked his leg stump out of the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were confident to chase, it was a good wicket but the top order failed and it didn&#8217;t quite come off at the end,&#8221; West Indies captain Dwayne Bravo said at the post-match presentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Root and Buttler batted well, they capitalised on the start they had&#8230; we didn&#8217;t get it right at the key moments, the first 10 overs, it&#8217;s something we have to work on, as a team and a batting group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Root came out with England in a sticky situation at 37-2 after Ben Stokes went for a golden duck but calmly set about rebuilding the innings, whacking seven boundaries to reach his ton, despite being hit on the thumb.</p>
<p>Buttler was unlucky not to reach triple figures as well. He struck seven boundaries and four sixes only to fall in the last over when he misjudged a slower ball from Ravi Rampaul which he chipped in the air for a return catch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought we could hurt them if we got a partnership going, that&#8217;s what Jos did at the end, once he got himself going &#8211; he looks unstoppable,&#8221; England captain Stuart Broad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken some half chances, particularly in the last couple of games, and that yorker in the end shows it can work.&#8221;<br />
The teams will now play each other in three Twenty20s in Barbados, starting on Sunday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002363&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">India&#8217;s return to Formula One will have to wait until at least 2016, by which time a new race in Azerbaijan could also be on the calendar, commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>The 83-year-old Briton dampened Indian hopes of the Buddh International Circuit near New Delhi hosting a race again next year after being dropped from the 2014 championship. “At the moment, India won&#8217;t be on for next year for sure,” said Ecclestone. “Probably 2016&#8230; they&#8217;re gradually getting over all the bureaucracy with the tax position inside the country and the general finance,” he added.</p>
<p>Ecclestone said in November that a deal had been done for the Indian Grand Prix to return in 2015 and for six years beyond that if tax problems with the country&#8217;s authorities could be overcome.</p>
<p>Problems over taxation, with Formula One classified as entertainment rather than a sport in India, as well as the considerable bureaucracy to be overcome in bringing equipment into the country have been seen as obstacles to the race returning. South Korea was also dropped from this year&#8217;s calendar and Ecclestone said they too would have to wait for a comeback.</p>
<p>Russia, with a circuit threading through the Olympic Park in Sochi, is this year&#8217;s new addition and Ecclestone saw no reason why that race should not happen despite international tension over the situation between that country and Ukraine. “Don&#8217;t cancel,” he said when asked his advice for anyone with flights already booked for the race in the Black Sea resort in October.</p>
<p><strong>Baku race</strong></p>
<p>Azerbaijan, with a street race in the capital Baku, could soon be joining Sochi as Formula One plans to increase its presence in the region.</p>
<p>Ecclestone said he would be having discussions about that subject on Thursday, with details yet to be determined. “It&#8217;s not particularly straightforward but it will be a street circuit.”</p>
<p>While Austria will be making its return to the calendar this season, for the first time since 2003 with a race at the Red Bull-owned Spielberg circuit. Germany&#8217;s future is less assured despite the heavyweight presence of Mercedes in the championship. The debt-loaded Nuerburgring has gone into administration and is looking for a new owner, with Ecclestone &#8211; who is due to go on trial in Germany in April on bribery charges &#8211; submitting a seemingly unsuccessful offer.</p>
<p>Nuerburgring currently alternates with Hockenheim as German Grand Prix host and Ecclestone said he was trying to do a deal with the latter circuit to take on the race every year.</p>
<p>“It depends who buys it,” he said when asked about the chances of Formula One returning to the Nuerburgring, one of the sport&#8217;s historic tracks albeit heavily modified from the fearsome one used from the 1950s to 1970s.</p>
<p>The 2014 calendar lists 19 races after plans to include Mexico and New Jersey were put on hold. Both remain on the cards for 2015, even if there is considerable scepticism within the sport about New Jersey happening, in what looks like an increasing fixture headache for Ecclestone.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001972&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic will join Inter Milan in the close season after eight years of success with the English champions, the Serie A side announced on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>The 32-year-old Serbia central defender said last month he would be leaving the Premier League club at the end of this term and was looking at moving to a team outside England.</p>
<p>“Vidic is a world-class player,” Inter president Erick Thohir told the club&#8217;s website (www.inter.it). “I&#8217;m extremely happy to have completed this deal to bring Nemanja to Milan. He&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s best defenders and his qualities, international pedigree and charisma will be an asset to the team and help bring through our younger players.</p>
<p>“He will bring added value to the club and is another piece of the great Inter side we are building,” Vidic joined United in 2006, winning a host of trophies, including five Premier League titles, the Champions League and the Club World Cup.</p>
<p>He forged a strong partnership with Rio Ferdinand at the heart of United&#8217;s defence, although his effectiveness has suffered with niggling injuries.</p>
<p>He has also struggled for playing time this season with new manager David Moyes looking to rejuvenate his squad.In February Vidic announced he would leave United when his contract expired at the end of this season and he was strongly linked with a move to Inter, fifth in Serie A but having won only two league matches out of 10 so far this year.</p>
<p>At the time, Vidic said: “I&#8217;m not considering staying in England as the only club I ever wanted to play for here is Manchester United and I was lucky enough to be part of this club for so many years”.</p>
<p><strong>Mutual decision</strong></p>
<p>Moyes later said the decision for Vidic to leave the club was a mutual one. United have struggled since Moyes replaced retired fellow Scot Alex Ferguson at the start of the season, with their hopes of retaining the title all but gone as they sit in seventh spot, 18 points adrift of leaders Chelsea.</p>
<p>They are also 12 points away from fourth-placed rivals Manchester City, who occupy the last Champions League qualifying spot and have a game in hand on United.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001965&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Olympic bronze medallist Saina Nehwal started her campaign on a positive note, advancing to the second round of the women&#8217;s singles competition but it was curtains for Parupalli Kashyap and K Srikanth in the men&#8217;s singles category of the All England championship in Birmingham on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Saina was the only bright spot on a dismal day for Indian badminton as she notched up an easy 21-15 21-6 win over Scotland&#8217;s Kirsty Gilmour in a 32-minute match. </span>She will take on US&#8217; Beiwen Zhang in the second round. Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, Kashyap played his heart out before suffering a 21-14 19-21 17-21 defeat against fifth seed Kenichi Tago of Japan in men&#8217;s singles match that lasted for an hour and 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Thailand Open GP Gold winner Kidambi Srikanth too could not cross the first hurdle and went down to Japan&#8217;s Kento Momota 11-21 15-21 in another men&#8217;s singles match.</p>
<p>Indian mixed doubles pair of Tarun Kona and Ashwini Ponnappa also fell in the opening round, losing to fourth seed Danish combo of Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Christinna Pedersen 13-21 16-21 in just over half an hour.</p>
<p>Among other Indians, men&#8217;s singles player Anand Pawar and women&#8217;s doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa could not cross the first hurdle in the qualifying round.</p>
<p>Seeded No 1 in the qualifiers, Anand squandered a one-game advantage to go down fighting against Indonesia&#8217;s Andre Kurniawan Tedjono 21-18 13-21 19-21 in an hour and eight minutes match.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Games Gold medallist pair of Jwala and Ashwini also failed to tame the Chinese combo of Jin Ma and Yuanting Tang as they went down 21-14 15-21 17-21 in a match that lasted 54 minutes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001960&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[With less than three months for the WC, Indian Hockey team Coach Walsh says India lags in key areas. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001951&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hockey-4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001958" alt="Sardar Singh-led India will play the World Cup starting May 31." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hockey-4801.jpg" /></a> Sardar Singh-led India will play the World Cup starting May 31.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Terry Walsh has sprung quite a few surprises in his selection of 33 probables for the World Cup. In an interview with The Indian Express, he discusses the reasons for including 16 U-23 players, recalling three veterans — Gurbaj Singh, Sandeep Singh and Vikram Kanth — and areas where the team needs to improve ahead of the World Cup in May. Excerpts:</span></p>
<p><strong>Sixteen out of 33 probables are under 23 years old&#8230;<br />
</strong>Having worked from inside the Hockey India League, we&#8217;ve been able to do a fair and decent assessment of the players. The young players performed really well against some of the top international players. It is an opportunity to put pressure on senior players who have been around for some time.</p>
<p><strong>Three of them — Affan Yousuf, Lalit Upadhyay and Devinder Walmiki — were ignored for the junior World Cup. What has changed so drastically in their game that they are in probables for the senior World Cup?</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a question that you shouldn&#8217;t ask me. These are three very talented players. It&#8217;s amazing what happens when young players gets an opportunity. The question with Affan is whether he has potential to go to another level. He&#8217;s been given a shot at the camp. Now he has to prove he is one of the best at that level to stay there.</p>
<p>Akashdeep (Singh) is another one of those promising names. Young Lalit has come a long way and was incredible in HIL. Ramandeep had been disappointing right up until his last match of the HIL but lot of people tell me he is an outstanding prospect. They all follow different processes. Some have a lot to offer going forward to the international team. We don&#8217;t know how they will perform until we put them in a pressure-cooker environment. Our most difficult task is to create such an environment in the camp and see how they respond.</p>
<p><strong>Three others — Sandeep Singh, Gurbaj Singh and Vikram Kanth — have returned after a very long time. How do you rate them?</strong><br />
Those three guys have an outside chance (to make the cut). Gurbaj is one of the most outstanding players. When you perform at that level consistently and have hunger to play, then no one can keep you out for long. I think Gurbaj has the potential to be one of the best internationally if he is in the right frame of mind.</p>
<p>I saw Vikram play at the Mumbai Gold Cup and was very impressed. In the HIL, his defensive abilities against top opponents were noteworthy. He has shown he can play in different positions. Flexibility and playing different roles is his calling card just as penalty corners is Sandeep&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Does Sandeep have a chance to get selected for the Cup?</strong><br />
Right now you wouldn&#8217;t pick Sandeep in the back three but now is not the time we will be picking the team. He has a history of being very slow on his feet and there&#8217;s a lot of work to be done in that area. If he does that then he has a chance. I am not saying he will be in. His penalty corners are a very lethal weapon.</p>
<p><strong>But Raghunath, Rupinderpal Singh and Gurjinder Singh have been quite effective drag-flickers as well&#8230;</strong><br />
They&#8217;ve been performing at different rates. Gurjinder was lively but not so strong during HIL. However, he was one of the players who stood up and played with authority in the junior World Cup. Raghu and Rupinder are top exponents of penalty corners not just in India but also in the world. Sandeep&#8217;s presence will put enormous amount of pressure, if nothing else, on the other three and make the atmosphere quite competitive. It will be quite a battle for that position.</p>
<p><strong>When would you pick the team for the World Cup?</strong><br />
Around three weeks before the World Cup. We play in Holland in mid-April on the pitch (where World Cup matches will be played). We&#8217;ll play a series of tests against different teams. We need to get our team playing outside India against European teams. Given our pool, that&#8217;s a pretty important thing.</p>
<p><strong>Between now and then, what are the areas the team needs to focus on?</strong><br />
We&#8217;ve got 12 weeks between the start of camp and the World Cup, which is more than adequate time. We have some major concerns that need fixing. Fitness is the key. The second is field goal conversion, which is really poor, because or poor technique which needs working on. Structurally, we&#8217;re poor in defense. The cover, or counter-control, is weak. We&#8217;re getting better but still not good enough. We have to be 30 per cent better than what we are now to be effective internationally. There are many more things that are not even on my radar at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any scope of including players who do well at the nationals?<br />
</strong>It&#8217;ll be both ways. The players who don&#8217;t produce at the camp will go out. And those who do well at nationals, play at a really high level and deserve an opportunity, will be given an opportunity.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001951&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Australia replaced India at number two position in the Test team rankings by the virtue of their hard-fought 245-run victory over South Africa in the third and final Test in Cape Town on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Australia had entered the series in third position on 111 ratings points and the victory handed them four ratings points which means that they finish the year on 115 points, three points ahead of India, at the April 1 cut-off date. It also means that Australia have won a cash award of $ 370,000 while third-placed India will have to settle with $ 265,000. England will receive $ 160,000 for finishing fourth.</p>
<p>South Africa, thanks to their commanding lead at the top of the table, retains the mace in spite of dropping to 127 ratings points and will also get richer by the top prize of $ 475,000.</p>
<p>At the January 2012 meeting, the ICC Board had approved a proposal to substantially increase incentives in the form of prize money to promote Test cricket.</p>
<p>In 2015, the total prize money will be increased to $ 1.34 million, which will be distributed to the teams that finish in the top four at the 1 April 2015 cut-off date.</p>
<p>The number-one ranked side will receive $500,000, followed by $390,000, $ 280,000 and $170,000 to the sides that will finish second, third and fourth, respectively.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001942&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/red-480.jpg" /></a> Joe Root scored 107 to take England to 303/6. (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Joe Root hit his maiden one-day century and Jos Buttler scored 99 as England amassed 303 for six off its 50 overs against West Indies in the third and final one-day international on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Root’s 107 off 122 balls included seven fours and lifted England from the early trouble of 37/2 in the seventh over at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. Root shared a fifth wicket stand of 175 with Buttler, who fell in the final over, one short of his own maiden century at this level. Buttler slammed seven fours and four sixes off 84 balls.</p>
<p>The 175 that the pair added was the second highest partnership for England for the fifth wicket. However, the pair survived several close opportunities. Buttler had a caught behind decision overturned on reviewing it when he was on 22 while Root was put down by wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin an outside edge off Sunil Narine.</p>
<p>While Root scored at a strike rate of 87, the power hitting was left to Buttler. He smashed four sixes and seven fours for his 99, that came of just 84 deliveries. Earlier, Moeen Ali had helped lay the platform with his first ODI.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By: Karthik Kumar</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">On a two-paced pitch, Milind Kumar’s composed, unbeaten knock of 70 and veteran Mithun Manhas’ 68 ensured that Delhi, the defending champions, have a great chance of qualifying for the next round of the Vijay Hazare trophy. Delhi beat Haryana by six-wickets at Feroz Shah Kotla to climb to second place in the North Zone.</span></p>
<p>The win was crucial for the hosts as Services and Punjab, both above Delhi in the points table, were playing each other this round and Delhi had to win to make the loss of one team or the other count. With only two sides progressing from each group to the knock-out stages, the Delhi Services game on Thursday becomes a virtual knockout fixture. Punjab can progress despite a loss to Himachal Pradesh on Thursday by virtue of a healthy net run rate.</p>
<p><strong>Bad start</strong><br />
Delhi’s chase of Haryana’s 200 began badly as Unmukt Chand was out leg before first ball to Mohit Sharma. Chand, though, may have got an inside edge. Gautam Gambhir hit three boundaries in his 30-ball stay, but was caught at cover trying to play Harshal Patel on the on-side. When, last match’s hero Jagrit Anand was caught at gully off Joginder Sharma, Delhi slipped to 41/3.</p>
<p>Then, Mithun Manhas and Milind Kumar anchored the innings as they put on 96 runs in 120 balls before Manhas was caught and bowled by Bhupinder Lingwal at 68. The majority of Manhas’ runs, including his boundaries, came through the mid-wicket and cover region. After his dismissal, Milind completed the chase successfully despite the slow nature of the pitch.</p>
<p>Milind and wicket-keeper Puneet Bisht played watchfully, adding 66 runs of 83 balls to secure victory. Earlier, Gautam Gambhir won the toss and elected to field. Pawan Negi and Sumit Narwal, who were brought in for the match, proved the best bowlers, picking up two wickets each. Haryana started well, with Rahul Dewan and Avi Barot adding 49 runs before the side lost six wickets for 60 runs.</p>
<p>All-rounder’s Bhupinder Lingwal and Sonu Rathee put on an unbeaten partnership of 91 runs in 107 deliveries that took the side to a relatively respectable score of 200/6 in 50 overs, but it did not prove enough. Ishant Sharma went wicketless while Virender Sehwag missed the game with a fever.</p>
<p>Brief Scores: Haryana 200/6 in 50 overs (B Lingwal 51, R Dewan 49, S Rathee 39) lost to Delhi 203/4 in 46.1 overs (M Kumar 70, M Manhas 68).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001932&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajanthamendisapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002293" alt="Ajantha Mendis says his target is to cement his place in the Test squad (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajanthamendisapm.jpg" /></a> Ajantha Mendis says his target is to cement his place in the Test squad (AP)
<p><strong><em>Ajantha Mendis burst onto the scene with 26 wickets at home in three Test matches in his debut series against India in 2008. But the Sri Lankan off-spinner has played only another 15 Tests over the next six years and has scalped just 70 wickets. After spending a year on the sidelines, Mendis is back in the Sri Lanka team for the Asia Cup and has picked up seven wickets in two matches. In an interview with The Indian Express, he spoke about his travails and revival.  </em><em>Excerpts:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>You have been bowling well in the Asia Cup as well as in the bilateral series against Bangladesh. Is there anything specific that you are doing to revive your career?</strong></p>
<p>No, not really. I’m the same bowler. Last year I was out with an injury. I have been focusing on doing the basics right after my return.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of injury was that?</strong></p>
<p>I had a back injury — a disc problem. Now it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>For how long you were out of the game, and did you have an operation?</strong></p>
<p>I was out for one year. Thankfully, surgery was not required. I went to Australia for treatment and rehab and now I’m fit and fine.</p>
<p><strong>You made a spectacular entry to international cricket, then there was the dip. You were eventually omitted from the Sri Lankan team. How did you handle the difficult period?</strong></p>
<p>I spent extra hours in the nets. I worked hard to get my basics right. I knew I had the ability to return to the fold again. It was important to get my rhythm back and I feel, now I’m bowling with the right rhythm. I’m more confident now.</p>
<p><strong>So did you find it much tougher after your mystery deliveries were unraveled?</strong></p>
<p>In these days of bowling coaches and video analysts, you can’t retain your surprise element for too long. You have to add variations to outwit the batters. You learn from your experience and try to become a better cricketer. I’m working hard to be the best I can.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Did you turn to anyone for advice to get things right?</strong></p>
<p>I sought help from the bowling coaches and my team mates. I also sought advice from Muttiah Muralitharan.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was Muralitharan’s advice?</strong></p>
<p>He told me to strengthen my basics and concentrate on line and length, and not experiment much.</p>
<p><strong>Now that you are fully fit, you must be very keen to make up for lost time?</strong></p>
<p>The target is to cement my place in the Test side as well. I love Test cricket and want to become a regular.</p>
<p><strong>You were supposed to carry forward Muralitharan’s legacy. Was that too big a pressure?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t think there was ever any pressure on me. A cricketer’s job is to do his best for his team and I always try to do that. Of course I want to be the No.1 player in the national team.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Coming to the Asia Cup, your take on the final against Pakistan.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been playing well and they, too, are doing well in both in batting and bowling. But I think we have a few tricks up our sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>Any special plans for Shahid Afridi?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing special. We will see that day.</p>
<p><strong>But Afridi is ripping apart the spinners and we’ve very short boundaries here?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, short boundaries are a problem but I will try to attack Afridi. If we take his wicket early.</p>
<p><strong>Do you consider Sri Lanka as the favourites for the final?</strong></p>
<p>No. They (Pakistan), too, are doing well. It would be pretty even.</p>
<p><strong>Not many Sri Lankan players were picked for the IPL. You were overlooked as well. Are you disappointed?</strong></p>
<p>No, not disappointed. Actually we’ve an England tour and can’t play all the IPL matches.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001927&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graeme Smith has never been the whiny kind. On most days, while wearing South African colours, the ‘Big Easy’ went about his job with an abstruse grin. It could have been a warm smile or, maybe a mocking smirk, nobody ever knew. You could never interpret Smith’s expression. Nor could you read his mind, mood or move — a trait he shared with other long-serving successful leaders like him.</p>
<p>Once, while opening for Rajasthan Royals, with an in-form Swapnil Asnodkar at the other end, Smith was struggling. The five-nothing Asnodkar, a nobody from Goa enjoying IPL Season One’s unexpected high, walked up to the towering captain of the world’s best side at the time with words of encouragement. Those were crazy times, the suddenly famous kids had the gall. Smith didn’t mind. He was all ears, giving slow nods with a pleasant but inscrutable expression.</p>
<p>A year earlier at Kanpur, after the 1-1 drawn Test series, he had put on the same mask. The diabolical pitch had negated the team’s lead in two-and-a-half days while the Green Park gawkers hadn’t been too gracious to his companion at that time, Slinky Minky, who was clearly under-dressed for the venue. He had enough reasons to break into a rant, but he didn’t.</p>
<p>Instead, he opted for an understatement: “The pitch was slightly underprepared”. That was Smith. He always believed in mopping spilled milk and moving on. He didn’t waste time crying over uncontrollable or nasty taunts. From the time he got world cricket’s second most difficult job — leading Pakistan tops that list — he has been subjected to snide swipes. “He wouldn’t last a tour,” they said when he became the captain at 22. Smith was to became the longest serving, longest-smiling international skipper.</p>
<p>They called his highly talented team a bunch of chokers. He always found the tag amusing. The rest of the world got the joke after South Africa’s recent five year undefeated streak both home and away.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that India has just one series win to show against a Smith-led South Africa, the fans in blue have never been hostile to the leader of the ruthless side. You might not have his poster on your wall but you can’t think of putting his face on the dart-board.</p>
<p>Even when he has been all at sea against Zaheer Khan, he would unleash his trademark disarming grin to de-escalate the tension around the engrossing duel. And this has been Smith’s legacy to South African cricket. Unlike the other stereotypes of the ugly Aussies or the snobbish English, the South Africans, under Smith, were popular champion side. You couldn’t despise them even after they destroyed you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/australiateamreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002331" alt="Less than five overs remained in the final day when last man Morkel was dismissed. Harris’ 4/32 proved decisive for the victorious Aussies. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/australiateamreutersm.jpg" /></a> Less than five overs remained in the final day when last man Morkel was dismissed. Harris’ 4/32 proved decisive for the victorious Aussies. (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ryan Harris condemned South Africa captain Graeme Smith to defeat in his last international as the seamer sealed a 245-run victory and a 2-1 series win for Australia in the dying moments of the third Test on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Harris bowled Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel in the same over as South Africa, trying to bat out a draw, was bowled out for 265 with 27 deliveries remaining in the game at Newlands.</p>
<p>Australia handed South Africa just its second series defeat in its last 26 Test series under Smith. Smith announced his retirement from international cricket on Monday after a 12-year career, and at one stage his team looked set to pull off a stunning rearguard and earn a share of the series.</p>
<p>However, Harris, who will fly home to undergo knee surgery, put in one final push to swing the ball and hit the wickets of Steyn and Morkel and spark wild celebrations for Australia. “Ryan Harris at the start of the day was struggling to walk, let alone bowl,’’ Australia captain Michael Clarke said. “For him to keep running in and do a job for us, he deserves a lot of credit.’’</p>
<p>Australia declared twice at 494-7 and 303-5, and South Africa replied with 287 and 265. For centuries in both innings, Australia opener Dave Warner was named man of the match, and series. South Africa’s intent to settle for the draw, and not chase a target of 511 to win, was clear from the beginning of the day when it resumed on a parlous 71-4.</p>
<p>Nightwatchman Kyle Abbott and AB de Villiers scored just 24 runs in the first 25 overs of play but, crucially, kept the Australian bowlers at bay as the fielders crowded the bat.</p>
<p>Abbott was finally shifted after a 114-minute vigil when he left a James Pattinson delivery and was bowled, but that was the only wicket to fall before lunch.</p>
<p>Australia took the second new ball after the break though, and struck two vital blows in the second session. First, Harris found the edge to remove De Villiers after a stay of 5 hours, 26 minutes at the crease that brought 43 runs from 228 deliveries, and then Faf du Plessis was trapped lbw by Steve Smith for 47.</p>
<p>That left Australia needing three wickets to win, but Vernon Philander and JP Duminy saw South Africa to tea, to leave the home side with 33 overs to see out in the final session.</p>
<p>“I think something we’ve become really good at is never letting go,’’ Smith said. “We’ve certainly been outplayed in this Test match but we still found a way to take it as deep as possible.’’ The pair reduced that figure to 20 overs before Duminy was caught at leg slip for 43 off the bowling of Johnson, but the drama wasn&#8217;t over.</p>
<p>Philander continued to fight, and was involved in a moment of controversy when he was given out caught at short leg off Johnson, only for the third umpire to rule that his right hand was off the bat at the time the ball brushed the glove.</p>
<p><strong>Final hour drama</strong></p>
<p>The decision drew the ire of Clarke, who became entangled in a war of words with Dale Steyn as a drinks break signaled the final hour, or 15 overs. “Honestly, if anybody was out of line it was me, and I apologised to the opposition player that I was out of line to,’’ Clarke said.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say he got me at a bad time, because we’d just had a decision that didn’t go our way — but that’s the game, and as captain of your country you’ve got to be able to cop that on the chin.’’ Philander and Steyn whittled that down to five, seeing off tough spells from Johnson and Pattinson, but then Harris returned to rewrite the final part of Smith’s script and give Australia the honours from a memorable Test series.</p>
<p>“It would have been a wonderful fairytale if we had hung on there, but I think I saw enough qualities today in what the guys showed that the Proteas will be really strong for a period of time,’’ Smith said. “The strength of character we saw today is what this team is all about.’’</p>
<p>Brief scores: Australia 494/7d &amp; 303/5d vs South Africa 287 &amp; 265 all in 134.3 overs (V Philander 51*, F du Plessis 47, JP Duminy 43; R Harris 4/32, M Johnson 3/92)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001920&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Sunil Gavaskar said it was hard to comprehend the Indian team’s decision to play an unchanged XI.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001923&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/pujaraaa.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1962843 " alt="Cheteshwar Pujara has only played two ODIs so far (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/pujaraaa.jpg" /></a> Cheteshwar Pujara has only played two ODIs so far (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Sunil Gavaskar on Wednesday slammed the Indian team management for fielding an unchanged XI in the dead rubber against Afghanistan and wondered whether the “fear” of bench players succeeding over current favourites has prompted it to play the same team. Despite India being out of contention for a berth in the final of the ongoing Asia Cup, middle-order batsman <a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Why is Cheteshwar Pujara still warming the bench?" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-why-is-cheteshwar-pujara-still-warming-the-bench/" target="_blank">Cheteshwar Pujara and pacer Ishwar Pandey were not included</a> in the team for the inconsequential match on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>“The only thing that comes to my mind is that there is that worry and there’s probably a fear that if these guys do well, what happens to our favourites in the team,” Gavaskar told Star Sports.</p>
<p>“This is what breeds complacency, guys know, kuch bhi karoon, team main hoon (whatever I do, I’m in the team). “Are you worried that Cheteshwar Pujara will score runs so that your favourites who are not consistent might have to make way? Are you worried that Ishwar Pandey will pick wickets, and again some of your favourite bowlers might not be certain of a place in the team, what are you worried about?,” the former Indian captain asked.</p>
<p>Gavaskar said it was hard to comprehend the Indian team’s decision. “Very hard to understand, to be honest with you, it’s baffling,” said Gavaskar. “Some of the players have been playing non-stop, they need a bit of a break before the World Twenty20 starts, the second thing is if you are not going to give the reserve players a chance, then when are they going to play,” he said.</p>
<p>Pandey has been a part of the ODI squad for the recent New Zealand tour and the Asia Cup, but hasn’t got a chance to play in either series, while Pujara failed to add to the two ODI caps he had earned in the low-profile Zimbabwe series last year despite India’s listless performances.</p>
<p><strong>Kohli’s stand</strong></p>
<p>At the toss, stand-in-skipper Virat Kohli defended the decision of playing an unchanged team, saying: “It is important the team gets confidence from playing one unit, you have to be patient with this side. We are in a transition phase as far as one-dayers are concerned, we have shown great fight in this tournament, people have to be patient with us, we surely have the talent, but we will have to wait for the experience to come,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001923&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Top officials of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have decided to approach the home ministry with a request to allow IPL matches in first week of May. By the first week of May, seven of the nine phases of the polling will be over.</span></p>
<p>“We will be requesting the home ministry again and will seek their approval to allow BCCI to hold matches in those states where elections are over in first week of May. We are mulling all options. Since this is a domestic tournament we want 60-70 per cent of IPL games to be held here,” a BCCI official said.</p>
<p>BCCI earlier had shortlisted South Africa, UAE and Bangladesh but will take a fresh stock of the situation.</p>
<p>The general elections are scheduled to take place from April 9 to May 12 with the declaration of results set for May 16.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, BCCI officials had a meeting, which was attended by president N Srinivasan, secretary Sanjay Patel, vice-president Rajeev Shukla and IPL CEO Sundar Raman to discuss the further course of action to be taken after election date were announced.</p>
<p>It is learnt that IPL title sponsor Pepsi has expressed their concern over IPL games being held in South Africa as it is not their strongest market.</p>
<p>According to sources, if less than 25 IPL games are to be played in first phase then, BCCI might choose South Africa. And if more than 25 games are to be played than UAE and Bangladesh might host the IPL. IPL chairman Ranjib Biswal said that the BCCI is still keen on hosting a bulk of the matches in India after the elections.</p>
<p>“Now that the election dates have been finalised, we are working towards hosting a majority of the matches in India. It is the Indian Premier League after all,” Biswal said. The chairman also revealed that the Indian board was still keeping all their options open in terms of choosing an offshore venue.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001918&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Australia&#8217;s Ryan Harris took the last two wickets as South Africa came within five overs of saving the third Test on a dramatic day in which a third umpire decision came close to deciding the outcome of the match.</p>
<p>South Africa were bowled out for 265 as Australia won the series-deciding third Test by 245 runs at Newlands on Wednesday, leaving their captain Graeme Smith to retire from international cricket with a defeat.</p>
<p>Not even a controversial third umpire decision could derail Australia&#8217;s victory charge, though they left it late in the day to force the win with Harris (four for 32) the hero.</p>
<p>The Proteas looked as though they would escape with a draw as they got within five overs of safety but Harris bowled out Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel to wrap up victory for the tourists.</p>
<p>Vernon Philander was not out on 51 after surviving a controversial moment with 16 overs remaining that left Australia seething when third umpire Richard Illingworth overturned a decision against him.</p>
<p>Mitchell Johnson produced a fierce bouncer that clearly caught the right thumb of the South African, who was given out by on-field umpire Aleem Dar.</p>
<p>Philander reviewed the decision and it was overturned based on the view that the batsman&#8217;s hand was not on the bat handle.</p>
<p>Replays looked inconclusive and the Australians were seething, leading to an ugly verbal confrontation between touring captain Michael Clarke and Steyn.</p>
<p>The victory gave Australia the series 2-1 and came in the wake of their 5-0 thrashing of England in the home Ashes series played earlier this year.</p>
<p>South Africa started the day on 71 for four and batted for 94 overs but could not find an anchor all day, despite a number of candidates emerging.</p>
<p>Philander, Faf du Plessis (47), JP Duminy (43) and AB de Villiers (43) all spent time at the crease, but not long enough to save the Proteas from a first series defeat since Australia won by the same scoreline in the 2008/09 season.</p>
<p>The match is the last for South Africa&#8217;s Smith who announced his retirement from international cricket after day three of the Test having played in 117 five-day games, 109 as skipper.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001730&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em><strong>India beat Afghanistan in their last Asia Cup fixture, but a lot of questions went unanswered in India&#8217;s campaign.</strong></em></p>
<p>The solid rock in the Indian Test line-up, Cheteshwar Pujara, is yet to become a regular feature in the ODI scheme of things. An outstanding Test average of around 60, with six hundreds and four fifties, is not enough to impress the men who matter. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage: Asia Cup 2014)</a></p>
<p>On occasions, India are found wanting against a quality pace attack and lose control in the space of a couple of overs. Despite the shortest format &#8211; T20s &#8211; having a huge say on the way ODIs are played these days, the stability which a good Test player brings to the middle is a prized asset. And, India are in desperate need of some, especially in the middle order.</p>
<p>If we scan the Indian batting line-up, there is lack of stability. The batting line-up is extremely top heavy. It seems we are back in the 90s or early 2000s where &#8220;top gone, India gone&#8221; was the reputation the team had to live with.</p>
<p>They say failures teach you lessons. If India are waiting for another debacle, an overseas one, to give Pujara a long rope in the shorter format, then they are not doing justice to the talent he posseses.</p>
<p><strong>What could have been done</strong></p>
<p>At the toss, India skipper Virat Kohli said he wanted this side &#8211; the XI which played against Pakistan &#8211; to spend more time in the middle. Moments after the toss, when the producer switched to Sunil Gavaskar, who was doing the pre-match show, criticism poured, and poured like a drain out of control.</p>
<p><a title="Asia Cup 2014: Unchanged India for Afghanistan clash ‘baffles’ Sunil Gavaskar" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-unchanged-india-for-afghanistan-clash-baffles-sunil-gavaskar/" target="_blank">Gavaskar was livid with the team management</a>. The decision to continue benching Pujara and Ishwar Pandey for the inconsequential tie baffled the former India skipper.</p>
<p>The shuffled batting line-up threw weight behind Gavaskar&#8217;s concerns.</p>
<p>If we had to promote Rahane, Karthik up the order, then why not Pujara? A good hit here would have done his ODI confidence a world of good. It is important to understand that a cricketer&#8217;s mental stability holds key to good performances, and the way Pujara is dealt with at the moment, it is doing no good to a quality player.</p>
<p><strong>Is Mishra not encouraging enough?</strong></p>
<p>The eternal tourist, Amit Mishra, <a title="Asia Cup 2014: After boom boom, India go bust" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-after-boom-boom-india-go-bust/" target="_blank">fired all cylinders in his first chance </a>after a long, or very long, wait on the bench.</p>
<p>It was only when lightning struck, and Kohli&#8217;s sense prevailed that the leggie got a game against arch-rivals Pakistan. Taking field after a long time, Mishra showed no out-of-touch signs, and turned the game around. Even in a modest chase, he forced Pakistan on to the back-foot and didn&#8217;t give many scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>If Pujara&#8217;s numbers are not enough, the team management should seriously take into account the way Mishra performed. Talent is okay, but the way it is dealt with makes the difference between quality and ordinary sides.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001712&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/indiateamreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001676" alt="Sunil Gavaskar said it was hard to comprehend the Indian team's decision (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/indiateamreutersm.jpg" /></a> Sunil Gavaskar said it was hard to comprehend the Indian team&#8217;s decision (Reuters)
<p>Sunil Gavaskar slammed the Indian team management for fielding an unchanged XI in the dead rubber against Afghanistan and wondered whether the &#8221;fear&#8221; of bench players succeeding over current favourites has prompted it to play the same team.</p>
<p>Despite India being out of contention for a berth in the final of the ongoing Asia Cup, middle-order batsman Cheteshwar Pujara and pacer Ishwar Pandey were not included in the team for the inconsequential match on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing that comes to my mind is that there is that worry and there&#8217;s probably a fear that if these guys do well, what happens to our favourites in the team,&#8221; Gavaskar told &#8216;Star Sports&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what breeds complacency, guys know, kuch bhi karoon, team main hoon (whatever I do, I&#8217;m in the team).</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you worried that Cheteshwar Pujara will score runs so that your favourites who are not consistent might have to make way? Are you worried that Ishwar Pandey will pick wickets, and again some of your favourite bowlers might not be certain of a place in the team, what are you worried about?,&#8221; the former Indian captain asked.</p>
<p>Gavaskar said it was hard to comprehend the Indian team&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very hard to understand, to be honest with you, it&#8217;s baffling,&#8221; said Gavaskar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the players have been playing non-stop, they need a bit of a break before the World Twenty20 starts, the second thing is if you are not going to give the reserve players a chance, then when are they going to play,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Pandey has been a part of the ODI squad for the recent New Zealand tour and the Asia Cup, but hasn&#8217;t got a chance to play in either series, while Pujara failed to add to the two ODI caps he had earned in the low-profile Zimbabwe series last year despite India&#8217;s listless performances.</p>
<p>At the toss, stand-in-skipper Virat Kohli defended the decision of playing an unchanged team, saying: &#8220;It is important the team gets confidence from playing one unit, you have to be patient with this side.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in a transition phase as far as one-dayers are concerned, we have shown great fight in this tournament, people have to be patient with us, we surely have the talent, but we will have to wait for the experience to come,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001671&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/shikhardhawanapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001642" alt="Chasing a modest total, India are in complete control in the middle (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/shikhardhawanapm.jpg" /></a> Chasing a modest total, India were in complete control in the middle (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">At the innings break, Varun Aaron sought out Wasim Akram for some bowling advice. He might have been better off playing this game against Afghanistan instead. In fact, not only Aaron, it was inexplicable that India didn’t go with Cheteshwar Pujara and Ishwar Pandey today and named an unchanged squad for their first ever ODI against Afghanistan. It was a perfect opportunity to give the reserves some game time in a dead rubber. </span></p>
<p>No one was available to answer this question because captain Virat Kohli didn’t attend the post-match press conference and Ajinkya Rahane, who attended didn’t enlighten anyone when asked about why team management decided not to alter their playing XI from the previous game.</p>
<p>India ended their Asia Cup campaign with a facile eight-wicket win over the bottom-ranked side of the tournament. They were out of the reckoning after Pakistan defeated Bangladesh last night. Aaron played just one match and after sending down 7.5 overs for 74 runs never got another opportunity. This is despite the fact that Mohammed Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar looked drained out — especially the former. Shami has been playing non-stop since making his Test debut against West Indies in November. He’s now struggling.</p>
<p>Even against Afghanistan, he conceded 50 runs in his 7.2 overs, though he bagged a couple of wickets. Kumar was too innocuous and went wicketless on Wednesday. Afghanistan made a promising start after they were sent in and raced to 29 for no loss in their first four overs. Shami was handled with contempt by Noor Ali Zadran, but on this Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium pitch, the minnows were never going to survive India’s spin test. Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin had the Afghanistan batsmen in a spin —taking four and three wickets respectively.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RIGHT AREAS</strong></p>
<p>Not that they bowled anything extraordinary. The Indian spinners just hit the right areas and their opponents simply didn’t have the technique to counter the turning ball. The way Asghar Stanikzai got out by hitting a half-tracker from Jadeja straight into the hands of Amit Mishra at mid-on, and also Najibullah Zadran’s dismissal in Ashwin’s first ball, gave a good indication of Afghanistan’s inexperience and lack of skill.</p>
<p>Wickets fell like ninepins, only Samiullah Senwari showed some application with a 73-ball half-century &#8211; an innings that was laced with six fours and a six. It was a very good effort.</p>
<p>He was watchful against the spinners and targeted the seamers during the batting power-play. It was his second fifty of the tournament which gave Afghanistan’s total some respectability. Senwari protected the tail-enders well to add 64 runs for the last three wickets.</p>
<p>The Indian spinners returned with the combined figures of eight for 82 from their 30 overs. They’ve bowled well in this tournament and have bagged a total of 19 wickets. India were done in by their batting mediocrity.</p>
<p>Rahane had made 73 against Bangladesh the other day. Today, promoted to open the innings, he played a good hand and was unlucky to be given out leg-before on 56.</p>
<p>“Number four is little challenging. I’m still learning at number four. I’ve always opened in T20s and domestic one-dayers. With the new ball and field restriction, you’ve the opportunity to play your shots.</p>
<p>In the middle-order, if you’re coming at No.4 with the score reading 37 for two or something like that, batting becomes different. Again, this is not in my hands and I’m ready to bat in any position according to the team management’s decision,” Rahane said.</p>
<p>Shikhar Dhawan scored 60 and for the first time in 11 matches India posted a 100-plus opening partnership. Dhawan got out to a beauty from off-spinner Mohammad Nabi. The left-hander was beaten by the drift and then the ball straightened after pitching.</p>
<p>Kohli didn’t bother to come, but Rohit Sharma, batting at No.3, and Dinesh Karthik took India to the victory target of 160 in 32.2 overs.</p>
<p>The win is achieved in a canter almost. But this tame exit from the tournament was certainly not the right kind of preparation India would be returning to Bangladesh in ten days’ time.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the MS Dhoni notwithstanding, they would be short on confidence.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001347&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hockey-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001095" alt="Affan Yousuf (L) and Yuvraj Walmiki (R) are two of the youngsters in the probables. Yuvraj’s brother Devinder is also in the 33 man list. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hockey-480.jpg" /></a> Affan Yousuf (L) and Yuvraj Walmiki (R) are two of the youngsters in the probables. Yuvraj’s brother Devinder is also in the 33 man list.
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Barely three months ago, Affan Yousuf, Devinder Walmiki and Lalit Upadhyay were not part for India&#8217;s junior World Cup squad. The trio, who had been the pillars of the team till then, were surprisingly left out of the mega event at home by coaches Gregg Clark and Baljit Saini. Their absence was clearly felt during the tournament as India finished a dismal 10th.</span></p>
<p>Now, as the senior team prepares for their World Cup in a little over three months, chief coach Terry Walsh is making sure the mistake isn&#8217;t repeated. Yousuf, Devinder and Upadhyay, on Tuesday, were among the 33 probables for the Holland event.</p>
<p>Since arriving here in October last year, the Australian has spoken about blooding fresh talents in the squad and it has reflected in his selection of the core group. Sixteen players out of the 33 summoned for the month-long preparatory camp in Delhi from March 9 are aged under 23. Thirteen of them also played in the junior World Cup.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s where the future of the game is. A lot of these players are showing improvement. I am really excited to have them and it should increase the competition level within the squad and put pressure on the seniors. Having worked from within the Hockey India League, we&#8217;ve been able to make a fair and decent assessment (of the young players),” Walsh told The Indian Express from Perth.</p>
<p>Upadhyay and Walmiki both played for Walsh-coached Kalinga Lancers in the HIL. So did Vikram Kanth, the defender who is back in fray after making his India debut eight years back. Kanth caught Walsh&#8217;s attention during the Mumbai Gold Cup last October and continued to impress the 59-year-old during the HIL.</p>
<p>Also making a comeback are Sandeep Singh and Gurbaj Singh, who last played for India at the London Olympics. Gurbaj&#8217;s return was expected. After several run-ins with former coach Michael Nobbs, the right half had been constantly overlooked despite being counted among the best players in the country.</p>
<p>His consistent performances in the domestic circuit and the HIL last month, however, could not be ignored. Known for his immaculate ball distribution, energy and aggression, Gurbaj stood out in the HIL for Delhi Waveriders. Sandeep, meanwhile, was the HIL&#8217;s top-scorer for second consecutive season. While his drag-flicking abilities are beyond doubt, his defensive frailties can become his undoing. Unless he becomes quick on feet, it is unlikely that he will be on the plane to The Hague.</p>
<p>Those who&#8217;ve missed out include goalkeeper PT Rao, defender Amit Rohidas and injured forward Gurwinder Singh Chandi. The team selection is likely to happen towards the end of April. India will be travelling to Holland to play a few friendly matches in early April as a part of their preparation for the World Cup. The quadrennial showpiece event will be held in the Netherlands from May 31 to June 15 and India are in Group A along side Australia, England, Belgium, Spain and Malaysia.</p>
<p>“We need to get our team playing outside India, against European teams. The team will be selected week after we get back from that tournament. The 33 players we have selected will have to work really hard to stay in contention. Those who won&#8217;t will be out and we include those who do well in the ongoing national championships,” Walsh said.</p>
<p>Probables: Goalkeepers: P.R. Sreejesh, Harjot Singh, Sushant Tirkey Defenders: Gurbaj Singh, Rupinder Pal Singh, V.R. Raghunath, Birendra Lakra, Gurmail Singh, Kothajit Singh Khadangbam, Gurjinder Singh, Gurinder Singh, Sandeep Singh, Vikram Kanth Midfielders: S.K. Uthappa, Dharamvir Singh, Chinglensana Singh Kangujam, Sardar Singh, Manpreet Singh, Danish Mujtaba, Satbir Singh, Devinder Sunil Walmiki, Vikas Pillay, Jasjit Singh Forwards: Nikkin Thimmaiah, Nithin Thimmaiah, S.V. Sunil, Mandeep Singh, Akashdeep Singh, Ramandeep Singh, Affan Yousuf, Yuvraj Walmiki, Talwinder Singh, Lalit Upadhyay.</p>
<p><strong>Chhattisgarh beat Kerala</strong><br />
Lucknow: CHHATTISGARH came from two goals behind and went on to defeat opponents Kerala 3-2 in their Pool D match of the 4th Hockey India Senior Men&#8217;s National Championship (B Division) at Dhyan Chand Stadium, Lucknow on Tuesday. Kerala forwards Sarin E (19th minute) and Jithu Sasi (34th minute) struck apiece each to give a 2-0 lead to their team at the breather. Chhattisgarh resorted to an aggressive game in the second-half. Shakeel Ahmed scored off a PC in the 55th minute, Erfan Khan equalised with a field goal in the 62nd minute while Upendra Pillay hit the winner in the dying seconds of the game.<br />
Two Pool C matches were also played on Tuesday. In the first Pool C match, Puducherry defeated Tripura 11-1 while Hockey Gangpur-Odisha beat Mizoram 6-0 in the other match.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001094&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After more than a year in limbo, the fate of IABF (Indian Amateur Boxing Federation) appeared to have been sealed on Monday. World body AIBA (Amateur International Boxing Association) which had suspended IABF in December 2012 citing possible manipulation of elections decided to cut its loss and ended its association with the Indian body. AIBA has now invited applications for a new national boxing federation.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t the only national federation suspended by AIBA — France, England, Korea and South Africa — were similarly sanctioned. But while Korea and South Africa were re inducted into the AIBA fold after fresh elections the failiure of IABF led by president Abhishek Matoria to do so have led to the current situation. Last year, more than 20 state units did not attend a meeting and the above said units have been gathering support even through online forums for the members to join the protest.</p>
<p>The impasse between AIBA and AIBF has negatively impacted Indian boxers. The federation not just failed to conduct an Annual General Meeting in their tenure, they have also failed to hold any national tournaments since the senior women nationals in May last year. While boxers and coaches were permitted to take part in last year&#8217;s World Championships in Kazakhstan under the AIBA flag, the boxers had to miss exposure and training competition in Cuba.</p>
<p>While the AIBA has been shifting its focus towards semi-professional style of boxing with its flagship programs World Series of Boxing and AIBA Professional League,Indian boxers failed to feature in WSB and in the draft and the final list for APB, which will begin later this year.</p>
<p>Now the latest AIBA decision brings a further sense of confusion. While AIBA has invited applications for a new national federation, the readmission process will not be completed before the AIBA congress to be held in November, putting a question mark over the camps abroad and the road map for this year&#8217;s CWG, Asian games and 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
<p>With the AIBA also coming with the new qualification system for Rio Olympics with more than 30 percent qualification through WSB and APB apart from a new qualifying tournament in the form of AOB World Qualifying, the boxers would hope that the new federation is formed as soon as possible.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001093&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graemesmithreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001395" alt="Australia's captain Michael Clarke (2nd R) greets Graeme Smith as he comes out to bat for the last time (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graemesmithreutersm.jpg" /></a> Australia&#8217;s captain Michael Clarke (2nd R) greets Graeme Smith as he comes out to bat for the last time (Reuters)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Graeme Smith made three in his final Test innings as South Africa slid towards a heavy defeat at the close on the fourth day of the series-deciding third Test against Australia on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>Chasing a victory target of 511, the hosts will resume on 71 for four on the final day despite a valiant effort from AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla who survived 31 overs before the latter was out 20 minutes before stumps.<br />
South Africa had lost openers Smith and Alviro Petersen, as well as Dean Elgar, as Australia were rampant before tea.</p>
<p>Smith flicked a rising Mitchell Johnson delivery on to his thigh and the ball looped gently to Alex Doolan at short leg, an inglorious end for one of the game’s greats who was given a guard of honour by the touring side as he came out to bat.</p>
<p>It was a tame way for Smith’s 205th Test innings to finish but it was in keeping with his poor form in a series in which he has scored just 45 runs in six innings.</p>
<p>The South African captain, who announced his retirement from international cricket last night, bowed out having made 9,265 runs at an average of 48.25 in 117 Tests, 109 of those as captain.</p>
<p>De Villiers survived 100 balls for his 16 with all thoughts of scoring gone and survival the only thing on his mind.<br />
He and Amla added 53 for the fourth wicket off 184 balls, a stand ended when Amla was trapped lbw by a reverse-swinging delivery from James Pattinson.</p>
<p>“Hopefully we come out tomorrow and bowl straight at the stumps, that’s the line I think we have to bowl,” Australia opener David Warner said. “It was quite tough to get through the wall (Amla) there, but we know if we get can the ball reversing then we are in the game.”</p>
<p>De Villiers will resume on Wednesday with nightwatchman Kyle Abbott hoping for a repeat of their performances in Adelaide and Johannesburg in the last 18 months where they batted for 148 and 136 overs respectively in the fourth innings to seal draws.</p>
<p>Faf du Plessis, who will bat next, scored battling centuries in both those innings to steer the Proteas to safety.<br />
“There has been a lot of emotion around with Graeme deciding to give up international cricket, but I suppose it is also motivation for the guys to ensure we fight hard for the skipper,” South Africa coach Russell Domingo said.</p>
<p>“We have got six wickets in the bank and we are going to fight hard tomorrow. It has been done before at Newlands, I remember England were four down a few years ago and hung on for a draw. We were four down in Adelaide, so we know it can be done.”</p>
<p>The struggles of the home side were in sharp contrast to the Australia innings, when Warner made batting look easy as he bludgeoned 145 from 156 balls and the tourists declared their second innings on 303 for five. It was a second century of the match for the left-hander, who took his runs total in the series to 543, averaging 91.</p>
<p>Warner received support from Chris Rogers (39) and Steve Smith (36 not out), but was the dominant figure in all his partnerships as he scored nearly half his side’s runs.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Australia 1st innings 494/7 dec &amp; 303/5 dec in 58 overs (D Warner 145, C Rogers 39,A Doolan 37; K Abbott 3/61, M Morkel 1/67) vs South Africa 1st innings 287 &amp; 71/4 in 41 overs (H Amla 41, AB De Villiers 16*,A Petersen 9;M Johnson 2/31,R Harris 1/10) .</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001059&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jimmy-new-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001055" alt="Jimmy Cook mentored Graeme Smith. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jimmy-new-480.jpg" /></a> Jimmy Cook mentored Graeme Smith.
<p><strong><em>Jimmy Cook is a former South African opener who played three Tests before taking over as coach at the King Edward School in Johannesburg where he oversaw the rise of Graeme Smith and then went on to become his mentor.</em></strong></p>
<p>The first time I met Graeme Smith I thought he was an odd boy. He had come to one of the cricket clinics we ran in Johannesburg and was bowling in the nets when another kid asked him something. Graeme turned around and sternly told this kid, “Can you leave me alone? I’m bowling.” And this kid looked at him like, ‘who the hell are you?’</p>
<p>Even I was taken aback by Graeme’s reaction. He was just 12-years-old. When he batted, every time Graeme hit the ball he would look straight at me as if inquiring ‘Everything ok?’. At the end of the net, he came to me and asked, “What did you think? How did I do?” We spoke only cricket. Jeez, the practice finished and suddenly Graeme’s high-fiving everybody and playing and running around like a normal kid. If anything, he was a naughty little bugger. But while he was playing cricket, there was no one or nothing else that mattered except what he was busy doing. I have never met a more focused young man. Ever.</p>
<p>Graeme’s an out-and-out Jo’burg boy and moved to Cape Town only much later. He went to King Edward School, where I was coach. And when he was 16, I spoke with the Lions franchise guys insisting that we need to sign him now. The guy looked at me like I was crazy.</p>
<p>A year later, he was with South Africa U-19s and I had eight of the 10 franchises calling me repeatedly asking ‘what do we have to do to get him into our province?’</p>
<p>Mentally, I’ve never seen a kid stronger then Graeme. Play or miss his expression never changed. As a bowler you would wonder, did he play at that ball cause he doesn’t look worried at all.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitive kid</strong></p>
<p>There were a couple of technical issues to start with. His grip on the bat was something we always tried to sort out. Eventually, we decided to work with it. He just wanted to practice. I used to fetch him (Graeme), Stephen (my oldest son), and a boy called Matthew Harris, who ended up as the Lions wicket-keeper, from school and bring them to the indoor centre at the Wanderers. We would start at 3 o clock. And we would just hit balls. Two throwing to each other and me on the machine. And we would rotate. It would be 7 o clock when their dads used to come and fetch them and Graeme would go, “No, no Dad, just one more net.” We used to be there for four-and-a-half hours.</p>
<p>Graeme would never tire of asking questions. “What was it like opening the batting? How should I play here?” I used to tell Stephen as we would drive back from school, “Geez, this kid asks a lot of questions.”<br />
He had a funny way, Graeme. He scored runs even when he wasn’t playing well. Many a Saturday, I used to watch and think, “Eh Graeme hasn’t played really well today.” Mind you he’s got 15 not out, so he’s doing alright.</p>
<p>half hour later he’s got 35. By the end of the day, 85. He always had a knack of making runs. Then I got to know him better and his dad said I would like you to look after his cricket and I became his mentor. I have to say that I was surprised when he got the captaincy so young. It was at the end of the 2003 World Cup with South Africa having been knocked out early and Shaun (Pollock) having lost his captaincy.</p>
<p>I was just going to go on as a studio guest for a 7 pm evening TV show. At about 6, Graeme’s dad called me and told me, “Graeme’s going to be the captain of South Africa on the next tour. I can’t tell anyone but I had to tell you.”</p>
<p>There were six or seven other guests and then they came to me, “Jimmy what do you think? There’s some talk that Graeme Smith might be the man.” I said Greame might be a little young for the job despite being the only one there who knew.</p>
<p><strong>Born leader</strong></p>
<p>I’ll never forget an incident that transpired at a preparation camp before they left for England on Graeme’s first tour as captain. The batsmen were doing some shuttles. The bowlers, however, were done and having a cold-drink on the sidelines. Suddenly Graeme screamed, “Everybody here. You bowlers, don’t you ever go and have a cold-drink when we aren’t done with practice. You come here, stand here and you cheer the guys on and help the guys with the fitness that we do.” There were Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald all standing there. At that moment, I realized we’ve made the right choice here. He’s proven us right for over a decade.</p>
<p>I have remained his mentor even after he moved to Cape Town. We’ve always had that sort of unwritten rule. If I need you, I will let you know. The success I had with Graeme has spurred me on to see how many more times I can do this. Get a guy from nowhere and turn him into something.</p>
<p>In a way, you can say I’ve lived my dream through his achievements. I wouldn’t have minded being Graeme Smith actually.</p>
<p>Graeme’s been a very special guy in my life. Some of the best years of my life were spent watching Stephen and Graeme play together. And I’ve really cherished sitting back in my chair and watching him perform miracles for South Africa.</p>
<p>He’s got a bloody good career. And I don’t think I’ll ever meet anyone like Graeme again.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001043&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graeme-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001037" alt="South Africa's captain Graeme Smith after announcing his retirement during the fourth day of the third Test against Australia. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graeme-480.jpg" /></a> South Africa&#8217;s captain Graeme Smith after announcing his retirement during the fourth day of the third Test against Australia. (Reuters)
<p>Graeme Smith announced his<a title="‘I don’t think I’ll ever meet anyone like Graeme Smith’" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/i-dont-think-ill-ever-meet-anyone-like-graeme-smith/" target="_blank"> sudden retirement from international cricket</a> on Monday, ending the career of the most experienced Test captain and South African cricket’s savior. Smith resurrected the team from the match-fixing scandal involving former skipper Hansie Cronje and a disastrous World Cup on home soil in 2003.</p>
<p>Smith, given control of the under-performing and fiercely criticised national team at 22, went on to play over 100 Tests, was captain for more than a decade and established South Africa as the No.1 Test team in the world, although he couldn’t end the country’s long wait for a World Cup title.</p>
<p>“This has been the most difficult decision I have ever had to make in my life,” Smith said in a statement through Cricket South Africa. He told teammates after the third day of the ongoing third Test against Australia at his home ground Newlands in Cape Town that he was retiring after the match. “It’s a decision that I have been considering since my ankle surgery in April last year,” he said. “I have a young family to consider, and I felt that retiring at Newlands would be the best way to end it because I have called this place home since I was 18 years old.”</p>
<p>CSA said it was surprised by Smith’s announcement but recognised him as “one of the true legends of the game.”<br />
It follows the sudden announcement by all-rounder Jacques Kallis to quit Tests late last year. “We must respect him for deciding to call time,” CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat said of Smith.</p>
<p>“Knowing him as well as I do, having been instrumental as a selector in appointing him as a young captain, he would not have taken this decision lightly or without a great deal of thought.”</p>
<p>He will give up all internationals after his 117th Test, against the same opponents and on the same ground where he made his debut almost to the day, on March 8, 2002. He also played 197 ODIs, and scored over 9,000 Test runs and 6,989 ODI runs.</p>
<p>“I have been fortunate to have had many highs,” Smith said, “amongst them leading and being part of the best Test team in the world. I will cherish these memories for the rest of my life. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I bid my career a fond yet sad farewell.”</p>
<p>A big, muscular left-handed opening batsman, Smith never was praised for being an elegant player, but he was gritty, single-minded and at times brutish — all qualities that endeared him to a South African sporting public that like their stars to be tough, above anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Early promise</strong></p>
<p>His double-centuries in back-to-back Tests in England in 2003 and early in his career announced him as a player to be reckoned with, and he had a habit of making big scores when his team had its back to the wall, not least the 90 he hit to set up South Africa’s world-record score of 438 to win an ODI against Australia in 2006.</p>
<p>Smith has scored 27 Test hundreds and 38 half-centuries at an average of 48.72 with likely one innings to go. Ahead of the series-deciding third Test, which Australia leads by 234 runs with two days to play, Smith talked of a “challenging two weeks” in relation to his personal life and with specific reference to his young daughter. He didn’t elaborate. “I definitely don’t see myself playing until the age of Kallis or (Sachin) Tendulkar,” he said. “But hopefully I’ll know when the time is right.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001029&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahidafridiapppm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001636" alt="Shahid Afridi played a crucial hand against India, and against Bangladesh on Tuesday (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahidafridiapppm.jpg" /></a> Shahid Afridi played a crucial hand against India, and against Bangladesh on Tuesday (AP)
<p><strong><em><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Rashid Latif, the latest chief selector of the Pakistan side, is a happy man. For one, Shahid Afridi found his touch with the bat against arch-rivals India in a last-over win to give credence to Latif’s belief in him. And secondly, the former Pakistan wicketkeeper believes that the current side is experienced enough to challenge for the World Cup next year. He explains why and more, in a conversation with The Indian Express. Excerpts. </span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>How significant is this last-over win against India for Pakistan?</strong></p>
<p>Very significant. Pakistan have had suffered many a jolt of late. There have been controversies, poor performances and uncertainties. I believe the win against India not only will bring in positive vibes but will also give the team a huge lift. Victories are warmly feted by both sets of fans in this clash (India-Pakistan encounters) and the whole nation is very happy that we won the game.</p>
<p><strong>Shahid Afridi’s performance had been under the scanner, especially with the bat. Will this knock will help him regain his confidence?</strong></p>
<p>Shahid has always been a very important player for us. After Shoaib Akhtar retired, he’s easily the biggest star in the country. We don’t have big movie stars like in Bollywood. Naturally, everyone’s happy that he won us the game with the bat. But here’s the thing with him. He’s now one of our premier bowlers. When he will play a good innings, he will win us matches. It happened against India. He has a clearly-defined role and has been doing his job very well as a senior player in the team.</p>
<p><strong>Did you see any similarities between R Ashwin’s final over and Chetan Sharma’s famous final ball?</strong></p>
<p>It’s obvious that people will compare this with our win in Sharjah in 1986. Javed Miandad had clinched it with a last ball six off Chetan. And it gave us such a big psychological upper hand that India couldn’t beat us in an ODI for the next five-six years. I hope this win also gives us a similar morale boost. Chetan was a very good bowler and it was one of those deliveries. But such is the nature of India-Pakistan ties that even minor slip-ups are hardly forgotten. This is one match that makes heroes and zeros. Like Chetan, Ashwin, too, might have to bear this for the rest of his career. He didn’t bowl badly and Shahid even had a mis-hit. But he’s so powerful that the ball cleared the ropes.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve been given the job to build a team for the World Cup. What are your plans to build a successful side?</strong></p>
<p>In Mohammad Hafeez, Misbah ul-Haq, Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi, Junaid Khan and Ahmed Shehzad we already have the core. They will go to the World Cup. Abdul Razzaq, too, will be there if he’s fit. And there are some really talented young players in the team.This is an exciting time for Pakistan cricket.</p>
<p><strong>The last time the World Cup was played in Australia-New Zealand, Pakistan won. Can Misbah do an Imran?</strong></p>
<p>To win a tournament like the World Cup, you need more than just good players and a great captain. You need luck as well. That team returned from the brink to win the title. They did it because they had the champion’s luck and also showed enormous character. It was basically an inexperienced team with Inzamam-ul-Haq, Ijaz Ahmed, Aaqib Javed and Moin Khan. Imran, Miandad and Wasim Akram were the three experienced players. This team has plenty of experience on their side. And it has the right mixture of youth as well.</p>
<p><strong>As PCB’s anti-corruption chief, how are you planning to rid Pakistan cricket of corruption?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>It’s not the job of an individual. The PCB and ICC are working jointly. We are trying to ensure that only the players with good characters come into the team. We are checking their past. And we are putting a lot of emphasis on that, because it’s imperative to have a clean past. We are holding seminars to educate young players.</p>
<p><strong>It must be a challenging post, considering that Pakistan cricket has always been riddled with controversies.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve got to stop these controversies. We’ve to check if our system is faulty and if there are loopholes, and plug them. But corruption in cricket is a global problem, not just ours.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the PCB’s decision of not supporting the ICC overhaul might affect Pakistan cricket?</strong></p>
<p>What happened was wrong. Just three countries can’t be the guardians of the game. India is already a cricketing superpower, so their constant need to stamp their authority on the rest of us makes no sense. If they need more money, they could always play more matches with Pakistan. It’s the biggest money-spinner in all of cricket, after all.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001025&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rehmanfilem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001388" alt="Abdur Rehman was taken off the attack after bowling  three beamers" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rehmanfilem.jpg" /></a> Abdur Rehman was taken off the attack after bowling three beamers
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Pakistani spinner Abdur Rehman had a spell to forget in his country’s Asia Cup <a title="Asia Cup 2014: Sprint decides run-marathon" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-sprint-decides-run-marathon/">match against Bangladesh</a> on Tuesday, the left-armer sending down a hat-trick of illegal full tosses to finish with bizarre bowling figures of 0-0-8-0. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></span></p>
<p>Brought into the attack in the 11th over at Mirpur’s Shere Bangla National Stadium, the 34-year-old spinner’s first delivery to Imrul Kayes slipped out of his hand and sailed well above waist-height and wide outside the off-stump.</p>
<p>His second attempt turned out to be a beamer, which Kayes pulled to deep mid-wicket, where a fielder took the catch but replays confirmed another no-ball.</p>
<p>Under ICC playing conditions, a bowler is taken out of the attack after sending down more than one full toss above the waist but South African umpire Johan Cloete let Rehman continue after a brief chat with Pakistan skipper Misbah-ul-Haq.</p>
<p>Rehman came round the wicket still searching for his first legitimate delivery but even his third attempt proved to be a full toss at the body of Anamul Haq, who pulled it to the midwicket boundary for an additional four runs.<br />
Rehman was summarily taken out of the attack after conceding the highest amount of runs ever recorded without bowling a single ball, and was replaced by fellow left-arm spinner Fawad Alam.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001018&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mohammadnabiapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001382" alt="Team Afghanistan is filled with batsmen who hope to bat like their hero, MS Dhoni (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mohammadnabiapm.jpg" /></a> Team Afghanistan is filled with batsmen who hope to bat like their hero, MS Dhoni (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Fans meet their heroes. This line encapsulates the India-Afghanistan Asia Cup match to be played on Wednesday. Afghanistan players worship their Indian counterparts, but the one they consider their hero will not play tomorrow. <a title="Injured Mahendra Singh Dhoni ruled out of Asia Cup; Virat Kohli to lead" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/injured-mahendra-singh-dhoni-ruled-out-of-asia-cup-virat-kohli-to-lead/" target="_blank">MS Dhoni’s absence</a> has left even the Afghans disappointed. “Dhoni is extremely popular within our team. We would have loved to play against him,” Afghanistan manager Shafiqllah Stanikzai said. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></span></p>
<p>This would be the first-ever ODI between the two sides and they have completely different goals. <a title="Asia Cup 2014: Sprint decides run-marathon" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-sprint-decides-run-marathon/" target="_blank">Pakistan’s win over Bangladesh</a> means India are out of the tournament. So a win on Wednesday will be only a consolation for the Indian team.</p>
<p>Both Pakistan and Sri Lanka have gained a bonus point against Afghanistan, but this is an Indian team short on wins and low on confidence. And with a bowling attack that does not inspire confidence.</p>
<p>The full squad was at practice on Tuesday, despite the fact that the training session was optional. <a title="Asia Cup 2014: Doing the best we can, in whatever capacity, says Ambati Rayudu" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-doing-the-best-we-can-in-whatever-capacity-says-ambati-rayudu/" target="_blank">Ambati Rayudu</a> defended the management’s decision to not make attendance at training sessions mandatory.</p>
<p>“We’ve been working very hard, as much as any other team, if not more. Moreover, we’ve played back-to-back games, three matches in five days. And it’s not only us. No team has practiced after back-to-back games. We’ve been travelling from South Africa to New Zealand and then here. We landed and played a game in just two days. The players are going through fatigue as well,” he said.</p>
<p>The players, however, looked very intense during their two-hour practice session. Shikhar Dhawan batted at a separate net and looked to be concentrating on his back-lift and feet movement.</p>
<p>The Delhi opener has been facing the second season blues and has just one half-century in his last nine ODI innings. His poor form has dented India’s chances with just two 50-plus opening partnerships in their last 10 matches.</p>
<p>India also have posted just one 300-plus total since leaving for foreign shores in December last year. At one corner of the ground, coach Duncan Fletcher was busy with Ajinkya Rahane. Fletcher advised Rahane about his elbow position. Rahane listened intently. But every time these youngsters are going out to bat in the middle, they’re looking to be putting extra pressure on themselves.</p>
<p>As for the bowling, medium-pacer Ishwar Pandey had a long stint in the nets. This match is now a perfect opportunity to check the bench strength.</p>
<p>Afghanistan have played against India in international cricket before — at the World T20 in 2012. Then, Lakshmipathy Balaji’s three-for and Virat Kohli’s fifty proved to be too much for them.</p>
<p>In their first big ODI event, Afghanistan have already made a mark with their win over Bangladesh. They would be keen to impress their Indian idols. In Shapoor Zadran, they have a bowler who can make the best of the Indian batsmen hop.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001008&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahidafridireutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001375" alt="Although he missed the record for the fastest ODI half-century ever by just a ball, Shahid Afridi brought up his fifty in just 18 balls — the third time he has done so in his one-day career. It propelled the defending champions into the Asia Cup final (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahidafridireutersm.jpg" /></a> Although he missed the record for the fastest ODI half-century ever by just a ball, Shahid Afridi brought up his fifty in just 18 balls — the third time he has done so in his one-day career. It propelled the defending champions into the Asia Cup final (Reuters)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">A partisan crowd celebrated his dismissal. Unfortunately, not a single clap was reserved for Shahid Afridi. In the mass hysteria, the fans forgot how privileged they were to be present at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium here on Tuesday to witness an Afridi special. </span></p>
<p>Afridi left the field grimacing in pain. He had scored 59 off just 25 balls, hit seven sixes and turned the game around. His dismissal was because of his sore hamstring that hampered his running between the wickets. He did push hard after placing an Al-Amin Hossain delivery to mid-on but he never seemed like making it to the other end. Shakib Al Hasan hit the stumps with a direct throw. Afridi was run out and the stands were alive again.</p>
<p>But the target by now was within Pakistan’s reach. Fawad Alam, who made 74, did get out with just two balls to go but it didn’t matter. Needing two runs to win, Umar Akmal found the gap along the mid-wicket boundary to ensure Pakistan chased down 327 for victory — their highest successful chase ever — with one ball to spare and reach the Asia Cup final.</p>
<p>Earlier, Afridi had arrived when the chips were down. A mindless promotion of Abdur Rehman as a slogger had made his job difficult. Pakistan were staring at a 10-plus asking rate. The equation &#8211; 102 more runs in 52 balls &#8211; was challenging. When Afridi marked his guard, spinner Mahmudullah was bowling.</p>
<p>The first ball, Afridi faced, went over the long-on boundary. The next was placed to deep-square leg for a couple. This was followed by another six. A single off the final ball of the over kept Afridi on strike.</p>
<p><strong>In the zone<br />
</strong>Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim turned to his best bowler Shakib. But Afridi was in the zone as he hit three more sixes in that Shakib over. By the end of the over he had played just 10 balls and raced to 35.</p>
<p>His half-century came in just 18 balls and then Afridi momentarily lost steam. He was dropped on 51 by Mushfiqur Rahim. Eight runs later Afridi departed but the damage had been done and Bangladesh were rattled.<br />
“This has to be one of the best ODI knocks ever. But I would say a combined batting effort won us the game.</p>
<p>Ahmed) Shehzad scored a century. Fawad Alam stayed till the end. Umar Akmal also contributed,” Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq said.</p>
<p>His Bangladesh counterpart admitted that he ran out of options. “When a batsman plays such an innings, bowlers run out of options. You can just hope that he misses one. Today Afridi connected everything,” said Rahim.<br />
Pakistan’s win also broke their sequence of 12 losses in a row, while chasing the scores of 250-plus. Misbah was right when he said that it was a team batting effort after giving due credit to Afridi’s knock.</p>
<p>Opener Ahmed Shehzad scored his fifth ODI hundred, while Mohammad Hafeez made 52. Together, they added 97 runs for the first wicket. Alam held the innings in the middle with a very calculated 70-ball 74. Akmal, who was held back in the order, provided the finishing touches with a boundary in the fifth ball of the final over.</p>
<p><strong>Heads held high</strong><br />
Bangladesh were defeated but not disgraced. They reached their highest ever ODI total (326/3), thanks to a late blitz, during which they scored 104 runs in the last eight overs. They made five changes to their XI following the loss against Afghanistan and looked determined to make amends.</p>
<p>Anamul Haque scored a very polished century, Imrul Kayes, Mominul Haque and Mushfiqur Rahim &#8211; all scored half-centuries and Shakib, who returned after a three-game ban, remained unbeaten on 44 off 16 balls.</p>
<p>The Pakistan bowlers were off-colour. Left-arm spinner Abdur Rehman, who was drafted into the squad, was barred by the umpires after bowling three waist-high full tosses in his first over. In the end, he, however, could smile as Afridi saved the day.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000993&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hafeez.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000982 " alt="Pakistan’s Mohammad Hafeez acknowledges the crowd after scoring fifty runs during the Asia Cup one-day international cricket tournament against India in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Sunday, March 2, 2014." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hafeez.jpg" /></a> Pakistan’s Mohammad Hafeez acknowledges the crowd after scoring fifty runs during the Asia Cup one-day international cricket tournament against India.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A large private university in Meerut has suspended 67 Kashmiri students for allegedly cheering Pakistan during the India-Pak match at the Asia Cup on Sunday. The students were told to vacate their hostel rooms, and were escorted by police and university officials to nearby Ghaziabad. Some students are now back with their families in the Valley.</span></p>
<p>Groups of students were watching the match on TV in the community hall of the hostel at the Swami Vivekananda Subharti University (SVSU). A clash broke out soon after India lost, a result which the Kashmiris allegedly celebrated. No action was taken against the other group.</p>
<p>G S Bansal, the warden of the hostel, said the Kashmiri students had been punished for being “anti-national”. “By raising pro-Pakistan slogans, the Kashmiri boys did an anti-national act, and that was why we suspended them and did not take any action against the others,” Bansal told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>SVSU vice-chancellor Manzoor Ahmed said the suspension was a “precautionary measure”.</p>
<p>“There was strong resentment against the students who had shouted anti-national and pro-Pakistan slogans after Pakistan won the match. So as a precautionary measure, we temporarily suspended students of J&amp;K for three days. We arranged for two buses to <span style="line-height:1.5em;">take the boys to Ghaziabad. We also sent three senior university officials with them,” Ahmed said.</span></p>
<p>Eyewitnesses said heated exchanges followed all-rounder Shahid Afridi’s last-over sixes off Ravichandran Ashwin, which quickly escalated to brawls, followed by several rounds of stone-throwing. “Security guards did not intervene for nearly an hour after the violence began. The students were ultimately forced to go to their rooms, but the groups clashed again on Monday,” said a student who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>University registrar R K Garg said the students were sent home because the university feared more violence. “Meerut is communally sensitive. We were apprehensive that if word of the violence got out, outsiders would storm the campus and target students,” Garg said.</p>
<p>In Srinagar, families of the suspended students said they hoped for normalcy to return to the campus soon. “The university has ordered the students to leave for some time in order to avert confrontations between groups,” Abdul Majeed Khan of Uri said. Khan’s son is a second year student of BBA at the university. He added that the university administration had taken the right steps.</p>
<p>Shahid Bashir, whose son Talib Bashir had to leave Meerut, said, “The university has asked the students to leave for a few days. Most of the students have left for the Valley, while a few are staying in Delhi with friends. Once the situation improves, they will rejoin the university.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000973&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kohlimishraapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000752" alt="Virat Kohli said the decision to draft in Amit Mishra was taken after their loss to Sri Lanka in the previous match (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kohlimishraapm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli said the decision to draft in Amit Mishra was taken after their loss to Sri Lanka in the previous match (AP)
<p>His team is on the verge of being knocked out of the Asia Cup after back-to-back losses but India&#8217;s stand-in skipper Virat Kohli said he is not at all shocked by the prospect as his side is massively inexperienced even though it has shown &#8220;character&#8221;.</p>
<p>India have lost consecutive matches to <a title="Asia Cup 2014: That man Kumara Sangakkara again" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-that-man-kumara-sangakkara-again/" target="_blank">Sri Lanka</a> and <a title="Asia Cup 2014: After boom boom, India go bust" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-after-boom-boom-india-go-bust/" target="_blank">arch-rivals Pakistan</a> in the five-team event and are all but out of contention for a spot in the final. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not shocked at all. I&#8217;m really proud of the way the boys fought it out. I&#8217;m really proud of the way the team showed character in the field and with the bowling as well. 245 against a team like Pakistan and on that wicket with the dew is not easy to defend, but I think the guys showed a lot of character,&#8221; Kohli said after the one-wicket loss to Pakistan.</p>
<p><a title="Asia Cup 2014: Shahid Afridi seals thrilling chase" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/sports-gallery/asia-cup-2014-shahid-afridi-seals-thrilling-chase/" target="_blank">The defeat was crushing</a> for the fact that India could have nailed it had it not been for <a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Shahid Afridi, the emir of Mirpur" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-shahid-afridi-the-emir-of-mirpur/" target="_blank">successive sixes struck by Shahid Afridi</a> in the final over of the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you see the kind of batsmen they had and our bowlers with the inexperience they had, still to put up that kind of fight. I mean you see (Amit) Mishra, he gave only 28 runs in 10 overs, took two wickets, bowled brilliantly against the likes of Misbah, Hafeez, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi. So I think it was a commendable effort and I&#8217;m really, really proud of the way the guys fought it out,&#8221; Kohli said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you compare the experience of our team with their team, it&#8217;s massive, it&#8217;s huge. And in International cricket it really counts a lot. You can get away with it in Twenty20, but in the 50-over format you need to show a lot of character and that&#8217;s exactly what the boys did,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Defending a modest 246, Indian bowlers, particularly Mishra (2/28 from 10 overs) and R Ashwin (3/44), took the match to the wire and Pakistan were left needing nine runs off the last four balls with one wicket in hand.</p>
<p>But Afridi&#8217;s big blows sealed the win which took Pakistan a step closer to the final.</p>
<p>Defending his decision to give Ashwin the last over, Kohli said: &#8220;I knew that if I put the seamers in before and Ashwin comes to bowl, they will go for it. Wickets are all we wanted. If Afridi and Umar Gul had just played singles they would have won easily. I took that risk of putting the seamers in and making them hit the ball. We almost pulled it off as well in the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those last two sixes were not quite off the middle of the bat. One side was a small boundary, but that&#8217;s how it goes. We almost pulled it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Showering more praise on Mishra, the skipper said the decision to draft in the leg-spinner was taken after their loss to Sri Lanka in the previous match.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even with the dew, if you can get the wicket to dry out, and these wickets are pretty dry, so if the bowler can bowl three deliveries in an over on an area, it&#8217;s much better for the spinner. He has more of a wicket-taking chance compared to the fast bowlers.</p>
<p>&#8220;With dew coming in at the end, the fast bowlers tend to go for plenty of runs. That was the idea in the last game itself. Rohit Sharma had contained them (Sri Lanka) pretty nicely and there I made a decision that we should go with three spinners,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;These guys have a lot of right-handers in the squad as well and Mishra turns to the ball, so I wanted that attacking bowler in the bowling line-up and it almost paid off for us. I think he and Ashwin were the difference in the game today. The way they controlled that situation was magnificent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kohli felt Mishra showed a lot of courage in taking up the challenge he threw at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been really impressed by Amit Mishra. He&#8217;s an attacking bowler, which I like as well. He always likes to make the batsman take on that extra fielder inside the circle. The way he bowled with such a small target to defend I think it was brilliant on his part,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of character he showed, he certainly put his hand up. In the future as well, if we want to play with three spinners or we want to go with the same kind of bowling attack, he would certainly be one of our priorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s brilliant with the ball, turns it on any sort of wicket and today he showed what he could do. I&#8217;m really, really happy for him.&#8221;<br />
Asked why Mishra was not considered for earlier matches, Kohli said: &#8220;Well that&#8217;s one thing you can say now. If he went for 70 in 10 I don&#8217;t think you would have asked me that question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kohli also gave credit to Afridi for his unbeaten 18-ball 34 that proved to be the difference between both the teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has always been big hitter, but we also took a chance that if he mistimes one of Ashwin&#8217;s carrom balls at the end, then we&#8217;ll have a good chance. It was like that, if he had mistimed it, we would have won, and if he hit a good shot the game would have gone the other way.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the plan, that he likes to play his shots and hopefully if one is mistimed and goes to hand then we can have a good chance. It went in the air two or three times, but credit to him, they cleared the boundary well.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000746&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/ambatirayuduapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996942" alt="Ambati Rayudu said the pitches were undoubtedly slow, but as professionals, they should not be complaining (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/ambatirayuduapm.jpg" /></a> Ambati Rayudu said the pitches were undoubtedly slow, but as professionals, they should not be complaining (AP)
<p>Despite the demoralising defeats against <a title="Asia Cup 2014: That man Kumara Sangakkara again" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-that-man-kumara-sangakkara-again/">Sri Lanka</a> and <a title="Asia Cup 2014: After boom boom, India go bust" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-after-boom-boom-india-go-bust/">Pakistan</a>, India middle order batsman Ambati Rayudu put his weight behind stand-in-skipper Virat Kohli and his teammates, saying that the captain as well as the team are putting in as much effort as they could.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been learning a lot from Dhoni bhai. He has been very proactive and did a fantastic job against Pakistan. Although we have been losing, we are putting in a lot of effort,&#8221; Rayudu told reporters on the eve of their last round-robin tie against Afghanistan. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></p>
<p>&#8220;We have been learning a lot as you have seen, the games have been extremely close. We are putting heart into it and that is all we can do as cricketers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>If Bangladesh can pull off an upset win over the defending champions Pakistan on Tuesday, India would have a slight chance of making the finals by registering a bonus point victory over Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would like to go out there tomorrow (Wednesday) and win with a bonus point and see what happens. We are just bothered to go and win with a bonus point. We will analyse it after Tuesday&#8217;s match.</p>
<p>&#8220;They (Afghanistan) are a very good bowling side as we have seen in the competition. We just need to keep our head down and make sure we get runs,&#8221; Rayudu said.</p>
<p><a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Crafty Saeed Ajmal and gritty Ambati Rayudu" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-crafty-saeed-ajmal-and-gritty-ambati-rayudu/" target="_blank">Rayudu struck 58 off 62 balls</a>, as he along with Ravindra Jadeja (52 not out off 49 balls) took India to 245 for eight against Pakistan.</p>
<p>Defending the modest target, India almost had the game in hands before <a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Shahid Afridi, the emir of Mirpur" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-shahid-afridi-the-emir-of-mirpur/" target="_blank">Shahid Afridi smashed two sixes</a> off Ravichandran Ashwin&#8217;s bowling in the final over to win it by one-wicket.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing the best we can, in whatever capacity. It is just we lost the game &#8212; I would say by a metre more than anything else. It&#8217;s unfortunate we are ending up on the losing side,&#8221; insisted Rayudu.</p>
<p>On their back-to-back failures, he said: &#8220;If you look at the pattern of the games, I think all the teams have struggled in the middle overs because the wicket is slower and the ball standing a little bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were wickets falling a bit so we needed to consolidate and at the end of the innings the scores were not 350 but 250. But the matches have gone to last ball. It is not actually we are not scoring or anything. It is same with all the teams,&#8221; explained Rayudu.</p>
<p>He said the pitches were undoubtedly slow, but as professionals, they should not be complaining.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were not expecting a batting-friendly pitch. Whatever the nature of wicket, we are here to play as professionals and we can&#8217;t complain about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Expected to fill into the big shoes of Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina, Rayudu said he would take confidence from his half-century he scores in a pressure game like India-Pakistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m learning in every game. The last game has given me a lot of confidence because I played under a lot of pressure. We lost wickets and India-Pakistan is always played under pressure. I&#8217;m happy I could keep my head down and we could put a total on the board that we almost defended,&#8221; he pointed out.</p>
<p>On Indian slow strike rate up the order, Rayudu said: &#8220;It is always difficult at the top of the order because most of the fielders are inside, not even for singles. In the middle overs, we make sure we get a lot of singles because scoring boundaries has become difficult because of the wicket. That way we are learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about the middle order continuing on a listless show after their series defeats in South Africa and New Zealand, Rayudu said: &#8220;I&#8217;m not too sure about New Zealand but I can talk about Asia Cup. We have been fairly doing well. I suppose the scores we have got on the board are not less by any means.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you know, I&#8217;m sure the games have gone down to last two overs, even last ball. It is just unfortunate that we are ending up as losing side. I&#8217;m sure we are learning. We will be a much better side in the coming days and tournaments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rayudu, who will be replaced by Suresh Raina in the World Twenty20 to be held later this month, wished India luck for the upcoming tournament.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in the T20 team. I am sure, I hope and I pray that we win the tournament.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000653&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graemesmithapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000450" alt="Graeme Smith told teammates after the third day of the ongoing third Test against Australia at his home ground Newlands in Cape Town that he was retiring after the match (AP/File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graemesmithapm.jpg" /></a> Graeme Smith told teammates after the third day of the ongoing third Test against Australia at his home ground Newlands in Cape Town that he was retiring after the match (AP/File)
<p><strong></strong>Graeme Smith announced his sudden retirement from international cricket on Monday, ending the career of the most experienced Test captain and South African cricket&#8217;s savior.</p>
<p>Smith resurrected the team from the match-fixing scandal involving former skipper Hansie Cronje and a disastrous World Cup on home soil in 2003.</p>
<p>Smith, given control of the underperforming and fiercely criticized national team at 22, went on to play over 100 Tests, was captain for more than a decade and established South Africa as the No. 1 Test team in the world, although he couldn&#8217;t end the country&#8217;s long wait for a World Cup title.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been the most difficult decision I have ever had to make in my life,&#8221; Smith said in a statement through Cricket South Africa.</p>
<p>He told teammates after the third day of the ongoing third Test against Australia at his home ground Newlands in Cape Town that he was retiring after the match.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a decision that I have been considering since my ankle surgery in April last year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have a young family to consider, and I felt that retiring at Newlands would be the best way to end it because I have called this place home since I was 18 years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>CSA said it was surprised by Smith&#8217;s announcement but recognized him as &#8220;one of the true legends of the game.&#8221; It follows the sudden announcement by allrounder Jacques Kallis to quit Tests late last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must respect him for deciding to call time,&#8221; CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat said of Smith. &#8220;Knowing him as well as I do, having been instrumental as a selector in appointing him as a young captain, he would not have taken this decision lightly or without a great deal of thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Smith appears to be heading for a defeat against the Australians in his final Test, a result that would end the Proteas&#8217; five-year unbeaten run in Test series.</p>
<p>He will give up all internationals after his 117th Test, against the same opponents and on the same ground where he made his debut almost to the day, on March 8, 2002. He also played 197 one-day internationals, and scored over 9,000 Test runs and 6,989 ODI runs.</p>
<p>Wicketkeeper-batsman AB de Villiers, the one-day captain, will likely be the favorite to take over as Test skipper.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s decision to quit just over two months after the long-serving Kallis announced his retirement on Christmas Day signals a &#8220;new era&#8221; in South African cricket, Lorgat said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been fortunate to have had many highs,&#8221; Smith said, &#8220;amongst them leading and being part of the best Test team in the world. I will cherish these memories for the rest of my life. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I bid my career a fond yet sad farewell.&#8221;</p>
<p>A big, muscular left-handed opening batsman, Smith never was praised for being an elegant player, but he was gritty, single-minded and at times brutish &#8211; all qualities that endeared him to a South African sporting public that like their stars to be tough, above anything else.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always been someone who has left everything out there on the field for my team and for my country,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His double-centuries in back-to-back Tests in England in 2003 and early in his career announced him as a player to be reckoned with, and he had a habit of making big scores when his team had its back to the wall, not least the 90 he hit to set up South Africa&#8217;s world-record score of 438 to win an ODI against Australia in 2006.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like us to remember Graeme for his nerves of steel and his match-winning performances,&#8221; Lorgat said.</p>
<p>Smith has scored 27 Test hundreds and 38 half-centuries at an average of 48.72 with likely one innings to go.</p>
<p>Ahead of the series-deciding third Test, which Australia leads by 234 runs with two days to play, Smith talked of a &#8220;challenging two weeks&#8221; in relation to his personal life and with specific reference to his young daughter. He didn&#8217;t elaborate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I definitely don&#8217;t see myself playing until the age of Kallis or (Sachin) Tendulkar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But hopefully I&#8217;ll know when the time is right.&#8221;<strong></strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000429&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mahesh Bhupathi hasn’t followed standard procedure while launching his star-studded, multi-million dollar International Premier Tennis League (IPTL). By getting players on board, forming teams before revealing the identity of the owners or explaining the business model, he has inverted the pyramid.</p>
<p>His enterprise should be applauded but can he pull this off?</p>
<p>Even though the Big Three — Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray — have committed to the tournament, but questions and doubts remain. Who are the men who have splashed millions, that too behind closed doors, to sign the game’s biggest stars? Does the league have a sustainable business model? Will the stars be available for all matches? The tournament is still eight months away but the lack of transparency at its launch doesn’t give the fans the belief that they might actually see top stars representing their cities year after year.</p>
<p>Player commitment will be the key if the organisers hope to portray this as a serious tournament and not some exhibition league with half-serious celebrities. According to the ground rules, “marquee” players — those who have been world No 1 or won slams — are entitled to pick and choose their appearances, while others will be there for all the three weeks.</p>
<p>Adding to the confusions are the whispers emerging from sidelines of the player draft in Dubai. Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, they say, is unlikely to commit to anything more than a week. And he wouldn’t be part of the traveling circus and is expected to appear only in one city. Nadal and Djokovic too are expected to follow the same schedule.</p>
<p>With no official update, the grapevine has been buzzing. And that’s dangerous for an ambitious start-up. At at time when the Indian Premier League — from which IPTL is directly inspired — is hit by numerous scandals due to cloudy ownership patterns, the organisers should have been more transparent. The league has undeniable potential, but it’ll be interesting to see if Bhupathi can fit the pieces of this puzzle together in time for his winter premiere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/andreaggasiapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000422" alt="Andre Agassi was selected for Singapore along with Serena Williams and Czech Tomas Berdych (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/andreaggasiapm.jpg" /></a> Andre Agassi was selected for Singapore along with Serena Williams and Czech Tomas Berdych (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Andre Agassi will snub the inaugural International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) if it clashes with Thanksgiving, the former world number one said the day after being signed up by the Singapore franchise.</span></p>
<p>The eight-times grand slam champion was named in Sunday&#8217;s player draft for the new Asia-based event but said he had since learned the first match would clash with the November holiday. “It&#8217;s a good thing to take tennis to places in the world where they want to see it. There&#8217;s no downside in doing that,” American Agassi said ahead of his World Tennis Day showdown with former arch-rival Pete Sampras in London later on Monday. “My agreement to do it was based on a few very specific conditions. Certainly economics played a little part in it but also time away played another part.</p>
<p>“I can&#8217;t be away for more than four or five days so I set some limitations and had some dates in December. “Now I read in an email that the dates are over Thanksgiving,” said the 43-year-old Agassi who is married to former women&#8217;s world number one Steffi Graf and has two children. “That would be a non-starter. Six or seven days away is too much of a price to pay,” he said.</p>
<p>The draft for the IPTL set up by Indian doubles specialist Mahesh Bhupathi saw the four teams &#8211; Singapore, Dubai, Bangkok and Mumbai &#8211; bid for players. Organisers said a total of $24 million was spent.</p>
<p>Agassi was selected for Singapore along with Serena Williams and Czech Tomas Berdych while 14-times major winner Sampras is set to join Rafa Nadal in the Mumbai team. Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic head up the Bangkok and Dubai squads.</p>
<p><strong>Sampras in dark</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Fellow American Sampras also appeared slightly in the dark on Monday. “It&#8217;s happened in the last 24 hours,” he said. “I&#8217;ve just been in talks with them and I&#8217;m excited to be a part of it. It&#8217;s a big endeavour by the guys who are putting the whole thing together.“It&#8217;s not an easy thing to do though and we&#8217;ll have to see how it all plays out in the next weeks. I&#8217;ll get more details when I get home.”Sampras said he would never have entertained the idea of playing in the competition when he was at his peak. “I didn&#8217;t have a lot of time off so it would have been a tricky thing to commit to,” explained the 42-year-old American. “It&#8217;s a long journey to Asia and I&#8217;m not sure how it would have played out for me. That was my time off.”</p>
<p>The IPTL is scheduled to begin in Singapore on November 28, the day after Thanksgiving, and a week after the Davis Cup final.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000098&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/parverasooliem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1957952 " alt="Parvez Rasool made 47 but J&amp;K's 199/9 was insufficient against Punjab (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/parverasooliem.jpg" /></a> Parvez Rasool made 47 but J&amp;K&#8217;s 199/9 was insufficient against Punjab (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Parvez Rasool, the Jammu and Kashmir skipper, was disappointed with the manner in which he was dismissed on Monday. Taruwar Kohli at midwicket didn’t spill the chance after Rasool’s soft jab against Harbhajan Singh headed his way. Rasool’s dismissal brought an end to the 85-run partnership between him and Ian Dev Singh for the fourth wicket. This was a crucial stand given that J&amp;K had lost three wickets for just seven runs in 5.5 overs. </span></p>
<p>The Jamia Milia track was on the slower side and the key to batting well was patience. Rasool was clear about the way he wanted to approach the innings. He defended when the bowlers found a tight line and length, but when width was on offer he attempted to pierce the in-field.</p>
<p>Rasool’s positive intent paid off when he struck Siddarth Kaul for two boundaries early in his innings. In the next over he square cut Manpreet Gony for his third boundary.</p>
<p>The run rate climbed from under two to over three. With Rasool trying to step on the pedal at every opportunity, at the other end Ian Dev could take his time to build his innings.</p>
<p>“As a senior, it is my responsibility to make my teammates play according to the situation. I used to be a batsman before eventually taking up off-spin also. Having batted at No.4 all through, I have played in different situations. Today, I wanted to take the pressure off my team. However, I couldn’t execute plans. Firstly, I got out at a crucial juncture and then Ian’s wicket pushed us to the wall,” Rasool said.</p>
<p>During the Rasool-Singh partnership of 85, only 38 runs were scored in boundaries. The remaining 54 came through ones and twos. “When you lose wickets early, even ones and twos can do the job for you. I have been doing this the entire Ranji Trophy season. As you settle down, it is easy to change gears,” Rasool added.</p>
<p>However, Rasool couldn’t produce a knock that would put J &amp; K in a strong position. Even against Delhi in the opening game, Rasool was dismissed on 30 at a time when his team was still in sight of an upset win. On Monday, Rasool got a life when on 39 he mistimed a lofted shot and Manan Vohra dropped a sitter off Harbhajan at deep mid wicket in the 21st over. After adding another eight runs to his individual score, Rasool was dismissed.</p>
<p>Shortly, Ian Dev played a poor shot on 50. Even though Hardeep Singh and Samiulllah Beigh tried to revive the innings, J &amp; K were bowled out for 199.</p>
<p>Rasool felt that he didn’t deliver on the day. “If I had stayed at the wicket for a longer period, we would have ended up in a much stronger position,” Rasool said.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> J &amp; K 199 for 9 in 50 overs ( ID Singh 50, Parvez Rasool 47; MS Grewal 3/28, Harbhajan Singh 3/49); Punjab 200/2 in 37 overs ( M Vohra 89, M Singh 76, R Punia 1/24)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000094&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/balbir-singh-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992581" alt="Since I was the chief coach, the director of the camp, if I wanted, I could have assembled a team of only Punjabis. But the country comes first." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/balbir-singh-480.jpg" /></a> Since I was the chief coach, the director of the camp, if I wanted, I could have assembled a team of only Punjabis. But the country comes first.
<p><em>In the final part of this Walk the Talk on NDTV 24X7, veteran hockey player Balbir Singh Senior tells The Indian Express Editor-in-Chief Shekhar Gupta about the 1975 World Cup that he won as coach, welcomes the Hockey India League and laments the decline of hockey as a popular sport.</em></p>
<p><strong>Your strength is that you don’t complain, you are very positive. You don’t complain about astro-turf and modern rules. In fact, you won India a World Cup on astro-turf in 1975, in the age of modern hockey. Tell us about that.</strong><br />
The preparatory camp for the World Cup had been set up on Panjab University campus, where we were given every facility. I was the chief coach and manager then. However, within the first few days of the camp, my father passed away. I took a day’s leave for the cremation and completed his last rites only after winning the World Cup.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>It is believed that India has not seen a team like the one you assembled in 1975. I mean, we haven’t had full-backs like Surjit Singh and Michael Kindo. They were so cool headed. And then there was Ajit Pal Singh as the centre-half. He was the captain too. And at the front line-up you had Shivaji Pawar, V J Phillips, H J S Chimni&#8230;</strong><br />
Since I was the chief coach, the director of the camp, if I wanted, I could have assembled a team of only Punjabis. But the country comes first.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>And I believe you told all your players to think of the team as an Army regiment.</strong><br />
I had even set up a common prayer. Also coined a new slogan: Jo bole so hai, Bharat mata ki jai. The new slogan was important because I wanted to ensure that the team had a pan-India presence to it. The kids (players) also liked it. And we put up a united front. That was the time my wife was unwell, she was in coma&#8230; Because I had stayed with teams before, I knew that the boys used to sneak out at night. So, to control that situation, I asked the hotel management to allot us a separate wing. I would place my chair at the entrance and guard the wing to ensure no one went out at night.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>During the World Cup, the defenders — Surjit and Michael — were the team’s strong points. They were like a fortress. Always cool and composed and with perfect recovery of the ball. And yet, in the final match, you brought in Aslam Sher Khan and he scored a penalty.</strong><br />
We brought in Aslam because I was slightly worried that with the Pakistanis abusing players, there was a chance that Kindo may get scared. Also, if I hadn’t let Aslam play, it would have seemed the decision was taken because he is a Muslim.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>In fact, this was the same thing that happened with Inam-ur- Rehman, one of our finest forwards.</strong><br />
Yes, exactly. I wanted him to play. Before the match, I went with Aslam to the Royal Mosque in Kuala Lumpur where he offered namaz. Once the namaz was over, the qazi came to us and said, ‘You are a Sikh, and yet you are in a mosque.’ I told him that I am a follower of Guru Nanak, and according to him, there is only one god who is everywhere. So the qazi blessed us with success. When we turned around, the Pakistan team had lined up to offer their prayers. After we won, some of my friends in the (Pakistan) team joked that we won because we had prayed to god before them. After the win, my wife was discharged from hospital. When she came home, I handed her the trophy and she was very proud.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell us something more about that team.</strong><br />
Ajit Pal was the captain and he performed very well.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes, in fact, he married India’s greatest woman basketball player, Kiran Grewal.</strong><br />
Virender (Singh) was the right-half of Railways. Phillips was right-out and Ashok Kumar, Dhyan Chand’s son, was at the centre. I had asked Ashok not to carry the ball at all. I told him that if he dribbled, I would throw him out and Dada’s (Dhyan Chand) reputation would be tarnished. I asked him to dodge and pass. And he even scored a goal.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>He had scored from a rather tough angle.</strong><br />
Yes, it was a very good goal. It is important to keep the players pumped up and enthusiastic. Also, before leaving for the World Cup, Mrs Gandhi had asked if I would be able to take care of the team. She wanted to ensure that I wouldn’t get involved in (hockey) politics and control the team. I assured her that I would (take care of the team).<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>It is the same old story with Indian hockey. The Indian Hockey Federation and Hockey India still run the sport. How do you feel about that?</strong><br />
It is rather unfortunate that there are two groups. I always request them to come together as one. It will be good for the country and for the team. I request them to come together and help each other.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The state of hockey is very poor. This is Chandigarh, so you still see a few children taking interest. When we were children studying in Punjab, it was necessary to carry hockey sticks to school, irrespective of whether we knew how to play. And now, Delhi University has removed the game from its sports quota. How do you feel about that?</strong><br />
It is very unfortunate. Once, I had gone to Amritsar from Chandigarh to receive someone at the border. And there was not a single person or child who had a hockey stick in his hand. Everyone was playing cricket. I want our country to do well in cricket, it is everyone’s favourite game. But when we lose in hockey, it hurts me.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sachin Tendulkar was awarded Bharat Ratna. Did you ever feel that you or Dhyan Chand deserved it too? I mean there are not that many people who have won three Olympic gold medals.</strong><br />
What can I say? Our job was to play well. We did that and won the medals. The rest is up to god.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>In the modern-day game, drag-flicks are being used increasingly to score goals. What is your take on that?</strong><br />
In my time, there was no drag-flicking. However, I used to stop the ball myself and shoot in the same motion for long corners. I was known for the technique.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>But these days, in the drag-flick, the ball rises high and also moves at a great speed. Don’t you think it is unfair?</strong><br />
The goal keeper is protected, wears a helmet. But if the ball hits any other player, there could be serious injuries.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The ball moves at over 200 km per hour.</strong><br />
Yes, very dangerous.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>This is almost one-and-a-half times as Mitchell Johnson bowling at his fastest. And with no helmets&#8230;</strong><br />
Yes, either everybody wears protective gear or they devise a technique for drag-flicks. Players should learn how to dodge the goalie and score.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>When you watch matches these days, do you get scared — that somebody does a drag flick, the ball hits a player and proves fatal?</strong> It’s more dangerous than a cricket ball&#8230;<br />
Yes, it’s like a bullet.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think the Hockey India League is good for Indian hockey?</strong><br />
The Indian League is good for the players. The more practice they get, the better it is. They are getting to play a lot of matches, getting to play with international players.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>And they are being paid. At least they won’t have to clean stables to make money.</strong><br />
I have come up with a reliable hockey scheme. You should have a look at it. I have tried to contact the minister of sports (for the scheme), but he hasn’t given me an appointment yet. He could be a royal, I am an ordinary man with an idea for the game.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>No one is more royal than you are. You have three Olympic gold medals and a world record to your name. The world record has lasted 61 years.</strong><br />
Balbirs come, Balbirs go, India stays forever.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You are three years older than Mr L K Advani and fitter than him. And you are always so positive. How do you manage that?</strong><br />
It is all thanks to my well-wishers. When people wish me well, it makes me stronger and keeps me going. You interviewed me today and spoke well of me. This will add five years to my life.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>So then we must interview you again on your 100th birthday. Hopefully, by then, India will have won another medal.</strong><br />
Well, it is necessary for India to win a medal now. When I had gone to London, people there praised me and my team a lot. They asked me if India would win a medal. As much as I wanted it to win the gold, I knew the team was not in a state to do so. I had prayed for the team to finish at least fifth or sixth. I would have been very happy. But they finished twelfth. Also, the foreign coaches are very good. I am not against them.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>But you think they are overqualified?</strong><br />
I feel our players are not at that level where they can benefit from foreign coaches, not up to that standard. (Foreign coaches) are overqualified for us.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>I know exactly what you are talking about. I had interviewed Ric Charlesworth on this show. He left a frustrated man. The players too were frustrated with him.</strong><br />
Exactly. Ideally, the foreign coaches should teach the Indian coaches. Often, the players don’t understand what the foreign coaches are trying to say, because of the language barrier. If they can’t understand the language, how will they benefit from the coaching? That is why it is important that the players are coached in a language that they understand.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>So our next conversation will either be when India wins a medal, or when you turn 100.</strong><br />
With well-wishers like you&#8230;<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a fan.</strong><br />
Right now, I am at that stage in life, what we in hockey call ‘extra time’. The golden goal, the final stage, is yet to come. My opponent at the golden goal is the Almighty and I can’t stop him from scoring the golden goal.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Decision was taken by the AIBA executive committee after the evaluation and assessment of the Indian body’s progress.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000085&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">In a major setback to the suspended Indian Amatuer Boxing Federation (IABF), the world body AIBA decided to end any official relationship with it. The AIBA said that only the formation of a new national federation had the potential to change its stand. </span></p>
<p>“As AIBA President and on behalf of the entire boxing family, I am expressing my deepest regret and sadness that we had to make this decision”, stated Dr Ching-Kuo Wu in a statement issued on Monday evening. “AIBA has always regarded India as one of the most important members of its family, but it has become impossible for us to bear the hard feelings, the pain and suffering the boxers as well as the boxing family in India had to go through under the past and recent leadership, which has also been damaging the image, reputation and interest of our sport in the country,” added Wu.</p>
<p>The decision was taken by the AIBA executive committee after the evaluation and assessment of the Indian body’s progress since its suspension in December 2012 and Monday’s decision came after the IABF has failed to hold its Annual General meeting and elections. Earlier last month, when Indian Olympic Association’s suspension was lifted by IOC, there was hope that AIBA would also lift the suspension on IABF.</p>
<p>But the world body stated on Monday that it received different claims from various groups in India and it became totally impossible for AIBA to make a proper judgement in case of IABF.</p>
<p>“It is believed that the only way to get the sport of boxing back on track in India would be for it to be left in the hands of trustful, clean and honest people who love boxing. We have to give the opportunity to any group of people with passion and love for our sport to submit applications for the establishment of a new National Federation. AIBA will, however, not tolerate any governmental or sports authority interference in this process.” stated Wu in the statement.</p>
<p>As per the latest decision, the IABF is now provisionally exluded from AIBA membership in accordance with article 18.2 of the AIBA Statutes.</p>
<p><strong>Playing under AIBA flag</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Meanwhile the boxers and coaches will be authorised to participate at any competition under the AIBA flag. AIBA also stated that it will now wait for requests by any organisation or person to submit an application and once contacted, the world body will give the full guidelines for the new application process.</p>
<p>“Despite AIBA warnings, the current federation ignored the matter and failed to organise the Annual General Meeting. A lot of state units did not correspond with the current federation and the situation got worse. After the current development, we will now wait for those who come forward to stake the claim for the new federation,”stated an official of a state unit of IABF.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000085&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sainanehwalfilem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000377 " alt="" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sainanehwalfilem.jpg" /></a> Saina Nehwal starts out against Scottish Kirsty Gilmour (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">As such, the All England is just one of five Super Series Premier tournaments on the annual badminton circuit. With a total prize purse of USD 400,000 it isn’t even the richest, with Asia’s badminton-crazy and skyscraping hypercities from Korea, China and Indonesia leaving Birmingham’s National Indoor Arena far behind on sweepstakes that are on offer for its champions. Yet, Indians tend to go all mushy on the All England year after year, after Prakash Padukone and Pullela Gopichand gave the country two of its finest sporting memories winning the prestigious trophy in the last three decades.</span></p>
<p>The All England though, has remained an elusive mirage for India’s most successful badminton player &#8211; Saina Nehwal, a summit two steps too far for the Olympic bronze medallist. Nehwal’s made two semifinals there, but never really had a sniff at the actual title, outwitted by a fair margin on both occasions.</p>
<p>Indians head to the 2014 edition starting Tuesday with one of the strongest set of challengers in singles &#8211; ranking-wise. But with indifferent form dogging the lot of them, this year’s edition might well again dissipate into an unproductive outing for the four young shuttlers.</p>
<p><strong>Starting troubles</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>An unprecedented two in the Top 10 of women’s singles (Nehwal at No 7, and PV Sindhu at No 9) means there is strength in numbers and the probability of a podium, literally, doubles. Yet, both girls were staring at lacklustre season-beginnings, until Nehwal picked the Syed Modi GP Gold earlier in the year &#8211; her first title in over a year.</p>
<p>Nehwal starts out against Scottish Kirsty Gilmour (which gives her a good look-in against a probable Commonwealth Games opponent), not a particularly stiff opponent. But she will be well and truly tested against the likes of Eriko Hirose or Shixian Wang, who are known to drag her into marathon matches accompanied with their wily mental-games.</p>
<p>Sindhu, battling in the same half of the draw as her, first comes up against Chinese 6-footer Sun Yu and it will be as fascinating a face-off as a new generation Indo-Chinese rivalry will allow. She might have an angry Yihan Wang awaiting her next, given the last time they met, the Indian 18-year-old snatched the Chinese shuttler’s podium at the Worlds.</p>
<p>In men’s singles, India’s best are pitted against Japan’s leading challengers, with World No 18 P Kashyap facing former All England finalist and fifth seed Kenichi Tago, and K Srikanth (No 21) up against unseeded Kento Momota. Their paths of progress are littered with the likes of Jan O Jorgensen and Pengyu Du, though both would concede there’s no easy rounds at an event like the All England. For Srikanth debuting at the hallowed venue and having enjoyed a breakthrough year last season, the All-England could be the perfect platform to grab global attention should he notch a few upsets here.</p>
<p>Anand Pawar heads the list of qualifiers who’ll attempt to go past Tuesday and enter the main draw, though considerable attention will be on the women’s doubles pairing of Jwala Gutta-Ashwini Ponappa &#8211; heading to All England in what is their first big tournament since reuniting. The former World Championship bronze medallists will start in the qualifiers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000083&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajitchandilam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000391" alt="Ajit Chandila (FIle)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajitchandilam.jpg" /></a> Ajit Chandila (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has summoned former Rajasthan Royals off-spinner Ajit Chandila to appear before its disciplinary committee in New Delhi on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Chandila is among the players who have been found guilty of spot-fixing, according to the internal report of Ravi Sawani &#8211; the BCCI’s anti-corruption unit chief &#8211; but he is the only one who has not received a sanction yet.</p>
<p>The reason for the delay is because Chandila was the last of the players to get bail in the IPL spot-fixing case and hence could not appear before Sawani. Also, though Chandila was out on bail since the second week of September, the BCCI’s disciplinary committee couldn’t fix a date for the off spinner to appear before it because the members of the committee were ‘busy’.</p>
<p>It is learnt that Sawani has recommended a ban between five years to life for Chandila as has been found guilty of violating multiple anti-corruption clauses. The disciplinary committee is likely to impose a life ban on Chandila.</p>
<p>“We have asked Chandila to appear before the disciplinary committee on Wednesday. Sawani has found him guilty and has advised strict action against him,” a BCCI official told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>Sawani’s report indicated that Chandila had influenced other players to indulge in spot-fixing. He is also accused of passing vital team information to the bookies. Based on Sawani’s report, the BCCI’s disciplinary committee banned Rajasthan Royals players &#8211; S Sreesanth and Ankeet Chavan for life, and Siddharth Trivedi for 12 months. A former player Amit Singh was banned for five years</p>
<p><strong>Election dates </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It is reliably learnt that a few BCCI officials will be meeting home ministry officials on Tuesday to ascertain the exact dates of the general elections. The Indian board is keen to conduct the second half of the IPL at home once the elections are over. “We will be getting exact dates by Tuesday so that we can fix the schedule,” a source said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000080&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Ravi Bopara and captain Stuart Broad put on 58 unbroken runs to guide England to a nerve-jangling, three-wicket victory over West Indies in the second One-day International in North Sound, Antigua on Sunday. Bopara, 38 not out, and Broad, 28 not out, combined in a patient stand for the eighth wicket as England reached 163 for seven in 44.5 overs in reply to the West Indies total of 159 all out at the Vivian Richards Cricket Ground.</span></p>
<p>England levelled the three-game series at 1-1, having lost the opener at the same venue on Friday by 15 runs despite a superb 106 from Michael Lumb on his ODI debut. On a slow pitch England lost opener Moeen Ali for 10 and Luke Wright for a duck, with only 30 runs on the board, before Lumb (39) and Joe Root (23) orchestrated something of a recovery with a third-wicket stand of 49 in 13 overs.</p>
<p>Lumb was then dismissed leg before wicket as he played across the line to a quicker delivery from left-arm spinner Nikita Miller. Just four overs later, England had slipped to 89 for six as Root, Ben Stokes (four) and Jos Buttler (no score) also departed.</p>
<p>Bopara and Tim Bresnan mounted a mini-fightback, adding 16 runs before Bresnan was run out for 10, but it was Bopara and Broad who spared England blushes as they doggedly overhauled the West Indies target with 31 balls remaining.</p>
<p>Earlier, Lendl Simmons provided the backbone in a mediocre West Indies batting display, hitting four boundaries and two sixes in 98 balls as he top-scored with a fluent 70. He dominated partnerships of 51, for the fourth wicket with Darren Bravo (13), and 52, for the fifth wicket with Dwayne Bravo (20), before he departed in the 38th over.</p>
<p>Attempting to loft the left-arm spin of Stephen Parry over the infield, Simmons holed out to Stokes at deep midwicket for West Indies to slip to 145 for six.</p>
<p>Parry, making his ODI debut, picked up two more wickets as the West Indies innings quickly folded, finishing with a return of three for 32 in his 10 overs. The three-game series finishes at the same venue on Wednesday before West Indies host England in three Twenty20 internationals in Barbados.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> WI 159 in 44.2 overs (L Simmons 70, Dwayne Bravo 20, Stephen Parry 3/32, Joe Root 2/15, James Tredwell 2/39) lost to England 163/7 in 44.5 overs (Michael Lumb 39, Ravi Bopara 38*, Stuart Broad 28*, Nikita Miller 2/28, Dwayne Bravo 2/41)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000072&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mitchelljohnsonapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000345" alt="Mitchell Johnson combined pace and aggression to raise his series tally to 19 wickets in five innings (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mitchelljohnsonapm.jpg" /></a> Mitchell Johnson combined pace and aggression to raise his series tally to 19 wickets in five innings (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Australia took a firm grip on the third Test as seamers Mitchell Johnson and Ryan Harris snared seven wickets between them to bowl South Africa out for 287 on day three Monday at Newlands. While Johnson combined pace and aggression to raise his series tally to 19 wickets in five innings, Harris found reverse swing to claim three key wickets as South Africa conceded a first-innings deficit of 207.</span></p>
<p>Faf du Plessis and Alviro Petersen were the only batsmen to score half-centuries for South Africa, who were bowled out within a day after Michael Clarke declared Australia’s first innings on its overnight total of 494-7.</p>
<p>Clarke elected not to enforce the follow-on, and Australia advanced to 27 without loss at stumps to take an overall lead of 234 runs with two days to play. South Africa will need something special to avoid defeat in the series decider.</p>
<p>Australia’s decision to declare overnight after a session and a half was lost to rain on Day 2 proved a good one, as their seamers found early movement. Johnson would claim 4-42 off 19 overs and Harris 3-63 off 22. In the fifth over Harris had captain Graeme Smith caught behind for 5 by Brad Haddin, who was soon in action again to take a spectacular one-handed grab after James Pattinson found the inside edge of Dean Elgar’s bat who got out for 11.</p>
<p><strong>Role reversal</strong></p>
<p>Opener Alviro Petersen showed signs of a return to form as he hit eight fours in his 53, but then feathered a legside delivery from Johnson through to Haddin. However, the biggest blow to South Africa came in the dismissal of Hashim Amla, as Harris found reverse swing to bend one through the batsman’s defenses shortly before the lunch break. Amla got out for 38.</p>
<p>“I must be honest, I was really surprised to see the ball reverse — I think it was 27 overs when the ball started reversing,” Du Plessis said. “Especially after rain and a wet outfield, I was really surprised at that.”</p>
<p>Reverse swing has been a controversial topic in the series after David Warner suggested South Africa used illegal practices to obtain it in their victory in the second Test, but Johnson insisted there was nothing untoward this time.</p>
<p>“We’d seen enough to bowl cross-seam and keep a good shine on the ball,” he said. “Once we saw that the ball wasn’t swinging normally we did that straight away, so we’re not surprised that it went.’’</p>
<p>After lunch, Johnson had AB de Villiers caught at second slip on 14, then Harris induced an edge from Duminy on 4 to give Haddin his fourth catch of the innings. Australia’s position could have become even better, but Haddin missed the opportunity to stump Du Plessis off the bowling of Nathan Lyon, who then saw the batsman put down at short leg two deliveries later.</p>
<p>Du Plessis went on to score 67 and put on a 95-run partnership with Vernon Philander, but after tea he pushed at a Johnson delivery and was caught at second slip.</p>
<p>Philander stuck around for an unbeaten 37, but aside from seeing Dale Steyn hit a quick 28, he found little support before the second new ball became available to allow Australia to clean up South Africa’s tail.</p>
<p>In the six overs left in the day, Australia opener Warner smacked Morne Morkel for 24 runs to be 25 not out.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores (Stumps Day 3):  </strong>Australia 1st innings 494/7 dec,</p>
<p>South Africa 1st innings 287 in 82.5 overs ( F Du Plesiss 67,A Petersen 53,H Amla 38; M Johnson 4/42, R Harris 3/63),<br />
Australia 2nd innings 27/0 in 6 overs ( D Warner 25 not out, C Rogers 1, K Abbott 0/2) at Newlands in Cape Town. Australia lead by 234 runs.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Kumar Sangakkara once again came good with a 102-ball 76 while skipper Angelo Mathews provided the late charge, scoring 45 off 41 balls, as Sri Lanka beat Afghanistan by 129 runs to secure a place in the Asia Cup final.</span></p>
<p>Afghanistan were soaring high after their upset win over the hosts just two days ago. Monday, they were brought down to earth by a much a better team.</p>
<p>Facing a quality bowling attack, Afghanistan, chasing 254 to win, struggled against Thisara Perera’s pace and Ajantha Mendis’s guile. And unlike their match against Bangladesh, there were no late order resolve today. The end came quickly as the minnows lost their last five wickets for just three runs. The collapse gave their rivals a bonus point.</p>
<p>“It’s the inexperience. We were playing against a world-class bowling and fielding,” Afghanistan coach Kabir Khan said.</p>
<p>They had, however, started promisingly. Sri Lanka won the toss and decided to bat first on a slow Sher-e-Bangla Stadium wicket. Only 35 runs were scored in the mandatory powerplay overs and Sri Lanka had already lost opener Lahiru Thirimanne, who was cleaned up by left-arm seamer Shapoor Zadran.</p>
<p>Ten runs were scored in the 11th over but Afghanistan conceded nothing in their next two. They were creating pressure and Kusal Perera succumbed to it as he played a Mirwais Ashraf ball on to the stumps.</p>
<p>It provided Mahela Jayawardene with an opportunity to return to form, but the veteran batsman got out playing a loose shot off Ashraf. Once again the onus was on Sangakkara to get his team out of the crisis, and he did that, following up his fifty and hundred against Pakistan and India, respectively, with another half-century.</p>
<p>Afghanistan came back strongly, dismissing Dinesh Chandimal and Sangakkara inside three balls, the former bowled by left-arm spinner Hamza Hotak. Suddenly, at 158 for five in the 38th over, Sri Lanka were in trouble. However, Mathews played a calculated innings and helping his side reach a winning total.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Sri Lanka 253/6 in 50 overs (K Sangakkara 76, A Mathews 45*; Mirwais Ashraf 2/29) beat Afghanistan 124 all out (Md Nabi 37, A Stanikzai 27; Ajantha Mendis 3/11, Thisara Perera 3/29) by 129 runs</p>
<p><strong>Pak face Bangla</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A rejuvenated Pakistan will look to seal a berth in the title clash as they lock horns with beleaguered hosts Bangladesh in their last round-robin match on Tuesday. The top two teams qualify for the summit clash and Pakistan, having collected nine points from three appearances, will go into the match as favourites.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dineshkarthikappm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000334" alt="Dinesh Karthik has gone into the Asia Cup without many games under his belt (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dineshkarthikappm.jpg" /></a> Dinesh Karthik has gone into the Asia Cup without many games under his belt (AP)
<p>Even though Dinesh Karthik wasn’t at his best in the last two games of the Asia Cup, I have no doubt he is India’s second best wicket-keeper at the moment after MS Dhoni. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></p>
<p>We should not forget that he had an excellent Champions Trophy last year and has justified his place in the squad whenever he has been given an opportunity. It is not easy for him to go out there and perform, especially when you know that the team’s skipper is also a wicket-keeper.</p>
<p>Dinesh has gone into the Asia Cup without many games under his belt recently and it has reflected in his performances. He missed two crucial stumping in the last two games, which proved to be costly for the team. The only flaw that I can notice in his game is that Dinesh is finding it tough to keep his eye on the ball.</p>
<p>After the ball is pitched, he sometimes takes his eyes off the ball even before it reaches him. It is very important for any wicket-keeper to keep an eye on the ball till the last moment.</p>
<p>It is not easy to collect the deliveries which are pitched outside the leg stump. It is easy for people to criticise him for not being able to collect the ball but they should realise that sometimes a keeper gets blinded because of the batsman in front of him. It’s very tough to know where the ball has pitched.</p>
<p>We should also take into consideration the way pitches have behaved in Bangladesh. It keeps too low sometimes and there is slight turn, which makes it even more difficult for wicket-keepers to get their body behind the ball.</p>
<p>The two misses will surely be playing on Dinesh’s mind but he should not dwell on it much. These things happen. It is important that he learns from these incidents and starts afresh. I still believe he is an outstanding cricketer and will be back at his best soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dineshkarthikm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000324" alt="Playing in the tournament only because MS Dhoni sat out, Dinesh Karthik has made only 29 runs in three innings (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dineshkarthikm.jpg" /></a> Playing in the tournament only because MS Dhoni sat out, Dinesh Karthik has made only 29 runs in three innings (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Ajinkya Rahane has an experience of 26 One-day Internationals. His scores, staring from the bilateral series against South Africa in December, read: 8, 7, 36, 3, 3, 2, 73, 22, 23. He has just one half century and has wasted three starts. Rahane, who batted at No.4 in the <a title="Asia Cup 2014: After boom boom, India go bust" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-after-boom-boom-india-go-bust/" target="_blank">narrow loss against Pakistan</a> at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, is a young batsman trying to find his feet in international cricket. </span></p>
<p><a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Crafty Saeed Ajmal and gritty Ambati Rayudu" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-crafty-saeed-ajmal-and-gritty-ambati-rayudu/" target="_blank">Ambati Rayudu batted at No.5 and made 58</a>, a notable innings considering it came in his first match against Pakistan. But Rayudu has played only nine ODIs. His half-century against Misbah-ul-Haq’s team was his second-best score after his unbeaten 63 against Zimbabwe. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></p>
<p><a title="Dinesh isn’t keeping eyes on the ball" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/dinesh-isnt-keeping-eyes-on-the-ball/" target="_blank">Wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik</a> has played 70 One-day Internationals but this number has been accumulated over nearly 10 years. At No.6, he made 23 off 46 balls at a strike rate of 50. Karthik’s opportunities have been limited in the past. He is at the Asia Cup because MS Dhoni has been rested.</p>
<p>Rahane and Rayudu are playing at the Asia Cup because the selectors have been prepared to given them an opportunity and look beyond Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh, who have played a combined total of 482 ODIs.</p>
<p>The Indian team playing the Asia Cup is relatively inexperienced. The bowling department too is thin on experience.</p>
<p>Fast bowler Varun Aaron has only played a handful of matches after returning from an injury lay-off. His international experience is limited to just eight ODIs and one Test.</p>
<p><strong>One win in 10 matches</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>India now have won just once in their last 10 completed One-day Internationals. They lost the ODI series in South Africa and New Zealand in tougher batting conditions. And now being virtually knocked out of the Asia Cup in home-like conditions would be a cause of alarm if the inexperience of the side and the fact that the selectors have decided to give talented youngsters a bit of international exposure is not taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Virat Kohli spoke about the inexperience in the side after the loss against Pakistan on Sunday.</p>
<p>“If you compare the experience of our team with them, it’s massive. It’s huge. And in international cricket it really counts a lot. You can get away with it in T20, but in the 50-over format, you need to show a lot of character,” Kohli said.</p>
<p>The composition of India’s World T20 side will be different. Both Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina have been included for the shortest format. Dhoni will be back to lead the side.</p>
<p>So by giving the younger players a break in the 50-over format, the selectors are getting a better look at them with the World Cup less than a year away. India have a massive year ahead, starting with the World T20 and culminating in the World Cup.</p>
<p>Yuvraj Singh has struggled since his return after overcoming lung cancer. He has struggled against the pace of Mitchell Johnson and Dale Steyn. Suresh Raina had to be given the message that he must stop taking his place for granted. The southpaw is expected to return stronger if he learns from his mistakes.</p>
<p>“Yuvraj still is a match-winner in the shorter format and must go to the World Cup,” says Sourav Ganguly.</p>
<p>In fact, Yuvraj strongly figures in the selectors’ scheme of things for the showpiece event as well and good performances in the World T20 and IPL will help him make a come back to the 50-overs format. The same holds good for Raina.</p>
<p>Without having enough matches under their belt, the Rahanes and the Rayudus will find it almost impossible to step into the big shoes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000055&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sri.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999905" alt="Sri Lankan players celebrate their win over Afghanistan during the Asia Cup one-day international cricket match in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Monday, March 3, 2014.

<p>Ajantha Mendis and Thisara Perera snared six wickets and Kumar Sangakkara hit a half century as Sri Lanka reached the Asia Cup final with a 129-run win over Afghanistan on Monday. Mendis took 3-11 off his unorthodox spin and Perera bowled a miserly 10-over spell for his 3-29 to get Afghanistan out for 124 with more than 11 overs to spare after Sangakkara&#8217;s 76 off 102 balls had lifted Sri Lanka to 253-6.</p>
<p>After their third successive victory, Sri Lanka booked Saturday&#8217;s final berth with 13 points, including a bonus point after their emphatic win on Monday.  Captain Mohammad Nabi top scored for Afghanistan with 37 but in a dramatic collapse the team lost its last five wickets for only three runs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a very important game for us because we had to book our place in the final,&#8221; said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, who scored a vital unbeaten 45 off 41 balls to propel the total. &#8220;They have a very good bowling attack and our batsmen found it hard, it was a slow pitch, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Afghanistan had made its mark in its maiden appearance at the biennial tournament when it defeated host Bangladesh, but the team&#8217;s batsmen struggled to negotiate both seam and spin of Sri Lanka on a slow wicket.</p>
<p>Asghar Stanikazi showed a bit of spark by hitting five boundaries in his 27 before the innings crumbled against Perera and Mendis.<br />
Nabi and Najibullah Zadran (11) put on 48 runs for the sixth wicket stand before spinner Chaturanga de Silva (2-29) and Mendis polished off the innings in quick time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We bowled brilliantly in the first 35 overs and Sangakkara played very well,&#8221; Nabi said. &#8220;We started well with the bat, but then Mendis bowled brilliantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier, Sangakkara, who made a half century against Pakistan and a century against India in Sri Lanka&#8217;s previous two victories, held the innings together by hitting six fours and a six against some tidy bowling.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing guaranteed in cricket, you can be in fine form, but it takes only one ball for you to get out, so you have to enjoy while it goes well,&#8221; Sangakkara said.</p>
<p>Afghanistan had restricted Sri Lanka at 171-5 by the 40th over when Dinesh Chandimal (28) was clean bowled and Sangakkara was run out in successive overs before Mathews put on 69 runs with Thisara Perera off 49 balls.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a tough wicket to bat on, so we had to spend some time to build a foundation,&#8221; Sangakkara said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t take anything for granted, the Afghan team played very well, they exploited the pitch very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s top order also struggled on a dual paced wicket after Mathews won the toss and elected to bat first.</p>
<p>Left-arm fast bowler Shapoor Zadran had Lahiru Thirimanne&#8217;s leg stump uprooted off a delivery which swung in on the left-hander and Kusal Perera played onto Ashraf&#8217;s delivery back onto his stumps.</p>
<p>Offspinner Nabi conceded only seven runs in his first four overs and also deployed eight bowlers within the first 26 overs that kept the scoring rate under check.</p>
<p>Jayawardene&#8217;s poor run of form continued when he was well caught by Nabi at mid-on before Sangakkara and Chandimal put on 74 runs off 93 balls to put the innings back on track.</p>
<p>Afghanistan struck through left-arm spinner Hamza Hotak in the second batting powerplay when he had Chandimal clean bowled.</p>
<p>Sangakkara, who was dropped on 62 by Dawlat Zadran off his own bowling and wicketkeeper Mohammad Shahzad missed out on a run out when the left-hander had reached 75, was run out in a mixup with Mathews as Afghanistan hit twice in space of one run.<br />
Mathews ensured Sri Lanka avoided more hiccups by hitting four boundaries in his 41-ball knock and get the total past the 250 mark. Zadran had to be taken out of the attack for bowling second beamer in the innings in the last over before Nabi completed his over.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999893&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following the defeat against Pakistan on Sunday,in the ongoing Asia Cup, former Indian captian Sunil Gavaskar questioned the &#8220;abysmal work ethics&#8221; of players&#8217; teamwork.</p>
<p>India suffered a nerve-wracking one-wicket defeat at the hands of Pakistan in Mirpur last night, which virtually put them out of contention from reaching the final of the five-nation tournament. India have lost two matches so far while winning just one against Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;India&#8217;s work ethic has been pretty abysmal. It has let the team down. They have not practised well and there can nothing be something like optional practice. There was noexcuse for anyone apart from Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli to miss practice,&#8221; Gavaskar told &#8216;NDTV&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This business of optional practice has to be thrown outof the window. This is not the case only in this tournament,but throughout.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not here to be in your hotel rooms or to be outin the shops. You are here to represent India, something which the team management has not been saying for the past two-three years. That&#8217;s been the disappointing aspect. This also explains why Indian team hasn&#8217;t won anything of note apart from the Champions Trophy,&#8221; blasted Gavaskar.</p>
<p>Gavaskar also lashed out at the top order, saying that the batsmen were over-confident and failed in shot-selection.</p>
<p>&#8220;India threw away a couple of wickets unnecessarily and every time Pakistan have been asked to chase 250 recently, they have failed. So, we were a few runs short,&#8221; said the former skipper.</p>
<p>He also said that it was very easy for the batsmen to hit sixes at the Sher-e-Bangla cricket stadium, as the boundaries<br />
were shorter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boundaries should be a bit longer. Sixes were hit easily on this stadium.&#8221; Gavaskar, however, defended stand-in-skipper Kohli and said that he has shown promise.</p>
<p>&#8220;For somebody who is captaining for the first time in a major tournament, Kohli has done well and shown promise. Losses to both Sri Lanka and Pakistan were suffered in the last over,&#8221; he pointed out.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999863&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
