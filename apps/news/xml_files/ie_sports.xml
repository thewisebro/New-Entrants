				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viratkohliapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996844" alt="Virat Kohli led India at the Asia Cup, where they failed to reach the final (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viratkohliapm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli led India at the Asia Cup, where they failed to reach the final (AP)
<p>Virat Kohli slipped two places to 10th while Australian David Warner jumped to a career-best fifth spot in the latest Reliance ICC Rankings released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Warner, who slammed hundreds (135 and 145) in both innings of the series-deciding Cape Town Test, has moved up five places to be the highest-ranked Australia batsman, with his skipper Michael Clarke in ninth position being the only other in the top 10.</p>
<p>The batting table is still headed by AB de Villiers, with Kumar Sangakkara in second place and Shivnarine Chanderpaul in third position. Kohli is also the lone Indian in the top 10 among batsmen.</p>
<p>In the Reliance ICC Player Rankings for Test Bowlers, Ryan Harris, who ended with a match haul of seven for 95 in Cape Town, has moved up two places to a best-ever second position.</p>
<p>Harris has now moved ahead of Vernon Philander and teammate Mitchell Johnson.</p>
<p>Philander, who picked just one wicket in the Cape Town Test, is down a place to third, while Johnson has dropped down a place to fourth. The bowlers’ table is still headed by Dale Steyn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only solace for South Africa from the Cape Town Test was in the fact that Philander has now become the number-one ranked all-rounder on the Reliance ICC Player Rankings for Test all-rounders.</p>
<p>Philander, who scored 37 and 51 not out in either innings, has moved up two places to top of the all-rounders&#8217; table, pushing India&#8217;s Ravichandran Ashwin to second.</p>
<p>Philander is now on 376 ratings points, just three ahead of Ashwin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Graeme Smith signed off on his impressive Test career in 16th place in the batting table. Smith reached a career high of second position after his match-winning century against England in Johannesburg in January 2010. That was also when he achieved a best-ever 843 ratings points.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002591&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afridi2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997607" alt="Shahid Afridi further said he was looking forward to doing well in the 2015 World Cup (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afridi2.jpg" /></a> Shahid Afridi further said he was looking forward to doing well in the 2015 World Cup (AP)
<p>Hitting out at his critics for questioning his place in the Pakistan team, all-rounder Shahid Afridi said he would quit the game the day he feels himself a burden to his team.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will sideline myself, the moment I start thinking that I&#8217;m becoming a burden on my team. I will not let anyone an opportunity to talk. As long as I&#8217;m fit and give my life to cricket, I&#8217;ll continue playing the sport,&#8221; Afridi told reporters ahead of Pakistan&#8217;s Asia Cup summit clash against Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to give something to my country with my performance. There is no such thing that you will score runs with the bat every day. I&#8217;ve given my focus to bowling as well. I want to get myself ready in such a way that I deliver to the team, be it in batting or bowling,&#8221; he said at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium.</p>
<p>Afridi had to face a lot criticism for his inconsistency as many experts back home in Pakistan had questioned his place in the team. The 34-year-old replied at his critics with a 34 not out against India and a 25-ball 59 against Bangladesh to take the defending champions into the Asia Cup final.</p>
<p>Asked to rate his two latest knocks, Afridi said, &#8220;There are many reasons that I won&#8217;t like to rate them but both of them were very important for me as well as for the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Afridi said he knew best what he was doing and he did not need a coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve said earlier also, having played at this level for so many years, I don&#8217;t need a coach. Mein apna coach behter hoon (I am better off with coaching myself). I know what to do and what not to do. It&#8217;s about having the right people to back you and support you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about the current Pakistani support staff, he said, &#8220;It was different earlier, it&#8217;s not that it was not good. It was better earlier so also today. The support team that we have now are all knowledgeable and keeps you positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a thrilling last over finish against India, Afridi smashed Ravichandran Ashwin for two sixes in the last over to seal a one-wicket victory on March 1, much the similar way Javed Miandad had done against Chetan Sharma in a Sharjah humdinger in 1986.</p>
<p>But after that Miandad heroics, Pakistan had suffered a string of defeats against India. Asked whether it will have the same effect this time around also, he said (with a smile), &#8220;It&#8217;s up to the Indian team how do they take these sixes)&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Afridi further said he was looking forward to doing well in the 2015 World Cup. &#8220;Obviously, the World Cup 2015 is going to be a huge thing for me and my team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Incidentally, it was in Australia, Pakistan had tasted their lone World Cup triumph in 1992.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of time to go for 2015. We have a lot of big series coming up. The management is supporting, if we continue to have the right kind of combination, and with God&#8217;s blessings, we hope to win the World Cup,&#8221; Afridi said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002588&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Harbhajan Singh said he is not competing with Ashwin for a place in the Indian team.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002585&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/harbhajan480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1964404" alt="Harbhajan Singh" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/harbhajan480.jpg" /></a> Harbhajan Singh has been out of the India team for one year (IE Photo)
<p>Ravichandran Ashwin&#8217;s shoddy overseas performance in recent times might have enhanced Harbhajan Singh&#8217;s chances of a return to the national side but the experienced off-spinner says he is &#8220;not competing&#8221; with the Tamil Nadu tweaker for a place in the Indian team.</p>
<p>&#8220;In all these years, I have only had one competitor. That&#8217;s me myself. I have never liked competing with anyone (read Ashwin) and it has remained like that over the years. International sport is a lonely journey. You compete with one&#8217;s self and try to grow as a cricketer,&#8221; said the off-spinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;No point in competing with two, three or four people. Try your best and leave it for others to judge. Also I don&#8217;t want to say a single word about a current India player,&#8221; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>Ashwin was ineffective during India&#8217;s disastrous tours of South Africa and New Zealand and received flak from former spinners Maninder Singh and Narendra Hirwani. Infact, former captain Sourav Ganguly called for Harbhajan&#8217;s return to the national team.</p>
<p>Harbhajan has been out of the India team for one year but the 33-year-old spinner as always is relishing the challenge to fight his way back into national side.</p>
<p>Ask if he had set any time-frame for himself, he replied, &#8220;The operative word here I believe is not age but motivation. Age is just a number. If someone can perform at 45, who will stop that fellow from playing top-level cricket.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, it&#8217;s the motivation and passion to play the game at the highest level. I still want to play for India and it&#8217;s important to realise how badly you want that. I will continue playing as long as I can enjoy playing for India,&#8221; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>For the man, who has nearly 700 international wickets across three international formats including 413 in Tests, it has been a &#8220;learning experience&#8221; of grinding it out in domestic cricket match after match after having enjoyed hero like-status in the Indian team for more than a decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is tough to play domestic cricket after playing more than 100 Tests (101) and 200-odd ODIs (229). But then adverse situations are testimony to one&#8217;s character. Either you face the challenges in life head on or back out. And I am not someone to back out from challenges,&#8221; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not the only person to face these tough career situations. There has been numerous examples of sportsmen fighting it out gutsily. Only person who can wriggle me out of this situation is myself. I am working hard and getting results also. There are concerned people (selectors) who will take a call as to when I can be brought back in the national side,&#8221; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>Ask him about his philosophy of attacking bowling, he explains that it&#8217;s not only about having close-in fielders.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a wrong concept that you become an attacking bowler by placing close-in fielders. Your field placings are based on match situations. If you are playing on a track that doesn&#8217;t offer turn and bounce, it&#8217;s useless to keep a close-in fielder. The ball will never get to him,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are playing on flat tracks, fielders should be kept in positions where batsmen can offer you catch while driving. If there are four fielders outside the circle, then strategy is completely different from when you have five fielders outside the circle.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, making my intent clear to the batsman before he stamps his authority is important. Playing with his mind is a way of attacking rather than setting attacking fields,&#8221; Harbhajan elaborated.</p>
<p>Harbhajan has so far taken six wickets in four List A matches in the Vijay Hazare Trophy after 22 wickets in six first-class matches this season.</p>
<p>The feisty off-spinner has bowled well in the four matches so far, coming to bowl often in the Power-plays.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, each and every game is an opportunity. In the last one year, I have not done badly in the domestic matches that I have played. My endeavour has been to work hard and get better at my game. After Vijay Hazare, there will be Mushtaq Ali Trophy followed by IPL. Each and every tournament is a platform to get back into India team,&#8221; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>Harbhajan was disappointed that he sustained a shoulder injury just after he had got 17 wickets from the first two Ranji Trophy games and had to remain out of action for nearly six weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the best time to get injured. In fact there is no right time for an injury (laughs). I had worked a lot during my pre-season and was starting to get wickets which is a result of that hardwork. But then my shoulder gave away and I had to take leave for month and a half. Ideally, I would have liked to get close to 50 wickets in Ranji Trophy,&#8221; Bhajji said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, my comeback to competitive cricket was a good one as I nearly got a century (92) in the quarter-finals against Jammu and Kashmir. I didn&#8217;t bowl much in the match (19.2 overs in all for two wickets) as my pacers did a splendid job on a greenish track (17 of 20 J&amp;K wickets were taken by trio of Sandeep Sharma, MS Gony and VRV Singh)&#8221;.</p>
<p>Harbhajan has been bowling a lot with fielding restrictions on in the One dayers and he is loving it.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a senior bowler and captain of the side, I need to lead from the front. I have to try and bowl in Power-plays as I have the confidence to restrict the batsmen. I have bowled 12 overs in two matches as I felt I had a better chance to keep the batsmen quiet in slog overs by mixing it up. I am happy with my economy rate (4.21 runs per over) in four games,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002585&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajinkyarahaneapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002386" alt="AjinkyaRahaneAPM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajinkyarahaneapm.jpg" /></a> Ajinkya Rahane said they missed skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the Asia Cup (AP)
<p>Ajinkya Rahane played the role of an opener against Afghanistan but the Indian batsman wants to perform well in the upcoming Twenty20 World Cup while batting at number four, a batting position he finds more challenging.</p>
<p>Rahane scored 56 runs and added 121 runs with fellow opener Shikhar Dhawan in an easy chase of 160 against the minnows.</p>
<p>&#8220;As an opener, you get first 10 overs, and new ball. I like to back my instincts and play my shots. At No 4, sometimes situation is like 30 for 2 or 40 for 2 and sometimes it&#8217;s like 120 or 150/2. You have to play under different situations when you bat at No 4. It&#8217;s very crucial to rotate the strike and play your shots, back your instincts. No 4 is really a challenging position,&#8221; Rahane told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;In T20 and domestic, I used to open. I am learning a lot at No 4. With world cup coming up, I&#8217;m looking forward to this challenge,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s win against Bangladesh on Tuesday had already sealed India&#8217;s fate in the Asia Cup. They signed off with a comfortable eight-wicket win over Afghanistan with 106 balls to spare.</p>
<p>Hailing the bowlers effort to bundle out Afghanistan for a paltry 159, he said: &#8220;It always feels good when you score runs. But we&#8217;re obviously disappointed that could not qualify. Overall, we played two close games. Credit goes to bowlers. it&#8217;s not easy to bowl on these condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially I want to mention the bowlers, Mishra, Jadeja, Ashwin and then Bhuvenshwar and Shami all bowled very well. The credit goes to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rahane said they missed skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni but added that stand-in skipper Virat Kohli did a great job.</p>
<p>&#8220;Playing under Virat is also a good experience. He&#8217;s doing well in all formats. He&#8217;s also learning a lot from Dhoni bhai. He did really well. He really handed the team well team. Also we missed Dhoni bhai. His experience as captain we missed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team will fly out of Bangladesh on Thursday before returning here for the World Twenty20 in less than a fortnight&#8217;s time and Rahane said their experience here has prepared them well.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking forward obviously. We really learnt a lot from the two tours in New Zealand and South Africa and here. As a team we played really well. Obviously we did not win but as a young unit, we approached every game very well. The attitude was good. That&#8217;s what matters. Happy that the boys are putting in effot. I&#8217;m happy for that.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002382&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/neymarreutersm-copy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002377" alt="Brazil's Neymar celebrates his goal against South Africa during their international friendly soccer match (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/neymarreutersm-copy.jpg" /></a> Brazil&#8217;s Neymar celebrates his goal against South Africa during their international friendly soccer match (Reuters)
<p>Neymar&#8217;s hat-trick lit up a powerful Brazil performance as the 32 nations taking part in this year&#8217;s World Cup tested out their squads on a busy night of friendlies on Wednesday which also brought victories for Spain, Germany and France.</p>
<p>Barcelona forward Neymar was unstoppable for tournament hosts Brazil as they demolished a poor South Africa side 5-0 in the Soweto Soccer City stadium which hosted the 2010 final between Spain and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>It was also a good day for Real Madrid&#8217;s Cristiano Ronaldo who scored twice in Portugal&#8217;s 5-1 win over Cameroon, making him his country&#8217;s all-time leading scorer with 49 goals.</p>
<p>But Neymar&#8217;s Barcelona team mate Lionel Messi had an off-colour night for Argentina in Romania, vomiting on the field early in a dull 0-0 draw in Bucharest.</p>
<p>Home advantage makes Brazil slight favourites to win a sixth World Cup this year, but a host of usual suspects will travel to the south American country with genuine hopes of gate-crashing the Samba party which starts in 99 days.</p>
<p>World and European champions Spain are chief among them and they underlined their pedigree with a 1-0 victory over Italy in a repeat of the Euro 2012 final.</p>
<p>Pedro scored the game&#8217;s only goal in Atletico Madrid&#8217;s Calderon Stadium.</p>
<p>Germany, also bidding to become Europe&#8217;s first winner of a World Cup in south America, edged past Chile 1-0 and 1998 winners France, who struggled through qualifying, beat the Netherlands 2-0.</p>
<p>Mario Goetze was on target for Germany in Stuttgart but they were jeered by unhappy fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a lucky win,&#8221; said captain Philipp Lahm. &#8220;I can understand the fans, the people paid for their tickets and they wanted to see something.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got work to do and we know that (but) &#8230; we were up against a good Chile team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karim Benzema and Blaise Matuidi sealed France&#8217;s impressive win over the Dutch in Paris.</p>
<p>Neymar was the day&#8217;s outstanding performer, though, scoring once in the first half and twice after the break to take his tally for his country to 30.</p>
<p>Chelsea&#8217;s Oscar had opened the scoring and Fernandinho completed the rout.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt that we are ready,&#8221; PSG&#8217;s Thiago Silva said on O Globo&#8217;s website.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gives us great morale, great motivation. Now we can rest the mind in these three months remaining.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Provisional squads</strong></p>
<p>With time running out for players to book their places in World Cup squads, Wednesday&#8217;s friendlies provided a valuable opportunity for coaches to examine their options for the last time before naming their provisional squads.</p>
<p>England manager Roy Hodgson was one of them.</p>
<p>He watched his side labour to a 1-0 win over Denmark with Liverpool&#8217;s Daniel Sturridge scoring late to ensure they did not lose three friendly matches in a row at Wembley having been beaten by Germany and Chile in November.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking at performances, you would have to be a harsh critic to say anybody played poorly tonight,&#8221; Hodgson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been very happy with the attitude and the desire to get on that plane and grab a shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>World Cup dark horses Belgium drew 2-2 with African qualifiers Ivory Coast, for whom Didier Drogba was on target, while Switzerland and Croatia also shared four goals.</p>
<p>Tim Cahill scored twice to become Australia&#8217;s all-time top goalscorer, although his side squandered a 3-0 lead to lose 4-3 against Ecuador in a thrilling clash in London.</p>
<p>Uruguay, who are in a World Cup group with fellow former champions England and Italy, were held 1-1 in Austria.</p>
<p>Ukraine and Russia, the two countries involved in a tense military standoff in Crimea, were both in action.</p>
<p>Fabio Capello&#8217;s Russia beat Armenia 2-0 in Krasnodar and Ukraine, who missed out on qualification, enjoyed a morale-boosting 2-0 victory over the United States in a match moved from Kharkiv to Larnaca in Cyprus.</p>
<p>First-time World Cup finalists Bosnia suffered a jolt as they were beaten 2-0 by Egypt in Innsbruck.</p>
<p>Asian qualifiers Japan and South Korea enjoyed victories against New Zealand and Greece respectively.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002372&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/joerootapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002369" alt="England's Joe Root celebrates scoring a century against West Indies during their third one-dayer (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/joerootapm.jpg" /></a> England&#8217;s Joe Root celebrates scoring a century against West Indies during their third one-dayer (AP)
<p>Joe Root completed his first one-day international century to help guide England to a 25-run victory over West Indies on Wednesday in the deciding match of their three-game series in Antigua.</p>
<p>Root made 107 off 122 balls to help the tourists compile an imposing total of 303 for six after opener Moeen Ali had laid the foundations with 55 and wicketkeeper Jos Buttler added 99 late in the innings.</p>
<p>West Indies, in reply, were bowled out for 278 in the 48th over to concede the series 2-1 despite an heroic batting performance by Denesh Ramdin.</p>
<p>The home side were in early trouble after slumping to 43 for four in the eighth over when Ramdin came to the crease. The West Indian keeper proceeded to blast a career best 128 off 109 deliveries, pummelling 12 boundaries and five sixes.</p>
<p>His explosive innings threatened to turn the match around but the West Indian fightback ended when he was the last man out, bowled by a yorker from all-rounder Tim Bresnan (3-45) that knocked his leg stump out of the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were confident to chase, it was a good wicket but the top order failed and it didn&#8217;t quite come off at the end,&#8221; West Indies captain Dwayne Bravo said at the post-match presentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Root and Buttler batted well, they capitalised on the start they had&#8230; we didn&#8217;t get it right at the key moments, the first 10 overs, it&#8217;s something we have to work on, as a team and a batting group.&#8221;</p>
<p>Root came out with England in a sticky situation at 37-2 after Ben Stokes went for a golden duck but calmly set about rebuilding the innings, whacking seven boundaries to reach his ton, despite being hit on the thumb.</p>
<p>Buttler was unlucky not to reach triple figures as well. He struck seven boundaries and four sixes only to fall in the last over when he misjudged a slower ball from Ravi Rampaul which he chipped in the air for a return catch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought we could hurt them if we got a partnership going, that&#8217;s what Jos did at the end, once he got himself going &#8211; he looks unstoppable,&#8221; England captain Stuart Broad said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve taken some half chances, particularly in the last couple of games, and that yorker in the end shows it can work.&#8221;<br />
The teams will now play each other in three Twenty20s in Barbados, starting on Sunday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2002363&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Bernie said that India won't be on for 2015, but probably by 2016, Indians will get over all bureaucracy. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001972&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">India&#8217;s return to Formula One will have to wait until at least 2016, by which time a new race in Azerbaijan could also be on the calendar, commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>The 83-year-old Briton dampened Indian hopes of the Buddh International Circuit near New Delhi hosting a race again next year after being dropped from the 2014 championship. “At the moment, India won&#8217;t be on for next year for sure,” said Ecclestone. “Probably 2016&#8230; they&#8217;re gradually getting over all the bureaucracy with the tax position inside the country and the general finance,” he added.</p>
<p>Ecclestone said in November that a deal had been done for the Indian Grand Prix to return in 2015 and for six years beyond that if tax problems with the country&#8217;s authorities could be overcome.</p>
<p>Problems over taxation, with Formula One classified as entertainment rather than a sport in India, as well as the considerable bureaucracy to be overcome in bringing equipment into the country have been seen as obstacles to the race returning. South Korea was also dropped from this year&#8217;s calendar and Ecclestone said they too would have to wait for a comeback.</p>
<p>Russia, with a circuit threading through the Olympic Park in Sochi, is this year&#8217;s new addition and Ecclestone saw no reason why that race should not happen despite international tension over the situation between that country and Ukraine. “Don&#8217;t cancel,” he said when asked his advice for anyone with flights already booked for the race in the Black Sea resort in October.</p>
<p><strong>Baku race</strong></p>
<p>Azerbaijan, with a street race in the capital Baku, could soon be joining Sochi as Formula One plans to increase its presence in the region.</p>
<p>Ecclestone said he would be having discussions about that subject on Thursday, with details yet to be determined. “It&#8217;s not particularly straightforward but it will be a street circuit.”</p>
<p>While Austria will be making its return to the calendar this season, for the first time since 2003 with a race at the Red Bull-owned Spielberg circuit. Germany&#8217;s future is less assured despite the heavyweight presence of Mercedes in the championship. The debt-loaded Nuerburgring has gone into administration and is looking for a new owner, with Ecclestone &#8211; who is due to go on trial in Germany in April on bribery charges &#8211; submitting a seemingly unsuccessful offer.</p>
<p>Nuerburgring currently alternates with Hockenheim as German Grand Prix host and Ecclestone said he was trying to do a deal with the latter circuit to take on the race every year.</p>
<p>“It depends who buys it,” he said when asked about the chances of Formula One returning to the Nuerburgring, one of the sport&#8217;s historic tracks albeit heavily modified from the fearsome one used from the 1950s to 1970s.</p>
<p>The 2014 calendar lists 19 races after plans to include Mexico and New Jersey were put on hold. Both remain on the cards for 2015, even if there is considerable scepticism within the sport about New Jersey happening, in what looks like an increasing fixture headache for Ecclestone.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001972&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidicfilem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002312" alt="Nemanja Vidic, 32, won five Premier League titles, the Champions League and Club World Cup with Manchester United (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/vidicfilem.jpg" /></a> Nemanja Vidic, 32, won five Premier League titles, the Champions League and Club World Cup with Manchester United (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic will join Inter Milan in the close season after eight years of success with the English champions, the Serie A side announced on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>The 32-year-old Serbia central defender said last month he would be leaving the Premier League club at the end of this term and was looking at moving to a team outside England.</p>
<p>“Vidic is a world-class player,” Inter president Erick Thohir told the club&#8217;s website (www.inter.it). “I&#8217;m extremely happy to have completed this deal to bring Nemanja to Milan. He&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s best defenders and his qualities, international pedigree and charisma will be an asset to the team and help bring through our younger players.</p>
<p>“He will bring added value to the club and is another piece of the great Inter side we are building,” Vidic joined United in 2006, winning a host of trophies, including five Premier League titles, the Champions League and the Club World Cup.</p>
<p>He forged a strong partnership with Rio Ferdinand at the heart of United&#8217;s defence, although his effectiveness has suffered with niggling injuries.</p>
<p>He has also struggled for playing time this season with new manager David Moyes looking to rejuvenate his squad.In February Vidic announced he would leave United when his contract expired at the end of this season and he was strongly linked with a move to Inter, fifth in Serie A but having won only two league matches out of 10 so far this year.</p>
<p>At the time, Vidic said: “I&#8217;m not considering staying in England as the only club I ever wanted to play for here is Manchester United and I was lucky enough to be part of this club for so many years”.</p>
<p><strong>Mutual decision</strong></p>
<p>Moyes later said the decision for Vidic to leave the club was a mutual one. United have struggled since Moyes replaced retired fellow Scot Alex Ferguson at the start of the season, with their hopes of retaining the title all but gone as they sit in seventh spot, 18 points adrift of leaders Chelsea.</p>
<p>They are also 12 points away from fourth-placed rivals Manchester City, who occupy the last Champions League qualifying spot and have a game in hand on United.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001965&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Olympic bronze medallist Saina Nehwal started her campaign on a positive note, advancing to the second round of the women&#8217;s singles competition but it was curtains for Parupalli Kashyap and K Srikanth in the men&#8217;s singles category of the All England championship in Birmingham on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Saina was the only bright spot on a dismal day for Indian badminton as she notched up an easy 21-15 21-6 win over Scotland&#8217;s Kirsty Gilmour in a 32-minute match. </span>She will take on US&#8217; Beiwen Zhang in the second round. Commonwealth Games bronze medallist, Kashyap played his heart out before suffering a 21-14 19-21 17-21 defeat against fifth seed Kenichi Tago of Japan in men&#8217;s singles match that lasted for an hour and 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Thailand Open GP Gold winner Kidambi Srikanth too could not cross the first hurdle and went down to Japan&#8217;s Kento Momota 11-21 15-21 in another men&#8217;s singles match.</p>
<p>Indian mixed doubles pair of Tarun Kona and Ashwini Ponnappa also fell in the opening round, losing to fourth seed Danish combo of Joachim Fischer Nielsen and Christinna Pedersen 13-21 16-21 in just over half an hour.</p>
<p>Among other Indians, men&#8217;s singles player Anand Pawar and women&#8217;s doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa could not cross the first hurdle in the qualifying round.</p>
<p>Seeded No 1 in the qualifiers, Anand squandered a one-game advantage to go down fighting against Indonesia&#8217;s Andre Kurniawan Tedjono 21-18 13-21 19-21 in an hour and eight minutes match.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Games Gold medallist pair of Jwala and Ashwini also failed to tame the Chinese combo of Jin Ma and Yuanting Tang as they went down 21-14 15-21 17-21 in a match that lasted 54 minutes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001960&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[With less than three months for the WC, Indian Hockey team Coach Walsh says India lags in key areas. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001951&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hockey-4801.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001958" alt="Sardar Singh-led India will play the World Cup starting May 31." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hockey-4801.jpg" /></a> Sardar Singh-led India will play the World Cup starting May 31.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Terry Walsh has sprung quite a few surprises in his selection of 33 probables for the World Cup. In an interview with The Indian Express, he discusses the reasons for including 16 U-23 players, recalling three veterans — Gurbaj Singh, Sandeep Singh and Vikram Kanth — and areas where the team needs to improve ahead of the World Cup in May. Excerpts:</span></p>
<p><strong>Sixteen out of 33 probables are under 23 years old&#8230;<br />
</strong>Having worked from inside the Hockey India League, we&#8217;ve been able to do a fair and decent assessment of the players. The young players performed really well against some of the top international players. It is an opportunity to put pressure on senior players who have been around for some time.</p>
<p><strong>Three of them — Affan Yousuf, Lalit Upadhyay and Devinder Walmiki — were ignored for the junior World Cup. What has changed so drastically in their game that they are in probables for the senior World Cup?</strong><br />
That&#8217;s a question that you shouldn&#8217;t ask me. These are three very talented players. It&#8217;s amazing what happens when young players gets an opportunity. The question with Affan is whether he has potential to go to another level. He&#8217;s been given a shot at the camp. Now he has to prove he is one of the best at that level to stay there.</p>
<p>Akashdeep (Singh) is another one of those promising names. Young Lalit has come a long way and was incredible in HIL. Ramandeep had been disappointing right up until his last match of the HIL but lot of people tell me he is an outstanding prospect. They all follow different processes. Some have a lot to offer going forward to the international team. We don&#8217;t know how they will perform until we put them in a pressure-cooker environment. Our most difficult task is to create such an environment in the camp and see how they respond.</p>
<p><strong>Three others — Sandeep Singh, Gurbaj Singh and Vikram Kanth — have returned after a very long time. How do you rate them?</strong><br />
Those three guys have an outside chance (to make the cut). Gurbaj is one of the most outstanding players. When you perform at that level consistently and have hunger to play, then no one can keep you out for long. I think Gurbaj has the potential to be one of the best internationally if he is in the right frame of mind.</p>
<p>I saw Vikram play at the Mumbai Gold Cup and was very impressed. In the HIL, his defensive abilities against top opponents were noteworthy. He has shown he can play in different positions. Flexibility and playing different roles is his calling card just as penalty corners is Sandeep&#8217;s.</p>
<p><strong>Does Sandeep have a chance to get selected for the Cup?</strong><br />
Right now you wouldn&#8217;t pick Sandeep in the back three but now is not the time we will be picking the team. He has a history of being very slow on his feet and there&#8217;s a lot of work to be done in that area. If he does that then he has a chance. I am not saying he will be in. His penalty corners are a very lethal weapon.</p>
<p><strong>But Raghunath, Rupinderpal Singh and Gurjinder Singh have been quite effective drag-flickers as well&#8230;</strong><br />
They&#8217;ve been performing at different rates. Gurjinder was lively but not so strong during HIL. However, he was one of the players who stood up and played with authority in the junior World Cup. Raghu and Rupinder are top exponents of penalty corners not just in India but also in the world. Sandeep&#8217;s presence will put enormous amount of pressure, if nothing else, on the other three and make the atmosphere quite competitive. It will be quite a battle for that position.</p>
<p><strong>When would you pick the team for the World Cup?</strong><br />
Around three weeks before the World Cup. We play in Holland in mid-April on the pitch (where World Cup matches will be played). We&#8217;ll play a series of tests against different teams. We need to get our team playing outside India against European teams. Given our pool, that&#8217;s a pretty important thing.</p>
<p><strong>Between now and then, what are the areas the team needs to focus on?</strong><br />
We&#8217;ve got 12 weeks between the start of camp and the World Cup, which is more than adequate time. We have some major concerns that need fixing. Fitness is the key. The second is field goal conversion, which is really poor, because or poor technique which needs working on. Structurally, we&#8217;re poor in defense. The cover, or counter-control, is weak. We&#8217;re getting better but still not good enough. We have to be 30 per cent better than what we are now to be effective internationally. There are many more things that are not even on my radar at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any scope of including players who do well at the nationals?<br />
</strong>It&#8217;ll be both ways. The players who don&#8217;t produce at the camp will go out. And those who do well at nationals, play at a really high level and deserve an opportunity, will be given an opportunity.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001951&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Australia replaced India at number two position in the Test team rankings by the virtue of their hard-fought 245-run victory over South Africa in the third and final Test in Cape Town on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Australia had entered the series in third position on 111 ratings points and the victory handed them four ratings points which means that they finish the year on 115 points, three points ahead of India, at the April 1 cut-off date. It also means that Australia have won a cash award of $ 370,000 while third-placed India will have to settle with $ 265,000. England will receive $ 160,000 for finishing fourth.</p>
<p>South Africa, thanks to their commanding lead at the top of the table, retains the mace in spite of dropping to 127 ratings points and will also get richer by the top prize of $ 475,000.</p>
<p>At the January 2012 meeting, the ICC Board had approved a proposal to substantially increase incentives in the form of prize money to promote Test cricket.</p>
<p>In 2015, the total prize money will be increased to $ 1.34 million, which will be distributed to the teams that finish in the top four at the 1 April 2015 cut-off date.</p>
<p>The number-one ranked side will receive $500,000, followed by $390,000, $ 280,000 and $170,000 to the sides that will finish second, third and fourth, respectively.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001942&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Joe Root hit his maiden one-day century and Jos Buttler scored 99 as England amassed 303 for six off its 50 overs against West Indies in the third and final one-day international on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Root’s 107 off 122 balls included seven fours and lifted England from the early trouble of 37/2 in the seventh over at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. Root shared a fifth wicket stand of 175 with Buttler, who fell in the final over, one short of his own maiden century at this level. Buttler slammed seven fours and four sixes off 84 balls.</p>
<p>The 175 that the pair added was the second highest partnership for England for the fifth wicket. However, the pair survived several close opportunities. Buttler had a caught behind decision overturned on reviewing it when he was on 22 while Root was put down by wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdin an outside edge off Sunil Narine.</p>
<p>While Root scored at a strike rate of 87, the power hitting was left to Buttler. He smashed four sixes and seven fours for his 99, that came of just 84 deliveries. Earlier, Moeen Ali had helped lay the platform with his first ODI.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By: Karthik Kumar</strong></p>
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">On a two-paced pitch, Milind Kumar’s composed, unbeaten knock of 70 and veteran Mithun Manhas’ 68 ensured that Delhi, the defending champions, have a great chance of qualifying for the next round of the Vijay Hazare trophy. Delhi beat Haryana by six-wickets at Feroz Shah Kotla to climb to second place in the North Zone.</span></p>
<p>The win was crucial for the hosts as Services and Punjab, both above Delhi in the points table, were playing each other this round and Delhi had to win to make the loss of one team or the other count. With only two sides progressing from each group to the knock-out stages, the Delhi Services game on Thursday becomes a virtual knockout fixture. Punjab can progress despite a loss to Himachal Pradesh on Thursday by virtue of a healthy net run rate.</p>
<p><strong>Bad start</strong><br />
Delhi’s chase of Haryana’s 200 began badly as Unmukt Chand was out leg before first ball to Mohit Sharma. Chand, though, may have got an inside edge. Gautam Gambhir hit three boundaries in his 30-ball stay, but was caught at cover trying to play Harshal Patel on the on-side. When, last match’s hero Jagrit Anand was caught at gully off Joginder Sharma, Delhi slipped to 41/3.</p>
<p>Then, Mithun Manhas and Milind Kumar anchored the innings as they put on 96 runs in 120 balls before Manhas was caught and bowled by Bhupinder Lingwal at 68. The majority of Manhas’ runs, including his boundaries, came through the mid-wicket and cover region. After his dismissal, Milind completed the chase successfully despite the slow nature of the pitch.</p>
<p>Milind and wicket-keeper Puneet Bisht played watchfully, adding 66 runs of 83 balls to secure victory. Earlier, Gautam Gambhir won the toss and elected to field. Pawan Negi and Sumit Narwal, who were brought in for the match, proved the best bowlers, picking up two wickets each. Haryana started well, with Rahul Dewan and Avi Barot adding 49 runs before the side lost six wickets for 60 runs.</p>
<p>All-rounder’s Bhupinder Lingwal and Sonu Rathee put on an unbeaten partnership of 91 runs in 107 deliveries that took the side to a relatively respectable score of 200/6 in 50 overs, but it did not prove enough. Ishant Sharma went wicketless while Virender Sehwag missed the game with a fever.</p>
<p>Brief Scores: Haryana 200/6 in 50 overs (B Lingwal 51, R Dewan 49, S Rathee 39) lost to Delhi 203/4 in 46.1 overs (M Kumar 70, M Manhas 68).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001932&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong><em>Ajantha Mendis burst onto the scene with 26 wickets at home in three Test matches in his debut series against India in 2008. But the Sri Lankan off-spinner has played only another 15 Tests over the next six years and has scalped just 70 wickets. After spending a year on the sidelines, Mendis is back in the Sri Lanka team for the Asia Cup and has picked up seven wickets in two matches. In an interview with The Indian Express, he spoke about his travails and revival.  </em><em>Excerpts:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>You have been bowling well in the Asia Cup as well as in the bilateral series against Bangladesh. Is there anything specific that you are doing to revive your career?</strong></p>
<p>No, not really. I’m the same bowler. Last year I was out with an injury. I have been focusing on doing the basics right after my return.</p>
<p><strong>What sort of injury was that?</strong></p>
<p>I had a back injury — a disc problem. Now it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>For how long you were out of the game, and did you have an operation?</strong></p>
<p>I was out for one year. Thankfully, surgery was not required. I went to Australia for treatment and rehab and now I’m fit and fine.</p>
<p><strong>You made a spectacular entry to international cricket, then there was the dip. You were eventually omitted from the Sri Lankan team. How did you handle the difficult period?</strong></p>
<p>I spent extra hours in the nets. I worked hard to get my basics right. I knew I had the ability to return to the fold again. It was important to get my rhythm back and I feel, now I’m bowling with the right rhythm. I’m more confident now.</p>
<p><strong>So did you find it much tougher after your mystery deliveries were unraveled?</strong></p>
<p>In these days of bowling coaches and video analysts, you can’t retain your surprise element for too long. You have to add variations to outwit the batters. You learn from your experience and try to become a better cricketer. I’m working hard to be the best I can.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Did you turn to anyone for advice to get things right?</strong></p>
<p>I sought help from the bowling coaches and my team mates. I also sought advice from Muttiah Muralitharan.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What was Muralitharan’s advice?</strong></p>
<p>He told me to strengthen my basics and concentrate on line and length, and not experiment much.</p>
<p><strong>Now that you are fully fit, you must be very keen to make up for lost time?</strong></p>
<p>The target is to cement my place in the Test side as well. I love Test cricket and want to become a regular.</p>
<p><strong>You were supposed to carry forward Muralitharan’s legacy. Was that too big a pressure?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t think there was ever any pressure on me. A cricketer’s job is to do his best for his team and I always try to do that. Of course I want to be the No.1 player in the national team.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Coming to the Asia Cup, your take on the final against Pakistan.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been playing well and they, too, are doing well in both in batting and bowling. But I think we have a few tricks up our sleeve.</p>
<p><strong>Any special plans for Shahid Afridi?</strong></p>
<p>Nothing special. We will see that day.</p>
<p><strong>But Afridi is ripping apart the spinners and we’ve very short boundaries here?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, short boundaries are a problem but I will try to attack Afridi. If we take his wicket early.</p>
<p><strong>Do you consider Sri Lanka as the favourites for the final?</strong></p>
<p>No. They (Pakistan), too, are doing well. It would be pretty even.</p>
<p><strong>Not many Sri Lankan players were picked for the IPL. You were overlooked as well. Are you disappointed?</strong></p>
<p>No, not disappointed. Actually we’ve an England tour and can’t play all the IPL matches.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001927&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Graeme Smith has never been the whiny kind. On most days, while wearing South African colours, the ‘Big Easy’ went about his job with an abstruse grin. It could have been a warm smile or, maybe a mocking smirk, nobody ever knew. You could never interpret Smith’s expression. Nor could you read his mind, mood or move — a trait he shared with other long-serving successful leaders like him.</p>
<p>Once, while opening for Rajasthan Royals, with an in-form Swapnil Asnodkar at the other end, Smith was struggling. The five-nothing Asnodkar, a nobody from Goa enjoying IPL Season One’s unexpected high, walked up to the towering captain of the world’s best side at the time with words of encouragement. Those were crazy times, the suddenly famous kids had the gall. Smith didn’t mind. He was all ears, giving slow nods with a pleasant but inscrutable expression.</p>
<p>A year earlier at Kanpur, after the 1-1 drawn Test series, he had put on the same mask. The diabolical pitch had negated the team’s lead in two-and-a-half days while the Green Park gawkers hadn’t been too gracious to his companion at that time, Slinky Minky, who was clearly under-dressed for the venue. He had enough reasons to break into a rant, but he didn’t.</p>
<p>Instead, he opted for an understatement: “The pitch was slightly underprepared”. That was Smith. He always believed in mopping spilled milk and moving on. He didn’t waste time crying over uncontrollable or nasty taunts. From the time he got world cricket’s second most difficult job — leading Pakistan tops that list — he has been subjected to snide swipes. “He wouldn’t last a tour,” they said when he became the captain at 22. Smith was to became the longest serving, longest-smiling international skipper.</p>
<p>They called his highly talented team a bunch of chokers. He always found the tag amusing. The rest of the world got the joke after South Africa’s recent five year undefeated streak both home and away.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that India has just one series win to show against a Smith-led South Africa, the fans in blue have never been hostile to the leader of the ruthless side. You might not have his poster on your wall but you can’t think of putting his face on the dart-board.</p>
<p>Even when he has been all at sea against Zaheer Khan, he would unleash his trademark disarming grin to de-escalate the tension around the engrossing duel. And this has been Smith’s legacy to South African cricket. Unlike the other stereotypes of the ugly Aussies or the snobbish English, the South Africans, under Smith, were popular champion side. You couldn’t despise them even after they destroyed you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/australiateamreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002331" alt="Less than five overs remained in the final day when last man Morkel was dismissed. Harris’ 4/32 proved decisive for the victorious Aussies. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/australiateamreutersm.jpg" /></a> Less than five overs remained in the final day when last man Morkel was dismissed. Harris’ 4/32 proved decisive for the victorious Aussies. (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ryan Harris condemned South Africa captain Graeme Smith to defeat in his last international as the seamer sealed a 245-run victory and a 2-1 series win for Australia in the dying moments of the third Test on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Harris bowled Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel in the same over as South Africa, trying to bat out a draw, was bowled out for 265 with 27 deliveries remaining in the game at Newlands.</p>
<p>Australia handed South Africa just its second series defeat in its last 26 Test series under Smith. Smith announced his retirement from international cricket on Monday after a 12-year career, and at one stage his team looked set to pull off a stunning rearguard and earn a share of the series.</p>
<p>However, Harris, who will fly home to undergo knee surgery, put in one final push to swing the ball and hit the wickets of Steyn and Morkel and spark wild celebrations for Australia. “Ryan Harris at the start of the day was struggling to walk, let alone bowl,’’ Australia captain Michael Clarke said. “For him to keep running in and do a job for us, he deserves a lot of credit.’’</p>
<p>Australia declared twice at 494-7 and 303-5, and South Africa replied with 287 and 265. For centuries in both innings, Australia opener Dave Warner was named man of the match, and series. South Africa’s intent to settle for the draw, and not chase a target of 511 to win, was clear from the beginning of the day when it resumed on a parlous 71-4.</p>
<p>Nightwatchman Kyle Abbott and AB de Villiers scored just 24 runs in the first 25 overs of play but, crucially, kept the Australian bowlers at bay as the fielders crowded the bat.</p>
<p>Abbott was finally shifted after a 114-minute vigil when he left a James Pattinson delivery and was bowled, but that was the only wicket to fall before lunch.</p>
<p>Australia took the second new ball after the break though, and struck two vital blows in the second session. First, Harris found the edge to remove De Villiers after a stay of 5 hours, 26 minutes at the crease that brought 43 runs from 228 deliveries, and then Faf du Plessis was trapped lbw by Steve Smith for 47.</p>
<p>That left Australia needing three wickets to win, but Vernon Philander and JP Duminy saw South Africa to tea, to leave the home side with 33 overs to see out in the final session.</p>
<p>“I think something we’ve become really good at is never letting go,’’ Smith said. “We’ve certainly been outplayed in this Test match but we still found a way to take it as deep as possible.’’ The pair reduced that figure to 20 overs before Duminy was caught at leg slip for 43 off the bowling of Johnson, but the drama wasn&#8217;t over.</p>
<p>Philander continued to fight, and was involved in a moment of controversy when he was given out caught at short leg off Johnson, only for the third umpire to rule that his right hand was off the bat at the time the ball brushed the glove.</p>
<p><strong>Final hour drama</strong></p>
<p>The decision drew the ire of Clarke, who became entangled in a war of words with Dale Steyn as a drinks break signaled the final hour, or 15 overs. “Honestly, if anybody was out of line it was me, and I apologised to the opposition player that I was out of line to,’’ Clarke said.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say he got me at a bad time, because we’d just had a decision that didn’t go our way — but that’s the game, and as captain of your country you’ve got to be able to cop that on the chin.’’ Philander and Steyn whittled that down to five, seeing off tough spells from Johnson and Pattinson, but then Harris returned to rewrite the final part of Smith’s script and give Australia the honours from a memorable Test series.</p>
<p>“It would have been a wonderful fairytale if we had hung on there, but I think I saw enough qualities today in what the guys showed that the Proteas will be really strong for a period of time,’’ Smith said. “The strength of character we saw today is what this team is all about.’’</p>
<p>Brief scores: Australia 494/7d &amp; 303/5d vs South Africa 287 &amp; 265 all in 134.3 overs (V Philander 51*, F du Plessis 47, JP Duminy 43; R Harris 4/32, M Johnson 3/92)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001920&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/pujaraaa.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1962843 " alt="Cheteshwar Pujara has only played two ODIs so far (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/pujaraaa.jpg" /></a> Cheteshwar Pujara has only played two ODIs so far (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Sunil Gavaskar on Wednesday slammed the Indian team management for fielding an unchanged XI in the dead rubber against Afghanistan and wondered whether the “fear” of bench players succeeding over current favourites has prompted it to play the same team. Despite India being out of contention for a berth in the final of the ongoing Asia Cup, middle-order batsman <a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Why is Cheteshwar Pujara still warming the bench?" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-why-is-cheteshwar-pujara-still-warming-the-bench/" target="_blank">Cheteshwar Pujara and pacer Ishwar Pandey were not included</a> in the team for the inconsequential match on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>“The only thing that comes to my mind is that there is that worry and there’s probably a fear that if these guys do well, what happens to our favourites in the team,” Gavaskar told Star Sports.</p>
<p>“This is what breeds complacency, guys know, kuch bhi karoon, team main hoon (whatever I do, I’m in the team). “Are you worried that Cheteshwar Pujara will score runs so that your favourites who are not consistent might have to make way? Are you worried that Ishwar Pandey will pick wickets, and again some of your favourite bowlers might not be certain of a place in the team, what are you worried about?,” the former Indian captain asked.</p>
<p>Gavaskar said it was hard to comprehend the Indian team’s decision. “Very hard to understand, to be honest with you, it’s baffling,” said Gavaskar. “Some of the players have been playing non-stop, they need a bit of a break before the World Twenty20 starts, the second thing is if you are not going to give the reserve players a chance, then when are they going to play,” he said.</p>
<p>Pandey has been a part of the ODI squad for the recent New Zealand tour and the Asia Cup, but hasn’t got a chance to play in either series, while Pujara failed to add to the two ODI caps he had earned in the low-profile Zimbabwe series last year despite India’s listless performances.</p>
<p><strong>Kohli’s stand</strong></p>
<p>At the toss, stand-in-skipper Virat Kohli defended the decision of playing an unchanged team, saying: “It is important the team gets confidence from playing one unit, you have to be patient with this side. We are in a transition phase as far as one-dayers are concerned, we have shown great fight in this tournament, people have to be patient with us, we surely have the talent, but we will have to wait for the experience to come,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001923&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/iplm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2002286" alt="A chunk of Indian Premier League 7 matches could be still played in India (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/iplm.jpg" /></a> A chunk of Indian Premier League 7 matches could be still played in India (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Top officials of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have decided to approach the home ministry with a request to allow IPL matches in first week of May. By the first week of May, seven of the nine phases of the polling will be over.</span></p>
<p>“We will be requesting the home ministry again and will seek their approval to allow BCCI to hold matches in those states where elections are over in first week of May. We are mulling all options. Since this is a domestic tournament we want 60-70 per cent of IPL games to be held here,” a BCCI official said.</p>
<p>BCCI earlier had shortlisted South Africa, UAE and Bangladesh but will take a fresh stock of the situation.</p>
<p>The general elections are scheduled to take place from April 9 to May 12 with the declaration of results set for May 16.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, BCCI officials had a meeting, which was attended by president N Srinivasan, secretary Sanjay Patel, vice-president Rajeev Shukla and IPL CEO Sundar Raman to discuss the further course of action to be taken after election date were announced.</p>
<p>It is learnt that IPL title sponsor Pepsi has expressed their concern over IPL games being held in South Africa as it is not their strongest market.</p>
<p>According to sources, if less than 25 IPL games are to be played in first phase then, BCCI might choose South Africa. And if more than 25 games are to be played than UAE and Bangladesh might host the IPL. IPL chairman Ranjib Biswal said that the BCCI is still keen on hosting a bulk of the matches in India after the elections.</p>
<p>“Now that the election dates have been finalised, we are working towards hosting a majority of the matches in India. It is the Indian Premier League after all,” Biswal said. The chairman also revealed that the Indian board was still keeping all their options open in terms of choosing an offshore venue.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001918&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Australia&#8217;s Ryan Harris took the last two wickets as South Africa came within five overs of saving the third Test on a dramatic day in which a third umpire decision came close to deciding the outcome of the match.</p>
<p>South Africa were bowled out for 265 as Australia won the series-deciding third Test by 245 runs at Newlands on Wednesday, leaving their captain Graeme Smith to retire from international cricket with a defeat.</p>
<p>Not even a controversial third umpire decision could derail Australia&#8217;s victory charge, though they left it late in the day to force the win with Harris (four for 32) the hero.</p>
<p>The Proteas looked as though they would escape with a draw as they got within five overs of safety but Harris bowled out Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel to wrap up victory for the tourists.</p>
<p>Vernon Philander was not out on 51 after surviving a controversial moment with 16 overs remaining that left Australia seething when third umpire Richard Illingworth overturned a decision against him.</p>
<p>Mitchell Johnson produced a fierce bouncer that clearly caught the right thumb of the South African, who was given out by on-field umpire Aleem Dar.</p>
<p>Philander reviewed the decision and it was overturned based on the view that the batsman&#8217;s hand was not on the bat handle.</p>
<p>Replays looked inconclusive and the Australians were seething, leading to an ugly verbal confrontation between touring captain Michael Clarke and Steyn.</p>
<p>The victory gave Australia the series 2-1 and came in the wake of their 5-0 thrashing of England in the home Ashes series played earlier this year.</p>
<p>South Africa started the day on 71 for four and batted for 94 overs but could not find an anchor all day, despite a number of candidates emerging.</p>
<p>Philander, Faf du Plessis (47), JP Duminy (43) and AB de Villiers (43) all spent time at the crease, but not long enough to save the Proteas from a first series defeat since Australia won by the same scoreline in the 2008/09 season.</p>
<p>The match is the last for South Africa&#8217;s Smith who announced his retirement from international cricket after day three of the Test having played in 117 five-day games, 109 as skipper.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001730&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em><strong>India beat Afghanistan in their last Asia Cup fixture, but a lot of questions went unanswered in India&#8217;s campaign.</strong></em></p>
<p>The solid rock in the Indian Test line-up, Cheteshwar Pujara, is yet to become a regular feature in the ODI scheme of things. An outstanding Test average of around 60, with six hundreds and four fifties, is not enough to impress the men who matter. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage: Asia Cup 2014)</a></p>
<p>On occasions, India are found wanting against a quality pace attack and lose control in the space of a couple of overs. Despite the shortest format &#8211; T20s &#8211; having a huge say on the way ODIs are played these days, the stability which a good Test player brings to the middle is a prized asset. And, India are in desperate need of some, especially in the middle order.</p>
<p>If we scan the Indian batting line-up, there is lack of stability. The batting line-up is extremely top heavy. It seems we are back in the 90s or early 2000s where &#8220;top gone, India gone&#8221; was the reputation the team had to live with.</p>
<p>They say failures teach you lessons. If India are waiting for another debacle, an overseas one, to give Pujara a long rope in the shorter format, then they are not doing justice to the talent he posseses.</p>
<p><strong>What could have been done</strong></p>
<p>At the toss, India skipper Virat Kohli said he wanted this side &#8211; the XI which played against Pakistan &#8211; to spend more time in the middle. Moments after the toss, when the producer switched to Sunil Gavaskar, who was doing the pre-match show, criticism poured, and poured like a drain out of control.</p>
<p><a title="Asia Cup 2014: Unchanged India for Afghanistan clash ‘baffles’ Sunil Gavaskar" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-unchanged-india-for-afghanistan-clash-baffles-sunil-gavaskar/" target="_blank">Gavaskar was livid with the team management</a>. The decision to continue benching Pujara and Ishwar Pandey for the inconsequential tie baffled the former India skipper.</p>
<p>The shuffled batting line-up threw weight behind Gavaskar&#8217;s concerns.</p>
<p>If we had to promote Rahane, Karthik up the order, then why not Pujara? A good hit here would have done his ODI confidence a world of good. It is important to understand that a cricketer&#8217;s mental stability holds key to good performances, and the way Pujara is dealt with at the moment, it is doing no good to a quality player.</p>
<p><strong>Is Mishra not encouraging enough?</strong></p>
<p>The eternal tourist, Amit Mishra, <a title="Asia Cup 2014: After boom boom, India go bust" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-after-boom-boom-india-go-bust/" target="_blank">fired all cylinders in his first chance </a>after a long, or very long, wait on the bench.</p>
<p>It was only when lightning struck, and Kohli&#8217;s sense prevailed that the leggie got a game against arch-rivals Pakistan. Taking field after a long time, Mishra showed no out-of-touch signs, and turned the game around. Even in a modest chase, he forced Pakistan on to the back-foot and didn&#8217;t give many scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>If Pujara&#8217;s numbers are not enough, the team management should seriously take into account the way Mishra performed. Talent is okay, but the way it is dealt with makes the difference between quality and ordinary sides.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001712&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/indiateamreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001676" alt="Sunil Gavaskar said it was hard to comprehend the Indian team's decision (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/indiateamreutersm.jpg" /></a> Sunil Gavaskar said it was hard to comprehend the Indian team&#8217;s decision (Reuters)
<p>Sunil Gavaskar slammed the Indian team management for fielding an unchanged XI in the dead rubber against Afghanistan and wondered whether the &#8221;fear&#8221; of bench players succeeding over current favourites has prompted it to play the same team.</p>
<p>Despite India being out of contention for a berth in the final of the ongoing Asia Cup, middle-order batsman Cheteshwar Pujara and pacer Ishwar Pandey were not included in the team for the inconsequential match on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing that comes to my mind is that there is that worry and there&#8217;s probably a fear that if these guys do well, what happens to our favourites in the team,&#8221; Gavaskar told &#8216;Star Sports&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is what breeds complacency, guys know, kuch bhi karoon, team main hoon (whatever I do, I&#8217;m in the team).</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you worried that Cheteshwar Pujara will score runs so that your favourites who are not consistent might have to make way? Are you worried that Ishwar Pandey will pick wickets, and again some of your favourite bowlers might not be certain of a place in the team, what are you worried about?,&#8221; the former Indian captain asked.</p>
<p>Gavaskar said it was hard to comprehend the Indian team&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very hard to understand, to be honest with you, it&#8217;s baffling,&#8221; said Gavaskar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the players have been playing non-stop, they need a bit of a break before the World Twenty20 starts, the second thing is if you are not going to give the reserve players a chance, then when are they going to play,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Pandey has been a part of the ODI squad for the recent New Zealand tour and the Asia Cup, but hasn&#8217;t got a chance to play in either series, while Pujara failed to add to the two ODI caps he had earned in the low-profile Zimbabwe series last year despite India&#8217;s listless performances.</p>
<p>At the toss, stand-in-skipper Virat Kohli defended the decision of playing an unchanged team, saying: &#8220;It is important the team gets confidence from playing one unit, you have to be patient with this side.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in a transition phase as far as one-dayers are concerned, we have shown great fight in this tournament, people have to be patient with us, we surely have the talent, but we will have to wait for the experience to come,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001671&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/shikhardhawanapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001642" alt="Chasing a modest total, India are in complete control in the middle (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/shikhardhawanapm.jpg" /></a> Chasing a modest total, India were in complete control in the middle (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">At the innings break, Varun Aaron sought out Wasim Akram for some bowling advice. He might have been better off playing this game against Afghanistan instead. In fact, not only Aaron, it was inexplicable that India didn’t go with Cheteshwar Pujara and Ishwar Pandey today and named an unchanged squad for their first ever ODI against Afghanistan. It was a perfect opportunity to give the reserves some game time in a dead rubber. </span></p>
<p>No one was available to answer this question because captain Virat Kohli didn’t attend the post-match press conference and Ajinkya Rahane, who attended didn’t enlighten anyone when asked about why team management decided not to alter their playing XI from the previous game.</p>
<p>India ended their Asia Cup campaign with a facile eight-wicket win over the bottom-ranked side of the tournament. They were out of the reckoning after Pakistan defeated Bangladesh last night. Aaron played just one match and after sending down 7.5 overs for 74 runs never got another opportunity. This is despite the fact that Mohammed Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar looked drained out — especially the former. Shami has been playing non-stop since making his Test debut against West Indies in November. He’s now struggling.</p>
<p>Even against Afghanistan, he conceded 50 runs in his 7.2 overs, though he bagged a couple of wickets. Kumar was too innocuous and went wicketless on Wednesday. Afghanistan made a promising start after they were sent in and raced to 29 for no loss in their first four overs. Shami was handled with contempt by Noor Ali Zadran, but on this Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium pitch, the minnows were never going to survive India’s spin test. Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin had the Afghanistan batsmen in a spin —taking four and three wickets respectively.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>RIGHT AREAS</strong></p>
<p>Not that they bowled anything extraordinary. The Indian spinners just hit the right areas and their opponents simply didn’t have the technique to counter the turning ball. The way Asghar Stanikzai got out by hitting a half-tracker from Jadeja straight into the hands of Amit Mishra at mid-on, and also Najibullah Zadran’s dismissal in Ashwin’s first ball, gave a good indication of Afghanistan’s inexperience and lack of skill.</p>
<p>Wickets fell like ninepins, only Samiullah Senwari showed some application with a 73-ball half-century &#8211; an innings that was laced with six fours and a six. It was a very good effort.</p>
<p>He was watchful against the spinners and targeted the seamers during the batting power-play. It was his second fifty of the tournament which gave Afghanistan’s total some respectability. Senwari protected the tail-enders well to add 64 runs for the last three wickets.</p>
<p>The Indian spinners returned with the combined figures of eight for 82 from their 30 overs. They’ve bowled well in this tournament and have bagged a total of 19 wickets. India were done in by their batting mediocrity.</p>
<p>Rahane had made 73 against Bangladesh the other day. Today, promoted to open the innings, he played a good hand and was unlucky to be given out leg-before on 56.</p>
<p>“Number four is little challenging. I’m still learning at number four. I’ve always opened in T20s and domestic one-dayers. With the new ball and field restriction, you’ve the opportunity to play your shots.</p>
<p>In the middle-order, if you’re coming at No.4 with the score reading 37 for two or something like that, batting becomes different. Again, this is not in my hands and I’m ready to bat in any position according to the team management’s decision,” Rahane said.</p>
<p>Shikhar Dhawan scored 60 and for the first time in 11 matches India posted a 100-plus opening partnership. Dhawan got out to a beauty from off-spinner Mohammad Nabi. The left-hander was beaten by the drift and then the ball straightened after pitching.</p>
<p>Kohli didn’t bother to come, but Rohit Sharma, batting at No.3, and Dinesh Karthik took India to the victory target of 160 in 32.2 overs.</p>
<p>The win is achieved in a canter almost. But this tame exit from the tournament was certainly not the right kind of preparation India would be returning to Bangladesh in ten days’ time.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the MS Dhoni notwithstanding, they would be short on confidence.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001347&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hockey-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001095" alt="Affan Yousuf (L) and Yuvraj Walmiki (R) are two of the youngsters in the probables. Yuvraj’s brother Devinder is also in the 33 man list. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hockey-480.jpg" /></a> Affan Yousuf (L) and Yuvraj Walmiki (R) are two of the youngsters in the probables. Yuvraj’s brother Devinder is also in the 33 man list.
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Barely three months ago, Affan Yousuf, Devinder Walmiki and Lalit Upadhyay were not part for India&#8217;s junior World Cup squad. The trio, who had been the pillars of the team till then, were surprisingly left out of the mega event at home by coaches Gregg Clark and Baljit Saini. Their absence was clearly felt during the tournament as India finished a dismal 10th.</span></p>
<p>Now, as the senior team prepares for their World Cup in a little over three months, chief coach Terry Walsh is making sure the mistake isn&#8217;t repeated. Yousuf, Devinder and Upadhyay, on Tuesday, were among the 33 probables for the Holland event.</p>
<p>Since arriving here in October last year, the Australian has spoken about blooding fresh talents in the squad and it has reflected in his selection of the core group. Sixteen players out of the 33 summoned for the month-long preparatory camp in Delhi from March 9 are aged under 23. Thirteen of them also played in the junior World Cup.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s where the future of the game is. A lot of these players are showing improvement. I am really excited to have them and it should increase the competition level within the squad and put pressure on the seniors. Having worked from within the Hockey India League, we&#8217;ve been able to make a fair and decent assessment (of the young players),” Walsh told The Indian Express from Perth.</p>
<p>Upadhyay and Walmiki both played for Walsh-coached Kalinga Lancers in the HIL. So did Vikram Kanth, the defender who is back in fray after making his India debut eight years back. Kanth caught Walsh&#8217;s attention during the Mumbai Gold Cup last October and continued to impress the 59-year-old during the HIL.</p>
<p>Also making a comeback are Sandeep Singh and Gurbaj Singh, who last played for India at the London Olympics. Gurbaj&#8217;s return was expected. After several run-ins with former coach Michael Nobbs, the right half had been constantly overlooked despite being counted among the best players in the country.</p>
<p>His consistent performances in the domestic circuit and the HIL last month, however, could not be ignored. Known for his immaculate ball distribution, energy and aggression, Gurbaj stood out in the HIL for Delhi Waveriders. Sandeep, meanwhile, was the HIL&#8217;s top-scorer for second consecutive season. While his drag-flicking abilities are beyond doubt, his defensive frailties can become his undoing. Unless he becomes quick on feet, it is unlikely that he will be on the plane to The Hague.</p>
<p>Those who&#8217;ve missed out include goalkeeper PT Rao, defender Amit Rohidas and injured forward Gurwinder Singh Chandi. The team selection is likely to happen towards the end of April. India will be travelling to Holland to play a few friendly matches in early April as a part of their preparation for the World Cup. The quadrennial showpiece event will be held in the Netherlands from May 31 to June 15 and India are in Group A along side Australia, England, Belgium, Spain and Malaysia.</p>
<p>“We need to get our team playing outside India, against European teams. The team will be selected week after we get back from that tournament. The 33 players we have selected will have to work really hard to stay in contention. Those who won&#8217;t will be out and we include those who do well in the ongoing national championships,” Walsh said.</p>
<p>Probables: Goalkeepers: P.R. Sreejesh, Harjot Singh, Sushant Tirkey Defenders: Gurbaj Singh, Rupinder Pal Singh, V.R. Raghunath, Birendra Lakra, Gurmail Singh, Kothajit Singh Khadangbam, Gurjinder Singh, Gurinder Singh, Sandeep Singh, Vikram Kanth Midfielders: S.K. Uthappa, Dharamvir Singh, Chinglensana Singh Kangujam, Sardar Singh, Manpreet Singh, Danish Mujtaba, Satbir Singh, Devinder Sunil Walmiki, Vikas Pillay, Jasjit Singh Forwards: Nikkin Thimmaiah, Nithin Thimmaiah, S.V. Sunil, Mandeep Singh, Akashdeep Singh, Ramandeep Singh, Affan Yousuf, Yuvraj Walmiki, Talwinder Singh, Lalit Upadhyay.</p>
<p><strong>Chhattisgarh beat Kerala</strong><br />
Lucknow: CHHATTISGARH came from two goals behind and went on to defeat opponents Kerala 3-2 in their Pool D match of the 4th Hockey India Senior Men&#8217;s National Championship (B Division) at Dhyan Chand Stadium, Lucknow on Tuesday. Kerala forwards Sarin E (19th minute) and Jithu Sasi (34th minute) struck apiece each to give a 2-0 lead to their team at the breather. Chhattisgarh resorted to an aggressive game in the second-half. Shakeel Ahmed scored off a PC in the 55th minute, Erfan Khan equalised with a field goal in the 62nd minute while Upendra Pillay hit the winner in the dying seconds of the game.<br />
Two Pool C matches were also played on Tuesday. In the first Pool C match, Puducherry defeated Tripura 11-1 while Hockey Gangpur-Odisha beat Mizoram 6-0 in the other match.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001094&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After more than a year in limbo, the fate of IABF (Indian Amateur Boxing Federation) appeared to have been sealed on Monday. World body AIBA (Amateur International Boxing Association) which had suspended IABF in December 2012 citing possible manipulation of elections decided to cut its loss and ended its association with the Indian body. AIBA has now invited applications for a new national boxing federation.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t the only national federation suspended by AIBA — France, England, Korea and South Africa — were similarly sanctioned. But while Korea and South Africa were re inducted into the AIBA fold after fresh elections the failiure of IABF led by president Abhishek Matoria to do so have led to the current situation. Last year, more than 20 state units did not attend a meeting and the above said units have been gathering support even through online forums for the members to join the protest.</p>
<p>The impasse between AIBA and AIBF has negatively impacted Indian boxers. The federation not just failed to conduct an Annual General Meeting in their tenure, they have also failed to hold any national tournaments since the senior women nationals in May last year. While boxers and coaches were permitted to take part in last year&#8217;s World Championships in Kazakhstan under the AIBA flag, the boxers had to miss exposure and training competition in Cuba.</p>
<p>While the AIBA has been shifting its focus towards semi-professional style of boxing with its flagship programs World Series of Boxing and AIBA Professional League,Indian boxers failed to feature in WSB and in the draft and the final list for APB, which will begin later this year.</p>
<p>Now the latest AIBA decision brings a further sense of confusion. While AIBA has invited applications for a new national federation, the readmission process will not be completed before the AIBA congress to be held in November, putting a question mark over the camps abroad and the road map for this year&#8217;s CWG, Asian games and 2016 Rio Olympics.</p>
<p>With the AIBA also coming with the new qualification system for Rio Olympics with more than 30 percent qualification through WSB and APB apart from a new qualifying tournament in the form of AOB World Qualifying, the boxers would hope that the new federation is formed as soon as possible.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001093&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graemesmithreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001395" alt="Australia's captain Michael Clarke (2nd R) greets Graeme Smith as he comes out to bat for the last time (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graemesmithreutersm.jpg" /></a> Australia&#8217;s captain Michael Clarke (2nd R) greets Graeme Smith as he comes out to bat for the last time (Reuters)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Graeme Smith made three in his final Test innings as South Africa slid towards a heavy defeat at the close on the fourth day of the series-deciding third Test against Australia on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>Chasing a victory target of 511, the hosts will resume on 71 for four on the final day despite a valiant effort from AB de Villiers and Hashim Amla who survived 31 overs before the latter was out 20 minutes before stumps.<br />
South Africa had lost openers Smith and Alviro Petersen, as well as Dean Elgar, as Australia were rampant before tea.</p>
<p>Smith flicked a rising Mitchell Johnson delivery on to his thigh and the ball looped gently to Alex Doolan at short leg, an inglorious end for one of the game’s greats who was given a guard of honour by the touring side as he came out to bat.</p>
<p>It was a tame way for Smith’s 205th Test innings to finish but it was in keeping with his poor form in a series in which he has scored just 45 runs in six innings.</p>
<p>The South African captain, who announced his retirement from international cricket last night, bowed out having made 9,265 runs at an average of 48.25 in 117 Tests, 109 of those as captain.</p>
<p>De Villiers survived 100 balls for his 16 with all thoughts of scoring gone and survival the only thing on his mind.<br />
He and Amla added 53 for the fourth wicket off 184 balls, a stand ended when Amla was trapped lbw by a reverse-swinging delivery from James Pattinson.</p>
<p>“Hopefully we come out tomorrow and bowl straight at the stumps, that’s the line I think we have to bowl,” Australia opener David Warner said. “It was quite tough to get through the wall (Amla) there, but we know if we get can the ball reversing then we are in the game.”</p>
<p>De Villiers will resume on Wednesday with nightwatchman Kyle Abbott hoping for a repeat of their performances in Adelaide and Johannesburg in the last 18 months where they batted for 148 and 136 overs respectively in the fourth innings to seal draws.</p>
<p>Faf du Plessis, who will bat next, scored battling centuries in both those innings to steer the Proteas to safety.<br />
“There has been a lot of emotion around with Graeme deciding to give up international cricket, but I suppose it is also motivation for the guys to ensure we fight hard for the skipper,” South Africa coach Russell Domingo said.</p>
<p>“We have got six wickets in the bank and we are going to fight hard tomorrow. It has been done before at Newlands, I remember England were four down a few years ago and hung on for a draw. We were four down in Adelaide, so we know it can be done.”</p>
<p>The struggles of the home side were in sharp contrast to the Australia innings, when Warner made batting look easy as he bludgeoned 145 from 156 balls and the tourists declared their second innings on 303 for five. It was a second century of the match for the left-hander, who took his runs total in the series to 543, averaging 91.</p>
<p>Warner received support from Chris Rogers (39) and Steve Smith (36 not out), but was the dominant figure in all his partnerships as he scored nearly half his side’s runs.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Australia 1st innings 494/7 dec &amp; 303/5 dec in 58 overs (D Warner 145, C Rogers 39,A Doolan 37; K Abbott 3/61, M Morkel 1/67) vs South Africa 1st innings 287 &amp; 71/4 in 41 overs (H Amla 41, AB De Villiers 16*,A Petersen 9;M Johnson 2/31,R Harris 1/10) .</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001059&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jimmy-new-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001055" alt="Jimmy Cook mentored Graeme Smith. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/jimmy-new-480.jpg" /></a> Jimmy Cook mentored Graeme Smith.
<p><strong><em>Jimmy Cook is a former South African opener who played three Tests before taking over as coach at the King Edward School in Johannesburg where he oversaw the rise of Graeme Smith and then went on to become his mentor.</em></strong></p>
<p>The first time I met Graeme Smith I thought he was an odd boy. He had come to one of the cricket clinics we ran in Johannesburg and was bowling in the nets when another kid asked him something. Graeme turned around and sternly told this kid, “Can you leave me alone? I’m bowling.” And this kid looked at him like, ‘who the hell are you?’</p>
<p>Even I was taken aback by Graeme’s reaction. He was just 12-years-old. When he batted, every time Graeme hit the ball he would look straight at me as if inquiring ‘Everything ok?’. At the end of the net, he came to me and asked, “What did you think? How did I do?” We spoke only cricket. Jeez, the practice finished and suddenly Graeme’s high-fiving everybody and playing and running around like a normal kid. If anything, he was a naughty little bugger. But while he was playing cricket, there was no one or nothing else that mattered except what he was busy doing. I have never met a more focused young man. Ever.</p>
<p>Graeme’s an out-and-out Jo’burg boy and moved to Cape Town only much later. He went to King Edward School, where I was coach. And when he was 16, I spoke with the Lions franchise guys insisting that we need to sign him now. The guy looked at me like I was crazy.</p>
<p>A year later, he was with South Africa U-19s and I had eight of the 10 franchises calling me repeatedly asking ‘what do we have to do to get him into our province?’</p>
<p>Mentally, I’ve never seen a kid stronger then Graeme. Play or miss his expression never changed. As a bowler you would wonder, did he play at that ball cause he doesn’t look worried at all.</p>
<p><strong>Inquisitive kid</strong></p>
<p>There were a couple of technical issues to start with. His grip on the bat was something we always tried to sort out. Eventually, we decided to work with it. He just wanted to practice. I used to fetch him (Graeme), Stephen (my oldest son), and a boy called Matthew Harris, who ended up as the Lions wicket-keeper, from school and bring them to the indoor centre at the Wanderers. We would start at 3 o clock. And we would just hit balls. Two throwing to each other and me on the machine. And we would rotate. It would be 7 o clock when their dads used to come and fetch them and Graeme would go, “No, no Dad, just one more net.” We used to be there for four-and-a-half hours.</p>
<p>Graeme would never tire of asking questions. “What was it like opening the batting? How should I play here?” I used to tell Stephen as we would drive back from school, “Geez, this kid asks a lot of questions.”<br />
He had a funny way, Graeme. He scored runs even when he wasn’t playing well. Many a Saturday, I used to watch and think, “Eh Graeme hasn’t played really well today.” Mind you he’s got 15 not out, so he’s doing alright.</p>
<p>half hour later he’s got 35. By the end of the day, 85. He always had a knack of making runs. Then I got to know him better and his dad said I would like you to look after his cricket and I became his mentor. I have to say that I was surprised when he got the captaincy so young. It was at the end of the 2003 World Cup with South Africa having been knocked out early and Shaun (Pollock) having lost his captaincy.</p>
<p>I was just going to go on as a studio guest for a 7 pm evening TV show. At about 6, Graeme’s dad called me and told me, “Graeme’s going to be the captain of South Africa on the next tour. I can’t tell anyone but I had to tell you.”</p>
<p>There were six or seven other guests and then they came to me, “Jimmy what do you think? There’s some talk that Graeme Smith might be the man.” I said Greame might be a little young for the job despite being the only one there who knew.</p>
<p><strong>Born leader</strong></p>
<p>I’ll never forget an incident that transpired at a preparation camp before they left for England on Graeme’s first tour as captain. The batsmen were doing some shuttles. The bowlers, however, were done and having a cold-drink on the sidelines. Suddenly Graeme screamed, “Everybody here. You bowlers, don’t you ever go and have a cold-drink when we aren’t done with practice. You come here, stand here and you cheer the guys on and help the guys with the fitness that we do.” There were Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald all standing there. At that moment, I realized we’ve made the right choice here. He’s proven us right for over a decade.</p>
<p>I have remained his mentor even after he moved to Cape Town. We’ve always had that sort of unwritten rule. If I need you, I will let you know. The success I had with Graeme has spurred me on to see how many more times I can do this. Get a guy from nowhere and turn him into something.</p>
<p>In a way, you can say I’ve lived my dream through his achievements. I wouldn’t have minded being Graeme Smith actually.</p>
<p>Graeme’s been a very special guy in my life. Some of the best years of my life were spent watching Stephen and Graeme play together. And I’ve really cherished sitting back in my chair and watching him perform miracles for South Africa.</p>
<p>He’s got a bloody good career. And I don’t think I’ll ever meet anyone like Graeme again.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001043&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graeme-480.jpg" /></a> South Africa&#8217;s captain Graeme Smith after announcing his retirement during the fourth day of the third Test against Australia. (Reuters)
<p>Graeme Smith announced his<a title="‘I don’t think I’ll ever meet anyone like Graeme Smith’" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/i-dont-think-ill-ever-meet-anyone-like-graeme-smith/" target="_blank"> sudden retirement from international cricket</a> on Monday, ending the career of the most experienced Test captain and South African cricket’s savior. Smith resurrected the team from the match-fixing scandal involving former skipper Hansie Cronje and a disastrous World Cup on home soil in 2003.</p>
<p>Smith, given control of the under-performing and fiercely criticised national team at 22, went on to play over 100 Tests, was captain for more than a decade and established South Africa as the No.1 Test team in the world, although he couldn’t end the country’s long wait for a World Cup title.</p>
<p>“This has been the most difficult decision I have ever had to make in my life,” Smith said in a statement through Cricket South Africa. He told teammates after the third day of the ongoing third Test against Australia at his home ground Newlands in Cape Town that he was retiring after the match. “It’s a decision that I have been considering since my ankle surgery in April last year,” he said. “I have a young family to consider, and I felt that retiring at Newlands would be the best way to end it because I have called this place home since I was 18 years old.”</p>
<p>CSA said it was surprised by Smith’s announcement but recognised him as “one of the true legends of the game.”<br />
It follows the sudden announcement by all-rounder Jacques Kallis to quit Tests late last year. “We must respect him for deciding to call time,” CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat said of Smith.</p>
<p>“Knowing him as well as I do, having been instrumental as a selector in appointing him as a young captain, he would not have taken this decision lightly or without a great deal of thought.”</p>
<p>He will give up all internationals after his 117th Test, against the same opponents and on the same ground where he made his debut almost to the day, on March 8, 2002. He also played 197 ODIs, and scored over 9,000 Test runs and 6,989 ODI runs.</p>
<p>“I have been fortunate to have had many highs,” Smith said, “amongst them leading and being part of the best Test team in the world. I will cherish these memories for the rest of my life. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I bid my career a fond yet sad farewell.”</p>
<p>A big, muscular left-handed opening batsman, Smith never was praised for being an elegant player, but he was gritty, single-minded and at times brutish — all qualities that endeared him to a South African sporting public that like their stars to be tough, above anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Early promise</strong></p>
<p>His double-centuries in back-to-back Tests in England in 2003 and early in his career announced him as a player to be reckoned with, and he had a habit of making big scores when his team had its back to the wall, not least the 90 he hit to set up South Africa’s world-record score of 438 to win an ODI against Australia in 2006.</p>
<p>Smith has scored 27 Test hundreds and 38 half-centuries at an average of 48.72 with likely one innings to go. Ahead of the series-deciding third Test, which Australia leads by 234 runs with two days to play, Smith talked of a “challenging two weeks” in relation to his personal life and with specific reference to his young daughter. He didn’t elaborate. “I definitely don’t see myself playing until the age of Kallis or (Sachin) Tendulkar,” he said. “But hopefully I’ll know when the time is right.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001029&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahidafridiapppm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001636" alt="Shahid Afridi played a crucial hand against India, and against Bangladesh on Tuesday (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahidafridiapppm.jpg" /></a> Shahid Afridi played a crucial hand against India, and against Bangladesh on Tuesday (AP)
<p><strong><em><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Rashid Latif, the latest chief selector of the Pakistan side, is a happy man. For one, Shahid Afridi found his touch with the bat against arch-rivals India in a last-over win to give credence to Latif’s belief in him. And secondly, the former Pakistan wicketkeeper believes that the current side is experienced enough to challenge for the World Cup next year. He explains why and more, in a conversation with The Indian Express. Excerpts. </span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>How significant is this last-over win against India for Pakistan?</strong></p>
<p>Very significant. Pakistan have had suffered many a jolt of late. There have been controversies, poor performances and uncertainties. I believe the win against India not only will bring in positive vibes but will also give the team a huge lift. Victories are warmly feted by both sets of fans in this clash (India-Pakistan encounters) and the whole nation is very happy that we won the game.</p>
<p><strong>Shahid Afridi’s performance had been under the scanner, especially with the bat. Will this knock will help him regain his confidence?</strong></p>
<p>Shahid has always been a very important player for us. After Shoaib Akhtar retired, he’s easily the biggest star in the country. We don’t have big movie stars like in Bollywood. Naturally, everyone’s happy that he won us the game with the bat. But here’s the thing with him. He’s now one of our premier bowlers. When he will play a good innings, he will win us matches. It happened against India. He has a clearly-defined role and has been doing his job very well as a senior player in the team.</p>
<p><strong>Did you see any similarities between R Ashwin’s final over and Chetan Sharma’s famous final ball?</strong></p>
<p>It’s obvious that people will compare this with our win in Sharjah in 1986. Javed Miandad had clinched it with a last ball six off Chetan. And it gave us such a big psychological upper hand that India couldn’t beat us in an ODI for the next five-six years. I hope this win also gives us a similar morale boost. Chetan was a very good bowler and it was one of those deliveries. But such is the nature of India-Pakistan ties that even minor slip-ups are hardly forgotten. This is one match that makes heroes and zeros. Like Chetan, Ashwin, too, might have to bear this for the rest of his career. He didn’t bowl badly and Shahid even had a mis-hit. But he’s so powerful that the ball cleared the ropes.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve been given the job to build a team for the World Cup. What are your plans to build a successful side?</strong></p>
<p>In Mohammad Hafeez, Misbah ul-Haq, Saeed Ajmal, Shahid Afridi, Junaid Khan and Ahmed Shehzad we already have the core. They will go to the World Cup. Abdul Razzaq, too, will be there if he’s fit. And there are some really talented young players in the team.This is an exciting time for Pakistan cricket.</p>
<p><strong>The last time the World Cup was played in Australia-New Zealand, Pakistan won. Can Misbah do an Imran?</strong></p>
<p>To win a tournament like the World Cup, you need more than just good players and a great captain. You need luck as well. That team returned from the brink to win the title. They did it because they had the champion’s luck and also showed enormous character. It was basically an inexperienced team with Inzamam-ul-Haq, Ijaz Ahmed, Aaqib Javed and Moin Khan. Imran, Miandad and Wasim Akram were the three experienced players. This team has plenty of experience on their side. And it has the right mixture of youth as well.</p>
<p><strong>As PCB’s anti-corruption chief, how are you planning to rid Pakistan cricket of corruption?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>It’s not the job of an individual. The PCB and ICC are working jointly. We are trying to ensure that only the players with good characters come into the team. We are checking their past. And we are putting a lot of emphasis on that, because it’s imperative to have a clean past. We are holding seminars to educate young players.</p>
<p><strong>It must be a challenging post, considering that Pakistan cricket has always been riddled with controversies.</strong></p>
<p>We’ve got to stop these controversies. We’ve to check if our system is faulty and if there are loopholes, and plug them. But corruption in cricket is a global problem, not just ours.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the PCB’s decision of not supporting the ICC overhaul might affect Pakistan cricket?</strong></p>
<p>What happened was wrong. Just three countries can’t be the guardians of the game. India is already a cricketing superpower, so their constant need to stamp their authority on the rest of us makes no sense. If they need more money, they could always play more matches with Pakistan. It’s the biggest money-spinner in all of cricket, after all.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001025&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rehmanfilem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001388" alt="Abdur Rehman was taken off the attack after bowling  three beamers" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rehmanfilem.jpg" /></a> Abdur Rehman was taken off the attack after bowling three beamers
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Pakistani spinner Abdur Rehman had a spell to forget in his country’s Asia Cup <a title="Asia Cup 2014: Sprint decides run-marathon" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-sprint-decides-run-marathon/">match against Bangladesh</a> on Tuesday, the left-armer sending down a hat-trick of illegal full tosses to finish with bizarre bowling figures of 0-0-8-0. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></span></p>
<p>Brought into the attack in the 11th over at Mirpur’s Shere Bangla National Stadium, the 34-year-old spinner’s first delivery to Imrul Kayes slipped out of his hand and sailed well above waist-height and wide outside the off-stump.</p>
<p>His second attempt turned out to be a beamer, which Kayes pulled to deep mid-wicket, where a fielder took the catch but replays confirmed another no-ball.</p>
<p>Under ICC playing conditions, a bowler is taken out of the attack after sending down more than one full toss above the waist but South African umpire Johan Cloete let Rehman continue after a brief chat with Pakistan skipper Misbah-ul-Haq.</p>
<p>Rehman came round the wicket still searching for his first legitimate delivery but even his third attempt proved to be a full toss at the body of Anamul Haq, who pulled it to the midwicket boundary for an additional four runs.<br />
Rehman was summarily taken out of the attack after conceding the highest amount of runs ever recorded without bowling a single ball, and was replaced by fellow left-arm spinner Fawad Alam.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001018&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mohammadnabiapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2001382" alt="Team Afghanistan is filled with batsmen who hope to bat like their hero, MS Dhoni (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mohammadnabiapm.jpg" /></a> Team Afghanistan is filled with batsmen who hope to bat like their hero, MS Dhoni (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Fans meet their heroes. This line encapsulates the India-Afghanistan Asia Cup match to be played on Wednesday. Afghanistan players worship their Indian counterparts, but the one they consider their hero will not play tomorrow. <a title="Injured Mahendra Singh Dhoni ruled out of Asia Cup; Virat Kohli to lead" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/injured-mahendra-singh-dhoni-ruled-out-of-asia-cup-virat-kohli-to-lead/" target="_blank">MS Dhoni’s absence</a> has left even the Afghans disappointed. “Dhoni is extremely popular within our team. We would have loved to play against him,” Afghanistan manager Shafiqllah Stanikzai said. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></span></p>
<p>This would be the first-ever ODI between the two sides and they have completely different goals. <a title="Asia Cup 2014: Sprint decides run-marathon" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-sprint-decides-run-marathon/" target="_blank">Pakistan’s win over Bangladesh</a> means India are out of the tournament. So a win on Wednesday will be only a consolation for the Indian team.</p>
<p>Both Pakistan and Sri Lanka have gained a bonus point against Afghanistan, but this is an Indian team short on wins and low on confidence. And with a bowling attack that does not inspire confidence.</p>
<p>The full squad was at practice on Tuesday, despite the fact that the training session was optional. <a title="Asia Cup 2014: Doing the best we can, in whatever capacity, says Ambati Rayudu" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-doing-the-best-we-can-in-whatever-capacity-says-ambati-rayudu/" target="_blank">Ambati Rayudu</a> defended the management’s decision to not make attendance at training sessions mandatory.</p>
<p>“We’ve been working very hard, as much as any other team, if not more. Moreover, we’ve played back-to-back games, three matches in five days. And it’s not only us. No team has practiced after back-to-back games. We’ve been travelling from South Africa to New Zealand and then here. We landed and played a game in just two days. The players are going through fatigue as well,” he said.</p>
<p>The players, however, looked very intense during their two-hour practice session. Shikhar Dhawan batted at a separate net and looked to be concentrating on his back-lift and feet movement.</p>
<p>The Delhi opener has been facing the second season blues and has just one half-century in his last nine ODI innings. His poor form has dented India’s chances with just two 50-plus opening partnerships in their last 10 matches.</p>
<p>India also have posted just one 300-plus total since leaving for foreign shores in December last year. At one corner of the ground, coach Duncan Fletcher was busy with Ajinkya Rahane. Fletcher advised Rahane about his elbow position. Rahane listened intently. But every time these youngsters are going out to bat in the middle, they’re looking to be putting extra pressure on themselves.</p>
<p>As for the bowling, medium-pacer Ishwar Pandey had a long stint in the nets. This match is now a perfect opportunity to check the bench strength.</p>
<p>Afghanistan have played against India in international cricket before — at the World T20 in 2012. Then, Lakshmipathy Balaji’s three-for and Virat Kohli’s fifty proved to be too much for them.</p>
<p>In their first big ODI event, Afghanistan have already made a mark with their win over Bangladesh. They would be keen to impress their Indian idols. In Shapoor Zadran, they have a bowler who can make the best of the Indian batsmen hop.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2001008&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

In the mass hysteria, the fans forgot how privileged they were to be present at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium here on Tuesday to witness an Afridi special. </span></p>
<p>Afridi left the field grimacing in pain. He had scored 59 off just 25 balls, hit seven sixes and turned the game around. His dismissal was because of his sore hamstring that hampered his running between the wickets. He did push hard after placing an Al-Amin Hossain delivery to mid-on but he never seemed like making it to the other end. Shakib Al Hasan hit the stumps with a direct throw. Afridi was run out and the stands were alive again.</p>
<p>But the target by now was within Pakistan’s reach. Fawad Alam, who made 74, did get out with just two balls to go but it didn’t matter. Needing two runs to win, Umar Akmal found the gap along the mid-wicket boundary to ensure Pakistan chased down 327 for victory — their highest successful chase ever — with one ball to spare and reach the Asia Cup final.</p>
<p>Earlier, Afridi had arrived when the chips were down. A mindless promotion of Abdur Rehman as a slogger had made his job difficult. Pakistan were staring at a 10-plus asking rate. The equation &#8211; 102 more runs in 52 balls &#8211; was challenging. When Afridi marked his guard, spinner Mahmudullah was bowling.</p>
<p>The first ball, Afridi faced, went over the long-on boundary. The next was placed to deep-square leg for a couple. This was followed by another six. A single off the final ball of the over kept Afridi on strike.</p>
<p><strong>In the zone<br />
</strong>Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim turned to his best bowler Shakib. But Afridi was in the zone as he hit three more sixes in that Shakib over. By the end of the over he had played just 10 balls and raced to 35.</p>
<p>His half-century came in just 18 balls and then Afridi momentarily lost steam. He was dropped on 51 by Mushfiqur Rahim. Eight runs later Afridi departed but the damage had been done and Bangladesh were rattled.<br />
“This has to be one of the best ODI knocks ever. But I would say a combined batting effort won us the game.</p>
<p>Ahmed) Shehzad scored a century. Fawad Alam stayed till the end. Umar Akmal also contributed,” Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq said.</p>
<p>His Bangladesh counterpart admitted that he ran out of options. “When a batsman plays such an innings, bowlers run out of options. You can just hope that he misses one. Today Afridi connected everything,” said Rahim.<br />
Pakistan’s win also broke their sequence of 12 losses in a row, while chasing the scores of 250-plus. Misbah was right when he said that it was a team batting effort after giving due credit to Afridi’s knock.</p>
<p>Opener Ahmed Shehzad scored his fifth ODI hundred, while Mohammad Hafeez made 52. Together, they added 97 runs for the first wicket. Alam held the innings in the middle with a very calculated 70-ball 74. Akmal, who was held back in the order, provided the finishing touches with a boundary in the fifth ball of the final over.</p>
<p><strong>Heads held high</strong><br />
Bangladesh were defeated but not disgraced. They reached their highest ever ODI total (326/3), thanks to a late blitz, during which they scored 104 runs in the last eight overs. They made five changes to their XI following the loss against Afghanistan and looked determined to make amends.</p>
<p>Anamul Haque scored a very polished century, Imrul Kayes, Mominul Haque and Mushfiqur Rahim &#8211; all scored half-centuries and Shakib, who returned after a three-game ban, remained unbeaten on 44 off 16 balls.</p>
<p>The Pakistan bowlers were off-colour. Left-arm spinner Abdur Rehman, who was drafted into the squad, was barred by the umpires after bowling three waist-high full tosses in his first over. In the end, he, however, could smile as Afridi saved the day.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000993&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hafeez.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000982 " alt="Pakistan’s Mohammad Hafeez acknowledges the crowd after scoring fifty runs during the Asia Cup one-day international cricket tournament against India in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Sunday, March 2, 2014." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/hafeez.jpg" /></a> Pakistan’s Mohammad Hafeez acknowledges the crowd after scoring fifty runs during the Asia Cup one-day international cricket tournament against India.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A large private university in Meerut has suspended 67 Kashmiri students for allegedly cheering Pakistan during the India-Pak match at the Asia Cup on Sunday. The students were told to vacate their hostel rooms, and were escorted by police and university officials to nearby Ghaziabad. Some students are now back with their families in the Valley.</span></p>
<p>Groups of students were watching the match on TV in the community hall of the hostel at the Swami Vivekananda Subharti University (SVSU). A clash broke out soon after India lost, a result which the Kashmiris allegedly celebrated. No action was taken against the other group.</p>
<p>G S Bansal, the warden of the hostel, said the Kashmiri students had been punished for being “anti-national”. “By raising pro-Pakistan slogans, the Kashmiri boys did an anti-national act, and that was why we suspended them and did not take any action against the others,” Bansal told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>SVSU vice-chancellor Manzoor Ahmed said the suspension was a “precautionary measure”.</p>
<p>“There was strong resentment against the students who had shouted anti-national and pro-Pakistan slogans after Pakistan won the match. So as a precautionary measure, we temporarily suspended students of J&amp;K for three days. We arranged for two buses to <span style="line-height:1.5em;">take the boys to Ghaziabad. We also sent three senior university officials with them,” Ahmed said.</span></p>
<p>Eyewitnesses said heated exchanges followed all-rounder Shahid Afridi’s last-over sixes off Ravichandran Ashwin, which quickly escalated to brawls, followed by several rounds of stone-throwing. “Security guards did not intervene for nearly an hour after the violence began. The students were ultimately forced to go to their rooms, but the groups clashed again on Monday,” said a student who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>University registrar R K Garg said the students were sent home because the university feared more violence. “Meerut is communally sensitive. We were apprehensive that if word of the violence got out, outsiders would storm the campus and target students,” Garg said.</p>
<p>In Srinagar, families of the suspended students said they hoped for normalcy to return to the campus soon. “The university has ordered the students to leave for some time in order to avert confrontations between groups,” Abdul Majeed Khan of Uri said. Khan’s son is a second year student of BBA at the university. He added that the university administration had taken the right steps.</p>
<p>Shahid Bashir, whose son Talib Bashir had to leave Meerut, said, “The university has asked the students to leave for a few days. Most of the students have left for the Valley, while a few are staying in Delhi with friends. Once the situation improves, they will rejoin the university.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000973&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kohlimishraapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000752" alt="Virat Kohli said the decision to draft in Amit Mishra was taken after their loss to Sri Lanka in the previous match (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kohlimishraapm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli said the decision to draft in Amit Mishra was taken after their loss to Sri Lanka in the previous match (AP)
<p>His team is on the verge of being knocked out of the Asia Cup after back-to-back losses but India&#8217;s stand-in skipper Virat Kohli said he is not at all shocked by the prospect as his side is massively inexperienced even though it has shown &#8220;character&#8221;.</p>
<p>India have lost consecutive matches to <a title="Asia Cup 2014: That man Kumara Sangakkara again" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-that-man-kumara-sangakkara-again/" target="_blank">Sri Lanka</a> and <a title="Asia Cup 2014: After boom boom, India go bust" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-after-boom-boom-india-go-bust/" target="_blank">arch-rivals Pakistan</a> in the five-team event and are all but out of contention for a spot in the final. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not shocked at all. I&#8217;m really proud of the way the boys fought it out. I&#8217;m really proud of the way the team showed character in the field and with the bowling as well. 245 against a team like Pakistan and on that wicket with the dew is not easy to defend, but I think the guys showed a lot of character,&#8221; Kohli said after the one-wicket loss to Pakistan.</p>
<p><a title="Asia Cup 2014: Shahid Afridi seals thrilling chase" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/sports-gallery/asia-cup-2014-shahid-afridi-seals-thrilling-chase/" target="_blank">The defeat was crushing</a> for the fact that India could have nailed it had it not been for <a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Shahid Afridi, the emir of Mirpur" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-shahid-afridi-the-emir-of-mirpur/" target="_blank">successive sixes struck by Shahid Afridi</a> in the final over of the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you see the kind of batsmen they had and our bowlers with the inexperience they had, still to put up that kind of fight. I mean you see (Amit) Mishra, he gave only 28 runs in 10 overs, took two wickets, bowled brilliantly against the likes of Misbah, Hafeez, Umar Akmal, Shahid Afridi. So I think it was a commendable effort and I&#8217;m really, really proud of the way the guys fought it out,&#8221; Kohli said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you compare the experience of our team with their team, it&#8217;s massive, it&#8217;s huge. And in International cricket it really counts a lot. You can get away with it in Twenty20, but in the 50-over format you need to show a lot of character and that&#8217;s exactly what the boys did,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Defending a modest 246, Indian bowlers, particularly Mishra (2/28 from 10 overs) and R Ashwin (3/44), took the match to the wire and Pakistan were left needing nine runs off the last four balls with one wicket in hand.</p>
<p>But Afridi&#8217;s big blows sealed the win which took Pakistan a step closer to the final.</p>
<p>Defending his decision to give Ashwin the last over, Kohli said: &#8220;I knew that if I put the seamers in before and Ashwin comes to bowl, they will go for it. Wickets are all we wanted. If Afridi and Umar Gul had just played singles they would have won easily. I took that risk of putting the seamers in and making them hit the ball. We almost pulled it off as well in the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those last two sixes were not quite off the middle of the bat. One side was a small boundary, but that&#8217;s how it goes. We almost pulled it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Showering more praise on Mishra, the skipper said the decision to draft in the leg-spinner was taken after their loss to Sri Lanka in the previous match.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even with the dew, if you can get the wicket to dry out, and these wickets are pretty dry, so if the bowler can bowl three deliveries in an over on an area, it&#8217;s much better for the spinner. He has more of a wicket-taking chance compared to the fast bowlers.</p>
<p>&#8220;With dew coming in at the end, the fast bowlers tend to go for plenty of runs. That was the idea in the last game itself. Rohit Sharma had contained them (Sri Lanka) pretty nicely and there I made a decision that we should go with three spinners,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;These guys have a lot of right-handers in the squad as well and Mishra turns to the ball, so I wanted that attacking bowler in the bowling line-up and it almost paid off for us. I think he and Ashwin were the difference in the game today. The way they controlled that situation was magnificent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kohli felt Mishra showed a lot of courage in taking up the challenge he threw at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been really impressed by Amit Mishra. He&#8217;s an attacking bowler, which I like as well. He always likes to make the batsman take on that extra fielder inside the circle. The way he bowled with such a small target to defend I think it was brilliant on his part,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The amount of character he showed, he certainly put his hand up. In the future as well, if we want to play with three spinners or we want to go with the same kind of bowling attack, he would certainly be one of our priorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s brilliant with the ball, turns it on any sort of wicket and today he showed what he could do. I&#8217;m really, really happy for him.&#8221;<br />
Asked why Mishra was not considered for earlier matches, Kohli said: &#8220;Well that&#8217;s one thing you can say now. If he went for 70 in 10 I don&#8217;t think you would have asked me that question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kohli also gave credit to Afridi for his unbeaten 18-ball 34 that proved to be the difference between both the teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has always been big hitter, but we also took a chance that if he mistimes one of Ashwin&#8217;s carrom balls at the end, then we&#8217;ll have a good chance. It was like that, if he had mistimed it, we would have won, and if he hit a good shot the game would have gone the other way.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the plan, that he likes to play his shots and hopefully if one is mistimed and goes to hand then we can have a good chance. It went in the air two or three times, but credit to him, they cleared the boundary well.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000746&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Despite the demoralising defeats against <a title="Asia Cup 2014: That man Kumara Sangakkara again" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-that-man-kumara-sangakkara-again/">Sri Lanka</a> and <a title="Asia Cup 2014: After boom boom, India go bust" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-after-boom-boom-india-go-bust/">Pakistan</a>, India middle order batsman Ambati Rayudu put his weight behind stand-in-skipper Virat Kohli and his teammates, saying that the captain as well as the team are putting in as much effort as they could.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been learning a lot from Dhoni bhai. He has been very proactive and did a fantastic job against Pakistan. Although we have been losing, we are putting in a lot of effort,&#8221; Rayudu told reporters on the eve of their last round-robin tie against Afghanistan. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></p>
<p>&#8220;We have been learning a lot as you have seen, the games have been extremely close. We are putting heart into it and that is all we can do as cricketers,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>If Bangladesh can pull off an upset win over the defending champions Pakistan on Tuesday, India would have a slight chance of making the finals by registering a bonus point victory over Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would like to go out there tomorrow (Wednesday) and win with a bonus point and see what happens. We are just bothered to go and win with a bonus point. We will analyse it after Tuesday&#8217;s match.</p>
<p>&#8220;They (Afghanistan) are a very good bowling side as we have seen in the competition. We just need to keep our head down and make sure we get runs,&#8221; Rayudu said.</p>
<p><a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Crafty Saeed Ajmal and gritty Ambati Rayudu" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-crafty-saeed-ajmal-and-gritty-ambati-rayudu/" target="_blank">Rayudu struck 58 off 62 balls</a>, as he along with Ravindra Jadeja (52 not out off 49 balls) took India to 245 for eight against Pakistan.</p>
<p>Defending the modest target, India almost had the game in hands before <a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Shahid Afridi, the emir of Mirpur" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-shahid-afridi-the-emir-of-mirpur/" target="_blank">Shahid Afridi smashed two sixes</a> off Ravichandran Ashwin&#8217;s bowling in the final over to win it by one-wicket.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are doing the best we can, in whatever capacity. It is just we lost the game &#8212; I would say by a metre more than anything else. It&#8217;s unfortunate we are ending up on the losing side,&#8221; insisted Rayudu.</p>
<p>On their back-to-back failures, he said: &#8220;If you look at the pattern of the games, I think all the teams have struggled in the middle overs because the wicket is slower and the ball standing a little bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were wickets falling a bit so we needed to consolidate and at the end of the innings the scores were not 350 but 250. But the matches have gone to last ball. It is not actually we are not scoring or anything. It is same with all the teams,&#8221; explained Rayudu.</p>
<p>He said the pitches were undoubtedly slow, but as professionals, they should not be complaining.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were not expecting a batting-friendly pitch. Whatever the nature of wicket, we are here to play as professionals and we can&#8217;t complain about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Expected to fill into the big shoes of Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina, Rayudu said he would take confidence from his half-century he scores in a pressure game like India-Pakistan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m learning in every game. The last game has given me a lot of confidence because I played under a lot of pressure. We lost wickets and India-Pakistan is always played under pressure. I&#8217;m happy I could keep my head down and we could put a total on the board that we almost defended,&#8221; he pointed out.</p>
<p>On Indian slow strike rate up the order, Rayudu said: &#8220;It is always difficult at the top of the order because most of the fielders are inside, not even for singles. In the middle overs, we make sure we get a lot of singles because scoring boundaries has become difficult because of the wicket. That way we are learning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about the middle order continuing on a listless show after their series defeats in South Africa and New Zealand, Rayudu said: &#8220;I&#8217;m not too sure about New Zealand but I can talk about Asia Cup. We have been fairly doing well. I suppose the scores we have got on the board are not less by any means.</p>
<p>&#8220;As you know, I&#8217;m sure the games have gone down to last two overs, even last ball. It is just unfortunate that we are ending up as losing side. I&#8217;m sure we are learning. We will be a much better side in the coming days and tournaments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rayudu, who will be replaced by Suresh Raina in the World Twenty20 to be held later this month, wished India luck for the upcoming tournament.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in the T20 team. I am sure, I hope and I pray that we win the tournament.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000653&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graemesmithapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000450" alt="Graeme Smith told teammates after the third day of the ongoing third Test against Australia at his home ground Newlands in Cape Town that he was retiring after the match (AP/File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/graemesmithapm.jpg" /></a> Graeme Smith told teammates after the third day of the ongoing third Test against Australia at his home ground Newlands in Cape Town that he was retiring after the match (AP/File)
<p><strong></strong>Graeme Smith announced his sudden retirement from international cricket on Monday, ending the career of the most experienced Test captain and South African cricket&#8217;s savior.</p>
<p>Smith resurrected the team from the match-fixing scandal involving former skipper Hansie Cronje and a disastrous World Cup on home soil in 2003.</p>
<p>Smith, given control of the underperforming and fiercely criticized national team at 22, went on to play over 100 Tests, was captain for more than a decade and established South Africa as the No. 1 Test team in the world, although he couldn&#8217;t end the country&#8217;s long wait for a World Cup title.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has been the most difficult decision I have ever had to make in my life,&#8221; Smith said in a statement through Cricket South Africa.</p>
<p>He told teammates after the third day of the ongoing third Test against Australia at his home ground Newlands in Cape Town that he was retiring after the match.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a decision that I have been considering since my ankle surgery in April last year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have a young family to consider, and I felt that retiring at Newlands would be the best way to end it because I have called this place home since I was 18 years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>CSA said it was surprised by Smith&#8217;s announcement but recognized him as &#8220;one of the true legends of the game.&#8221; It follows the sudden announcement by allrounder Jacques Kallis to quit Tests late last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must respect him for deciding to call time,&#8221; CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat said of Smith. &#8220;Knowing him as well as I do, having been instrumental as a selector in appointing him as a young captain, he would not have taken this decision lightly or without a great deal of thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 33-year-old Smith appears to be heading for a defeat against the Australians in his final Test, a result that would end the Proteas&#8217; five-year unbeaten run in Test series.</p>
<p>He will give up all internationals after his 117th Test, against the same opponents and on the same ground where he made his debut almost to the day, on March 8, 2002. He also played 197 one-day internationals, and scored over 9,000 Test runs and 6,989 ODI runs.</p>
<p>Wicketkeeper-batsman AB de Villiers, the one-day captain, will likely be the favorite to take over as Test skipper.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s decision to quit just over two months after the long-serving Kallis announced his retirement on Christmas Day signals a &#8220;new era&#8221; in South African cricket, Lorgat said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been fortunate to have had many highs,&#8221; Smith said, &#8220;amongst them leading and being part of the best Test team in the world. I will cherish these memories for the rest of my life. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I bid my career a fond yet sad farewell.&#8221;</p>
<p>A big, muscular left-handed opening batsman, Smith never was praised for being an elegant player, but he was gritty, single-minded and at times brutish &#8211; all qualities that endeared him to a South African sporting public that like their stars to be tough, above anything else.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have always been someone who has left everything out there on the field for my team and for my country,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His double-centuries in back-to-back Tests in England in 2003 and early in his career announced him as a player to be reckoned with, and he had a habit of making big scores when his team had its back to the wall, not least the 90 he hit to set up South Africa&#8217;s world-record score of 438 to win an ODI against Australia in 2006.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like us to remember Graeme for his nerves of steel and his match-winning performances,&#8221; Lorgat said.</p>
<p>Smith has scored 27 Test hundreds and 38 half-centuries at an average of 48.72 with likely one innings to go.</p>
<p>Ahead of the series-deciding third Test, which Australia leads by 234 runs with two days to play, Smith talked of a &#8220;challenging two weeks&#8221; in relation to his personal life and with specific reference to his young daughter. He didn&#8217;t elaborate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I definitely don&#8217;t see myself playing until the age of Kallis or (Sachin) Tendulkar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But hopefully I&#8217;ll know when the time is right.&#8221;<strong></strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000429&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mahesh Bhupathi hasn’t followed standard procedure while launching his star-studded, multi-million dollar International Premier Tennis League (IPTL). By getting players on board, forming teams before revealing the identity of the owners or explaining the business model, he has inverted the pyramid.</p>
<p>His enterprise should be applauded but can he pull this off?</p>
<p>Even though the Big Three — Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray — have committed to the tournament, but questions and doubts remain. Who are the men who have splashed millions, that too behind closed doors, to sign the game’s biggest stars? Does the league have a sustainable business model? Will the stars be available for all matches? The tournament is still eight months away but the lack of transparency at its launch doesn’t give the fans the belief that they might actually see top stars representing their cities year after year.</p>
<p>Player commitment will be the key if the organisers hope to portray this as a serious tournament and not some exhibition league with half-serious celebrities. According to the ground rules, “marquee” players — those who have been world No 1 or won slams — are entitled to pick and choose their appearances, while others will be there for all the three weeks.</p>
<p>Adding to the confusions are the whispers emerging from sidelines of the player draft in Dubai. Wimbledon champion Andy Murray, they say, is unlikely to commit to anything more than a week. And he wouldn’t be part of the traveling circus and is expected to appear only in one city. Nadal and Djokovic too are expected to follow the same schedule.</p>
<p>With no official update, the grapevine has been buzzing. And that’s dangerous for an ambitious start-up. At at time when the Indian Premier League — from which IPTL is directly inspired — is hit by numerous scandals due to cloudy ownership patterns, the organisers should have been more transparent. The league has undeniable potential, but it’ll be interesting to see if Bhupathi can fit the pieces of this puzzle together in time for his winter premiere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/andreaggasiapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000422" alt="Andre Agassi was selected for Singapore along with Serena Williams and Czech Tomas Berdych (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/andreaggasiapm.jpg" /></a> Andre Agassi was selected for Singapore along with Serena Williams and Czech Tomas Berdych (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Andre Agassi will snub the inaugural International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) if it clashes with Thanksgiving, the former world number one said the day after being signed up by the Singapore franchise.</span></p>
<p>The eight-times grand slam champion was named in Sunday&#8217;s player draft for the new Asia-based event but said he had since learned the first match would clash with the November holiday. “It&#8217;s a good thing to take tennis to places in the world where they want to see it. There&#8217;s no downside in doing that,” American Agassi said ahead of his World Tennis Day showdown with former arch-rival Pete Sampras in London later on Monday. “My agreement to do it was based on a few very specific conditions. Certainly economics played a little part in it but also time away played another part.</p>
<p>“I can&#8217;t be away for more than four or five days so I set some limitations and had some dates in December. “Now I read in an email that the dates are over Thanksgiving,” said the 43-year-old Agassi who is married to former women&#8217;s world number one Steffi Graf and has two children. “That would be a non-starter. Six or seven days away is too much of a price to pay,” he said.</p>
<p>The draft for the IPTL set up by Indian doubles specialist Mahesh Bhupathi saw the four teams &#8211; Singapore, Dubai, Bangkok and Mumbai &#8211; bid for players. Organisers said a total of $24 million was spent.</p>
<p>Agassi was selected for Singapore along with Serena Williams and Czech Tomas Berdych while 14-times major winner Sampras is set to join Rafa Nadal in the Mumbai team. Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic head up the Bangkok and Dubai squads.</p>
<p><strong>Sampras in dark</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Fellow American Sampras also appeared slightly in the dark on Monday. “It&#8217;s happened in the last 24 hours,” he said. “I&#8217;ve just been in talks with them and I&#8217;m excited to be a part of it. It&#8217;s a big endeavour by the guys who are putting the whole thing together.“It&#8217;s not an easy thing to do though and we&#8217;ll have to see how it all plays out in the next weeks. I&#8217;ll get more details when I get home.”Sampras said he would never have entertained the idea of playing in the competition when he was at his peak. “I didn&#8217;t have a lot of time off so it would have been a tricky thing to commit to,” explained the 42-year-old American. “It&#8217;s a long journey to Asia and I&#8217;m not sure how it would have played out for me. That was my time off.”</p>
<p>The IPTL is scheduled to begin in Singapore on November 28, the day after Thanksgiving, and a week after the Davis Cup final.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000098&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/parverasooliem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1957952 " alt="Parvez Rasool made 47 but J&amp;K's 199/9 was insufficient against Punjab (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/parverasooliem.jpg" /></a> Parvez Rasool made 47 but J&amp;K&#8217;s 199/9 was insufficient against Punjab (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Parvez Rasool, the Jammu and Kashmir skipper, was disappointed with the manner in which he was dismissed on Monday. Taruwar Kohli at midwicket didn’t spill the chance after Rasool’s soft jab against Harbhajan Singh headed his way. Rasool’s dismissal brought an end to the 85-run partnership between him and Ian Dev Singh for the fourth wicket. This was a crucial stand given that J&amp;K had lost three wickets for just seven runs in 5.5 overs. </span></p>
<p>The Jamia Milia track was on the slower side and the key to batting well was patience. Rasool was clear about the way he wanted to approach the innings. He defended when the bowlers found a tight line and length, but when width was on offer he attempted to pierce the in-field.</p>
<p>Rasool’s positive intent paid off when he struck Siddarth Kaul for two boundaries early in his innings. In the next over he square cut Manpreet Gony for his third boundary.</p>
<p>The run rate climbed from under two to over three. With Rasool trying to step on the pedal at every opportunity, at the other end Ian Dev could take his time to build his innings.</p>
<p>“As a senior, it is my responsibility to make my teammates play according to the situation. I used to be a batsman before eventually taking up off-spin also. Having batted at No.4 all through, I have played in different situations. Today, I wanted to take the pressure off my team. However, I couldn’t execute plans. Firstly, I got out at a crucial juncture and then Ian’s wicket pushed us to the wall,” Rasool said.</p>
<p>During the Rasool-Singh partnership of 85, only 38 runs were scored in boundaries. The remaining 54 came through ones and twos. “When you lose wickets early, even ones and twos can do the job for you. I have been doing this the entire Ranji Trophy season. As you settle down, it is easy to change gears,” Rasool added.</p>
<p>However, Rasool couldn’t produce a knock that would put J &amp; K in a strong position. Even against Delhi in the opening game, Rasool was dismissed on 30 at a time when his team was still in sight of an upset win. On Monday, Rasool got a life when on 39 he mistimed a lofted shot and Manan Vohra dropped a sitter off Harbhajan at deep mid wicket in the 21st over. After adding another eight runs to his individual score, Rasool was dismissed.</p>
<p>Shortly, Ian Dev played a poor shot on 50. Even though Hardeep Singh and Samiulllah Beigh tried to revive the innings, J &amp; K were bowled out for 199.</p>
<p>Rasool felt that he didn’t deliver on the day. “If I had stayed at the wicket for a longer period, we would have ended up in a much stronger position,” Rasool said.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> J &amp; K 199 for 9 in 50 overs ( ID Singh 50, Parvez Rasool 47; MS Grewal 3/28, Harbhajan Singh 3/49); Punjab 200/2 in 37 overs ( M Vohra 89, M Singh 76, R Punia 1/24)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000094&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/balbir-singh-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992581" alt="Since I was the chief coach, the director of the camp, if I wanted, I could have assembled a team of only Punjabis. But the country comes first." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/balbir-singh-480.jpg" /></a> Since I was the chief coach, the director of the camp, if I wanted, I could have assembled a team of only Punjabis. But the country comes first.
<p><em>In the final part of this Walk the Talk on NDTV 24X7, veteran hockey player Balbir Singh Senior tells The Indian Express Editor-in-Chief Shekhar Gupta about the 1975 World Cup that he won as coach, welcomes the Hockey India League and laments the decline of hockey as a popular sport.</em></p>
<p><strong>Your strength is that you don’t complain, you are very positive. You don’t complain about astro-turf and modern rules. In fact, you won India a World Cup on astro-turf in 1975, in the age of modern hockey. Tell us about that.</strong><br />
The preparatory camp for the World Cup had been set up on Panjab University campus, where we were given every facility. I was the chief coach and manager then. However, within the first few days of the camp, my father passed away. I took a day’s leave for the cremation and completed his last rites only after winning the World Cup.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>It is believed that India has not seen a team like the one you assembled in 1975. I mean, we haven’t had full-backs like Surjit Singh and Michael Kindo. They were so cool headed. And then there was Ajit Pal Singh as the centre-half. He was the captain too. And at the front line-up you had Shivaji Pawar, V J Phillips, H J S Chimni&#8230;</strong><br />
Since I was the chief coach, the director of the camp, if I wanted, I could have assembled a team of only Punjabis. But the country comes first.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>And I believe you told all your players to think of the team as an Army regiment.</strong><br />
I had even set up a common prayer. Also coined a new slogan: Jo bole so hai, Bharat mata ki jai. The new slogan was important because I wanted to ensure that the team had a pan-India presence to it. The kids (players) also liked it. And we put up a united front. That was the time my wife was unwell, she was in coma&#8230; Because I had stayed with teams before, I knew that the boys used to sneak out at night. So, to control that situation, I asked the hotel management to allot us a separate wing. I would place my chair at the entrance and guard the wing to ensure no one went out at night.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>During the World Cup, the defenders — Surjit and Michael — were the team’s strong points. They were like a fortress. Always cool and composed and with perfect recovery of the ball. And yet, in the final match, you brought in Aslam Sher Khan and he scored a penalty.</strong><br />
We brought in Aslam because I was slightly worried that with the Pakistanis abusing players, there was a chance that Kindo may get scared. Also, if I hadn’t let Aslam play, it would have seemed the decision was taken because he is a Muslim.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>In fact, this was the same thing that happened with Inam-ur- Rehman, one of our finest forwards.</strong><br />
Yes, exactly. I wanted him to play. Before the match, I went with Aslam to the Royal Mosque in Kuala Lumpur where he offered namaz. Once the namaz was over, the qazi came to us and said, ‘You are a Sikh, and yet you are in a mosque.’ I told him that I am a follower of Guru Nanak, and according to him, there is only one god who is everywhere. So the qazi blessed us with success. When we turned around, the Pakistan team had lined up to offer their prayers. After we won, some of my friends in the (Pakistan) team joked that we won because we had prayed to god before them. After the win, my wife was discharged from hospital. When she came home, I handed her the trophy and she was very proud.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell us something more about that team.</strong><br />
Ajit Pal was the captain and he performed very well.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes, in fact, he married India’s greatest woman basketball player, Kiran Grewal.</strong><br />
Virender (Singh) was the right-half of Railways. Phillips was right-out and Ashok Kumar, Dhyan Chand’s son, was at the centre. I had asked Ashok not to carry the ball at all. I told him that if he dribbled, I would throw him out and Dada’s (Dhyan Chand) reputation would be tarnished. I asked him to dodge and pass. And he even scored a goal.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>He had scored from a rather tough angle.</strong><br />
Yes, it was a very good goal. It is important to keep the players pumped up and enthusiastic. Also, before leaving for the World Cup, Mrs Gandhi had asked if I would be able to take care of the team. She wanted to ensure that I wouldn’t get involved in (hockey) politics and control the team. I assured her that I would (take care of the team).<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>It is the same old story with Indian hockey. The Indian Hockey Federation and Hockey India still run the sport. How do you feel about that?</strong><br />
It is rather unfortunate that there are two groups. I always request them to come together as one. It will be good for the country and for the team. I request them to come together and help each other.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The state of hockey is very poor. This is Chandigarh, so you still see a few children taking interest. When we were children studying in Punjab, it was necessary to carry hockey sticks to school, irrespective of whether we knew how to play. And now, Delhi University has removed the game from its sports quota. How do you feel about that?</strong><br />
It is very unfortunate. Once, I had gone to Amritsar from Chandigarh to receive someone at the border. And there was not a single person or child who had a hockey stick in his hand. Everyone was playing cricket. I want our country to do well in cricket, it is everyone’s favourite game. But when we lose in hockey, it hurts me.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sachin Tendulkar was awarded Bharat Ratna. Did you ever feel that you or Dhyan Chand deserved it too? I mean there are not that many people who have won three Olympic gold medals.</strong><br />
What can I say? Our job was to play well. We did that and won the medals. The rest is up to god.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>In the modern-day game, drag-flicks are being used increasingly to score goals. What is your take on that?</strong><br />
In my time, there was no drag-flicking. However, I used to stop the ball myself and shoot in the same motion for long corners. I was known for the technique.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>But these days, in the drag-flick, the ball rises high and also moves at a great speed. Don’t you think it is unfair?</strong><br />
The goal keeper is protected, wears a helmet. But if the ball hits any other player, there could be serious injuries.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The ball moves at over 200 km per hour.</strong><br />
Yes, very dangerous.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>This is almost one-and-a-half times as Mitchell Johnson bowling at his fastest. And with no helmets&#8230;</strong><br />
Yes, either everybody wears protective gear or they devise a technique for drag-flicks. Players should learn how to dodge the goalie and score.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>When you watch matches these days, do you get scared — that somebody does a drag flick, the ball hits a player and proves fatal?</strong> It’s more dangerous than a cricket ball&#8230;<br />
Yes, it’s like a bullet.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think the Hockey India League is good for Indian hockey?</strong><br />
The Indian League is good for the players. The more practice they get, the better it is. They are getting to play a lot of matches, getting to play with international players.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>And they are being paid. At least they won’t have to clean stables to make money.</strong><br />
I have come up with a reliable hockey scheme. You should have a look at it. I have tried to contact the minister of sports (for the scheme), but he hasn’t given me an appointment yet. He could be a royal, I am an ordinary man with an idea for the game.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>No one is more royal than you are. You have three Olympic gold medals and a world record to your name. The world record has lasted 61 years.</strong><br />
Balbirs come, Balbirs go, India stays forever.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You are three years older than Mr L K Advani and fitter than him. And you are always so positive. How do you manage that?</strong><br />
It is all thanks to my well-wishers. When people wish me well, it makes me stronger and keeps me going. You interviewed me today and spoke well of me. This will add five years to my life.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>So then we must interview you again on your 100th birthday. Hopefully, by then, India will have won another medal.</strong><br />
Well, it is necessary for India to win a medal now. When I had gone to London, people there praised me and my team a lot. They asked me if India would win a medal. As much as I wanted it to win the gold, I knew the team was not in a state to do so. I had prayed for the team to finish at least fifth or sixth. I would have been very happy. But they finished twelfth. Also, the foreign coaches are very good. I am not against them.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>But you think they are overqualified?</strong><br />
I feel our players are not at that level where they can benefit from foreign coaches, not up to that standard. (Foreign coaches) are overqualified for us.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>I know exactly what you are talking about. I had interviewed Ric Charlesworth on this show. He left a frustrated man. The players too were frustrated with him.</strong><br />
Exactly. Ideally, the foreign coaches should teach the Indian coaches. Often, the players don’t understand what the foreign coaches are trying to say, because of the language barrier. If they can’t understand the language, how will they benefit from the coaching? That is why it is important that the players are coached in a language that they understand.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>So our next conversation will either be when India wins a medal, or when you turn 100.</strong><br />
With well-wishers like you&#8230;<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a fan.</strong><br />
Right now, I am at that stage in life, what we in hockey call ‘extra time’. The golden goal, the final stage, is yet to come. My opponent at the golden goal is the Almighty and I can’t stop him from scoring the golden goal.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Decision was taken by the AIBA executive committee after the evaluation and assessment of the Indian body’s progress.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000085&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">In a major setback to the suspended Indian Amatuer Boxing Federation (IABF), the world body AIBA decided to end any official relationship with it. The AIBA said that only the formation of a new national federation had the potential to change its stand. </span></p>
<p>“As AIBA President and on behalf of the entire boxing family, I am expressing my deepest regret and sadness that we had to make this decision”, stated Dr Ching-Kuo Wu in a statement issued on Monday evening. “AIBA has always regarded India as one of the most important members of its family, but it has become impossible for us to bear the hard feelings, the pain and suffering the boxers as well as the boxing family in India had to go through under the past and recent leadership, which has also been damaging the image, reputation and interest of our sport in the country,” added Wu.</p>
<p>The decision was taken by the AIBA executive committee after the evaluation and assessment of the Indian body’s progress since its suspension in December 2012 and Monday’s decision came after the IABF has failed to hold its Annual General meeting and elections. Earlier last month, when Indian Olympic Association’s suspension was lifted by IOC, there was hope that AIBA would also lift the suspension on IABF.</p>
<p>But the world body stated on Monday that it received different claims from various groups in India and it became totally impossible for AIBA to make a proper judgement in case of IABF.</p>
<p>“It is believed that the only way to get the sport of boxing back on track in India would be for it to be left in the hands of trustful, clean and honest people who love boxing. We have to give the opportunity to any group of people with passion and love for our sport to submit applications for the establishment of a new National Federation. AIBA will, however, not tolerate any governmental or sports authority interference in this process.” stated Wu in the statement.</p>
<p>As per the latest decision, the IABF is now provisionally exluded from AIBA membership in accordance with article 18.2 of the AIBA Statutes.</p>
<p><strong>Playing under AIBA flag</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Meanwhile the boxers and coaches will be authorised to participate at any competition under the AIBA flag. AIBA also stated that it will now wait for requests by any organisation or person to submit an application and once contacted, the world body will give the full guidelines for the new application process.</p>
<p>“Despite AIBA warnings, the current federation ignored the matter and failed to organise the Annual General Meeting. A lot of state units did not correspond with the current federation and the situation got worse. After the current development, we will now wait for those who come forward to stake the claim for the new federation,”stated an official of a state unit of IABF.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000085&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sainanehwalfilem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000377 " alt="" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sainanehwalfilem.jpg" /></a> Saina Nehwal starts out against Scottish Kirsty Gilmour (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">As such, the All England is just one of five Super Series Premier tournaments on the annual badminton circuit. With a total prize purse of USD 400,000 it isn’t even the richest, with Asia’s badminton-crazy and skyscraping hypercities from Korea, China and Indonesia leaving Birmingham’s National Indoor Arena far behind on sweepstakes that are on offer for its champions. Yet, Indians tend to go all mushy on the All England year after year, after Prakash Padukone and Pullela Gopichand gave the country two of its finest sporting memories winning the prestigious trophy in the last three decades.</span></p>
<p>The All England though, has remained an elusive mirage for India’s most successful badminton player &#8211; Saina Nehwal, a summit two steps too far for the Olympic bronze medallist. Nehwal’s made two semifinals there, but never really had a sniff at the actual title, outwitted by a fair margin on both occasions.</p>
<p>Indians head to the 2014 edition starting Tuesday with one of the strongest set of challengers in singles &#8211; ranking-wise. But with indifferent form dogging the lot of them, this year’s edition might well again dissipate into an unproductive outing for the four young shuttlers.</p>
<p><strong>Starting troubles</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>An unprecedented two in the Top 10 of women’s singles (Nehwal at No 7, and PV Sindhu at No 9) means there is strength in numbers and the probability of a podium, literally, doubles. Yet, both girls were staring at lacklustre season-beginnings, until Nehwal picked the Syed Modi GP Gold earlier in the year &#8211; her first title in over a year.</p>
<p>Nehwal starts out against Scottish Kirsty Gilmour (which gives her a good look-in against a probable Commonwealth Games opponent), not a particularly stiff opponent. But she will be well and truly tested against the likes of Eriko Hirose or Shixian Wang, who are known to drag her into marathon matches accompanied with their wily mental-games.</p>
<p>Sindhu, battling in the same half of the draw as her, first comes up against Chinese 6-footer Sun Yu and it will be as fascinating a face-off as a new generation Indo-Chinese rivalry will allow. She might have an angry Yihan Wang awaiting her next, given the last time they met, the Indian 18-year-old snatched the Chinese shuttler’s podium at the Worlds.</p>
<p>In men’s singles, India’s best are pitted against Japan’s leading challengers, with World No 18 P Kashyap facing former All England finalist and fifth seed Kenichi Tago, and K Srikanth (No 21) up against unseeded Kento Momota. Their paths of progress are littered with the likes of Jan O Jorgensen and Pengyu Du, though both would concede there’s no easy rounds at an event like the All England. For Srikanth debuting at the hallowed venue and having enjoyed a breakthrough year last season, the All-England could be the perfect platform to grab global attention should he notch a few upsets here.</p>
<p>Anand Pawar heads the list of qualifiers who’ll attempt to go past Tuesday and enter the main draw, though considerable attention will be on the women’s doubles pairing of Jwala Gutta-Ashwini Ponappa &#8211; heading to All England in what is their first big tournament since reuniting. The former World Championship bronze medallists will start in the qualifiers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000083&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajitchandilam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000391" alt="Ajit Chandila (FIle)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajitchandilam.jpg" /></a> Ajit Chandila (File)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has summoned former Rajasthan Royals off-spinner Ajit Chandila to appear before its disciplinary committee in New Delhi on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>Chandila is among the players who have been found guilty of spot-fixing, according to the internal report of Ravi Sawani &#8211; the BCCI’s anti-corruption unit chief &#8211; but he is the only one who has not received a sanction yet.</p>
<p>The reason for the delay is because Chandila was the last of the players to get bail in the IPL spot-fixing case and hence could not appear before Sawani. Also, though Chandila was out on bail since the second week of September, the BCCI’s disciplinary committee couldn’t fix a date for the off spinner to appear before it because the members of the committee were ‘busy’.</p>
<p>It is learnt that Sawani has recommended a ban between five years to life for Chandila as has been found guilty of violating multiple anti-corruption clauses. The disciplinary committee is likely to impose a life ban on Chandila.</p>
<p>“We have asked Chandila to appear before the disciplinary committee on Wednesday. Sawani has found him guilty and has advised strict action against him,” a BCCI official told The Indian Express.</p>
<p>Sawani’s report indicated that Chandila had influenced other players to indulge in spot-fixing. He is also accused of passing vital team information to the bookies. Based on Sawani’s report, the BCCI’s disciplinary committee banned Rajasthan Royals players &#8211; S Sreesanth and Ankeet Chavan for life, and Siddharth Trivedi for 12 months. A former player Amit Singh was banned for five years</p>
<p><strong>Election dates </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It is reliably learnt that a few BCCI officials will be meeting home ministry officials on Tuesday to ascertain the exact dates of the general elections. The Indian board is keen to conduct the second half of the IPL at home once the elections are over. “We will be getting exact dates by Tuesday so that we can fix the schedule,” a source said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000080&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Ravi Bopara and captain Stuart Broad put on 58 unbroken runs to guide England to a nerve-jangling, three-wicket victory over West Indies in the second One-day International in North Sound, Antigua on Sunday. Bopara, 38 not out, and Broad, 28 not out, combined in a patient stand for the eighth wicket as England reached 163 for seven in 44.5 overs in reply to the West Indies total of 159 all out at the Vivian Richards Cricket Ground.</span></p>
<p>England levelled the three-game series at 1-1, having lost the opener at the same venue on Friday by 15 runs despite a superb 106 from Michael Lumb on his ODI debut. On a slow pitch England lost opener Moeen Ali for 10 and Luke Wright for a duck, with only 30 runs on the board, before Lumb (39) and Joe Root (23) orchestrated something of a recovery with a third-wicket stand of 49 in 13 overs.</p>
<p>Lumb was then dismissed leg before wicket as he played across the line to a quicker delivery from left-arm spinner Nikita Miller. Just four overs later, England had slipped to 89 for six as Root, Ben Stokes (four) and Jos Buttler (no score) also departed.</p>
<p>Bopara and Tim Bresnan mounted a mini-fightback, adding 16 runs before Bresnan was run out for 10, but it was Bopara and Broad who spared England blushes as they doggedly overhauled the West Indies target with 31 balls remaining.</p>
<p>Earlier, Lendl Simmons provided the backbone in a mediocre West Indies batting display, hitting four boundaries and two sixes in 98 balls as he top-scored with a fluent 70. He dominated partnerships of 51, for the fourth wicket with Darren Bravo (13), and 52, for the fifth wicket with Dwayne Bravo (20), before he departed in the 38th over.</p>
<p>Attempting to loft the left-arm spin of Stephen Parry over the infield, Simmons holed out to Stokes at deep midwicket for West Indies to slip to 145 for six.</p>
<p>Parry, making his ODI debut, picked up two more wickets as the West Indies innings quickly folded, finishing with a return of three for 32 in his 10 overs. The three-game series finishes at the same venue on Wednesday before West Indies host England in three Twenty20 internationals in Barbados.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> WI 159 in 44.2 overs (L Simmons 70, Dwayne Bravo 20, Stephen Parry 3/32, Joe Root 2/15, James Tredwell 2/39) lost to England 163/7 in 44.5 overs (Michael Lumb 39, Ravi Bopara 38*, Stuart Broad 28*, Nikita Miller 2/28, Dwayne Bravo 2/41)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000072&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mitchelljohnsonapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000345" alt="Mitchell Johnson combined pace and aggression to raise his series tally to 19 wickets in five innings (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/mitchelljohnsonapm.jpg" /></a> Mitchell Johnson combined pace and aggression to raise his series tally to 19 wickets in five innings (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Australia took a firm grip on the third Test as seamers Mitchell Johnson and Ryan Harris snared seven wickets between them to bowl South Africa out for 287 on day three Monday at Newlands. While Johnson combined pace and aggression to raise his series tally to 19 wickets in five innings, Harris found reverse swing to claim three key wickets as South Africa conceded a first-innings deficit of 207.</span></p>
<p>Faf du Plessis and Alviro Petersen were the only batsmen to score half-centuries for South Africa, who were bowled out within a day after Michael Clarke declared Australia’s first innings on its overnight total of 494-7.</p>
<p>Clarke elected not to enforce the follow-on, and Australia advanced to 27 without loss at stumps to take an overall lead of 234 runs with two days to play. South Africa will need something special to avoid defeat in the series decider.</p>
<p>Australia’s decision to declare overnight after a session and a half was lost to rain on Day 2 proved a good one, as their seamers found early movement. Johnson would claim 4-42 off 19 overs and Harris 3-63 off 22. In the fifth over Harris had captain Graeme Smith caught behind for 5 by Brad Haddin, who was soon in action again to take a spectacular one-handed grab after James Pattinson found the inside edge of Dean Elgar’s bat who got out for 11.</p>
<p><strong>Role reversal</strong></p>
<p>Opener Alviro Petersen showed signs of a return to form as he hit eight fours in his 53, but then feathered a legside delivery from Johnson through to Haddin. However, the biggest blow to South Africa came in the dismissal of Hashim Amla, as Harris found reverse swing to bend one through the batsman’s defenses shortly before the lunch break. Amla got out for 38.</p>
<p>“I must be honest, I was really surprised to see the ball reverse — I think it was 27 overs when the ball started reversing,” Du Plessis said. “Especially after rain and a wet outfield, I was really surprised at that.”</p>
<p>Reverse swing has been a controversial topic in the series after David Warner suggested South Africa used illegal practices to obtain it in their victory in the second Test, but Johnson insisted there was nothing untoward this time.</p>
<p>“We’d seen enough to bowl cross-seam and keep a good shine on the ball,” he said. “Once we saw that the ball wasn’t swinging normally we did that straight away, so we’re not surprised that it went.’’</p>
<p>After lunch, Johnson had AB de Villiers caught at second slip on 14, then Harris induced an edge from Duminy on 4 to give Haddin his fourth catch of the innings. Australia’s position could have become even better, but Haddin missed the opportunity to stump Du Plessis off the bowling of Nathan Lyon, who then saw the batsman put down at short leg two deliveries later.</p>
<p>Du Plessis went on to score 67 and put on a 95-run partnership with Vernon Philander, but after tea he pushed at a Johnson delivery and was caught at second slip.</p>
<p>Philander stuck around for an unbeaten 37, but aside from seeing Dale Steyn hit a quick 28, he found little support before the second new ball became available to allow Australia to clean up South Africa’s tail.</p>
<p>In the six overs left in the day, Australia opener Warner smacked Morne Morkel for 24 runs to be 25 not out.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores (Stumps Day 3):  </strong>Australia 1st innings 494/7 dec,</p>
<p>South Africa 1st innings 287 in 82.5 overs ( F Du Plesiss 67,A Petersen 53,H Amla 38; M Johnson 4/42, R Harris 3/63),<br />
Australia 2nd innings 27/0 in 6 overs ( D Warner 25 not out, C Rogers 1, K Abbott 0/2) at Newlands in Cape Town. Australia lead by 234 runs.</p>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afghanistanapm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000373" alt="Afghanistan were brought down to earth by a much a better team (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afghanistanapm1.jpg" /></a> Afghanistan were brought down to earth by a much a better team (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Kumar Sangakkara once again came good with a 102-ball 76 while skipper Angelo Mathews provided the late charge, scoring 45 off 41 balls, as Sri Lanka beat Afghanistan by 129 runs to secure a place in the Asia Cup final.</span></p>
<p>Afghanistan were soaring high after their upset win over the hosts just two days ago. Monday, they were brought down to earth by a much a better team.</p>
<p>Facing a quality bowling attack, Afghanistan, chasing 254 to win, struggled against Thisara Perera’s pace and Ajantha Mendis’s guile. And unlike their match against Bangladesh, there were no late order resolve today. The end came quickly as the minnows lost their last five wickets for just three runs. The collapse gave their rivals a bonus point.</p>
<p>“It’s the inexperience. We were playing against a world-class bowling and fielding,” Afghanistan coach Kabir Khan said.</p>
<p>They had, however, started promisingly. Sri Lanka won the toss and decided to bat first on a slow Sher-e-Bangla Stadium wicket. Only 35 runs were scored in the mandatory powerplay overs and Sri Lanka had already lost opener Lahiru Thirimanne, who was cleaned up by left-arm seamer Shapoor Zadran.</p>
<p>Ten runs were scored in the 11th over but Afghanistan conceded nothing in their next two. They were creating pressure and Kusal Perera succumbed to it as he played a Mirwais Ashraf ball on to the stumps.</p>
<p>It provided Mahela Jayawardene with an opportunity to return to form, but the veteran batsman got out playing a loose shot off Ashraf. Once again the onus was on Sangakkara to get his team out of the crisis, and he did that, following up his fifty and hundred against Pakistan and India, respectively, with another half-century.</p>
<p>Afghanistan came back strongly, dismissing Dinesh Chandimal and Sangakkara inside three balls, the former bowled by left-arm spinner Hamza Hotak. Suddenly, at 158 for five in the 38th over, Sri Lanka were in trouble. However, Mathews played a calculated innings and helping his side reach a winning total.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Sri Lanka 253/6 in 50 overs (K Sangakkara 76, A Mathews 45*; Mirwais Ashraf 2/29) beat Afghanistan 124 all out (Md Nabi 37, A Stanikzai 27; Ajantha Mendis 3/11, Thisara Perera 3/29) by 129 runs</p>
<p><strong>Pak face Bangla</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>A rejuvenated Pakistan will look to seal a berth in the title clash as they lock horns with beleaguered hosts Bangladesh in their last round-robin match on Tuesday. The top two teams qualify for the summit clash and Pakistan, having collected nine points from three appearances, will go into the match as favourites.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dineshkarthikappm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000334" alt="Dinesh Karthik has gone into the Asia Cup without many games under his belt (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dineshkarthikappm.jpg" /></a> Dinesh Karthik has gone into the Asia Cup without many games under his belt (AP)
<p>Even though Dinesh Karthik wasn’t at his best in the last two games of the Asia Cup, I have no doubt he is India’s second best wicket-keeper at the moment after MS Dhoni. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></p>
<p>We should not forget that he had an excellent Champions Trophy last year and has justified his place in the squad whenever he has been given an opportunity. It is not easy for him to go out there and perform, especially when you know that the team’s skipper is also a wicket-keeper.</p>
<p>Dinesh has gone into the Asia Cup without many games under his belt recently and it has reflected in his performances. He missed two crucial stumping in the last two games, which proved to be costly for the team. The only flaw that I can notice in his game is that Dinesh is finding it tough to keep his eye on the ball.</p>
<p>After the ball is pitched, he sometimes takes his eyes off the ball even before it reaches him. It is very important for any wicket-keeper to keep an eye on the ball till the last moment.</p>
<p>It is not easy to collect the deliveries which are pitched outside the leg stump. It is easy for people to criticise him for not being able to collect the ball but they should realise that sometimes a keeper gets blinded because of the batsman in front of him. It’s very tough to know where the ball has pitched.</p>
<p>We should also take into consideration the way pitches have behaved in Bangladesh. It keeps too low sometimes and there is slight turn, which makes it even more difficult for wicket-keepers to get their body behind the ball.</p>
<p>The two misses will surely be playing on Dinesh’s mind but he should not dwell on it much. These things happen. It is important that he learns from these incidents and starts afresh. I still believe he is an outstanding cricketer and will be back at his best soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dineshkarthikm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2000324" alt="Playing in the tournament only because MS Dhoni sat out, Dinesh Karthik has made only 29 runs in three innings (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/dineshkarthikm.jpg" /></a> Playing in the tournament only because MS Dhoni sat out, Dinesh Karthik has made only 29 runs in three innings (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Ajinkya Rahane has an experience of 26 One-day Internationals. His scores, staring from the bilateral series against South Africa in December, read: 8, 7, 36, 3, 3, 2, 73, 22, 23. He has just one half century and has wasted three starts. Rahane, who batted at No.4 in the <a title="Asia Cup 2014: After boom boom, India go bust" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-after-boom-boom-india-go-bust/" target="_blank">narrow loss against Pakistan</a> at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, is a young batsman trying to find his feet in international cricket. </span></p>
<p><a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Crafty Saeed Ajmal and gritty Ambati Rayudu" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-crafty-saeed-ajmal-and-gritty-ambati-rayudu/" target="_blank">Ambati Rayudu batted at No.5 and made 58</a>, a notable innings considering it came in his first match against Pakistan. But Rayudu has played only nine ODIs. His half-century against Misbah-ul-Haq’s team was his second-best score after his unbeaten 63 against Zimbabwe. <a href="http://indianexpress.com/topic/asia-cup-2014/" target="_blank">(Full Coverage Asia Cup 2014)</a></p>
<p><a title="Dinesh isn’t keeping eyes on the ball" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/dinesh-isnt-keeping-eyes-on-the-ball/" target="_blank">Wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik</a> has played 70 One-day Internationals but this number has been accumulated over nearly 10 years. At No.6, he made 23 off 46 balls at a strike rate of 50. Karthik’s opportunities have been limited in the past. He is at the Asia Cup because MS Dhoni has been rested.</p>
<p>Rahane and Rayudu are playing at the Asia Cup because the selectors have been prepared to given them an opportunity and look beyond Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh, who have played a combined total of 482 ODIs.</p>
<p>The Indian team playing the Asia Cup is relatively inexperienced. The bowling department too is thin on experience.</p>
<p>Fast bowler Varun Aaron has only played a handful of matches after returning from an injury lay-off. His international experience is limited to just eight ODIs and one Test.</p>
<p><strong>One win in 10 matches</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>India now have won just once in their last 10 completed One-day Internationals. They lost the ODI series in South Africa and New Zealand in tougher batting conditions. And now being virtually knocked out of the Asia Cup in home-like conditions would be a cause of alarm if the inexperience of the side and the fact that the selectors have decided to give talented youngsters a bit of international exposure is not taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Virat Kohli spoke about the inexperience in the side after the loss against Pakistan on Sunday.</p>
<p>“If you compare the experience of our team with them, it’s massive. It’s huge. And in international cricket it really counts a lot. You can get away with it in T20, but in the 50-over format, you need to show a lot of character,” Kohli said.</p>
<p>The composition of India’s World T20 side will be different. Both Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina have been included for the shortest format. Dhoni will be back to lead the side.</p>
<p>So by giving the younger players a break in the 50-over format, the selectors are getting a better look at them with the World Cup less than a year away. India have a massive year ahead, starting with the World T20 and culminating in the World Cup.</p>
<p>Yuvraj Singh has struggled since his return after overcoming lung cancer. He has struggled against the pace of Mitchell Johnson and Dale Steyn. Suresh Raina had to be given the message that he must stop taking his place for granted. The southpaw is expected to return stronger if he learns from his mistakes.</p>
<p>“Yuvraj still is a match-winner in the shorter format and must go to the World Cup,” says Sourav Ganguly.</p>
<p>In fact, Yuvraj strongly figures in the selectors’ scheme of things for the showpiece event as well and good performances in the World T20 and IPL will help him make a come back to the 50-overs format. The same holds good for Raina.</p>
<p>Without having enough matches under their belt, the Rahanes and the Rayudus will find it almost impossible to step into the big shoes.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=2000055&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/sri.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999905" alt="Sri Lankan players celebrate their win over Afghanistan during the Asia Cup one-day international cricket match in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Monday, March 3, 2014.

<p>Ajantha Mendis and Thisara Perera snared six wickets and Kumar Sangakkara hit a half century as Sri Lanka reached the Asia Cup final with a 129-run win over Afghanistan on Monday. Mendis took 3-11 off his unorthodox spin and Perera bowled a miserly 10-over spell for his 3-29 to get Afghanistan out for 124 with more than 11 overs to spare after Sangakkara&#8217;s 76 off 102 balls had lifted Sri Lanka to 253-6.</p>
<p>After their third successive victory, Sri Lanka booked Saturday&#8217;s final berth with 13 points, including a bonus point after their emphatic win on Monday.  Captain Mohammad Nabi top scored for Afghanistan with 37 but in a dramatic collapse the team lost its last five wickets for only three runs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a very important game for us because we had to book our place in the final,&#8221; said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, who scored a vital unbeaten 45 off 41 balls to propel the total. &#8220;They have a very good bowling attack and our batsmen found it hard, it was a slow pitch, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Afghanistan had made its mark in its maiden appearance at the biennial tournament when it defeated host Bangladesh, but the team&#8217;s batsmen struggled to negotiate both seam and spin of Sri Lanka on a slow wicket.</p>
<p>Asghar Stanikazi showed a bit of spark by hitting five boundaries in his 27 before the innings crumbled against Perera and Mendis.<br />
Nabi and Najibullah Zadran (11) put on 48 runs for the sixth wicket stand before spinner Chaturanga de Silva (2-29) and Mendis polished off the innings in quick time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We bowled brilliantly in the first 35 overs and Sangakkara played very well,&#8221; Nabi said. &#8220;We started well with the bat, but then Mendis bowled brilliantly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier, Sangakkara, who made a half century against Pakistan and a century against India in Sri Lanka&#8217;s previous two victories, held the innings together by hitting six fours and a six against some tidy bowling.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing guaranteed in cricket, you can be in fine form, but it takes only one ball for you to get out, so you have to enjoy while it goes well,&#8221; Sangakkara said.</p>
<p>Afghanistan had restricted Sri Lanka at 171-5 by the 40th over when Dinesh Chandimal (28) was clean bowled and Sangakkara was run out in successive overs before Mathews put on 69 runs with Thisara Perera off 49 balls.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a tough wicket to bat on, so we had to spend some time to build a foundation,&#8221; Sangakkara said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t take anything for granted, the Afghan team played very well, they exploited the pitch very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s top order also struggled on a dual paced wicket after Mathews won the toss and elected to bat first.</p>
<p>Left-arm fast bowler Shapoor Zadran had Lahiru Thirimanne&#8217;s leg stump uprooted off a delivery which swung in on the left-hander and Kusal Perera played onto Ashraf&#8217;s delivery back onto his stumps.</p>
<p>Offspinner Nabi conceded only seven runs in his first four overs and also deployed eight bowlers within the first 26 overs that kept the scoring rate under check.</p>
<p>Jayawardene&#8217;s poor run of form continued when he was well caught by Nabi at mid-on before Sangakkara and Chandimal put on 74 runs off 93 balls to put the innings back on track.</p>
<p>Afghanistan struck through left-arm spinner Hamza Hotak in the second batting powerplay when he had Chandimal clean bowled.</p>
<p>Sangakkara, who was dropped on 62 by Dawlat Zadran off his own bowling and wicketkeeper Mohammad Shahzad missed out on a run out when the left-hander had reached 75, was run out in a mixup with Mathews as Afghanistan hit twice in space of one run.<br />
Mathews ensured Sri Lanka avoided more hiccups by hitting four boundaries in his 41-ball knock and get the total past the 250 mark. Zadran had to be taken out of the attack for bowling second beamer in the innings in the last over before Nabi completed his over.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999893&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gavaskarm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999867" alt="Disappointed with India's defeat against Pakistan on Sunday, former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar  slams the Indian Cricket Team (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/gavaskarm.jpg" /></a> Disappointed with India&#8217;s defeat against Pakistan on Sunday, former Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar slams the Indian Cricket Team (PTI)
<p>Following the defeat against Pakistan on Sunday,in the ongoing Asia Cup, former Indian captian Sunil Gavaskar questioned the &#8220;abysmal work ethics&#8221; of players&#8217; teamwork.</p>
<p>India suffered a nerve-wracking one-wicket defeat at the hands of Pakistan in Mirpur last night, which virtually put them out of contention from reaching the final of the five-nation tournament. India have lost two matches so far while winning just one against Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;India&#8217;s work ethic has been pretty abysmal. It has let the team down. They have not practised well and there can nothing be something like optional practice. There was noexcuse for anyone apart from Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli to miss practice,&#8221; Gavaskar told &#8216;NDTV&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This business of optional practice has to be thrown outof the window. This is not the case only in this tournament,but throughout.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not here to be in your hotel rooms or to be outin the shops. You are here to represent India, something which the team management has not been saying for the past two-three years. That&#8217;s been the disappointing aspect. This also explains why Indian team hasn&#8217;t won anything of note apart from the Champions Trophy,&#8221; blasted Gavaskar.</p>
<p>Gavaskar also lashed out at the top order, saying that the batsmen were over-confident and failed in shot-selection.</p>
<p>&#8220;India threw away a couple of wickets unnecessarily and every time Pakistan have been asked to chase 250 recently, they have failed. So, we were a few runs short,&#8221; said the former skipper.</p>
<p>He also said that it was very easy for the batsmen to hit sixes at the Sher-e-Bangla cricket stadium, as the boundaries<br />
were shorter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boundaries should be a bit longer. Sixes were hit easily on this stadium.&#8221; Gavaskar, however, defended stand-in-skipper Kohli and said that he has shown promise.</p>
<p>&#8220;For somebody who is captaining for the first time in a major tournament, Kohli has done well and shown promise. Losses to both Sri Lanka and Pakistan were suffered in the last over,&#8221; he pointed out.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999863&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kallism.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1999846" alt="Jacques Kallis-Players like him come once in many generations. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/kallism.jpg" /></a> Jacques Kallis says players like Brian Lara come once in many generations. (AP)
<p>Retired South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis picked Brian Lara over Sachin Tendulkar, as the best opponent he has ever played against.</p>
<p>Although, Kallis did not rate Tendulkar as the best batsman he has played against but said the Indian legend has &#8220;tremendously&#8221; helped in taking the game forward by playing with the right spirit throughout his illustrious career.</p>
<p>&#8220;He (Tendulkar) has done a tremendous amount for world cricket and for taking it forward. He played the game hard but always in the right spirit,&#8221; said Kallis.</p>
<p>&#8220;To achieve what he (Tendulkar) achieved is incredible. I enjoyed my battles against him. I always said I will play this game hard but in the right spirit, that I can (leave aside) the game when I am in a country and have a beer with them. That&#8217;s the way he played it (too),&#8221; Kallis, who retired from Test cricket last December, was quoted as saying in &#8216;ESPNcricinfo&#8217;.</p>
<p>Asked who are his toughest opponents, Kallis said, &#8220;Seamer: Wasim Akram. He had the ability to swing the ball both ways. Spinner: Shane Warne. He controlled the game, he attacked, defended. Batsman: Brian Lara.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 39-year-old Kallis, who scored 13,289 runs and took 292 wickets from 166 Test matches, was also not unduly worried about the BCCI exercising most of the administrative and financial control in world cricket, saying the Indian Board had been doing so for some time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone really knows if it&#8217;s a good or a bad thing. We are going to have to wait and see. If we are brutally honest, the BCCI has had a lot of power over the game for some time, so I don&#8217;t think it is really going to change much.</p>
<p>&#8220;My only concern is that they make decision in the best interests of cricket and not only in the best interests of own cricket, and I think they will do that,&#8221; said Kallis who plays for Kolkata Knight Riders in the cash-rich IPL</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1999845&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/broadboparareutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1998147" alt="England levelled the three-game series at 1-1 (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/broadboparareutersm.jpg" /></a> England levelled the three-game series at 1-1 (Reuters)
<p>Ravi Bopara and captain Stuart Broad put on 58 unbroken runs to guide England to a nerve-jangling, three-wicket victory over West Indies in the second one-day international in North Sound, Antigua on Sunday.</p>
<p>Bopara, 38 not out, and Broad, 28 not out, combined in a patient stand for the eighth wicket as England reached 163 for seven in 44.5 overs in reply to the West Indies total of 159 all out at the Vivian Richards Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>England levelled the three-game series at 1-1, having lost the opener at the same venue on Friday by 15 runs despite a superb 106 from Michael Lumb on his ODI debut.</p>
<p>On a slow pitch England lost opener Moeen Ali for 10 and Luke Wright for a duck, with only 30 runs on the board, before Lumb (39) and Joe Root (23) orchestrated something of a recovery with a third-wicket stand of 49 in 13 overs.</p>
<p>Lumb was then dismissed leg before wicket as he played across the line to a quicker delivery from left-arm spinner Nikita Miller.<br />
Just four overs later, England had slipped to 89 for six as Root, Ben Stokes (four) and Jos Buttler (no score) also departed.</p>
<p>Bopara and Tim Bresnan mounted a mini-fightback, adding 16 runs before Bresnan was run out for 10, but it was Bopara and Broad who spared England blushes as they doggedly overhauled the West Indies target with 31 balls remaining.</p>
<p>Earlier, Lendl Simmons provided the backbone in a mediocre West Indies batting display, hitting four boundaries and two sixes in 98 balls as he top-scored with a fluent 70.</p>
<p>He dominated partnerships of 51, for the fourth wicket with Darren Bravo (13), and 52, for the fifth wicket with Dwayne Bravo (20), before he departed in the 38th over.</p>
<p>Attempting to loft the left-arm spin of Stephen Parry over the infield, Simmons holed out to Stokes at deep midwicket for West Indies to slip to 145 for six.</p>
<p>Parry, making his ODI debut, picked up two more wickets as the West Indies innings quickly folded, finishing with a return of three for 32 in his 10 overs.</p>
<p>The three-game series finishes at the same venue on Wednesday before West Indies host England in three Twenty20 internationals in Barbados.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1998143&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afridi2.jpg"><img src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afridi2.jpg" alt="Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi plays a shot during the Asia Cup one-day international cricket tournament against India. (AP)" class="size-full wp-image-1997607" /></a> Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi plays a shot during the Asia Cup one-day international cricket tournament against India. (AP)
<p>Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan led the chorus of appreciation for the Pakistan team after its stunning one-wicket win over India in the Asia Cup, showering special praise on senior all-rounder Shahid Afridi for his electrifying cameo.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afridi fulfilled his responsibilities as a senior player and I am happy to see him playing so well under lot of pressure,&#8221; Imran said.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar said while Pakistan had secured a great win but one must remain realistic at all times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am happy that Pakistan won but I think it was not our batting but our bowling that won us the match as they restricted India to a reasonable total on a good batting track,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that India badly missed the services of Mahendra Singh Dhoni as captain and batsman and that Virat Kohli had made some mistakes as captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;He should have kept at least two overs for Shami knowing the way Pakistan&#8217;s batting collapses at times,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s former captain, Muhammad Yousuf said Indian batsman appeared a bit over-confident when they batted first.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but I got this feeling they were over confident and tried to play too many strokes and they paid the price. On this pitch India fell short by at least 60 to 70 runs,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Yousuf praised the Pakistani bowlers for putting in a good effort on a batting track.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bowlers provided the impetus for the win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about Afridi&#8217;s match winning innings, Yousuf said the all-rounder can win and lose matches for both sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today he won the match for Pakistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s designated chief selector, Rashid Latif felt that India made a mistake by not selecting Yuvraj Singh for the Asia Cup particularly when Dhoni was not available and Suresh Raina had been sidelined.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why Yuvraj was not selected because he remains a limited overs player and today India missed his aggressive attitude and all round ability. I think his experience would have helped against the Pakistani spinners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Latif also felt that Kohli was a quality player but needed to curb his aggression to be successful as captain on the international front.</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s former batsman and former head coach Mohsin Khan said Afridi had shown why it was necessary to retain faith in senior players like him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think everyone contributed in the win but the way Afridi handled the pressure in the final over, that was the winning moment for Pakistan. He kept his nerves and won the match for Pakistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mohsin, who has also remained chief selector, pointed out that Pakistan should have won this match more comfortably after restricting India to a gettable total.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is the way this team plays it makes things difficult for itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pakistan&#8217;s banned fast bowler, Muhammad Aamir said that Pakistan had won a great match after a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Afridi showed his value to the team and he remains a big asset for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the match ended there were wild celebrations in every part of the country with youngsters waving Pakistan flags and banners and riding atop cars in the eastern city of Lahore where the match was followed with huge interest. </p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997593&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">An exquisite equaliser from Yaya Toure sparked a second-half comeback by Manchester City in the League Cup final on Sunday, with a 3-1 victory over Sunderland giving Manuel Pellegrini his first trophy as manager.</span></p>
<p>Returning to the stadium where Roberto Mancini&#8217;s City career ended in an FA Cup final loss last May, further Wembley misery appeared to be beckoning when Fabio Borini put Premier League struggler Sunderland in front after 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Instead, City, which has now scored 121 goals this season, remains on course for an improbable quadruple that would require all the resolve displayed in the second half to complete.</p>
<p>After a flat first-half performance, the recovery began after Toure nonchalantly curled into the net from 30 yards (meters) in the 55th minute, with Samir Nasri volleying home City&#8217;s second inside two minutes.</p>
<p>City fans were already celebrating just their third trophy in three years, following a 35-year title drought, when Jesus Navas completed a counterattack to add the third in the 90th minute.</p>
<p>After more than $1.5 billion of Abu Dhabi investment in less than six years, City has now won each of the domestic trophies in three years, following the 2011 FA Cup and 2012 Premier League title.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997263&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">In the same week as Roger Federer won the Dubai Championships, Grigor Dimitrov, known for his similarities with the master, edged out South Africa&#8217;s Kevin Anderson 7-6 (7-1) 3-6 7-6 (7-5) in a three-hour slugfest to claim his second career title with victory in the Acapulco International final on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>The 22-year-old, who won the Stockholm Open in October for his first title victory, claimed the first-set in a tiebreak but Anderson broke in the second game of the next and comfortably held serve to level the match at one set apiece.</p>
<p>Anderson carried the momentum into the third with another early break but handed back the initiative with a double fault on break point in the eighth game of the deciding set.</p>
<p>Dimitrov, who beat Wimbledon champion Andy Murray in the semi-finals, held on to take the decider into a tiebreak and completed the victory on his first match point to improve his head-to-head record against the South African to 4-1.</p>
<p>”Belief! That was the only thing that kept me (going) today. I didn&#8217;t think I was gonna come back after last night&#8217;s match. I felt really bad after the match,” Dimitrov told reporters, referring to his semi-final win that finished after 2:30 a.m. on Saturday. “Body is holding up. It will be great to get some rest, maybe tomorrow.”</p>
<p><strong>Consecutive losses</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It was a second heartbreaking loss in as many weeks for Anderson, who lost to Marin Cilic in the Delray Beach Open final last Sunday. “Right now it&#8217;s really disappointing&#8230; to come so close. It was possibly a match where I felt I was going to get it,” Anderson told reporters. “I&#8217;m going to have to move on, need to take positives and take belief.</p>
<p>In the women&#8217;s tournament played at the same venue, top seeded Slovakian Dominika Cibulkova battled past American Christina McHale 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 6-4 to win her fourth career title.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997261&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/rafaelnadalreutersm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1967499" alt="Rafael Nadal will be joined by Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray in the league " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/rafaelnadalreutersm1.jpg" /></a> Rafael Nadal will be joined by Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray in the league
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">World No. 1 Rafael Nadal will turn out for team Mumbai in the inaugural edition of the multi-million dollar International Premier Tennis League while Novak Djokovic was snapped up by team Dubai and Andy Murray by team Bangkok.</span></p>
<p>Four teams were drafted for the ambitious tournament, created by Mahesh Bhupathi, on Sunday in Dubai. Nadal, who will reportedly be paid a whopping $1.1 million per night by IPTL, will be accompanied by Pete Sampras, Rohan Bopanna, Sania Mirza, Ana Ivanovic, Gael Monfils and Fabrice Santoro in the Mumbai team. Serena Williams was picked by team Singapore while Victoria Azarenka and Caroline Wozniacki were picked up by team Bangkok and Dubai respectively.</p>
<p>The Mumbai leg of the round-robin tournament will be held on December 7, 8 and 9 at a yet-to-be-decided venue. Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka, David Ferrer, Agnieszka Radwanska, Jelena Jankovic and Somdev Devvarman were among the notable players who did not find any takers. However, they can still be a part of the event as the team owners still have the option of making additions to their squads with a maximum of 10 players are allowed.</p>
<p>The organisers said just under USD 24 million were spent by the teams on the 28 players who were sold but details of individual deals were not revealed. The identity of the owners too has been kept a secret. It is also not known how often the leading stars such as Murray and Nadal will actually play. Murray had previously said he was happy to play some but not all the matches but whether the smaller format will change his view remains to be seen. It was the same case with Nadal and Djokovic, who were not keen to play for the entire duration of the tournament.</p>
<p>The inaugural edition will be a four-team event instead of five as announced earlier. Kuala Lumpur, which was put forward as a possible venue earlier, had to be dropped from the first edition. There organisers did not specify any reasons for the same.</p>
<p>All four teams will compete in one of the cities over a three-day period before moving onto the next. The format will see a total of 24 matches played, with the first on November 28 in Singapore and the last on December 13, making it a shorter season than originally planned. A full fixture list is yet to be announced.</p>
<p>A total of 70 players had put their names forward for the auction. The draft took place in the presence of undisclosed team owners, Bhupathi, CEO Morgan Menahem, COO Eric Gottschalk and former world No. 1 Carlos Moya, who will be the VP of Player Relations for the league.</p>
<p>Bhupathi, the co-owner and managing director of the league, said the tournament is an answer to a growing demand for world class tennis in the Middle East and Asia. “We’ve got some unbelievably strong teams. I think out of the 27 players that got drafted we have about 21 Grand Slam champions. We have 14 present and past No1s. It’s a pretty blockbuster field,” Bhupathi was quoted as saying by Dubai-based website Sport360°.</p>
<p>Some players like Roger Federer have opted out of the tournament (see box) because it falls in the off-season, a time the professionals dedicate for rest and recuperation as have other top professionals like Maria Sharapova.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997256&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Veteran rally driver Sunny Sidhu won his seventh Maruti Suzuki Desert Storm title on Saturday after he finished more than 20 minutes ahead of the second-placed Sandeep Sharma of Thunderbolt team.</span></p>
<p>Driving a Mahindra XUV 500, Sidhu and his navigator PVS Murthy, took 12 hours, 42 minutes and 47 seconds to complete the five-legged cross-country rally which concluded in Jaipur on Saturday. Sharma and his co-driver Varun Davessar clocked 13:08.20 in their gypsy. Amartejpal Buwal and Nakul Mendiratta, of Team Thunderbolt, ended third with a time of 13:11.24.</p>
<p>Bangalore&#8217;s CS Santosh, riding a Suzuki, won the two-wheeler category with a time of 9:57.09, ahead of Austrian Helly Frauwallner who rode a Yamaha (10:15.38) and Suzuki&#8217;s Suresh Babu (11:31.45).</p>
<p>The 12th edition of the Desert Storm was flagged off from Delhi last Monday, with 250 Indian and foreign participants fighting for top honours. The six-day rally traversed through the desert and concluded in Jaipur on Saturday, covering almost 2,200 kilometres through the dune outback of Sardarshahar, Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Jaipur.</p>
<p>Defending champion Suresh Rana along with favourites Gaurav Gill and Karamjeet Singh had crashed out on Day One of the rally itself after suffering mechanical failures. Sidhu said he had to adopt a conservative approach, ensuring his car lasted for the entire duration of the race. “After those guys were out, I had to keep calm and make sure the car didn&#8217;t give up. So I drove conservatively, avoiding making any mistakes,” Sidhu said.</p>
<p>The organizers cancelled the final leg for ‘safety&#8217; reasons, without elaborating further.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997252&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Pankaj Advani began his campaign in style in the Snooker Nationals, Lucknow on Sunday, when he registered his career-best break of 145 in his Group N match. PSPB&#8217;s Advani was in his full flow against qualifier Anurag Giri of Madhya Pradesh in his first league match scripting 3-0 (86-22, 108(70)-00, 145(145)-00) win before a huge crowd.</span></p>
<p>In the course of the break of 145, Pankaj had to take two pinks instead of the black balls. The break remained Pankaj&#8217;s best so far in snooker, bettering his previous effort of 143. Had the pinks been traded for blacks, Advani would have notched the highest break possible in snooker, 147. However, that was not to be.</p>
<p>It was enough of a moment for match referee IS Malik, a former player himsef, to be proud to watch the match while officiating it. “As a veteran player , his positioning was so spotless that I was spellbound . I defeinitely feel honoured to be referee of such a break,” Malik said. In his second match, Pankaj outclassed Prabhu of Tamil Nadu 3-1 (88-08, 79-46, 32-80, 112(71)-05).</p>
<p>Defending champion Manan Chandra of PSPB had to struggle a bit before outplaying Punjab&#8217;s Anmoldeep Singh 3-2 (73-28, 72-29, 14-66, 40-62, 64-40).</p>
<p><strong>Other results:</strong> Brijesh Damani (PSPB) bt Rahul Berlia (WB) 3-2, Akshay Kumar (UP) bt Aditya Agarwal (Railways) 3-2, Shivam Arora (Bihar) bt Varghav Lakhar (Assam) 3-0, Aayush Kumar (Punjab) bt Vinayak Agarwal (Uttar Pradesh) 3-2. Sundeep Gulati (Delhi) bt Aneesh Saini (Haryana) 3-0, Sahil Nayyar (Punjab) bt Balaji Reddy (Karnataka) 3-2, Kanishk Jhanjharia (MP) bt Mundir Sherazi (Karnataka) 3-0, Devendra Joshi ( PSPB) bt Malkeet Singh (Railways ) 3-0, Sourav Kothari (PSPB) bt Subrat Das (Odisha) 3-0.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997250&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arvindbhatm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1998137" alt="Arvind Bhat beat Denmark's Hans-Kristian Vittinghus 24-22 19-21 21-11" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/arvindbhatm.jpg" /></a> Arvind Bhat beat Denmark&#8217;s Hans-Kristian Vittinghus 24-22 19-21 21-11
<p>His maiden national title had come belatedly, at age 29, and on Sunday, Arvind Bhat picked up his first-ever Grand Prix Gold title winning the German Open to cap a spectacular week at Mülheim an der Ruhr almost midway into his 30s. At 34, Bhat became the first Indian since P Gopichand to win a Grand Prix Gold-level title in Europe.</p>
<p>The earnest shuttler&#8217;s career received a fresh lease of life in Germany this week, where he&#8217;s played the club league every summer, when he bested Danish World No 25 Hans-Kristian Vittinghus 24-22 19-21 21-11 in a nearly hour-long final that tested both his defense and patience.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s taken time,” laughed the seasoned shuttler, adding “but it&#8217;s also taken time to come to terms with the fact that I was getting old!” Admitting that mentally getting accustomed to creaking joints and the fact that he was getting thumped occasionally by boys many years his junior was tougher, Bhat candidly said: “I had to accept that juniors were beating me in India, and they completely deserved being in the core group, even as us older guys were pushed to the sidelines.”</p>
<p><strong>Ranking freefall</strong></p>
<p>Bhat, who has slipped to World No 87 now (he&#8217;s an unfancied 10th among internationally-ranked Indians) was up against a sprightly 25-year-old — though the Dane&#8217;s aggression ended up aggravating his dodgy back midway through the match, just before he dragged it into the decider.</p>
<p>Vittinghus had a 4-point lead in the opener at 12-8, but the Indian showed remarkable doggedness to draw level, and was snapping at the younger man&#8217;s heels chasing down shuttles tirelessly. Bhat twice saved game-points in the first-set before winning it 24-22 with an authoritative 3-point surge to close out the opener.</p>
<p>The lanky Bangalorean, whose prime years were thought to be half a deacde back, maintained the tempo in the second, before inexplicably allowing the Dane to inch back into the match, before his back spasms struck. While Vittinghus had upped the ante with an offensive flurry, he needed medical attention at 19-18 after he limped court-side and showed discomfort pointing to his taped back.</p>
<p>“It was tough when he took that break, because I started thinking ahead of myself, about winning. I also had to factor in the chance that maybe his back wasn&#8217;t as bad as he made it out to be and it was just to give me a false sense of confidence. Anyway, I was determined to not win by a walkover,” Bhat stressed. An old warhorse of the circuit, and no stranger to such tricks, Bhat said he kept his focus, knowing how much this final meant to him.</p>
<p><strong>Dream week</strong></p>
<p>Though the Dane levelled the set-scores and (a change of shirt later) began prancing around the court with the same pre-injury purpose, Bhat looked more resolute than ever. In a dreamy week where he beat a range of players from talented to tricky to temperamental ones — Yun Hu, Daren Liew, Viktor Axelsen and Tien Chen Chou — Bhat was determined to not falter at the last hurdle.</p>
<p>A winner of minor titles — the Scottish and Czech Opens — and a finalist at Bitburger in Germany five years ago, Bhat had been almost training by himself in Bangalore even as he made peace with where he stood against India&#8217;s younger contenders. “I realised I couldn&#8217;t train like when younger, mindlessly hard. I needed to be smart about it,” he says, adding that though he&#8217;d been feeling good about his game, there were no indications at the start of the week that he could go all the way.</p>
<p>“I frankly didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d go past the second round. But the slower shuttles early on suited my flicks and clears, and as the courts got faster in semis and final, I was hitting very well. Against Hans-Kristian, I knew I was playing better than him, but needed to keep my cool,” he added.</p>
<p>Arvind Bhat came very close to beating K Srikanth, India&#8217;s best young talent, earlier at Lucknow this year, a match that gave him plenty of confidence. However, the German title was reward for a man who&#8217;s persevered through the transition from being India&#8217;s prime shuttler to one bullied to the sidelines by juniors, a decade younger. However, the celebrations will be quiet, and only when he gets home. “I want to rush home. I&#8217;m getting older!” he chortled.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997244&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">England&#8217;s spinners shared eight wickets to dismiss West Indies for 159 in 44.2 overs in the second one-day cricket international on Sunday with Lendl Simmons resisting with a top score of 70 off 98 balls.</span></p>
<p>Newcomer Stephen Parry led the way for the tourists with 3-32 while off-spinners Joe Root (2-15), James Tredwell (2-39) and Moeen Ali (1-11) also impressed.</p>
<p>The West Indies, fresh off a dramatic victory in Friday&#8217;s opening match, collapsed early on to 30-3 after England won the toss and sent them in for the second straight match.</p>
<p>Root claimed opener Dwayne Smith (5) to a catch at midwicket and also removed Kirk Edwards (9) thanks to a sharp slip catch by Tredwell.</p>
<p>Inbetween, left-hander Kieran Powell (16) chipped a return catch to Ali.Simmons shared successive half century stands with the Bravo brothers, Darren and captain Dwayne, to help revive the innings.</p>
<p>Simmons compiled his second straight half century and dominated a fourth wicket stand of 51 with Darren Bravo (13), who eventually dragged on trying to guide Stuart Broad to third man at 81-4 in the 23rd over.Simmons, who hit four fours and two sixes, then added 52 with Dwayne Bravo who hit one boundary in 20 runs off 38 balls before a controversial stumping sparked a decline which saw the final six wickets fall for 26 runs.</p>
<p>Bravo was out of his ground after Tredwell&#8217;s delivery but wicketkeeper Jos Buttler appeared to break the stumps with his gloves as the ball came loose from his grip. After that, the tail subsided meekly with the 28-year-old Parry claiming Simmons to a catch in the deep and adding the scalps of Darren Sammy and Sunil Narine.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> West Indies 159 in 44.2 overs (L Simmons 70, Dwayne Bravo 20, K Powell 16; S Parry 3/32, Root 2/15) vs England.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997237&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Australian captain Michael Clarke hit an unbeaten 161 to guide his team to a strong position before rain disrupted his team&#8217;s bid to take a stranglehold on the second day of the third and final Test against South Africa at Newlands on Sunday. Australia were 494 for seven when a storm swept in on the back of high winds and prevented any play after mid-afternoon.</span></p>
<p>Before the rain, Australia were on target to take their total past 500 and subject South Africa to a challenging examination from the tourists&#8217; fast bowlers in what was shaping as a mirror image of the domination achieved by South Africa in the second Test in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Clarke said it was a “very satisfying” innings. “There were some tough stages yesterday (Saturday). Morne Morkel bowled a couple of pretty quick spells, bowling around the wicket with a set plan to attack the emblem on my helmet.</p>
<p>“That was difficult to get through but most important is we&#8217;ve got 494 runs on the board and I&#8217;m extremely pleased withthe position we&#8217;re in.” Clarke said Australia were determined to push for a win which would seal a series that is tied at one match each.</p>
<p>He said there was some inconsistent bounce. “Hopefully it continues to deteriorate and gets a little more up and down. But we&#8217;re going to have to bowl well, it&#8217;s still a very good batting wicket.”</p>
<p>South African bowler Kyle Abbott, who bowled two tight spells in difficult, windy conditions, said he thought the pitch would stay good for batting through most of the rest of the match. “We&#8217;ve got to bat as well as they have,” he said. We have to keep positive. As soon as you start thinking of a draw, or any negative thoughts, you come unstuck.”</p>
<p>Australia scored 163 runs in 39.4 overs on Sunday, blunting a depleted South African pace attack with an almost-new ball at the start of the day and then going for their shots. Part-time off-spinner JP Duminy claimed Test-best figures of four for 73, taking three wickets after lunch as Australia went for quick runs.</p>
<p>With strike bowler Dale Steyn out of action after suffering a hamstring injury on the first day, the key for Australia was to prevent the South African bowlers from making a breakthrough early in the day with an almost-new ball.</p>
<p>Abbott bowled an outstanding spell of six overs during which he conceded only one run —but couldn&#8217;t take a wicket, while Vernon Philander went for 39 runs in his six-over morning spell.</p>
<p><strong>Long wait </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Clarke, who was on 92 overnight, quickly went to 99 but then faced 24 deliveries &#8211; 23 of them from Abbott &#8211; without being able to get the run to bring up his fifth century against South Africa. It finally came with a cover drive for four off Philander. He had faced 215 balls and hit 11 fours.</p>
<p>Smith, meanwhile, played some aggressive strokes, which included a straight six off Philander. He made 84 in a fourth wicket stand of 184 with Clarke before he chopped a wide delivery from part-time left-arm spinner Dean Elgar into his stumps. He hit nine fours and three sixes in a 155-ball innings.</p>
<p>Shane Watson, playing in his first match of the series, survived a review off the first ball he faced when Elgar appealed for leg before wicket but went on to make an aggressive 40 off 32 balls with two fours and three sixes. In trying to hit Duminy for a fourth six he mistimed a shot to long-off.</p>
<p>Brad Haddin also perished playing an attacking shot and Mitchell Johnson was caught down the legside first ball by wicketkeeper AB de Villiers off Duminy.</p>
<p>Clarke, who had gone 11 Test innings without making more than 24 runs, batted with increasing confidence and reached 150 for the tenth time in his career off 288 balls when he clipped Abbott for his 17th four.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Australia 494/7 in 127.4 overs (M Clarke 161 not out, D Warner 135, S Smith 84; Duminy 4/73, Steyn 1/44)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997234&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Ajmal, in perhaps all of world cricket today, has the widest range of varieties to his conventional off-spin.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997233&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saeed Ajmal came on to bowl during the 17th over of India’s innings. The batsmen, Rohit Sharma on 53 and Ajinkya Rahane on 12, were well set. During his first over, both Rohit and Rahane looked out for the ball that has made Ajmal a household name — the deadly doosra. It never came.</p>
<p>Ajmal, in perhaps all of world cricket today, has the widest range of varieties to his conventional off-spin. Yet, for his first 16 balls — nearly a third of his entire spell — Ajmal didn’t land a single wrong ‘un. He stuck to his basics, employing the simple off-spinner with plenty of flight, and conceded just four runs.</p>
<p>When it did arrive, half way through his third over, it surprised Rahane. As any suprise ball should. The batsman looked to work the ball through midwicket. It pitched on middle and spat past his bat. Rahane barely survived a stumping appeal. Immediately, Ajmal went back to his stock ball, the big turning off-spinner, and bowled two more dots. Three overs, five runs. One doosra.</p>
<p>The 36-year old had proved his point. In an era where the role of a spinner in the shorter formats has become all about thinking out-of-the-box by inventing newer variations to fox big-hitting willow wielders, Ajmal showed that conventional wisdom still has a place in this game. On a non-condusive wicket, Ajmal kept a simple plan of attacking the off-stump with appropriate fields and was brave enough to give the ball some air. It worked, of course.</p>
<p>In his first five overs, Ajmal took no wickets but conceded just two boundaries. By then, India’s chances of a big total had vanished. He didn’t have to cull the Indian batters; just a simple choke was enough.</p>
<p>In fact, until his penultimate over, the 47th of the match, Ajmal wouldn’t take a wicket. But here, bowling his ninth over against the lower middle-order and the tail — players who aren’t equipped enough to block off his variations — the doosra came out from hiding. Ambati Rayudu fell to it while trying to up the run-rate with a slog and Ravichandran Ashwin was stumped against it when stepping aimlessly down the track.</p>
<p>Ashwin must’ve walked back to the dressing room with a lot more than just nine runs. Not only did Ajmal show him how and when to use the variations, but also taught his Indian counterpart the importance of sticking by the stock ball.</p>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afghanistancricketreuterslm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997824" alt="Cash awards were announced for the victorious Afghanistan team (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afghanistancricketreuterslm.jpg" /></a> Cash awards were announced for the victorious Afghanistan team (Reuters)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">In Jalalabad, the fans opened fire and apparently twenty people were injured. In Dhaka, the players danced to Kumar Sanu and Alka Yagnik’s numbers the whole night, with left-arm seamer Shapoor Zadran stealing the show on the make-shift dance floor. Welcome to celebrations, Afghanistan style.</span></p>
<p>The high and mighty, also, joined in. President Hamid Karzai picked up the phone and congratulated the whole team. Finance minister Ishaq Dar announced a cash award of $1,000 each for the squad. Afghanistan Cricket Board added another $1,000 to the package. But that’s not the end of the story.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the team had a muted on-field celebration after their biggest victory in cricket at Fatullah last night. Afghanistan’s senior most player Karim Sadiq explained: “The home fans were already upset and a wild celebration at the ground would have hurt them more. So we decided to wait. Once we reached the hotel, we let our hair down,” Sadiq said, speaking to The Indian Express.</p>
<p>“First, the President called. Then the finance minister spoke to the team management on phone and finally Bollywood took over. From Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman to Chennai Express, every Shah Rukh Khan movie is very popular in Afghanistan. One of those pictures was playing on the video, but for a change no one seemed to be interested last night. We all were dancing and singing and then someone turned on the music player and it started to roll out Kumar Sanu and Alka Yagnik songs.</p>
<p>The celebrations continued till the early hours and today we’ve a celebration dinner,” he added.</p>
<p>Fans back home took their merriment to the wild side. “Ah, they had gone mad. A friend sent me a video this morning. People came down to the streets in Jalalabad and Kabul and opened fire. Crazy celebrations! I heard 20 of them were injured. I wish they recover quickly,” Sadiq said.</p>
<p>“This is just the beginning. For the first time we are playing on such a big stage and we won an ODI against a full member in just four attempts. This victory has given us belief and we will carry forward this belief to the World T20. We think we can reach the quarterfinals there because we’ve a good team and T20 is anybody’s game,” said captain Mohammad Nabi.</p>
<p>Eyes are now fixed on the bigger stage and of course on the IPL. Who knows, a good in the upcoming World T20 and the door might be ajar for Nabi and Co. next year.</p>
<p><strong>Up Next: Sri Lanka</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The immediate goal, however, is to do well in the rest of the Asia Cup. On Monday, Afghanistan take on the table toppers Sri Lanka, who have both their matches so far, against Pakistan and India.</p>
<p>With two wins and a healthy runrate of +0.168, Sri Lanka have virtually assured themselves of a berth in the finals of Asia Cup, while Afghanistan’s hopes of further progress in the tournament will depend on the outcome of the match on Monday.</p>
<p>Afghanistan have four points from two matches with one win and a loss in their kitty. However, they don’t have anything to lose from this tournament as they are featuring in the Asia Cup for the first time in its history.</p>
<p>Should Afghanistan beat Sri Lanka, it would complete a fairytale journey for them in the tournament, giving the war-torn nation a desperately needed boost. Their victory over Bangladesh was wildly celebrated back home on the streets.</p>
<p>Afghanistan coach Kabir Khan has already sounded a warning bell for India and Sri Lanka, stating that they are “hungry to win” against them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/afridireutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997085" alt="Shahid Afridi celebrates after hitting the winning six against India on Sunday. Afridi scored 34 (not out) (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/12/afridireutersm.jpg" /></a> Shahid Afridi celebrates after hitting the winning six against India on Sunday. Afridi scored 34 (not out) (Reuters)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Two wickets inside three balls in the penultimate over and an inexplicable crossover made the task very difficult for Pakistan. The final over of the match began with Pakistan needing 10 runs for victory with just two wickets in hand and Shahid Afridi not on strike. Ravichandran Ashwin bowled Saeed Ajmal round his legs to take India closer to an unlikely victory. But all said and done, Pakistan were basically just a couple of big hits away.</span></p>
<p>And that was exactly what happened. Though Ashwin got Saeed Ajmal out bowled around his legs in the first ball, Afridi was back on strike in the third ball. Ashwin pushed the long-on and long off right to the ropes and also gave a real zip to his carrom balls but Afridi connected both the deliveries, though he failed to time them properly. Still, they sailed over long and wide long-off respectively. Game over. Incredibly, the straight boundaries were set only at 65 metres for this game.</p>
<p>Pakistan got themselves under enormous pressure during the chase, but 245 was never going to be a winning total on this pitch. Despite several stumbles, Pakistan finally made it, thanks to Afridi at the end and Mohammad Hafeez at the start. Afridi’s last big innings came eight months ago, on July 13 last year at Providence. He made 76 at a strike rate of 138. Of late he has become more of a bowler than batsman. On Sunday, he played a blinder, hitting 34 not out off 18 balls when things threatened to spiral out of control in the chase. “I’m very happy for Afridi. He copped so much criticism. But we always have faith in his ability. He’s a match-winner,” captain Misbah-ul-Haq said. Virat Kohli naturally looked very dejected after the match and rued the “errors” which his team “kept on repeating”. But today, for a change, he was backed well by his bowlers.</p>
<p>Amit Mishra, who sat on the bench for an eternity, finally got a game and proved to be a good choice in spin-friendly conditions. An outstanding first spell of eight overs that went for just 16 runs and got him two wickets brought India back into the contest. Till his introduction in the 13th over, Pakistan were taking the game away from their arch-rivals. Mishra bagged opener Ahmed Shehzad with a straight one that pitched short but skidded off the surface.</p>
<p>Shehzad pulled it straight to Ashwin at short mid-wicket. Then Misbah was run out, thanks to a misunderstanding between him and Hafeez. Mishra had a fantastic pick-up at the bowling end and broke the stumps. The leggie also removed in-form Umar Akmal with a flighted delivery as Ravindra Jadeja took a very good running catch. After a 71-run opening partnership, Pakistan slipped to 114 for four.</p>
<p><strong>Steadying the ship</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Young Sohaib Maqsood steadied the ship with an 87-run fifth wicket partnership with Hafeez and made his team favourites again, but the latter departed after scoring 75 off 117 balls and Maqsood followed him — another misunderstanding, another run out. With 43 required off the last five overs, it came down to Afridi. Umar Gul dispatched Bhuvneshwar Kumar over deep mid-wicket but got out to the same bowler in the 49th over. Three balls later debutant Mohammad Talha crossed over as he got out, forgetting that it was the last delivery of Kumar’s over.</p>
<p>“Such things happen in cricket but that could really be a big miss for us. Thanks to the almighty we managed to pull this one through,” said Misbah.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping india in check</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, India made a below par score batting first. It has become a case of India scoring big only if Kohli scores big. When Kohli guided an away-goer from Gul to ’keeper Akmal when he was on five the writing was on the wall for India. Rohit Sharma looked to have found his touch and reached a half-century but Saeed Ajmal’s introduction to the attack checked the run flow and an inexperienced middle-order failed to set a platform.</p>
<p>Rohit top-edged a pull to deep mid-wicket off Talha and Hafeez took a very good catch, avoiding collision. Rahane also got out to Talha.</p>
<p>Dinesh Karthik was removed by Hafeez, but Rayudu handled spin well and scored his second ODI half-century. Then a late-order blitz from Jadeja (52 off 49 balls) took India to some respectability but he was lucky to survive a very confident leg-before shout when he was on seven and then was dropped by Hafeez on 12.</p>
<p>Theoretically, India are still not eliminated from the tournament. If Pakistan lose to Bangladesh and they win with a bonus point against Afghanistan, Kohli’s men have a chance. But the skipper himself said, he has “personally stopped putting his money” on that possibility.</p>
<p><strong>A rollercoaster of a climax</strong></p>
<p><em>Batting first, India were 77 runs away from their eventual total (245/5) at the end of the 40th over, at 168/5. At the same point, Pakistan were 11 runs better, and with a wicket less to worry about. Yet, as is the case with India-Pakistan matches, the chase went down to the last over.</em></p>
<p><strong>41st:</strong> Off the last ball of the over, Shohaib Maqsood smacks Amit Mishra over long-on for a six. It’s the first boundary hit off Mishra, coming as late as his ninth over. Pakistan steal 11 runs from the over.</p>
<p><strong>42nd:</strong> Ravindra Jadeja bowls a maiden to Mohammad Hafeez, increasing the equation to 56 from 48.</p>
<p><strong>43rd:</strong> Mohammed Shami gives away just three runs from his fist four balls. But off his fifth, he is swiped away for a maximum by Hafeez. A dot is bowled, but Pak still just need a chaseable 47 from 42.</p>
<p><strong>44th:</strong> Ashwin takes the wicket — Pakistan’s top-scorer, Hafeez with 75. He concedes just three runs from the over and ups the required run-rate to over seven an over — 7.33 (44 from 36).</p>
<p><strong>45th:</strong> Maqsood, the other well set batsman at this point, is run out by the new batsman, Shahid Afridi, off the fourth ball. He is gone for 38 and Mishra has only given away a run. Afridi, who hasn’t hit a fifty in his last 20 ODI innings, has a task at hand.</p>
<p><strong>46th:</strong> Off the third ball, Afridi sends Jadeja over the ropes at cow-corner for six. The next ball is nicked over the ‘keeper for four more. Pakistan, requiring 30 runs from the last four overs, keep themselves in the chase.</p>
<p><strong>47th:</strong> A four and a six is smacked off this Bhuvneshwar over as well. Afridi flicks the pacer from outside off-stump to square leg for a boundary. Then Umar Gul hoicks one over midwicket for six. Off the last ball, Gul thumps one to long-off and steals two. Pakistan now need less than a run-a-ball.</p>
<p><strong>48th:</strong> Shami gives away just four and Pakistan need 13 from 12.</p>
<p><strong>49th:</strong> Bhuvneshwar pulls India back with a double-strike. Gul holes out at long-off before Mohammad Talha does the same off the last ball, but not before crossing the strike and leaving the second-last batsman (Saeed Ajmal) to face the first ball off the last over.</p>
<p><strong>50th:</strong> Ajmal, expectedly, is bowled by Ashwin. But off the very next ball, Junaid Khan, the last man rotates the strike. Pakistan need nine from the last four. Afridi boom booms two sixes. The match is over with a couple of balls to spare. — <strong>ENS</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997228&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahidafridiapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997072" alt="Shahid Afridi sealed the game for Pakistan with consecutive sixes in the last over (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/shahidafridiapm.jpg" /></a> Shahid Afridi sealed the game for Pakistan with consecutive sixes in the last over (AP)
<p>Yes it&#8217;s an Indo-Pak contest, yes we expect it to be exciting, yes it does go down to the wire, yes there is electric atmosphere in the stands, but this one in Mirpur was a bit too much even by those standards.</p>
<p>Pakistan, after getting off to an electric start, like always, blew it away. Our dear neighbours lost as many as three wickets in a hurry, and all of a sudden, found themselves in familiar territory. A 71-run opening stand, and the team, in no time, was reduced to 113/4.</p>
<p>It was then when the Professor &#8211; Mohammed Hafeez &#8211; dictated terms in the middle. Playing against his favourite opposition &#8211; he averages more than 45 against India &#8211; Hafeez was in complete command of the proceedings. Along with Sohaib Maqsood, he countered the Indian spinners, and seamers, with utmost ease.</p>
<p>And, then the Indo-Pak thing happened. After going wicketless for more than 20 overs, Indian bowlers took two in a hurry. In space of ten deliveries, Hafeez and Maqsood were both back in the hut.</p>
<p>What next? Or who next? Sahibzada Mohammad Shahid Khan Afridi. And, rest, they say, is history.</p>
<p><strong>Sensible Afridi</strong></p>
<p>Surprised? A term not often associated with the aggressive right-hander, who has the reputation to throw away starts and matches, at will!</p>
<p>This time around, against the opposition which brings the best out of him, Afridi sealed the game. Coming into bat in a tense situation, Afridi had to play sensibly. Going after everything was not the need of the hour since the run-rate required was not out of reach. He did what the situation wanted him to do, and sealed the thrilling encounter in fitting fashion &#8211; with a six.</p>
<p><strong>Turning Mishra</strong></p>
<p>Team India&#8217;s eternal tourist finally got a game on Sunday. And, what a game it was. A must-win Asia Cup fixture against arch-rivals Pakistan and the task of bowling second with the dew.</p>
<p>Not the setting Mishra would have liked after warming the bench for so long.</p>
<p>Leg-spinners are a treat to watch. And the way Mishra bowled today, the treat turned out to be even more delicious. An easy run-up, simple pivot and a perfect release.</p>
<p>The pitch, which many termed as a flat deck, started behaving differently during Mishra&#8217;s spell. The odd one was gripping the surface, and the spinner was extracting a lot of side turn. His figures of 2/28 make a decent reading, but he bowled much better than that.</p>
<p><strong>Captain, you beauty!</strong></p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t score with the bat, but made his presence felt with the decisions on the field. Smartly rotating his bowlers, accurately placing the fields and making the right calls under pressure highlight captain Virat Kohli&#8217;s day in the office.</p>
<p>The Delhi dasher was thinking on his feet. He didn&#8217;t wait for an error, he forced one. Didn&#8217;t wait for an edge, created one. Didn&#8217;t wait for a collapse, triggered one.</p>
<p>Captaincy is not about the resources you field for the match, but the way you extract the most out of those resources. The way he used Mishra was a delight to watch. He gave the leg-spinner attacking fields &#8211; even two slips and silly point &#8211; on occasions and backed him to succeed, even under pressure.</p>
<p>Many would argue against certain calls he took. For starters, giving Bhuvi the 49th over.</p>
<p>But, it&#8217;s cricket and it&#8217;s a game of glorious uncertainties.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997059&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two moments of magic in the space of two second-half minutes helped Manchester City to a 3-1 victory over Sunderland in the English League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday.</p>
<p>Manuel Pellegrini&#8217;s favourites were trailing to Fabio Borini&#8217;s 10th minute strike for Sunderland and a shock looked on the cards until Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri intervened.</p>
<p>Jesus Navas completed the turnaround late on.</p>
<p>Toure curled in City&#8217;s equaliser after 55 minutes before Nasri thumped home the winner to snatch the season&#8217;s first silverware for Pellegrini&#8217;s title-chasing side.</p>
<p>It was City&#8217;s first League Cup title since 1976.</p>
<p>&#8220;We needed to win today, it was very important. And we deserved it the way we played in the second half,&#8221; Toure told Sky Sports.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today we showed we are a great team. I think it was my best goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sunderland spent the opening five minutes entrenched inside their own half as City, who scored 19 goals en route to the final, moved the ball around with ease on the lush turf.</p>
<p>But minutes later the ball was in the back of the City net.</p>
<p>There seemed no imminent danger as Borini closed down Vincent Kompany but City&#8217;s skipper was guilty of over-complication and Borini robbed him of the ball before bursting into the penalty area and thumping a shot with the outside of his right boot past Costel Pantilimon.</p>
<p>City dominated possession for the rest of the half without ever carving open a Sunderland rearguard bolstered by former Manchester United stalwarts Wes Brown and John O&#8217;Shea.</p>
<p>Phil Bardsley, who scored in Sunderland&#8217;s semi-final penalty shootout win over United, reacted superbly to deny Sergio Aguero a certain goal but keeper Vito Mannone was not required to make any outstanding saves.</p>
<p>Sunderland were always dangerous on the counter-attack and could have doubled their lead when Borini ran through on goal from a suspiciously offside position but Kompany recovered to nick the ball away as the Italian cocked his leg to shoot.</p>
<p>A city onslaught was expected at the start of the second half but again, Sunderland continued to impress.</p>
<p>Ki Sung-yueng, part of the Swansea City side to lift the trophy last season, let fly from 30 metres, forcing Pantilimon to tip his dipping strike over the crossbar.</p>
<p>Then the wheels fell off Sunderland&#8217;s bandwagon.</p>
<p>One nonchalant swing of Toure&#8217;s right leg sent a curling 25 metre shot beyond the fingertips of Mannone after 55 minutes and two minutes later Nasri turned the final on its axis with an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area after Aleksandar Kolarov&#8217;s cross was half cleared.</p>
<p>It was cruel on Sunderland who until then had been worth their lead but a further demonstration of the formidable firepower available to Pellegrini.</p>
<p>Sunderland refused to capitulate and once their heads had cleared from the shock of two lightning bolts they began to pose some serious questions of a city defence that still looked vulnerable to crosses.</p>
<p>With Sunderland throwing men forward substitute Steven Fletcher hit a shot straight at Pantilimon and they battled gamely until the end to no avail.</p>
<p>Substitute Navas made absolutely sure there was no way back for Sunderland with City&#8217;s third on the stroke of full time.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1997052&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rayuduappm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996976" alt="Asia Cup 2014: Ambati Rayudu hit a gritty fifty under pressure against Pakistan (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rayuduappm.jpg" /></a> Asia Cup 2014: Ambati Rayudu hit a gritty fifty under pressure against Pakistan (AP)
<p><em><strong>Offie Saeed Ajmal ends with impressive figures of 3/40 as Ambati Rayudu&#8217;s second ODI fifty pushes India to respectable total. <a title="Asia Cup 2014 Live Score: Ambati Rayudu, Ravindra Jadeja push India to 245" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-live-score-india-bat-in-high-voltage-clash-amit-mishra-gets-a-game/" target="_blank">(Catch it LIVE)</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The coin went up in the air, and Pakistan skipper Misbah-ul-Haq got the spin in his favour. With no hesitation and dew in his mind, he invited the opposition to bat. A struggling Indian opening combination took crease, and signalled intent right from the word go.</p>
<p>Surprise! surprise! Rohit Sharma found the middle early, and made going tough for the Pakistan new ball attack, which had a spinner from one end. The move of starting with a spinner raised eyebrows, but all of that was put to rest when Hafeez, with his accurate offies, scalped Shikhar Dhawan early.</p>
<p>In walked the Indian skipper Virat Kohli. For a change, all the attention was directed towards Rohit, who was timing the ball sweetly.</p>
<p><strong>Been there, done that</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rohitsharma.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1996982" alt="RohitSharma" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rohitsharma.jpg?w=600&#038;h=400"   /></a></p>
<p>Rohit is probably one cricketer who you can love, hate, but can&#8217;t ignore. After a lean patch, he comes up with a performance to remember.</p>
<p>In the previous fixture, the right-hander faced a hard time in the middle. The feet was not moving and boundaries weren&#8217;t coming. This is not a new situation for Rohit, who has on a lot of occasions come under pressure for not scoring on consistent basis. One good knock follows a string of poor performances.</p>
<p>After a poor tour of New Zealand and South Africa, a good &#8216;Rohit knock&#8217; was due, due big time. It was a different Rohit today. The one who we always want to see, but don&#8217;t see that often. He picked the lengths to perfection, lofted with impeccable timing and operated with the calculation of a mathematician and precision of a surgeon.</p>
<p>Wickets were tumbling at the other end, but Rohit maintained his own. Against the run of play, Rohit attempted one shot too many and was scalped by debutant Talah for a 58-ball 56.</p>
<p><strong>Crafty Ajmal</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajmall.jpg"><img alt="Ajmall" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/ajmall.jpg?w=480&#038;h=556" width="480" height="556" /></a></p>
<p>How often have we seen a spinner start proceedings in the batting powerplays and the death overs? How often have seen a spinner, who bowls the 49th over of the innings, goes for only one and picks two wickets in the process?</p>
<p>The answer will be, &#8220;not very often&#8221;. But when the ball is in Ajmal&#8217;s hands, the-not-so-often happens. The off-spinner&#8217;s variations, and his control on them makes him unplayable. If not unplayable, then a very difficult bowler to score runs off. There is the doosra, the flatter off-spinner, the stock ball and the one that holds its line. Six balls to bowl in an over and this man has the capability of bowling four different ones.</p>
<p>Misbah used the spinner well as the Indians found him difficult on a track where the odd ball was gripping the surface. Well bowled Ajmal!</p>
<p><strong>Gritty Rayudu</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/raydyuuu.jpg"><img alt="Raydyuuu" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/raydyuuu.jpg?w=400&#038;h=600" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Still finding his &#8216;moment&#8217; in international cricket, Ambati Rayudu almost got one today. Coming into bat after Rohit&#8217;s wicket, in the 20th over of the innings, it was not an easy time to bat against the on-song Pakistan bowling line-up.</p>
<p>Known to clear the ropes at will, Rayudu played a different game. A game which the situation demanded in the middle. Along with Dinesh Karthik, he stitched a crucial partnership and didn&#8217;t do anything silly in the process. Turned it around for the ones and twos, and didn&#8217;t spare the looseners.</p>
<p>The right-hander couldn&#8217;t bat through the innings and was holed out in the deep shortly after bringing up his second ODI fifty.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996973&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alanpardewapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996889" alt="Newcastle United's manager Alan Pardew,  right,  and Hull City's David Meyler, 3rd left, confront each other during the during the English Premier League match (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/alanpardewapm.jpg" /></a> Newcastle United&#8217;s manager Alan Pardew, right, and Hull City&#8217;s David Meyler, 3rd left, confront each other during the during the English Premier League match (AP)
<p>Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew was fined and warned by his club after he was sent off for headbutting a Hull City player while Chelsea and Liverpool claimed convincing away wins in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
<p>Pardew was fined 100,000 pounds ($167,600) and given a formal warning by Newcastle who said his behaviour was &#8220;unacceptable&#8221;, while FA chairman Greg Dyke said the governing body would investigate the incident.</p>
<p>Pardew was sent to the stands by referee Kevin Friend when he headbutted Hull midfielder David Meyler on the sideline after 72 minutes of Newcastle&#8217;s 4-1 win at Hull&#8217;s KC Stadium and he is likely to face a hefty FA fine and a touchline ban.</p>
<p>In the title race, Germany international Andre Schuerrle scored a hat-trick as leaders Chelsea went four points clear with a 3-1 victory at neighbours Fulham while Liverpool jumped into second spot with a 3-0 win at Southampton.</p>
<p>Brendan Rodgers&#8217; side leapfrogged Arsenal and Manchester City after the Gunners suffered a surprising 1-0 defeat at Stoke City due to a second-half Jon Walters penalty.</p>
<p>Manchester City were without a league match as they play Sunderland in the Capital One (League) Cup final on Sunday.</p>
<p>The results left Chelsea top with 63 points from 28 games, followed by Liverpool on 59 ahead of Arsenal on goal difference.</p>
<p>Fourth-placed City, who have two matches in hand on the clubs above them, have 57 points.</p>
<p>While Schuerrle&#8217;s Chelsea treble, and goals by Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling and a Steven Gerrard penalty for Liverpool, will make headlines for the right reasons, Newcastle manager Pardew&#8217;s name will be splashed across the back pages for the wrong ones.</p>
<p><strong>Sent off</strong></p>
<p>The unsavoury incident at Hull began when midfielder Meyler tried to move Pardew, who was standing by the touchline, out of the way to take a quick throw.</p>
<p>Meyler was handed a yellow card for his part in the fracas which quickly escalated involving a whole host of jostling players and officials.</p>
<p>Pardew, who was fined 20,000 pounds ($33,500) and banned for two matches at the start of last season for shoving an assistant referee, apologised for his behaviour on Saturday.</p>
<p>He told Sky Sports: &#8220;I will have to sit down from now on because that&#8217;s two or three incidents I&#8217;ve been involved in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to do anything aggressive but I did move my head forward and that&#8217;s enough. I wouldn&#8217;t have got involved if I&#8217;d been on the other side of the line. Perhaps it will teach me to sit down.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame because it took the gloss off a fantastic performance from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dyke, speaking in Zurich after a meeting of the International Football Association Board (IFAB), told reporters he had watched the incident, adding: &#8220;I&#8217;ve only just seen the clip and clearly it looks serious and we will investigate it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Formal warning</strong></p>
<p>Newcastle later issued a statement saying Pardew had accepted a formal warning and adding: &#8220;We have held discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies to the club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of Newcastle United.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was also involved in some drama of his own making on Saturday when, by his own admission, for the first time in his managerial career, he did not say a single word to his players at halftime.</p>
<p>Mourinho was so upset by Chelsea&#8217;s first-half performance at Craven Cottage against neighbours Fulham that he said he just looked at his team and walked out of the dressing room.</p>
<p>They responded with what he called &#8220;probably the best second-half performance of the season,&#8221; and kept up their great record at Fulham were they have lost once in 13 league games since the hosts were promoted to the Premier League in 2001.</p>
<p>&#8220;At halftime I told them nothing &#8211; nothing &#8211; not a word. I walked in, then I walked out. The second half was a great reaction to the worst performance of the season,&#8221; Mourinho was quoted as saying by the BBC.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second half was one of the best performances of the season. We moved the ball around well. If I could have made 11 changes I might have done, but I could only make three &#8211; so I did nothing. Schuerrle is cold in front of the goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have four points more than Arsenal. The gap to Man City is a fake advantage. If they win their games in hand, they&#8217;re top of the league. We&#8217;re behind them,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Schuerrle scored his three goals in 16 minutes and although John Heitinga pulled one back Fulham remain anchored to the bottom of the table four points from the safety zone.</p>
<p><strong>Big worry</strong></p>
<p>Arsenal lost ground in the title race at Stoke where Walters converted a 76th minute penalty after visiting central defender Laurent Koscielny handled the ball.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big worry to lose a game like that, it is a massive setback,&#8221; Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told the BBC.</p>
<p>Liverpool&#8217;s title chances got a boost at St Mary&#8217;s where they resisted Southampton&#8217;s impressive first-half display to keep the pressure on the their rivals at the top.</p>
<p>Suarez opened the scoring with an opportunist strike after 16 minutes for his 24th league goal this season in his 100th league match while Sterling got the second in the 58th after coming off the bench and Gerrard netted a last-minute penalty.</p>
<p>The win avenged the Saints&#8217; 1-0 victory at Anfield earlier in the season, Liverpool&#8217;s only home league defeat this term.</p>
<p>Saturday&#8217;s other match ended in a 1-0 win for Everton with Chelsea loanee Romelu Lukaku scoring the only goal after being introduced as a substitute following his recent injury layoff.</p>
<p>The win lifted Everton into sixth place above Manchester United who are without a game this weekend.</p>
<p>As well as the Manchester City-Sunderland League Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, there are three other league games with Tottenham Hotspur hosting Cardiff City, Aston Villa playing Norwich City and Swansea City welcoming Crystal Palace.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996884&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/pakwins.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1997558" alt="Pakistan celebrate after winning the Asia Cup one-day international cricket tournament against India in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Two wickets inside three balls in the penultimate over and an inexplicable crossover made the task very difficult for Pakistan. The final over of the match began with Pakistan needing 10 runs for victory with just two wickets in hand and Shahid Afridi not on strike. Ravichandran Ashwin bowled Saeed Ajmal round his legs to take India closer to an unlikely victory. But all said and done, Pakistan were basically just a couple of big hits away.</span></p>
<p>And that was exactly what happened. Though Ashwin got Saeed Ajmal out bowled around his legs in the first ball, Afridi was back on strike in the third ball. Ashwin pushed the long-on and long off right to the ropes and also gave a real zip to his carrom balls but Afridi connected both the deliveries, though he failed to time them properly. Still, they sailed over long and wide long-off respectively. Game over. Incredibly, the straight boundaries were set only at 65 metres for this game.</p>
<p>Pakistan got themselves under enormous pressure during the chase, but 245 was never going to be a winning total on this pitch. Despite several stumbles, Pakistan finally made it, thanks to Afridi at the end and Mohammad Hafeez at the start. Afridi’s last big innings came eight months ago, on July 13 last year at Providence. He made 76 at a strike rate of 138. Of late he has become more of a bowler than batsman. On Sunday, he played a blinder, hitting 34 not out off 18 balls when things threatened to spiral out of control in the chase. “I’m very happy for Afridi. He copped so much criticism. But we always have faith in his ability. He’s a match-winner,” captain Misbah-ul-Haq said. Virat Kohli naturally looked very dejected after the match and rued the “errors” which his team “kept on repeating”. But today, for a change, he was backed well by his bowlers.</p>
<p>Amit Mishra, who sat on the bench for an eternity, finally got a game and proved to be a good choice in spin-friendly conditions. An outstanding first spell of eight overs that went for just 16 runs and got him two wickets brought India back into the contest. Till his introduction in the 13th over, Pakistan were taking the game away from their arch-rivals. Mishra bagged opener Ahmed Shehzad with a straight one that pitched short but skidded off the surface.</p>
<p>Shehzad pulled it straight to Ashwin at short mid-wicket. Then Misbah was run out, thanks to a misunderstanding between him and Hafeez. Mishra had a fantastic pick-up at the bowling end and broke the stumps. The leggie also removed in-form Umar Akmal with a flighted delivery as Ravindra Jadeja took a very good running catch. After a 71-run opening partnership, Pakistan slipped to 114 for four.</p>
<p><strong>Steadying the ship</strong></p>
<p>Young Sohaib Maqsood steadied the ship with an 87-run fifth wicket partnership with Hafeez and made his team favourites again, but the latter departed after scoring 75 off 117 balls and Maqsood followed him — another misunderstanding, another run out. With 43 required off the last five overs, it came down to Afridi. Umar Gul dispatched Bhuvneshwar Kumar over deep mid-wicket but got out to the same bowler in the 49th over. Three balls later debutant Mohammad Talha crossed over as he got out, forgetting that it was the last delivery of Kumar’s over.</p>
<p>“Such things happen in cricket but that could really be a big miss for us. Thanks to the almighty we managed to pull this one through,” said Misbah.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping india in check</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, India made a below par score batting first. It has become a case of India scoring big only if Kohli scores big. When Kohli guided an away-goer from Gul to ’keeper Akmal when he was on five the writing was on the wall for India. Rohit Sharma looked to have found his touch and reached a half-century but Saeed Ajmal’s introduction to the attack checked the run flow and an inexperienced middle-order failed to set a platform.</p>
<p>Rohit top-edged a pull to deep mid-wicket off Talha and Hafeez took a very good catch, avoiding collision. Rahane also got out to Talha.</p>
<p>Dinesh Karthik was removed by Hafeez, but Rayudu handled spin well and scored his second ODI half-century. Then a late-order blitz from Jadeja (52 off 49 balls) took India to some respectability but he was lucky to survive a very confident leg-before shout when he was on seven and then was dropped by Hafeez on 12.</p>
<p>Theoretically, India are still not eliminated from the tournament. If Pakistan lose to Bangladesh and they win with a bonus point against Afghanistan, Kohli’s men have a chance. But the skipper himself said, he has “personally stopped putting his money” on that possibility.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996798&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/michaellumbapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996839" alt="Michael Lumb scored a hundred on ODI debut (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/michaellumbapm.jpg" /></a> Michael Lumb scored a hundred on ODI debut (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">England opener Michael Lumb hit 106 on debut but the West Indies battled back from precarious situations with bat and ball to seal a 15-run win in the opening One-day International on Friday at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium. When left-hander Lumb was flowing, England were favourite to chase down West Indies’ total of 269-6 off 50 overs.</span></p>
<p>But spinner Sunil Narine claimed 2-36 off 10 overs and captain Dwayne Bravo (1-59) and Ravi Rampaul (1-53) were lethal at the death to limit England to 254-6 off 50 overs and give the hosts a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.</p>
<p>Bravo had earlier been the savior with the bat, slamming an unbeaten 87 off 91 balls to lift the West Indies from the early peril of 45-4. The 30-year-old, later named Man of the Match, lashed eight fours and a six. Lendl Simmons and Darren Sammy added contrasting half centuries of their own to boost the hosts after a trio of England off-spinners had stalled the early innings.</p>
<p>Simmons compiled 65 off 94 balls and shared a restorative fifth wicket stand of 108 with Bravo. Sammy went berserk in smashing five fours and four sixes in 61 off 39 as he and his skipper added 116 off 62 balls towards the end.</p>
<p>The West Indies blasted 85 runs from the last five overs. Earlier, James Tredwell (10-1-23-1), Joe Root and Moeen Ali each took a wicket as the England slow men stifled the hosts. The series continues at the same venue on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> West Indies 269/6 ( Bravo 87 not out, Simmons 65,Bresnan 3/68,Tredwell 1/23) beat England 254/6 ( Lumb 106, Ali 44, Narine 2/36, Smith 1/30)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996565&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/davidwarnerapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996821" alt="David Warner attacked the South African bowlers from the third over of the day (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/davidwarnerapm.jpg" /></a> David Warner attacked the South African bowlers from the third over of the day (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Australia combined aggression and courage to seize control of the third and decisive Test against South Africa at Newlands on Saturday as they closed day one on 331 for three. While David Warner attacked with a brisk 135, Michael Clarke withstood a brutal spell of fast bowling from Morne Morkel. The Australian captain went to stumps with bruises on his hand, elbow, jaw, shoulder and midriff, but also with 92 to his name after a battling return to form.</span></p>
<p>Steve Smith was not out at the close after scoring a breezy 50 in an unbroken 114-run stand with Clarke that left South Africa facing a long road back into the match.</p>
<p>Warner attacked the South African bowlers from the third over of the day, when he took nine runs off Dale Steyn, and rarely let up on his way to a seventh Test century. Although he lost opening partner Chris Rogers in the first session and saw Alex Doolan depart just after lunch, Warner’s scoring rate ensured that South Africa never gained a real foothold.</p>
<p>The hosts were hampered by an injury to Steyn midway through the second session, which saw the fast bowler leave the field with a hamstring strain. He failed to return, and will undergo a fitness test on Sunday morning to see if he can rejoin the attack.</p>
<p>Steyn was replaced by Morkel, whose spell to Clarke from around the wicket produced a piece of pure theatre as the Australian captain was left ducking and diving and suffered regular blows to the body. While the one to his jaw felled him halfway through the 45th over of the day, Clarke got back to his feet and refused to be cowed even as Morkel peppered him with three more short balls.</p>
<p>The encounter proved the defining period of the day. Once Clarke had seen off Morkel he was able to play his way back into form against South Africa’s part-time spinners, who conceded more than four runs per over throughout the day.</p>
<p>Warner went to a chanceless century from 104 deliveries in the midst of Morkel’s barrage, but was eventually caught behind off the bowling of JP Duminy to end a telling 79-run stand with Clarke.</p>
<p>By that time Clarke was looking comfortable, if a little sore, and found another attacking partner in the form of Smith. As South Africa’s spinners failed to contain the pair, the match drifted further and further away from the home side. Even the second new ball brought no relief, with Clarke and Smith capitalizing on the harder ball by finding the boundary regularly in the final 30 minutes.</p>
<p>While Clarke enjoyed the gift of four overthrows in the penultimate over of the day, Smith went to his half-century with a cheeky ramp shot that summed up the turnaround in Australia’s fortunes over the past week. (AP)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viratkohliapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996844" alt="Virat Kohli &amp; Co. slipped up in the last match against Sri Lanka. Pakistan also lost to the same opposition in their opening-round game (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viratkohliapm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli &amp; Co. slipped up in the last match against Sri Lanka. Pakistan also lost to the same opposition in their opening-round game (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Ahead of their Asia Cup match at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium here on Sunday, Pakistan and India prepared differently.</span></p>
<p>Pakistan had a full training session where the frontline bowlers bowled to all top batters. The Indian players opted to rest as they opted for rest after their last night’s game.</p>
<p>Only Cheteshwar Pujara and Varun Aaron came out for practice but trained in different nets. Aaron bowled to a dummy batsman while bowling coach Joe Dawes monitored the length closely and offered advice. Pujara was practising pull shots, ramp and lap shots against the net bowlers.</p>
<p>Despite the low-key practice session, an India vs Pakistan game is a rare occasion. The last time they played a bilateral series was in India in 2012-13, a three-match affair that Pakistan won 2-1. Last time they played against each other was in the ICC Champions Trophy at Edgbaston last year, and India had won at a canter, bowling out their arch-rivals for 165 in 39.4 years. Pakistan also lost to India in the Asia Cup two years ago despite scoring 329 batting first. Virat Kohli’s sublime 183, after Sachin Tendulkar’s 48-ball 52, had clinched the deal for his team. Things have changed since and fresh faces have arrived in both camps, but when it comes to the ICC or ACC events, India have enjoyed an upper hand.</p>
<p>India, however, are going into this game on the heels of a poor run. They’ve won only once in their last seven ODIs and that too against Bangladesh. Pakistan, on the other hand, have recently won a bilateral series against Sri Lanka in the UAE and bagged a bonus point victory against Afghanistan two days ago.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will be a do-or-die affair for both the teams. Still, Pakistan team’s chief cricket consultant Zaheer Abbas claimed that the players are under no extra pressure. “The players want to play their game. The pressure comes from the fans. Media adds to that. We always play to win,” he said.</p>
<p>If Virat Kohli is the biggest positive for India, then the seamers and a weak middle-order are real problems. The stand-in India captain indirectly admitted the side’s batting fragility after the loss against Sri Lanka, saying they wanted to “strengthen” their batting.</p>
<p><strong>Best bowling attack</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Pakistan have the best bowling attack in the tournament with Umar Gul, Junaid Khan and Anwar Ali in charge of the seam attack and Saeed Ajmal and Shahid Afridi taking care of spin. Even Mohammad Hafeez made a big impact in the last match against Afghanistan with three wickets after Ajmal kept things tight at one end. Together the Pakistan spinners have bagged nine wickets in the first two matches, while India’s Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja have taken six. But yesterday, against Sri Lanka, both bowled well and once again a lot will depend on how they do in their combined 20 overs.</p>
<p><strong>At what expense</strong></p>
<p>That the Indian seamers don’t inspire confidence is an old story. Mohammed Shami takes wickets, seven scalps in the first two matches, but he leaks runs freely. Last night, in a relatively low-scoring game, he went for 81 in his 10 overs and it eventually decided the outcome. India don’t have a fast bowler like Gul, who can take wickets upfront and keep the batters in check at death. But Junaid’s wicket-less stint is a worry for Pakistan.</p>
<p>As far as batting is concerned, India’s hopes rest on Kohli, though Dhawan showed signs of returning to limited-overs form with a 114-ball 94 against Sri Lanka. Rohit Sharma has struggled and Ambati Rayudu is yet to prove himself. In a positive sense, the match against Pakistan gives the young middle-order the opportunity to make a bold statement.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s batting, too, looks jittery and only Umar Akmal is in form with a 74 in the first match and a century in the second. Misbah-ul-Haq has been strangely subdued but Hafeez is yet to get into the groove and the openers, Ahmed Shehzad and Sharjeel Khan haven’t hit the ground running yet. To help his batters return to form, Abbas had a simple advice: “Don’t hit lofted shots and play along the ground.”</p>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afghanistanapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996835" alt="Afghanistan players celebrate the wicket of a Bangladesh batsman. Afghanistan won by 32 runs, their first win over an ICC full member (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/afghanistanapm.jpg" /></a> Afghanistan players celebrate the wicket of a Bangladesh batsman. Afghanistan won by 32 runs, their first win over an ICC full member (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Considering it was Afghanistan’s first ODI win over an ICC full member the team’s celebrations were surprisingly muted. A group of Afghan fans in the stands looked rather more animated. Mohammad Nabi and his boys were a lot more business-like. Afghanistan beat Bangladesh by 32 runs in their Asia Cup fixture at Fatullah Cricket Ground on Saturday to create history. </span></p>
<p>“We’d to justify our participation on the big stage, and this is a historic moment,” said middle-order batsman Asghar Stanikzai, who scored 90*, as he dedicated this win to his countrymen.</p>
<p>In fact, Afghanistan could have won with a bonus point after the hosts lost four wickets for four runs inside eight balls during the chase. From 161 for four in 38.5 overs, they were reduced to 165 for eight in 40.1 overs. Still, 38 runs were needed to deny Afghanistan the bonus point. Ziaur Rahaman’s (41, 22 balls) desperate hitting saved Bangladesh from ignominy, but once Nabi brought himself back to the attack and cleaned up the danger man, Afghanistan’s win became a formality. Bangladesh folded for 222 in 47.5 overs, chasing 255. Nabi took three wickets with his off-spin, fast bowler Hamid Hassan took two before he limped off with a thigh injury. His new ball partner Shapoor Zardan too chipped in with a couple of wickets. But Stanikzai and Samiullah Shenwari were the chief architects of this landmark result.</p>
<p><strong>Standing tall</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>They added 164 runs for the sixth wicket and lifted their team from 90 for five at one stage to 254 in 50 overs. Bangladesh spinners were in full control when Stanikzai and Shenwari paired up. Their response was careful rebuilding, followed by mighty hitting. Shenwari was the man who took the challenge to the opposition, clobbering successive boundaries off left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak in the 40th over. Stanikzai joined in and then there was mayhem in the final 10 overs.</p>
<p>Medium pacer Rubel Hossain was clattered all over the park for 40 runs in his last four overs. Razzak and Arafat Sunny gave away 25 and 19 runs respectively in their last two overs. Rahaman too was taken to the cleaners. The two Afghan batters hit 12 fours and four sixes in the last 10 overs to turn the game on its head. Shenwari was run out for 81 (94 balls) but Stanikzai remained unbeaten on 90 in 103 deliveries. Their partnership demoralised Bangladesh.</p>
<p>In the chase, Bangladesh lost wickets at the wrong time. After two early wickets Mominul Haque (50) and captain Mushfiqur Rahim (23) added 67 runs for the third but both fell in quick succession. Nasir Hossain and Naeem Islam forged a 73-run partnership for the fifth wicket, but the asking rate was always climbing and despite some uncertain moments, Afghanistan didn’t falter on the home stretch. Shenwari deservedly bagged the Man of the Match award.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Afghanistan 254/6 (A Stanikzai 90, S Shenwari 81, A Sunny 2/44, M Haque 38/1) bt B’Desh 222 ( M Haque 50, Z Rahman 41, M Nabi 3/44, H Hassan 2/26)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996559&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Bespectacled Imam, blessed with the same silken sense of timing as his uncle, is the second highest scorer of the U-19 World Cup. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996556&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">It&#8217;s not the kind of serependipity you expect in Pakistan cricket. A fast bowler being transformed into a spinner, and him coming good. Few other nations in the cricket world after all have encouraged their youngsters to run in as fast as their legs can carry them and hurl thunderbolts with the same passion.</span></p>
<p>Karamat Ali too grew up dreaming of knocking batsmen&#8217;s heads and stumps off in that order. And the youngster too like many of his peers would try to emulate the feats of his fast-bowling heroes on TV while playing endless tape-ball cricket matches on the congested by-lanes of Lahore. The Pakistan U-19 star even insists on having begun his junior cricket career in 2006 with the sole goal of becoming his hometown&#8217;s most feared pacer. Fate, however, had other ideas and Ali would instead end up as a leg-spinner, a potent one at that, leading his country into the World Cup final solely with the trickery produced by his wrists. The unlikely transformation transpired on an unremarkable day at Lahore&#8217;s P&amp;T Gymkhana ground. One that the 17-year-old remembers fondly.</p>
<p>“There were no spinners that day and my coach had already told me that with my height (five feet six inches) fast bowling would be a difficult thing to master. He told me to bowl spin and the first ball I bowled, I beat the batsman. Next ball, the same thing happened and since then, beating batsmen is something that I just love doing,” he says. Over the last three weeks, Ali&#8217;s not just beaten a lot of batsmen he has left many of them flummoxed and befuddled.</p>
<p>Though it might not compare with the joy of seeing fear in the batsmen&#8217;s eyes like many of his countrymen have in the past—and continue to do so—the youngster does insist on deriving a lot of joy by seeing his opponents in a state of absolute shock after having been undone by his guile.</p>
<p>“The transformation wasn&#8217;t all that easy. My idea of bowling spin was flighting the ball. I simply tossed it up and in a week&#8217;s time, batsmen were hammering me to all corners. It was here that my coach stepped in, telling me to economize my use of flight and at times think like a fast bowler. Try and work a batsmen out,” he recalls.</p>
<p><strong>Mean googly</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>While he&#8217;s been a thorn in the opposition&#8217;s flesh througout the tournament, he reserved his best for England in the semi-final, even if he only finished with two victims. The first was with a regular leg-break, which pitched on middle and then broke away viciously, leaving batsman Ryan Higgins stranded miles down the wicket. Joe Clarke was next, bowled through the gap by a googly that would have put a smile on Mushtaq Ahmed&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>The third of five sons of an electrician with a small shop in one of Lahore&#8217;s bazaars, Ali dropped out of school in the eighth standard. His father was understandably displeased with his son&#8217;s decision. But luckily he found support from his mother.</p>
<p>Though it was the likes of Wasim and Waqar whose posters occupied Ali&#8217;s walls in his childhood, they have since been replaced by Shahid Afridi.</p>
<p><strong>Lefties have a mind of their own, I’m a different kind of Haq: Imam</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Imam-ul Haq laughs when that familiar question arrives. One of Pakistan&#8217;s biggest legends, the single-minded aggregator of runs renowned for his lazy elegance, Inzamam ul Haq, is Imam&#8217;s uncle. How big a role does the famous uncle play in his cricketing life?</span></p>
<p>“Its quite funny. Ninety per cent of people bring out my Chachu in their very first sentence to me. It is of course a very proud thing that he is my uncle. He does talk to me, but honestly, it is not like he assesses the way I play minutely,” he says. “He never talks to me about technique. He was always so calm and relaxed when he plays and is the same with me. The biggest lesson that he has taught me, is to not ease up. On 10 or on 100, you have to concentrate on the ball and do your job,” he says.</p>
<p>The bespectacled Imam, blessed with the same silken sense of timing as his uncle, is the second highest scorer of the U-19 World Cup. With 382 runs in six outings to his name, the 18-year-old Imam is the fulcrum of the Pakistan batting. He already has 1106 runs to his name in 28 international under-19 matches, and he is slowly navigating his way through First Class cricket.</p>
<p>However, it is Imam&#8217;s consistency at the World Cup that has fetched him praise. Whether it was his flowing 133 against Scotland, or a dogged 28 in the tense semi-final against England, one where he batted through the pain of a pulled hamstring, scoring runs is a constant for the boy from Lahore.</p>
<p>Son of a property dealer, Imam took to cricket only four years ago. In 2009, at the insistence of his father, he accompanied his elder brother to a cricket camp. Those two hours at a dusty Lahore ground were enough. “Earlier, I was more interested in studies, I love reading. But that day, I suddenly realized that I liked cricket too and I was pretty good with a bat in my hand,” he says. He started off, progressed gradually, and then found himself in the Pakistan U-19 team for the 2012 World Cup, aged just 16. Though he didn&#8217;t set the edition on fire, he says the experience has helped.</p>
<p>“Earlier, it was about hitting the ball hard, slashing away at anything outside the off-stump. For a while thing went to plan. But as the bowling got better, I started losing my wicket to such shots. I went back to my coaches, made some technical adjustments. The biggest was leaving well. After that, I played three First Class matches and playing against Mohammed Irfan, Umar Gul and Junaid Khan. It teaches you a lot. The more First Class you play, the learning increases,” he says.</p>
<p><strong>Anwar’s inputs</strong></p>
<p>Asked about whether he shares his uncle’s personality, Imam disagrees. “We are so completely different. I am a very desperate person. I just want to score no matter what. Chachu has always been calm, not really affected by things. Also lefties have a mind of their own, they don&#8217;t copy anyone and that&#8217;s why I am different. However, Inzaman chachu, having played international cricket for so long, he has some great friends who help me,” he says.</p>
<p>One such meeting with a great friend was instrumental in Imam’s development. “I met Saeed Anwar at my uncle&#8217;s house and I had nice chat with him. Anwar, a left-hander himself, spoke to me about my problem with playing spinners. He didn&#8217;t tell me anything complicated. He just told me to trust the shots that I was confident of pulling off and not manufacture any stroke,” he says.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996556&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For someone who wasn&#8217;t expecting to make the South African squad for the Under-19 World Cup, things have turned around quite rapidly for Aiden Markram. The 19-year-old&#8217;s pessimism may have appeared to be justified. The South African age group program doesn&#8217;t get a lot of international exposure so when Markram underperformed at the U19 quadrangular in Visakhapatnam last year,(he scored 73 runs in 5 innings) it would well have seemed he had missed his chance.</p>
<p>But Markram not only got his call-up, he was also named skipper of the squad. It was a decision that he says left him &#8220;shocked and uncertain whether to feel either happy or sad&#8221;. The selectors faith in him was justified. On Sunday he not only led South Africa to their first ever U-19 World Cup triumph, he also was named player of the series for his 370 runs at an average of 123.33.</p>
<p>Even with the exhilaration of victory fresh, Markram is remarkably level headed about his achievement. &#8220;I have had some bad tournaments so it is good to have a good one as well,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The man of the series trophy isn&#8217;t as important to me as the team trophy,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>His century against Zimbabwe rescued his side from 54/3 and his 45 in the semis against Australia formed a base for the middle order to build on. And while the powerfully built Markram appears a tad stodgy for an opener, he backs his ability to find the big hits and make up the runs over the course of his innings.</p>
<p>On Saturday against Pakistan, albeit chasing a modest total, South Africa were 28/2 after 11.4 overs.So Markram went about his job &#8211; seeing off the main Pakistani bowlers. He was 28 from 66 balls at one stage but stuck to his task methodically &#8211; tapping the wide lines between overs-a superstition he has maintained since school cricket. Ultimately he would see SA home with an unbeaten 66, carrying his bat for the second time in the tournament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rabada’s fast track to success </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>The slow wickets of Dubai were one where spinners were expected to dominate and for the most part that held true at the U-19 World Cup. But when someone bowls at close to 90 miles an hour, like Kagiso Rabada does, that’s got to count for something as well. Indeed, the South African finished as the second highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 14 wickets in 5 games, including a six-wicket haul against Australia. While Rabada’s pace obviously draws attention, he combines with it accuracy. His wickets came at 10.28 runs each, he only conceded 3.1 runs an over.</p>
<p>“Congrats South Africa in Rabada you have unearthed another outstanding Quick bowler”, tweeted former England captain Michael Vaughan after Rabada’s 6/25 against Australia in the semifinals. Rabada doesn’t come from a family of cricketers.</p>
<p>”My father played football. As a black man in his time, he didn’t have the kind of opportunity to play cricket. I was luckier that could go to a good school (St. Stithians College) where I got the chance,” he says. Rabada says he always knew he wanted to be a fast bowler. “I saw Alan Donald bowl on TV and he was quick. I wanted to be like that.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996554&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Even before Bradley Dial smashed Saud Shakeel’s first ball of his second over for a boundary, the general mood around the Dubai International Stadium seemed to have tilted in South Africa’s favour.</span></p>
<p>Dial’s full-blooded swing was predictably followed by the South African team rushing out on to the turf. Dial and skipper, Aiden Markram, were engulfed by their mates For when victory arrived, it was rather comprehensive. South Africa won the Under-19 World Cup with a comfortable six-wicket margin, with eight overs to spare. Captain, Markram, was declared the player of the tournament, just reward for his 370 runs at 123.33 in six matches. He also hit two centuries and a half century.</p>
<p>The afternoon though, belonged to Markram’s teammate. A 19-year-old from Durban seemed to have picked Saturday to announce himself, and that he did, in emphatic fashion. Corbin Bosch, came on in the 12th over with Pakistan at 41 for two. He bowled seven overs on the trot, polishing off three of Pakistan’s middle-order batsmen while giving away just 12 runs.</p>
<p>Though the Pakistan middle-order seemed to aid Bosch — a combination of cavalier and irresponsible stroke-play being the main culprit in all their downfalls — the seamer stuck to his task with singular focus. Most of Bosch’s deliveries were bowled on or around the off stump. The length was just short of good, one which often left the Pakistan batsmen in two minds. Instead of being watchful, they decided to hit their way out of trouble.</p>
<p>Bosch’s first three wickets were accounted for by identical deliveries. The ball, angled away from the batsmen, pitched on off-stump and seamed away just a touch. Pakistan’s Saud Shakeel, Kamran Ghulam and Saifullah Khan perished while trying to chase balls, which they should have left alone.</p>
<p>All the three batsmen were guilty of wafting at the ball, without any semblance of foot movement.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, none of the Pakistan batsmen seemed to have learned from the way their teammates were dismissed. Every time the ball was angled away from them, they tried to pull off drives, something which cost them dear.</p>
<p><strong>Early strikes</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Kagiso Rabada and Justin Dill had sent both openers back with only 39 runs on the board. Half an hour later, Pakistan were facing a full blown crises.</p>
<p>Pakistan were seven down for 72 and if not for a face-saving stand of 45 between Zafar Gohar and Amad Butt, there was every possibility that Pakistan would have capitulated for under 100. The innings finally folded up for 131, a score which was never going to be enough on a wicket which seemed to have got slower, but nothing that would have the South Africans breaking into a sweat.</p>
<p>To their credit, Pakistan came out firing on all cylinders. Butt sent back the dangerous Clyde Fortuin in the fourth over, as he mistimed a pull. Leg-spinner Karamat Ali, foxed Jason Smith a few overs later with one of his trademark googlies.</p>
<p>At the other end though, Markram was resolute. The right-hander was happy to roll out his forward defense on a regular basis and did not seem to concerned to dead-bat the ball frequently.</p>
<p>He compiled a 71-run partnership with Gary Oldfield, which took the Proteas to within touching distance of victory. Belatedly, Ali got one delivery to bounce and Oldfield edged one behind the stumps. However, Bradley Dial along with his skipper, ensured that there were no further tense moments by knocking off the required runs.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Scores:</strong> Pakistan 131 in 44.3 overs (Amad Butt 37, Zafar Gohar 22, Corbin Bosch 4/15) lost to South Africa 134/4 in 42.1 overs (Aiden Makrram 66, Greg Oldfield 40)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996551&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">Roger Federer won a record sixth Dubai Championships and 78th career title by beating Tomas Berdych 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the final on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>Federer, who maintains a home in Dubai, delighted a packed stadium of fans who seemed biased for the Swiss in back-to-back wins over Novak Djokovic in the semifinals and Berdych.</p>
<p>Federer&#8217;s win, his sixth here in the last 12 years, extends his record of winning at least one title a year to 14 consecutive years.</p>
<p>This is Federer&#8217;s first tournament victory since winning in Halle, his only title of 2013, last spring.</p>
<p>Federer improved his record over Berdych to 12-6 with the win. The last time they played, however, Berdych beat Federer in the Dubai semifinals last year.</p>
<p>The loss ended Berdych&#8217;s longest winning streak of his career at 11 matches. In the first set, Federer&#8217;s forehand looked shaky and he appeared a step slow. After exchanging early service breaks, the third-seeded Berdych snared the go-ahead break in the sixth game. On a second break point at 30-40, Federer netted a backhand to lose serve.</p>
<p>In the second set, there was another early exchange of breaks. From 4-4, Federer won the final eight points of the set to even the set score.</p>
<p>Both players had break opportunities in the first two games of the third set- Berdych three and Federer one but both held. Federer secured his victory when he broke Berdych on a second break point in the fourth game.</p>
<p>Federer faced two break points on his serve in the seventh game but held on to the game for 5-2.</p>
<p>Berdych was able to save two match points on his own serve in the eighth game. But the Czech couldn&#8217;t stop Federer from serving out. On Federer&#8217;s third match point at 40-15 in the ninth game, Berdych netted a backhand return.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996546&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yuvrajsinghiem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996826" alt="Yuvraj Singh held the Punjab innings together on a track where batting became difficult due to overcast conditions (IE Photo Praveen Khanna)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/yuvrajsinghiem.jpg" /></a> Yuvraj Singh held the Punjab innings together on a track where batting became difficult due to overcast conditions (IE Photo Praveen Khanna)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">At the fall of Punjab’s third wicket, Yuvraj Singh emerged from the tunnel leading out of the dressing rooms. The cloud cover, the nip in the air and the overnight rains had tilted conditions in favour of the bowlers on Saturday. </span></p>
<p>Delhi, after being asked to bat in the morning, were reduced to 53 for five. Virender Sehwag and Unmukt Chand were caught behind off medium-pacer Siddarth Kaul. Gautam Gambhir, cautious during his eight off 28 deliveries, was run-out when he unsuccessfully took on medium pacer Kaul’s bowling arm. The dogged Rajat Bhatia was bowled by Kaul’s new-ball partner Sandeep Sharma.</p>
<p>Once the pacers sent down the first 15 overs, Harbhajan Singh brought himself on and trapped Milind Kumar in his first over. Punjab had won a crucial toss, given the conditions, and didn’t waste the opportunity to force Delhi on to the mat. There would have been no fightback if Mithun Manhas was not dropped on four but the reliable batsman made 98, an innings that helped Delhi post 228. Delhi and Manhas were aided by the absence of a third frontline seamer because Manpreet Singh Gony pulled out minutes before the game with back spasms.</p>
<p>The reprimand Gony received at the end of the day from Harbhajan Singh and coach Bhupinder Singh Sr. for not giving greater clarity about his fitness status earlier would have been more severe if not for Yuvraj’s unbeaten 96 and the unconquered 146-run stand with Gurkeerat Singh Mann, one that got Punjab over the line with 18 balls to spare.</p>
<p>Yuvraj, like Manhas earlier, was the batsman around whom the innings revolved. Punjab were 57 for three when Yuvraj walked out to bat. In their previous game, a rain-truncated match against Haryana, Punjab were reduced to 48 for six before being bowled out for 146 and losing by seven runs. The young Punjab batting unit was short on experience at the Jamia Milia Cricket Ground on Thursday. Yuvraj, back in the side after excusing himself to attend his brother’s wedding, brought a sense of calm to the middle-order.</p>
<p>The situation demanded a cool head and a patient approach. Ashish Nehra was bowling fast, on a good length and cramping the batsmen for room. Rajat Bhatia, the wily medium-pacer with his subtle variations, troubled not just with accuracy but also with movement. To add to a batsman’s worry, the ball occasionally kept low on the wicket.</p>
<p>Yuvraj got a full stride in, played with a straight bat and was prepared to defend. It took him a while to get his timing going but every time he did, it gave the impression that he was in control of the chase.</p>
<p>Nehra, the best bowler on the day, was steered to the third-man fence and then driven through covers. With Yuvraj controlling the pace of the innings, Gurkeerat had the luxury of taking singles and leaving it to his senior partner to find the boundaries.</p>
<p>There was the flick to the fine-leg boundary, the slog sweep and powerful drives off Yuvraj’s bat. Delhi skipper Gautam Gambhir put down a difficult chance at cover when Yuvraj, batting on 45, drove off-spinner Milind Kumar. No.3 Gitansh Khera too benefitted from Delhi’s butterfingers. In the first instance, he was dropped by Unmukt Chand at second slip and shortly after, by Virender Sehwag, who can’t seem to do anything right these days.</p>
<p>Gurkeerat, though, didn’t offer a chance. In Yuvraj’s company he grew in confidence and pierced the off-side field confidently. With Punjab on the threshold of victory, Yuvraj played to the galleries and hit a six over wide long on off left-arm spinner Varun Sood to finish the chase.</p>
<p>It was a dominating finish to a Yuvraj innings that had a workman-like start.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Scores:</strong> Delhi 228 all out in 49.1 overs (Mithun Manhas 98, S Kaul 4/37, Harbhajan Singh 2/54) lost to Punjab 232 for 4 in 47 overs. (Yuvraj Singh 96 not out,Gurkeerat Singh 52 not out).</p>
<p>Points Punjab 4; Delhi 0.</p>
<p><strong>Other results</strong></p>
<p><strong>North Zone:</strong> (At Palam) Services 171/8 in 32 overs (R Paliwal 54; R Dayal 2/20, W Raza 2/22) bt Jammu &amp; Kashmir 169/ 9 in 32 overs (Hardeep Singh 66, Bandeep Singh 55*; Avishek Sinha 4/26, S Yadav 3/23) by 2 runs.</p>
<p><strong>East Zone :</strong> (At Ranchi) Assam vs Orissa match — which was already reduced to 20 overs a side — was abandoned due to rain after 16.5 overs was bowled in the Assam innings.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Assam 128/6 in 16,5 overs (P Aziz 61; D Behera 3/28) vs Orissa; At Ranchi: Jharkhand vs Tripura match abandoned without a ball bowled.</p>
<p><strong>Harbhajan: Stock delivery is important</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> Ravichandran Ashwin’s loss of form and his recent alteration in bowling action during the Asia Cup has been the center of discussion. Harbhajan Singh, who was replaced by Ashwin as India’s premier off-spinner, believes that spinners must be able to deliver with their stock ball and use variations as a surprise.</p>
<p>“Variations are important but, you still need to have a stock ball. The batsmen still gets out the way they used to before. You shouldn’t forget your originality. Any spinner should least, be able to spin the ball,” Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>When asked specifically, about Ashwin’s performance in the Asia cup he said “I wouldn’t like to make any comments about a current India player. I haven’t seen the recent matches. I will always wish Ashwin luck as he is a talented bowler.”</p>
<p>About variations, Harbhajan added: “Whether you hold the ball cross-seam or straight you have to deliver off-spin. If he’s an off-spinner he should be able to bowl off-spin. Recently, I haven’t seen any spinner who can be perceived to be threatening.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cricket-main.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996434 " alt="Rahman tried to change the course of the game with a few lusty blows towards the end but his efforts could not stop Afghanistan from creating a cricketing history. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/cricket-main.jpg" /></a> Hosts Bangladesh invited Afghanistan to bat first after winning the toss. (AP)
<p>Afghanistan notched up their first major win against a Test playing nation as they produced an all-round performance to script an upset 32-run victory over Bangladesh in their Asia Cup match, here today.</p>
<p>Chasing 255 for victory, Bangladesh could not recover from a top-order collapse and kept on losing wickets at regular intervals to be bundled out for 222 in 47.5 overs at Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium to slump to their second consecutive loss in the five-nation regional tournament.</p>
<p>Barring Mominul Haque (50), Nasir Hossain (41) and Ziaur Rahman (41), none of their batsmen showed enough patience to stay at the crease and grind it out.</p>
<p>Rahman tried to change the course of the game with a few lusty blows towards the end but his efforts could not stop Afghanistan from creating a cricketing history.</p>
<p>Afghanistan&#8217;s inexperience at the international level was on full display when their butterfingered fielders dropped as many as four catches and gave away few easy runs.</p>
<p>But the gutsy team from the strife-torn nation held its nerve to pull off a dramatic victory over Bangladesh, kicking off jubilant celebrations in their camp.</p>
<p>This was after rearguard half-centuries from Asghar Stanikzai (90 not out) and Samiullah Shenwari (81) took the visitors to 254 for 6 after being put in to bat.</p>
<p>Afghanistan were once in trouble at 90/5, but Stanikzai and Shenwari got together and added 164 from 138 balls for the sixth-wicket partnership to take Afghanistan past 250.</p>
<p>Bangladesh conceded 107 runs from last 10 overs as the duo of Stanikzai and Shenwari first stressed on building the innings and then unleashed an array of powerful strokes at the death to post a competitive total.</p>
<p>Bangladesh started their run chase on a disastrous note, losing openers Shamsur Rahman (0) and Anamul Haque (1) with<br />
just one run on the board.</p>
<p>Mominul and Mushfiqur Rahim (23) tried to resurrect the innings with a 68-run stand for the third wicket but both were dismissed in quick succession to leave Bangladesh reeling at 88 for 4 halfway through their innings.</p>
<p>Momimul was castled by Samiullah Shenwari just after the batsman completed his half-century, laced with six fours.</p>
<p>Hossain cashed in on two dropped chances to score a patient 60-ball 41 and also raised a 73-run stand for the fifth wicket with Naeem Islam (35) to provide stabilitity to the floundering innings.</p>
<p>Hossain was first dropped by Asghar Stanikzai off Hamza Hotak at backward point when he was batting on 1 and couple of overs later by Samiullah Shenwari off his own bowling.</p>
<p>The partnership was broken by Mirwais Ashraf when he had Hossain caught by Shenwari at backward point in the 39th over to trigger another familiar Bangladesh collapse.</p>
<p>Bangladesh lost Islam, Abdur Razzak (0) and Arafat Sunny (0) within a span of three deliveries to slump to 165 for 8.<br />
After that, it was just a matter of time before they succumbed to their worst defeat in the limited overs format.</p>
<p>For Afghanistan, Mohammad Nabi was the pick of the bowlers with figures of three for 44, while Shapoor Zadran and Hamid Hassan accounted for two wickets apiece.</p>
<p>Earlier, Afghanistan made a dramatic recovery from a top-order collapse with a late blitzkrieg from Stanikzai and Shenwari to post a fighting total.</p>
<p>The duo, who started cautiously, finished with a flourish as they punished Bangladesh bowlers in the final overs.</p>
<p>Stanikzai was slow to get going initially as he took 81 balls to reach his fourth ODI fifty.</p>
<p>But after reaching the milestone the 26-year-old cut loose as he carted the hosts&#8217; bowlers all around the park.</p>
<p>Stanikzai&#8217;s knock came off 103 balls and included six fours and three sixes.</p>
<p>Shenwari, on the other hand, maintained a brisk scoring rate throughout. His 69-ball innings included 10 fours and a six.</p>
<p>The Bangladeshi bowlers did not get support from their fielders who dropped two catches in the innings.</p>
<p>Afghanistan openers Mohammad Shahzad (2) and Karim Sadiq (12) departed cheaply. Shahzad was foxed by a slower one from<br />
pacer Rubel Hossain and was trapped in front of the wicket, while left-arm spinner Arafat Sunny claimed the scalp of Sadiq<br />
who handed a simple return catch to him.</p>
<p>Najibullah Zadran (21) was dismissed soon after as Afghanistan were reduced to 43 for three.</p>
<p>Next batsman Nawroz Mangal, however, showed some purpose as he hit three fours in his 33-ball 22 before being out in the 23rd over.</p>
<p>Afghanistan lost another wicket soon after with skipper Nabi dismissed for just seven as the visitors were further reduced to 90 for five before Stanikzai and Shenwari took them to a respectable total.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996433&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[In Jaipur, thanks to cameos from their top-three, including 24 off 21 from Suresh Raina, Uttar Pradesh finished at 137 for nine from 20 overs, the same score as Madhya Pradesh in the Central Zone game.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996064&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Two matches of the Vizay Hazare Trophy zonal rounds were tied on Friday, one of them a 20-over affair played between Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. In the South Zone leg between Karnataka and Hyderabad, the scores were tied at 248 after both sides played out their full quota of 50 overs. Captain R Vinay Kumar had a good outing with both the bat and the ball in the tied game. </span></p>
<p>Put into bat, Karnataka recovered from an early wobble to post 248 for eight with captain R Vinay Kumar top-scoring with an unbeaten 47. Hyderabad seemed to be on course in their run chase as they were 142 for two in the 31st over but suffered a batting collapse, triggered by Vinay Kumar (5/42), to be reduced to 165 for six in the 38th over. Hyderabad needed 31 runs from the last three overs with three wickets in hand and they almost pulled it off. Ashish Reddy (51 not out) kept Hyderabad in the hunt but finally fell short of the target of 249 by one run.</p>
<p>In Jaipur, thanks to cameos from their top-three, including 24 off 21 from Suresh Raina, Uttar Pradesh finished at 137 for nine from 20 overs, the same score as Madhya Pradesh in the Central Zone game.</p>
<p>At Alur in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu beat Andhra Pradesh by eight wickets in a low scoring match while Kerala defeated Goa by three wickets. Tamil Nadu pacer Yo Mahesh returned with figures of 5/31 as Andhra were shot out for just 126 in 41.3 overs. Tamil Nadu easily chased down the target of 127 in just 30.1 overs on the back of 84-run opening wicket stand between wicket-keeper batsman Umashankar Sushil (61 not out) and Murali Vijay (50).</p>
<p>Kerala captain Sachin Baby led from the front with a 100-ball 89 to help his side to victory against Goa with seven balls to spare. Kerala got all the four points from the win.</p>
<p><strong>Close win for maha</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In Rajkot, thanks to half-centuries by Ankit Bawne and Rahul Tripathi and a splendid final over by Dominic Joseph, Maharashtra beat Saurashtra by four runs in the West Zone Vijay Hazare One-day Tournament.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Both captains claimed they weren’t going to talk about David Warner on Friday; both went on to dedicate a fair bit of time to talking about him.</span></p>
<p>“He’s becoming a little bit of a rent-a-quote,” South Africa’s Graeme Smith offered.</p>
<p>“He’s a tough bugger, there’s no doubt about it, and he’ll love the challenge he faces when he walks out onto that ground,” was Michael Clarke’s assessment of his Australia teammate.</p>
<p>Warner grabbed the headlines in the lead-up to the third and decisive Test at Newlands starting on Saturday when he accused South Africa of underhand ball-management tactics during its win in the second Test.</p>
<p>He was fined 15 percent of his match fee by the International Cricket Council, after telling a Sydney radio station: “We were actually questioning whether or not AB de Villiers would get the ball in his hand and with his glove wipe the rough side every ball.’’</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with it inhouse</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Clarke said he wanted to focus on the Test, but admitted he had shared his mind with the left-hander.</p>
<p>“The ICC have dealt with it. We’ve dealt with it in-house,” Clarke said. “I’ve also made very clear to David how disappointed I was, and am, with his comments, and at the appropriate time I will catch up with Graeme and make it clear to him how I feel about it.”</p>
<p>Smith backed up South Africa coach Russell Domingo’s sentiment that Warner’s slur would only spur the Proteas as they attempt to beat Australia in a series at home for the first time since readmission.</p>
<p>“We’ve lost one series in eight years or something like that which is a pretty successful run, and I think that needs to be embraced and enjoyed,” Smith noted.</p>
<p>“If we go on to win this test match it’s another big steppingstone in what this team has been able to create. It would be a big feather in our hat.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996060&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[That face-off set the tone for the first Test as Johnson continued to terrorise batsmen.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996050&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few contemporary batsmen have so much time on the ball as Hashim Amla, and for that reason, watching the South African stare disorientedly into middle distance, his helmet sitting comically askew, after getting thumped on the head first ball by Mitchell Johnson at Centurion was extraordinary. Johnson had made Amla look gauche.</p>
<p>That face-off set the tone for the first Test as Johnson continued to terrorise batsmen, his career-best 12/127 flooring South Africa. The left arm pacer had picked up 49 wickets in six Tests running, all of which his side went on to win.</p>
<p>By contrast, Amla, who ought to have assumed increased significance post-Kallis, was looking unusually shaky. Amla’s first innings duck in the second Test, falling to Johnson again, meant that, perhaps for the first time in his career, the S word was whispered at him. He had slumped to 105 runs in seven innings, out bowled in all three of his outings against India, twice to deliveries that he had shouldered arms to. Amla, expected to make the last stand against Johnson on behalf of his ilk, was seemingly getting worked over.</p>
<p>Then, of course, came the unbeaten 127 in the second innings at Port Elizabeth. Johnson had Graeme Smith bowled, hit Dean Elgar on the shoulder and smacked Amla on the helmet again. The blows ought to have slowed South Africa down, but Amla pushed on. He punched Johnson off the backfoot through cover for boundaries and nudged the rising ball into the leg side to get to the other end. Scoring at a healthy rate (72.15), Amla gave his side enough time to bowl Australia out a second time, as South Africa squared the series with a 231-run win.</p>
<p>Amla’s return to form also coincided with Johnson’s own return to relative normalcy (he picked up less than six wickets for the first time in seven matches) on a sluggish wicket.</p>
<p>It will be a different story when the decider gets underway Saturday at the Newlands, a venue which has yielded a result in every match for the last three seasons, including the bizzare game in 2011, where South Africa and Australia combined to lose 22 wickets in 44.5 overs on the second day. All of the 32 batsmen to be dismissed in the game fell to pace. In fact, over the last three seasons, pacers have picked up eight out of 10 wickets to fall at Newlands.</p>
<p>Between watching left-arm spinners fire it in in Bangladesh, England slug it out against the West Indies in Antigua, and Amla take on Johnson at Newlands with the series at stake, the choice for the fan is straight forward.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/steynjohnsonreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996034" alt="The wicket has been a key factor in the opening two Tests" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/steynjohnsonreutersm.jpg" /></a> The wicket has been a key factor in the opening two Tests
<p>South Africa captain Graeme Smith expects an even contest between bat and ball to set up a thrilling finale in the series-deciding third Test against Australia at Newlands in Cape Town on Saturday.</p>
<p>The wicket has been a key factor in the opening two Tests, a lively pitch helping Mitchell Johnson bowl Australia to a 281-run win in the series opener in Pretoria and a slower and more abrasive surface in Port Elizabeth aiding South Africa to get prodigious reverse-swing and claim a 231-run win.</p>
<p>“It looks like a really good Test wicket and will have something for both bat and ball,” Smith told reporters on Friday.</p>
<p>“It can get a bit flat and slow towards the back end if it is hot, but it has also changed of late and there has been a bit more in it than in the past.”</p>
<p>The Proteas captain said he expected a different type of wicket to the one that saw Australia bowled out for 47 in their second innings in 2011.</p>
<p>“I think the wicket has settled down quite a bit since then. That Test was also played in November just after winter.”</p>
<p>Smith denied that the South African team had asked Newlands curator Evan Flint for any specific type of wicket or that they had done so ahead of the second Test.</p>
<p>“Port Elizabeth has been exactly the same for the last 40 years, I’m amazed that so much was made of the wicket after the Test. We knew exactly what to expect down there and we were the team that adapted best to the conditions.”</p>
<p><strong>Looking for runs</strong></p>
<p>Smith has scored 37 runs in four innings in the series, but felt in good form and was looking forward to playing on a ground where he averages 52 overall.</p>
<p>“I feel like I have been batting well the whole season, it is just these last two games. In Pretoria I felt I was unlucky there and I let myself down in Port Elizabeth. My training has gone well, mentally I feel in a good space. I have ticked all the boxes, it’s now about going out there tomorrow and getting in.”</p>
<p>Having former coach and fellow left-handed opener Gary Kirsten back with the squad this week in a consultancy role has been a boost, Smith said.</p>
<p>“It’s always nice to have Gary back, he always adds value with his calmness, experience and work rate. He is a great asset.”</p>
<p><strong>Australia turn to Warne</strong></p>
<p>Shane Warne’s vast Test experience has been well utilised by the Australian squad in the lead-up to the series-deciding third Test against South Africa at Newlands in Cape Town on Saturday.</p>
<p>Captain Michael Clarke says the veteran of 145 Test matches and arguably the greatest leg-spinner of all time has played a leading role in mentoring the team in his role as a consultant.</p>
<p>Clarke believes Warne’s cricketing brain and infectious personality will help lift the squad after the demoralising loss in the second Test.</p>
<p>“It’s been fantastic having him around and great for me personally,” Clarke told reporters on Friday. “I have a wonderful relationship with Warney and it’s always nice to have him around, especially for those players that have not spent a lot of time with him, they have had their eyes opened.</p>
<p>“The spinners really enjoyed the work he did with them yesterday (Thursday). He will do whatever it takes to get the players to bring the best out of themselves. I have said for a long time he is probably the best captain I have played under and his knowledge is like no other, He played 145 Test matches and knows the game.”</p>
<p>Clarke admits he is at a loss to explain why his bowlers failed to get the same reverse-swing as South Africa in the second Test and expects it to be a factor again in Cape Town.</p>
<p>After claiming a win in the first Test, Australia were on track for success in the second before paceman Dale Steyn took advantage of the conditions to fire his side to victory.</p>
<p><strong>Dry wicket</strong></p>
<p>“Our bowlers have been very good at getting the ball to reverse, that did not happen last time. The wicket looks quite dry so that means there should be reverse-swing again.”</p>
<p>Although his position in the side is not under threat, Clarke said the fact he has not scored more than 25 in his last 11 Test innings is weighing heavily on him.</p>
<p>“Any time I am not leading from the front it is disappointing for me. My first job in the team is to score runs. It’s the Australian way, you are first picked on form and then made captain later.”<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Important to win</strong></p>
<p>Clarke had earlier in the week suggested the third Test would be one of the most important of his career, not least given the fact that Australia’s recent form away from home has been poor.</p>
<p>They have not won an overseas Test series since beating the West Indies in April 2012.</p>
<p>“It’s a really important Test match, a special one for us. We achieved what we wanted in Australia through the summer, but we have not had success away for a long time. “But having said that, we did not come here to lose. To win the series would be a great way to finish the summer and we will leave nothing in the tank.”</p>

<p>Buoyed by his team’s <a title="Asia Cup 2014: Let off the hook, Umar Akmal and Pakistan make the Afghans pay" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-let-off-the-hook-umar-akmal-and-pakistan-make-the-afghans-pay/" target="_blank">spirited effort against Pakistan</a>, Afghanistan coach Kabir Khan on Friday sounded a warning bell for India and Sri Lanka, stating that they are “hungry to win” a match in the ongoing Asia Cup tournament. Afghanistan on Thursday had reduced Pakistan to 117 for six before the latter side recovered well to end up at 248.</p>
<p>“All of our boys are very hungry to win a game or two here they know how much it will change the team. If we get one or two wins it will change the future of youngsters and the next ten years of Afghanistan cricket,” Afghan coach Khan told reporters.</p>
<p>“I think, after the performance, all the rest of the teams who are playing against us will think twice before trying to take us lightly. They will definitely look out for our bowling and specially plan for our bowlers. We came here in this tournament not to win in the Cup but to to win one or two games. That’s what we want to take from here,” Khan added.</p>
<p>Khan, who has played for Pakistan, heaped further praise on Afghanistan’s fast-bowling resources. “Well, in Afghanistan, the boys are well-built. They are strong and tough. They are aggressive. Obviously, that helps in them being fast bowlers. Kids back home want to be fast bowlers, not spinners. It’s just natural.”</p>
<p>The coach further added that they have another fine pacer in Hamid Hassan. “You haven’t seen Hamid Hassan yet. When you see him, it will change your views as well.”</p>
<p>He said cricket’s future in the country would become even more bright should the team pick up a few points here in the Asia Cup.</p>
<p>“The one thing that I keep on mentioning is that the cause why we are here is totally different from the other teams. Other teams might be here to win the tournament or to perform very well. We want to perform very well but our cause is totally different. If we win even a single match here, it will change the future of Afghanistan for the next ten years. Our youngsters, our youth will come to sports. And that is what we want to change.”</p>
<p>Afghanistan will have their best opportunity to make an impact on Saturday when they take on the hosts Bangladesh. Bangladesh played well in their loss against India, but have been affect by a spate injuries. Pacer Mashrafe Mortaza has been ruled out of the Asia Cup with a side strain.</p>
<p>They are already without key players Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan. Captain Mushfiqur Rahim is also carrying a shoulder injury from the India game. Rahim notched up a hundred against India. However, he sustained a shoulder injury while fielding and is still under observation.</p>
<p>Asked if Afghanistan were looking at Saturday&#8217;s match to taste their first big success in top-flight cricket, Khan said: “We would be playing against Bangladesh in the ICC World Twenty20 also. If we want to go to the second round there, we have to beat Bangladesh. We have to beat them. Because we are playing them in the World Twenty20, we want to put extra pressure on them and play well against them to boost ourselves for the World Twenty20 as well.”</p>

<p>About half of Dhaka’s Sri Lankan community of over 1,000 dropped in at the Fatullah Cricket Ground on Friday. And their presence was felt all through the game. They beat drums, blew bugles and even implored the DJ to play Honey Singh numbers.</p>
<p>They did go silent for a while during the India innings when Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli were forging a partnership. But sprang back to life as soon as Ajantha Mendis took two wickets from three balls.</p>
<p>Achira, a 31-year-old from Colombo, who works here at the Dhaka branch of a Sri Lankan company (Ecochem), was the obvious cheer leader of this noisy bunch. His wife, Anjana, played second fiddle to him. “I’ve been working here for the last six years. Cricket helps us to break the monotony of everyday affairs. We never miss a game whenever our team is here. We followed them across the country during the two-month long bilateral series against Bangladesh,” says Achira.</p>
<p>Along with his friends, many of them students, Achira has formed a fan forum.</p>
<p>“We organize six-a-side cricket matches once a year and do community service with the funds raised,” says Achira. While Achira talks about his exploits of his team, his wife offers a silent prayer for Mahela Jayawardene’s success.</p>
<p>“Actually we are from the same college and it makes me a Mahela fan,” he explains.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996015&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tennism.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996009" alt="Reports say Nadal, Djokovic and Wawrinka will  be paid seven-figure sums (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/tennism.jpg" /></a> Reports say Nadal, Djokovic and Wawrinka will be paid seven-figure sums (File)
<p>Mahesh Bhupathi’s brainchild, the International Premier Tennis League (IPTL), took a giant step towards becoming a reality after the world numbers 1, 2 and 3 of the men’s game confirmed their participation for the IPL-style tournament. Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka accepted the invitation to play in the cash-rich tournament on Friday along with former world No.2 and reigning Wimbledon champion Andy Murray. From the women’s side, Serena Williams, Caroline Wozniacki and Victoria Azarenka top the charts.</p>
<p>However, Roger Federer and Maria Sharapova are the most notable absentees from the list of players released on Friday to participate in a ‘draft’ of 70 male and female players in Dubai on Sunday. Current Australian Open champion Li Na, Argentina’s Juan Martin del Potro and the Bryan Brothers are other notable names missing from the list.</p>
<p>The players have been put into different categories depending on their status and market values. The five shortlisted venues — Hong Kong, Mumbai, Singapore, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur — will compete against each other to bring the players to their city.<br />
Nadal, Djokovic and Wawrinka are listed as ‘icon’ players along with Williams, Azarenka and Wozniacki. Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi too have been included in this bracket. Former tour stars such as Michael Chang, Pat Rafter, Goran Ivanisevic and Carlos Moya, among others, have given their consent. These players have been included in the ‘past greats’ category.</p>
<p><strong>Paes absent</strong></p>
<p>Sania Mirza, Somdev Devvarman and Rohan Bopanna headline the Indian presence, in which Leander Paes’s name is conspicuously missing. Bopanna’s doubles partner Aisam ul-haq Qureshi of Pakistan too is included for the draft. Bhupathi has been tight-lipped about his plans for the league ever since it was announced last year. There were apprehensions over the participation of the top players, who have complained of a packed ATP and WTA schedule in recent years. It is believed that Bhupathi found it hard to convince the marquee players to join the league but managed to do so just hours before the draft list was made public.</p>
<p>The inaugural season of the IPTL is slated to be held during the international off season in November and December this year. Djokovic dispelled any concerns by committing himself to the tournament. “I think it&#8217;s a fantastic concept if it happens, obviously,” he had said on Thursday. “I hope and I believe it will. It&#8217;s a fun concept. It lets the players enjoy themselves on court and off court together. It&#8217;s something that we don&#8217;t get to see that much, the team concept. It&#8217;s not that easy to realise, because it&#8217;s a huge programme and project.”</p>
<p>It was reported earlier this week that Nadal would be paid close to $1 million per night by the IPTL to participate in the tournament. Other ‘icon’ players too can expect seven-figure sums once picked by the teams on Sunday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1996003&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rogerfedererreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1996000" alt="Roger Federer’s win over Novak Djokovic was his first in four matches against the Serb (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/rogerfedererreutersm.jpg" /></a> Roger Federer’s win over Novak Djokovic was his first in four matches against the Serb (Reuters)
<p>Fourth-seeded Roger Federer ended top-seeded Novak Djokovic&#8217;s chance of defending his Dubai Championships title with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 semifinal win on Friday. Federer will be looking for his sixth Dubai title when he plays third-seeded Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic in Saturday&#8217;s final.</p>
<p>Berdych reached his second consecutive Dubai Championships final with a tough 7-5, 7-5 semifinal win over seventh-seeded Philiipp Kohlschreiber of Germany.</p>
<p>Federer now leads Djokovic 17-15 in their career head-to-head meetings. He also leads Djokovic 13-12 when competing on hard courts. “He deserved to win,” Djokovic said. “He played in the second part of the match better and was more aggressive and played all around the court really well.” Djokovic had won their last three matches and nine of their last 12 matches. He&#8217;s twice won three consecutive matches against Federer, but never has won four in a row. “Right now I&#8217;m just happy that I was able to win the match,” Federer said. “I don&#8217;t care so much about the head-to-heads. But it&#8217;s nice to be in the finals here in Dubai again.”</p>
<p>For the first set-and-a-half, Djokovic looked as if he would have an easy time reaching the final. Djokovic established an early lead when Federer lost his serve in an error-filled second game of the first set. Serving at 5-3, Djokovic won the first set on his third set point of the game with a clean ace down the middle. Midway through the second set, it seemed as though Federer remembered that his new part-time coach Stefan Edberg, who is not in Dubai, is urging him to play more offensively. From that point on, Federer started to come into the net and volley more often, which was an effective strategy that Djokovic couldn&#8217;t handle.</p>
<p>“I think I was able to play a bit more aggressive as the match went on,” Federer said. “For me it was just a matter of playing consistent, but remain aggressive. Clearly it was close, but I think I got the right balance,” he said.</p>
<p>Djokovic doesn&#8217;t seem to be interested in learning to use the net effectively now that he has Boris Becker, who was a serve and volley type of player, as his new head coach.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been working on certain details in my game, but it&#8217;s nothing significant that I&#8217;m going to change,” Djokovic said. “I&#8217;m not going to play serve and volley.”</p>
<p>In the second set, Djokovic surrendered his serve in an error-riddled sixth game to put Federer in position to even the score at one set apiece. Federer broke Djokovic&#8217;s serve in the first and fifth games of the third set to set up the win. In the final game, Federer saved two break points when serving for the match in the final game.</p>
<p><strong>Winning streak</strong></p>
<p>Berdych enters the final on a 11-match winning streak. He arrived in Dubai having won his first title in over a year at Rotterdam two weeks ago.</p>
<p>“I think he&#8217;s playing very well right now,” Federer said. “This is a big match for him tomorrow (Saturday) as well. “I will try to stop him and play a good match myself.”</p>
<p>Berdych now leads Kohlschreiber 8-1 in career matches played. In the first set, Kohlschreiber broke out to a 4-2 lead after Berdych lost his serve in the opening game of the match. From 5-3 for Kohlschreiber, Berdych won the next four games to win the first set, which lasted one hour, 28 minutes.</p>
<p>The second set stayed on serve until the very last game, when Kohlschreiber surrendered his serve at 15-40 for Berdych to return to the final. “The second final in a row with so many great players in the draw here is a great result for me,” Berdych said. “It&#8217;s great to be able to be hitting the ball so nice and clean.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995991&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viratkohlibattingapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995974" alt="Virat Kohli backed Rohit Sharma and said he deserves all the support (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/03/viratkohlibattingapm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli backed Rohit Sharma and said he deserves all the support (AP)
<p>Indian skipper Virat Kohli said the toss proved to be &#8220;crucial&#8221; and added that his batsmen could have played &#8220;smarter cricket&#8221; as they went down to Sri Lanka by two wickets in their Asia Cup encounter.</p>
<p>Experienced <a title="Asia Cup 2014 Quick Singles: Former skipper steals show, stand-in hearts" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-former-skipper-steals-show-stand-in-hearts/" target="_blank">Kumar Sangakkara</a> showed the way with a breathtaking 84-ball 103 as Sri Lanka recovered from a middle-order batting collapse to pull off a thrilling two-wicket victory.</p>
<p>Chasing 265 for win after opting to bowl first, the islanders rode on the 36-year-old&#8217;s masterclass to complete the task with four balls to spare at the Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toss was crucial in these sort of places. It&#8217;s just a matter of luck at the toss. If they were bowling and they had three spinners later on I don&#8217;t think they would have had the same chances. I would rather strengthen my batting. It did not pay off for us. We need to go back to drawing table and see what we can do from here,&#8221; Kohli said at the post-match presser.</p>
<p>India were cruising at one stage but wickets of <a title="Asia Cup Live Quick Singles: Virat Kohli’s consistency and the Mendis mystery" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-quick-singles-virat-kohlis-consistency-and-the-mendis-mystery/" target="_blank">Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan</a> cost them dear as the inexperience middle-order, in the absence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, failed to deliver.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could have played smarter cricket on the day. But if you see some decisions first two overs close lbws, plus we dropped a few chances. It&#8217;s part of cricket. But we should have taken our chances. Overall, we did not play smart cricket the way we did against Bangladesh. In batting also we could have made 20-25 runs more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kohli defended his decision to play Stuart Binny even as as Sri Lankan&#8217;s inclusion of Ajantha Mendis (4/60) worked for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plan was to play that extra batsman with Stuart Binny and combine him with Rohit and Rayudu for the 10 overs. But when you have dew in the end, you don&#8217;t have much that regular fast bowlers can do. The last 10 overs there was a lot of dew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it was a commendable effort by bowlers to take the game to the last over with Kumar Sangakkara set in the middle. It&#8217;s difficult one to answer. When you collapse in your batting, you miss that extra batsman as well,&#8221; Kohli said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to learn from mistakes. I know they are very capable cricketers that&#8217;s why they are playing for India. Sometimes in international cricket you tend to bog down. The span of making one mistake and a next one should be long enough to become that potentially big player.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about the turning points, he said: &#8220;The wickets of Shikhar, Rahane and Karthik at first, we lost them in quick succession, something that hurt our batting. We were in position to get 300 but lost these three quick wickets.</p>
<p>&#8220;While in fielding we could have had those three chances even in the last over also&#8230; we never know. We just need to be smarter and professional with our fielding as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since his downfall in South Africa, where he was troubled by Dale Steyn, Rohit Sharma does not look the same player at the top, but Kohli backed the Indian opener and said he deserves all the support.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rohit is very comfortable opening his innings. He&#8217;s done well for us to have faith in him. He has done really well for us since he&#8217;s opened for us. It&#8217;s not certain an individual performs every series. He&#8217;s been brilliant in the last one year. We need to have faith in him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s done really well and stepped up when we did not have any opening options. He&#8217;s filled in that spot beautifully. He deserves all the faith.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995972&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em><strong>Kumar Sangakkara anchored his side to a thrilling win as Virat Kohli impresses with smart captaincy in tense situations.</strong></em></p>
<p>In what turned out to be a thrilling run-chase, there was one constant in the constantly changing fortunes &#8211; Kumar Sangakkara. Right from the moment he took crease to face the first ball, he chewed the gum in intent, and kept chewing till he got his side close to a <a title="Asia Cup 2014: Kumar Sangakkara special seals thrilling win for Sri Lanka" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-2014-kumar-sangakkara-special-seals-thrilling-win-for-sri-lanka/" target="_blank">thrilling win over neighbours India</a>.</p>
<p>The face, especially amid tense situations, wore a dead pan look as we went about doing business with utmost perfection and elegance. There was not a single moment where one could say,&#8221;aah! he got lucky, oh! that fell short&#8221;. It was a perfect exhibition of how to chase stiff targets without any fuss.</p>
<p><strong>No yes, no mine and again they collide</strong></p>
<p>Sri Lanka openers were off to a brisk start, and it seemed they&#8217;ll go past India at a canter. Kusal Perera, in particular, was the aggressor as he, along with Lahiru Thirimanne, operated just under run-a-ball.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dhawanrahaneappin.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1995950" alt="DhawanRahaneAPpIN" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dhawanrahaneappin.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>The duo were helped by some ordinary Indian fielding.</p>
<p>First of the two happened in the fourth over of the innings. Perera miscued one and what should have been a rather easy catch for Ajinkya Rahane, turned out to be an ugly collision. Shikhar Dhawan, who was charging from the ropes, didn&#8217;t see Rahane coming and kept charging towards the ball.</p>
<p>Both the fielders didn&#8217;t care to call for the catch, and served Perera with a life early in his innings. In the second match of the tournament, this was the second occasion that the Indian fielders were involved in an ugly collision in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Spongy Sanga!</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you read it right. Spongy Sanga!</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sangakkaraaareuters.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1995954" alt="SangakkaraaaReuters" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sangakkaraaareuters.jpg?w=480&#038;h=632" width="480" height="632" /></a></p>
<p>The way the elegant southpaw soaked the pressure in tense situations was a treat to watch. There were occasions where the asking rate climbed over seven-an-over, but the former captain didn&#8217;t let it affect his cool batting.</p>
<p>Wickets kept tumbling at the other end, but he held fort and got his side agonisingly close to the 265-run target. Close enough that it didn&#8217;t take Thisara Perera much time to trigger celebrations in the Sri Lankan dressing room.</p>
<p><strong>Kohli &#8211; 200/100</strong></p>
<p>It was not a Kohli show with the bat, but his captaincy in the middle which impressed one and all. The way the young skipper juggled his bowlers in the middle throws light on his smart cricketing brain, especially under pressure.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohliap1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1995957" alt="ViratKohliAP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohliap1.jpg?w=480&#038;h=720" width="480" height="720" /></a></p>
<p>Sri Lanka, at one point, were cruising along. But Kohli continued to attack. He didn&#8217;t wait for things to happen and instead made them happen. Introducing Ashwin in short spells with attacking fields did the trick as the offie was successful in removing both the openers.</p>
<p>Jadeja, too, benefitted from Kohli&#8217;s street-smart thinking as the left-armer returned with impressive figures of 3/30. Jadeja&#8217;s spell almost did the trick for India, but Sangakkara&#8217;s ton turned out to be the difference between the two sides.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995886&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

(Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sachin-main.jpg" /></a> Former teammates Rahul Dravid, V V S Laxman and Yuvraj Singh also paid tributes to Tendulkar in the book. (Reuters)
<p>Batting legend Sachin Tendulkar was not too happy when he was asked by his then captain Sourav Ganguly to bat at number four in ODIs in 2002-03, according to a book.</p>
<p>Ganguly, who captained the recently-retired Tendulkar in 143 of the 341 international matches they played together, recalled that the Mumbaikar was brought back as opener during the 2003 World Cup in South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say, please, do it for a short while; of course you&#8217;ll be back up, let&#8217;s see how long it goes. Once he settled down to the idea and saw it work, it was fine. When things went a bit wobbly at the 2003 World Cup, he was back up straight away,&#8221; Ganguly said.</p>
<p>In an article featured in ESPNcricinfo&#8217;s new anthology &#8216;Sachin Tendulkar: The Man Cricket Loved Back&#8217;, Ganguly said that Tendulkar&#8217;s record as captain was better than people made out to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;He led on some very tough tours &#8211; South Africa, West Indies, Sri Lanka, Australia &#8211; and it must be said he didn&#8217;t lose eight in a row. This when he didn&#8217;t have a very good team around him. The older players were fading and the newcomers were too raw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When it came to being Sachin&#8217;s captain, it was about giving him due respect: treating him like a team-mate but also as the special player he was. He was central to the side doing well. He had to feel relaxed and comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Former teammates such as Rahul Dravid, V V S Laxman and Yuvraj Singh also paid tributes to Tendulkar in the book.</p>
<p>Dravid, who made a record 6920 Test runs with Tendulkar, said, &#8220;One sure indicator that (Tendulkar) was in good touch was when he played the flick to the leg side. Cricket is a game where you naturally have more fielders on the off side, and especially in limited-overs cricket, bowlers like to bowl tight lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;(Tendulkar) would be on his toes, on top of the bounce, and would often beat midwicket to the fielder&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>Sometimes he even beat square leg to his right with that flick, not to the full ball but the ones pitched short of a length. That made you marvel from the other end.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995796&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohliapm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995763" alt="Virat Kohli scored a fluent 48 before Ajantha Mendis picked his wicket (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohliapm1.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli scored a fluent 48 before Ajantha Mendis picked his wicket (AP)
<p>A very usual contest was on the cards as India and Sri Lanka, playing their 144th ODI &#8211; the most between two nations &#8211; against each other, took field in Fatullah. As if following a tradition, Sri Lanka skipper Angelo Mathews wasted very little time in putting India in. This time thanks to the dew.</p>
<p>For a change, something different happened. The Indian openers were tied down by the Sri Lankan seamers as Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma took time to get their eye in. Dhawan-Rohit were in desperate need of runs under their belt, and looked determined to get a big one today.</p>
<p>All, it seemed, was going according to the plan before Mathews spiced up proceedings. The skipper introduced spin as early as the fifth over of the innings, and stalled Indian progress. There were no such demons in the strip, but runs were not flowing against Senanayake&#8217;s accurate off-spin.</p>
<p>The offie got rewards early in his spell when he scalped Rohit in his third over, the ninth of the Indian innings.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rohitsharmaap.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1995958" alt="RohitSharmaAP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rohitsharmaap.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Rohit disappointment</strong></p>
<p>Another failure adds to Rohit&#8217;s already long list of disappointing performances. After his splendid double century against Australia, Rohit, in the 13 matches he has played, has scored only 304 runs at pedestrian average of 25.33. In the process, he has managed only two scores in excess of fifty, and the strike rate is not very encouraging either.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kohlidhawanap.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1995960" alt="KohliDhawanAP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kohlidhawanap.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The Delhi dashers</strong></p>
<p>Early wicket was no problem for the Indian skipper as the right-hander continued from where he left. Getting off the mark with a boundary signalled he was ready for a big one against his favourite opposition. Dhawan, too, gained confidence with the free-flowing Kohli at the other end as the duo scored runs at a brisk pace. In no time, they added 97 for the first wicket.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mendisssap.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1995963" alt="MendisssAP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mendisssap.jpg?w=480&#038;h=317" width="480" height="317" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The mystery</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>It seemed the Mendis mystery was a thing of the past when Kohli and Dhawan played the spinner with utmost ease in the middle. Kohli, in particular, was playing the spinner well and used his feet to perfection.</p>
<p>Something unusual happened again, this time in the 26th over of the Indian innings. Second ball: Mendis bowls slightly back of length, to which Kohli presents the full face and pushes through covers. Third ball: Mendis makes slight adjustment, pushes the ball slightly back and deceives the right-hander with the length and turn. Result: A shocked Kohli acknowledges the delivery, and makes the long walk back.</p>
<p>There was no looking back for the mystery spinner who added three more to his kitty, including Dhawan&#8217;s wicket, to end with figures of 4/60.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995756&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sangakkaraapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995853" alt="Asia Cup 2014: Sri Lanka rode on Kumar Sangakkara's masterclass to complete the task with four balls to spare (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sangakkaraapm.jpg" /></a> Asia Cup 2014: Sri Lanka rode on Kumar Sangakkara&#8217;s masterclass to complete the task with four balls to spare (AP)
<p>Quite a few times during Sri Lanka’s successful chase, which resulted in their two-wicket win over India, Virat Kohli would have missed a spinner. The Indian skipper would have rued not playing Amit Mishra and regretted choosing pace bowling all-rounder Stuart Binny as Varun Aaron’s replacement. Binny scored a four-ball duck and looked completely innocuous with his dibbly-dobblies. On a Fatullah Cricket Stadium pitch, where the ball gripped and stayed low, Mishra would have turned the ball and, maybe, the game in India’s favour.</p>
<p>The two frontline spinners, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, did enough to pull things back for their team. Jadeja removed Mahela Jayawardene and Dinesh Chandimal in the first two balls of his fifth over to put the brakes on Sri Lanka’s run chase. The left-arm spinner accounted for Chaturanga de Silva in his final over to keep India in the hunt but after his spell, India dragged their feet and finally gave up. Jadeja finished with three for 30 in his 10 overs.</p>
<p>Ashwin, returning to his usual action and wearing half sleeves, bowled well, too. Forty-two runs in his 10 overs with the wickets of Kusal Perera and Lahiru Thirimanne, was a good effort. He also reached the landmark of 100 ODI wickets in the process. But, by the time he and Jadeja were finished, five more overs were to be played. With Kumar Sangakkara and Thisara Perera at the crease and no specialist spinner at hand for Kohli, Sri Lanka had little worry. Pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami did get a few toe-crushers in but still the runs leaked. Eventually, Sri Lanka won by two wickets, with four balls to spare, to top the group. They now have only Bangladesh and Afghanistan to play against and their place in the final looks almost certain. For India, they will have to win against Pakistan on Sunday to stay afloat in the competition.</p>
<p><strong>Five drops</strong></p>
<p>Despite their fast bowlers’ lack of discipline, India would have managed to defend the total had they been sharp on the field. A total of five catches were dropped, and that meant Sri Lanka were let off the hook too often. A collision between Ajinkya Rahane and Shikhar Dhawan in the third over during Sri Lanka’s run chase allowed Thirimanne a reprieve. He was on one then. Four runs later, Jadeja dropped him at cover. Shami was the bowler on both occasions. Perera got a life when he was on 36. Another tough chance at deep mid-wicket off Binny and once again it was the team’s best fielder Jadeja who had failed to hold on to the catch. The two openers went on to add 80 runs for the first wicket.</p>
<p>But India were worst hit by a missed stumping as it would have dismissed Kumar Sangakkara. It was a faster delivery down the leg side from Jadeja that Sangakkara missed and lost his balance. Dinesh Karthik swung his hand towards the stumps but missed them completely. The left-hander ended up as his team’s batting hero with an 84-ball 103, his 18th hundred in this format.</p>
<p>It was a terrific innings under the circumstances. Sangakkara never looked to be in any sort of hurry but still ended up with a strike rate of 122-plus. He had to stay till the end to see his team through as wickets were falling at the other end. And when he got out in the 49th over, Sri Lanka were just seven runs away.</p>
<p>India’s young batsman would benefit a lot if they learn a few things from the Sri Lankan. Most of them lacked application. The pitch didn’t offer sharp turn but still eight Indian wickets went down to Sri Lanka’s spinners. Kohli got a very good delivery from Ajantha Mendis — a carrom ball that crashed into the off stump. Actually, Mendis’s inclusion in this game turned out to be a master stroke for Sri Lanka.</p>
<p><strong>Mystery returns</strong></p>
<p>The 27-year-old has always suffered for his inconsistency. But today was a good day for him and he deserved his four wickets. Sachithra Senanayake took three for 41 and left-arm spinner Chaturanga de Silva bagged Ambati Rayudu’s wicket. After a promising start, the latter just threw it away.</p>
<p>In fact, Sri Lanka were one bowler short as Mathews limped off after bowling just 3.2 overs. As usual, Lasith Malinga was not menacing against India, taking just one wicket for 58 runs in his 10 overs. But Mendis, with the wickets of Dhawan and Karthik inside three balls in his seventh over, was the game changer. From 175/3 at one stage, India were reduced to 247 for nine before a couple of sixes from Shami gave the total some respectability.</p>
<p>Earlier, Dhawan and Kohli put on 97 runs for the second wicket after an out-of-sorts Rohit Sharma got out cheaply. Dhawan returned to his one-day form after low scores in his last seven innings. But unlike Kohli, he still hasn’t acquired the skill to guide his team till the end.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995482&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/msdhoniapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1974703" alt="Mahendra Singh Dhoni is letting things happen, rather than causing them to happen (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/msdhoniapm.jpg" /></a> Mahendra Singh Dhoni is letting things happen, rather than causing them to happen (File)
<p>From his point of view, and of the long term benefit of Indian cricket, it was best that Mahendra Singh Dhoni missed the Asia Cup. He must be tired. Winning can sometimes mask that but losing accentuates it. When you are winning, there is always someone raising spirits, making 50-50 decisions feel like master strokes, making you believe that your instincts are still good enough. Winning is reassuring in many ways.</p>
<p>But when you lose, a tired mind accompanies a tired body. A good masseur and a caring physio can put you back in shape to play but it is not as easy to nurse the mind back. Suddenly you doubt yourself, you are not even certain whether long leg should have been a touch squarer, let alone whether or not backing your third seamer was a good idea. A losing captain also tends to be a lonely captain and negative thoughts can fester.</p>
<p>I’m just surprised that Dhoni isn’t tired oftener given the number of roles he plays in the Indian team. Being a wicketkeeper alone can be tiring, try going up and down five hundred and forty times a day, but add to that being captain and a frequent batsman, and the relentless scrutiny, and it makes it quite a lot. Writers get tired of writing, and often that is the only thing they do.</p>
<p><strong>Tired and tested</strong></p>
<p>A tired captain is bad for the side too. As a leader you have to sniff around for every opportunity. Dhoni has rarely had the luxury of bowlers he could throw the ball too and switch off, even if briefly, and so he needs to be even more alert. A tired mind can let things drift, see how often that happens to you for example. And inevitably, at such moments, the ball will go to where a fielder should have been but wasn’t.</p>
<p>Sometimes captains can get stale too. Like leaders in almost any walk of life, they have their way of doing things and that may get dated, or ineffective. They may have exhorted the team the same way, with the same words, and suddenly it doesn’t have the same effect. With Dhoni, some of these factors might be valid, there might be others, but it is apparent that he is letting things happen, rather than causing them to happen. I hope, therefore, that he is in the hills somewhere, taking in the still crisp air, and not reading newspapers or watching television. That might stress him even more.</p>
<p>But from India’s point of view there is another reason why this rest might be good. Dhoni is well into the second half of his captaincy and while his successor may still be some distance away from taking his place, we need to see how good he is. I think, like many others, that Virat Kohli will make a dashing captain one day but that hypothesis hasn’t been tested. As a leader he might be completely different in character from the way he is as a batsman, for example, and so he needs to captain the side a fair bit before he can get the job full time. A tournament like the Asia Cup will be just right for him. The competition will be tough but this is not the World Cup and so he can explore himself and his leadership skills. He can see if he really likes it because it is not mandatory that he must. Sometimes leadership can be far more attractive when you don’t have it.</p>
<p>However, if Kohli does like the job, and he displays some panache for it, and the players seem to warm to his leadership, it can offer India alternatives that might otherwise not be apparent. Why, it might even kindle a new fire in Dhoni as he sees a future challenger revel in captaincy. You never know!</p>
<p><strong>Quitting CSK captaincy</strong></p>
<p>I think India needs a fresh, hungry, and tactically agile Dhoni to lead India to England and Australia. Maybe from that point of view it is best if he gives up the captaincy in matches that, from the national team’s point of view, are less critical. Captaincy of the Chennai Super Kings, for example. It is not the first time I have advocated this and playing purely as an attacking batsman and wicketkeeper might reduce the stress a bit. Tiger Pataudi did that. He led India but in the Ranji Trophy he allowed his good friend M L Jaisimha to lead Hyderabad, even South Zone.</p>
<p>Apart from batting and bowling, there is something else to watch for at the Asia Cup.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995128&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohli100apm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994077" alt="Virat Kohli's 136-run knock came off 122 balls with 18 boundaries, including two sixes against Bangladesh. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohli100apm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli&#8217;s 136-run knock came off 122 balls with 18 boundaries, including two sixes against Bangladesh. (AP)
<p>He’s (Virat Kohli) batting exceptionally well, but we’ve (Lasith) Malinga. So we will see tomorrow,” Dinesh Chandimal spelled out the key contestants ahead of the Asia Cup clash between the two countries.</p>
<p>Usually, India-Sri Lanka cricket matches are not attritional. They&#8217;ve played so much against each other in the past. The present, however, is a little different. Matches come thick and fast in this Asia Cup and there&#8217;s no time to sit back and relax. A minor slip-up can lead to an exit from the tournament.</p>
<p>Kohli versus Malinga is an obvious and very popular catch-line for Friday&#8217;s game, once again to be played at the non-descript Fatullah. The stand-in India captain has scored a match-winning century in his first match of the tournament, while Malinga took five wickets against Pakistan to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.</p>
<p>The healthy rivalry between the two world-class performers adds spice to the contest but doesn&#8217;t make it the only thing to watch out for. India also have players like Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Ajinkya Rahane and Ravindra Jadeja. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, can boast of the collective experience and class of Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Angelo Mathews. Lahiru Thirimanne&#8217;s 110-ball 102 against the best bowling attack of the tournament in the first match suggested that the 24-year-old opener is an exciting prospect.</p>
<p>Chandimal talked about the &#8220;added advantage&#8221; of knowing the conditions better than their rivals. Indeed, Sri Lanka have been here for the last two months.</p>
<p>Despite playing each other several times in the last few years, the two teams are playing for the first time in seven months. The last time when they met, MS Dhoni decided the contest in the final over at the Queens Park Oval. His pyrotechnics won India the tri-series as Shaminda Eranga, who was the bowler, left the ground almost in tears. Dhoni is recuperating from a side strain at the moment, while Eranga is not picked for the Asia Cup. Both teams have some fresh faces who will be under the spotlight.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron or Pandey?</strong></p>
<p>Will India change their winning combination? Varun Aaron turned out to be easy pickings even for the Bangladesh batsmen, the extra pace notwithstanding. The replacement available is Ishwar Pandey, who hasn&#8217;t made his debut for the national side yet, despite travelling with the squad to New Zealand. The problem with going with an extra spinner is that heavy dew in the second half might make slower bowlers redundant. Still, spin is India&#8217;s strength and Amit Mishra might get a game during the tournament, though it is unlikely to be against Sri Lanka, considering Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja returned reasonable figures against Bangladesh.</p>
<p>India had an optional practice session on Thursday and those who warmed the bench for the first game had a decent workout in the nets. Mishra bowled with full intensity. Problem is that India usually don&#8217;t like to tinker with their 3-2 bowling combination. Also, going with just two specialist seamers is always fraught with danger in limited-overs cricket. Kohli is likely to play safe.</p>
<p>But spin is certainly on the mind of the Sri Lankans with Chandimal indicating that Ajantha Mendis could play a part on Friday. The two front-line Sri Lankan spinners, Sachithra Senanayake and Chaturanga de Silva, gave away 103 runs in their 19 overs for just two wickets in the first match. In good batting conditions, Mendis&#8217;s variety might help.</p>
<p>Back to Malinga and his ability to bowl yorkers at the death and make even the newish ball reverse. &#8220;This is his natural ability,&#8221; said Chandimal. But a bowling average of 42, compared to his career average of 27, and an economy rate of 5.95 against India suggest that the Indian batters handle him better than the rest.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/akmal.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995120" alt="Pakistan’s Umar Akmal kisses the ground after scoring a century against Afghanistan during their Asia Cup match on Thursday. AP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/akmal.jpg" /></a> Pakistan’s Umar Akmal kisses the ground after scoring a century against Afghanistan during their Asia Cup match on Thursday. AP
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Wicketkeeper-batsman Umar Akmal notched up a breezy century under pressure before the bowlers came to the party and guided Pakistan to a bonus-point 72-run victory over Afghanistan in the Asia Cup. Chasing a challenging target of 249, Afghanistan could only manage 176 in 47.2 overs in front of a disciplined Pakistan bowling attack.</span></p>
<p>Put in to bat, Pakistan rode on Akmal&#8217;s scintillating batting effort to post 248 for eight in their quota of 50 overs on a sluggish pitch at the Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium here. The young batsman smashed unbeaten 102 off 89 balls after Pakistan were reduced to 117 for six inside 30 overs. The 23-year-old, who scored 74 off 72 against Sri Lanka in the last match, clobbered three sixes and seven boundaries while helping his team recover from a precarious position.</p>
<p>Afghanistan, in reply, had a poor start as they lost opener Mohammad Shahzad (9) early. His partner, Noor Ali Zadran, played a few attractive shots at the other end. Zadran made 44 off 63 deliveries and hit seven boundaries, before he was trapped in front by off-spinner Saeed Ajmal.</p>
<p>Asghar Stanikzai and Nawroz Mangal started the resurrection job for Afghanistan and tried to build a partnership. Though the duo put on a 74-run for the third wicket, they failed to get the spiralling asking rate down. While Stanikzai consumed 91 deliveries for his 40, Mangal made 35 off 57 balls. Both hit three boundaries each in their 119-ball partnership.</p>
<p>With the required rate steadily going beyond reach, Afghanistan batsman played shots and perished in pursuit of quick runs. Afghanistan lost the wickets of Stanikzai and Mangal in the space of three balls. Skipper Mohammad Nabi (15) and Najibullah Zadran (1) failed to make an impact in the run-chase as Afghanistan fell way short.</p>
<p>The Afghan team faced difficulty in negotiating the Pakistan spin-trio led by Saeed Ajmal, who picked up two wickets while giving away just 25 runs in his nine overs. Shahid Afridi (1/31) and Mohammad Hafeez (3/29), too, kept the opposition batsmen in check, besides chipping in with wickets.</p>
<p><strong>Costly drop</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, things could have been much different had Samiullah Shenwari clung on to a straightforward skier at point when Umar Akmal was on 28. Pakistan, at that stage, were 146 for six.</p>
<p>Akmal went on to make a scintillating ton, which he brought up with a huge six off the penultimate ball of Pakistan&#8217;s innings.</p>
<p>Opener Ahmed Shehzad (50) contributed with a half-century and, along with Sharjeel Khan, got Pakistan off to a fine start, compiling 55 runs for the opening wicket before the latter was scalped for 25 off 37 balls. Sharjeel struck two fours and a six.</p>
<p>Next batsman Mohammad Hafeez (10) joined hands with Shehzad, but the duo could only add 23 runs before Mirwais Ashraf sent Hafeez back to the pavilion. Shehzad&#8217;s departure triggered a mini collapse and from 89 for two, Pakistan slumped to 117 for six. They lost four wickets for only 28 runs on the board.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: </strong>Pakistan 248/8 in 50 overs (Ahmed Shehzad 50, Umar Akmal 102*; Mirwais Ashraf 2/29, Samiullah Shenwari 2/29) bt Afghanistan 176 in 47.2 overs (Noor Ali 44, Asghar Stanikzai 40; Saeed Ajmal 2/25, Mohammad Hafeez 3/29)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995116&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Two teams in dire need of rehabilitation ahead of the next global cricketing contest start what should be an intriguing fortnight of competition when the West Indies host England in Antigua.</span></p>
<p>While the next World Cup in Australia and New Zealand is still just under a year away, the Caribbean side’s defence of the World T20 crown begins in three weeks’ time in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>So it will be no surprise if there is even greater interest and purpose attached to the three T20 fixtures between Dwayne Bravo’s men and Stuart Broad’s side in Barbados the week following the final ODI.</p>
<p>However, in the almost immediate aftermath of horrendous foreign campaigns, victories for either side in any format and against any opposition will be welcome. England’s annihilation in Australia over all three established formats of the game grabbed most international attention, but the West Indies also endured humiliating Test series defeats in India and New Zealand, despite performing more creditably in the one-dayers.</p>
<p><strong>Key players missing</strong></p>
<p>Both squads are without key performers going into the opening exchanges at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, named in honour of the tiny nation’s greatest cricketer. On England’s last visit to the Caribbean in 2009, the scheduled second Test in the same North Sound venue lasted all of nine deliveries before it was abandoned due to a poorly-prepared outfield covered with more sand than any of the island’s idyllic beaches.</p>
<p>Then, Kevin Pietersen had just been replaced as captain by Andrew Strauss. Now, he is out of the picture altogether.<br />
West Indies have no intention of parting ways with their own mercurial batsmen as yet.</p>
<p>Still, Chris Gayle will not be in the line-up for the three ODIs due to a back injury sustained in the first of two T20’s against Ireland the previous week in his native Jamaica.</p>
<p>It is hoped he will be fit for the T20s against the English, but the same cannot be said for power-hitting all-rounder Kieron Pollard who misses this series and the World T20 as he continues his recuperation from knee surgery.</p>
<p>In sharing the honours with the Irish in two scrappy, low-scoring matches and then taking the lone one-dayer by four wickets at Sabina Park, the home side presented little in the way of significant improvement.</p>
<p>And that suggests that England, for all their travails in Australia where they lost 12 of 13 international matches, may actually start the series as marginal favourites.</p>
<p><strong>West Indies: Dwayne Bravo (capt), D Smith, L Simmons, Darren Bravo, M Samuels, D Ramdin, D Sammy, N Miller, S Narine, J Holder, R Rampaul.</strong></p>
<p><strong>England: S Broad (capt), L Wright, A Hales, B Stokes, J Root, E Morgan, J Buttler, R Bopara, T Bresnan, C Jordan, J Tredwell.</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995112&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/louvincentapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995865" alt="Lou Vincent, who retired from all cricket last year, had failed to report the approach to the ICC (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/louvincentapm.jpg" /></a> Lou Vincent, who retired from all cricket last year, had failed to report the approach to the ICC (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Former New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent has pleaded guilty to not reporting an approach by a bookmaker while playing in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) last year. The 35-year-old Vincent is one of three former New Zealand cricketers under investigation by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for alleged match-fixing.</span></p>
<p>Vincent, who retired from all cricket last year, had failed to report the approach to the ICC while playing for the Khulna Royal Bengals in the domestic Twenty20 competition in January last year. “I confirm I rejected this approach at the time,” Vincent said in a statement carried by New Zealand media on Thursday.</p>
<p>“There is no allegation or suggestion anything untoward occurred beyond the approach itself. I also express I have no involvement in any of the matches, or matters, involving the other parties, which were the subject of recent hearings and investigation in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, I am unable to comment any further on this matter, as it is subject to an ongoing judicial process.<br />
Full co-operation</p>
<p>“I am also continuing to co-operate with the ICC in respect of other inquiries, they are making, which also restricts my ability to comment any further.”</p>
<p>The two other New Zealand cricketers being investigated have been named by local media but New Zealand Cricket (NZC) has declined to confirm their identities. The three have been probed as part of a wider investigation into alleged match-fixing in the BPL.</p>
<p>An anti-corruption tribunal found the managing director of BPL champions Dhaka Gladiators, Shihab Jishan Chowdury, guilty of a charge for being “a party to an effort to fix a match against Chittagong”.</p>
<p>The tribunal dropped charges against six other Dhaka players and officials, including Kent cricketer Darren Stevens, who was found not guilty of a charge of failing to report an illegal approach by a bookmaker.</p>
<p>The tribunal said it would set a hearing date for the sanction against Chowdury after releasing the “full reasons” of the judgement within two weeks.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the ICC and Bangladesh Cricket Board said they were “surprised and obviously disappointed with the outcome” of the tribunal hearing and held out the possibility of appealing the judgement.</p>
<p>Former Bangladesh captain and Dhaka batsman Mohammad Ashraful is also expected to be sanctioned within the next two weeks after confessing to match-fixing charges last year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995107&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/davidwarnerm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985630" alt="David Warner, who made the allegation in a radio interview, accepted the sanction from match referee Roshan Mahanama (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/davidwarnerm.jpg" /></a> David Warner, who made the allegation in a radio interview, accepted the sanction from match referee Roshan Mahanama (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Australia opener David Warner has been fined 15 percent match fee from the second Test for suggesting South African<a title="David Warner questions South Africa’s spirit" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/david-warner-questions-south-africas-spirit/" target="_blank"> AB de Villiers used his wicketkeeper’s gloves</a> to rough up one side of the ball in the Port Elizabeth match.</span></p>
<p>Warner breached an article of the Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel relating to “public criticism of, or inappropriate comment&#8230;” the International Cricket Council said.</p>
<p>There was no need for a formal hearing as Warner, who made the allegation in a radio interview, accepted the sanction from match referee Roshan Mahanama.</p>
<p>“It was disrespectful for David to publicly denigrate an opponent when commenting on a match-related incident, and imply that a South African player was engaging in sharp practice. I’m sure David will be careful when making public comments in future,” Mahanama said.</p>
<p><strong>‘Watch out for morkel’</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dale Steyn, the world’s number one test bowler, says his team mate Morne Morkel will be the player to watch when South Africa play Australia in the series-deciding third test starting at Newlands on Saturday.</p>
<p>Steyn tore through the Australian batting on Sunday to drive his side to a 231-run second-test win in Port Elizabeth that levelled the series at 1-1.</p>
<p>But on a Newlands wicket that is likely to be quicker with greater bounce, he believes Morkel may well be the most effective of the South African pace attack. “I thought Morne bowled extremely well on a flat wicket in Port Elizabeth and did the business. It was a different Morne from what we have seen,” Steyn said Thursday. “Morne was the guy who started things off in that first innings and he didn’t get the credit he deserved.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995102&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Warner has done it again. He has made allegations of very serious proportions without evidence on hand. But can there be smoke without fire? There obviously had been whispers in the Australian dressing-room, and in cricket circles around the world too, about Dale Steyn’s destructive spell that cost the visitors the second Test. His quotes indicated that the Aussies had found AB de Villiers’ gloves messing with the ball. So did Steyn get reverse swing because the ball was tampered with? A bit of history can help everyone to draw their own conclusion.</p>
<p>First the backdrop. Chasing 448, Australia had quickly progressed along to 141/1. The only wicket had come via JP Duminy. Steyn had gone wicketless till then, having only collected a single scalp in the game. The ball was just over 40 overs old but had hardly misbehaved.</p>
<p>The 22-yard strip at St George’s Park was a sluggish one, prepared specifically to neutralise the pace and bounce of Mitchell Johnson, who had blown the hosts away with fire and brimstone in the first Test. With no specialist spinner in the mix, South Africa’s only solace lay in finding reverse swing. It also had to be Steyn with his express pace generating it for the required effect.</p>
<p>Almost out of nowhere Steyn started getting the scuffed-up ball to go Irish and how. The bemused trio of Clarke, Smith and Haddin had no clue what hit them as Steyn turned into a chestnut-haired Waqar Younis, making the ball talk on a lifeless pitch. It was a brief and violent interlude to an otherwise staid period of play. One that destroyed Australia in addition to raising eyebrows in their camp.</p>
<p>There were denials from the visitors’ camp, from Ryan Harris in particular, about their firebrand opener’s remarks. But Harris was cryptic in his views insisting that both teams had tried to ‘work’ on the ball for the sake of getting it to reverse. Incidentally, South Africa had spent a major part of last year playing Pakistan, the renowned masters at ‘taking care of a cricket ball’, on slow and dry tracks in UAE. It was ironically during one of those series in the UAE that Faf du Plessis had been caught tampering with the ball by rubbing it near the zipper on his trouser pocket. Warner’s utterances can be questioned but his doubts do seem justified.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jogindersharmam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995875" alt="Joginder Sharma returned with impressive figures of 9-0-22-5 (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jogindersharmam.jpg" /></a> Joginder Sharma returned with impressive figures of 9-0-22-5 (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Defending small totals is not something new for Haryana. Since the time they have started hosting their Ranji Trophy games at Lahli, their bowlers have learnt the art of coming out on top of low-scoring games. On Thursday, Haryana once again excelled, their disciplined bowling forcing a batting line-up to throw away their wickets. Haryana defeated Punjab by eight runs after making just 153 in 32 overs of a reduced game of the Vijay Hazare Trophy.</span></p>
<p>Instrumental in Haryana’s win was their veteran seamer Joginder Sharma, who bowled his full quota of nine overs in one go, picking up a five-wicket haul, conceding just 22 runs. With the bat, Avi Barot made a much needed half century to help Haryana reach 153.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect line</strong></p>
<p>Sharma troubled the batsmen with his swing and off-the-wicket movement alongwith a great control. He perhaps learnt from how things went earlier in the day, when Manpreet Gony stuck to a testing line and picked up four Haryana batsmen. Sharma, in fact, went up to his batsmen to figure out what exactly he had to do to come out on top on a wicket that had something for the medium pacers.</p>
<p>“Our batsmen told me that it was difficult to play the swing on the Jamia Millia wicket. It was a huge boost for me since I have always been a swing bowler and not somebody who could bowl at a fast pace. I put all my learning over the years and decided not to give width to any Punjab batsmen. In a low scoring game, there is always a tendency to score quickly and that is when the opposition has a chance,” said Sharma.</p>
<p>As Sharma reached the ninth and final over of his spell, he had done the damage for Punjab. The scorecard read 54/7 after the eighteenth over with skipper Harbhajan Singh playing-on. Haryana was certainly moving towards the win.</p>
<p>Out of the five batsmen he dismissed, Sharma trapped two leg before, castled two and had one caught. He said varying his pace and swing was the key to his performance. “On a wicket like this, you have to make sure that the batsman doesn’t get used to either your pace or your swing. He should always be in two minds. The two LBWs that I got were by in-swingers, which is not my natural delivery. I set them up with away going deliveries, with a packed off-side field. On some deliveries, I deliberately reduced my pace , which is not to say that I bowled slower ones. We just stuck to a plan and worked around that,” Sharma said.<br />
support cast</p>
<p>If he was doing his bit from one end, Mohit Sharma and Harshal Patel supported him equally well from the other. Mohit picked up the important wicket of Manan Vohra while Patel trapped Himanshu Chawla and then had Gurkeerat Singh (31) caught during the batting power play.</p>
<p>With Punjab needing 40 runs in the last four overs, both Gurinder Singh and Manpreet Gony swung their bats but could only muster 32 runs. Gony smashed a couple of sixes which gave Punjab some hope and Gurinder supported him right till the end, making a fist of the chase. “I believe all our bowlers are capable of bowling in the death overs. I bowled out because I was in rythm. We have played cricket together and we now know how to bowl in such situations,” Sharma said.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: Haryana 153 for 8 in 32 overs (A Barot 55, N Saini 27, M Gony 4/39, S Kaul 2/22) beat Punjab 146 for 8 in 32 overs (Gurinder Singh 38*, G Mann 31, M Gony 26 n.o, J Sharma 5/22, Harshal Patel 2/31)</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995093&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ronaldoreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1995872" alt="Ronaldo scored two goals, in the 52nd and 57th minute, as Real Madrid won 6-1 in the first leg of their Champions League round of 16 match at Schalke (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ronaldoreutersm.jpg" /></a> Ronaldo scored two goals, in the 52nd and 57th minute, as Real Madrid won 6-1 in the first leg of their Champions League round of 16 match at Schalke (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Merciless Real Madrid pounced on a glut of Schalke 04 mistakes as they romped to another 6-1 away win in the Champions League on Wednesday, their second of the season, leaving the ragged Bundesliga side shattered and embarrassed.</span></p>
<p>The round-of-16 first-leg bore more resemblance to a playground kickabout than Europe’s top club competition as Schalke kept giving the ball away to Real, who simply ran down the other end of the pitch and scored.</p>
<p>Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice each and Real could quite easily have added to their tally against opponents who started promisingly but completely lost their composure after conceding two goals in a disastrous eight-minute first-half spell.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the home fans kept singing until the end and were rewarded when Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar volleyed in from the edge of the area for a stoppage-time consolation.</p>
<p>The result, Schalke’s heaviest defeat in European football. Real took their tally in the competition to 26 goals in seven games, 11 of them from Ronaldo.</p>
<p>“We made too many simple mistakes,” shattered Schalke coach Jens Keller told ZDF television, his tie undone and his hair flopping to one side.</p>
<p>“I’m satisfied with everything because that was the perfect game,” said Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
<p><strong>PROMISING START</strong></p>
<p>It started promisingly for the hosts when Benedikt Hoewedes headed wide from close range in the first minute. But Real were in front after 13 minutes when Bale was allowed to run unimpeded to the edge of the penalty area where he found Ronaldo, whose backheel slipped through Felipe Santana’s legs and fell for Benzema to fire past Ralf Faehrmann.</p>
<p>Schalke’s Julian Draxler was denied at point blank-range by Iker Casillas one minute later and Schalke’s hopes were effectively killed off with another Santana mishap. The Brazilian lost possession near the touchline to Benzema who flicked the ball to Bale and the Welshman dribbled cleverly between two defenders to score the second in the 21st minute.</p>
<p>Ronaldo, already impatient to get on the scoresheet himself, hit inside of the post and saw another shot blocked by Faehrmann’s outstretched leg as Real began to run riot. He then fired a free kick into the Schalke wall and did exactly the same on the rebound.</p>
<p>Ronaldo finally got on the scoresheet in the 52nd minute when he was left one-on-one with Joel Matip, performed some trademark stepovers and then flew past the defender before firing past Faehrmann.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, a Schalke cross into the visitors’ penalty area was cleared and Real were again allowed to pass their way upfield without any resistance. The move ended with another goal as Benzema found Ronaldo who flicked the ball back to the Frenchman to chip past Faehrmann.</p>
<p>Sergio Ramos sent Bale away for the fifth with 21 minutes still to pay after Schalke lost possession in midfield again. They still failed to learn and in the 89th minute, Roman Neustaedter lost the ball in his own half and Benzema quickly set up Ronaldo, who held off Matip and rounded Faehrmann for the sixth.</p>
<p><strong>ALL TO PLAY FOR</strong></p>
<p>Istanbul: Chelsea kept Didier Drogba well-shackled in his first game against the team he helped to win the Champions League but Aurelien Chedjou’s second-half goal earned Galatasaray a 1-1 draw in their last-16 first leg on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Cameroon defender took advantage of sloppy marking to find space in the box and steer home Wesley Sneijder’s inswinging corner on 65 minutes to leave the tie evenly poised.</p>
<p>Fernando Torres had silenced a raucous home crowd when he fired Chelsea into a ninth-minute lead but the Premier League leaders could not press home their first-half dominance and the Turkish side improved markedly after the break.</p>
<p>Galatasaray manager Roberto Mancini, who won the Premier League in 2012 with Manchester City, said his side had deserved at least a draw.</p>
<p>“Maybe in the first half we were too deep, we played with fear probably,” the Italian told reporters. “In the second half we probably deserved to score another goal because we played very well.”</p>
<p>His opposite number Jose Mourinho was also satisfied.</p>
<p>“In the second half they put pressure on us, they had attacking full-backs and powerful strikers. It’s better to be 1-1 than 0-0,” the Portuguese said.</p>
<p><strong>NOT LEARNING</strong></p>
<p>Drogba, Chelsea’s record European scorer with 34 goals in 69 games, was kept quiet in his first game against his former side since scoring the winning penalty when the Londoners lifted the Champions League trophy in May 2012.</p>
<p>Closely watched by Gary Cahill and John Terry throughout, Drogba headed a free kick down towards the far post but Selcuk Inan was guilty of a bad miss from close range as he could only steer his effort against the outside of the post.</p>
<p>Having enjoyed the letoff, Chelsea fell asleep a minute later at a corner when no one picked up Chedjou and the defender gleefully equalised from six metres out. Chelsea, always dangerous on the counter, had controlled the opening 45 minutes but just had Torres’s early goal as reward.</p>
<p>Andre Schuerrle set the overlapping Cezar Azpilicueta free on the left flank and his low cross was met by the Spaniard to fire low into an unguarded net.</p>
<p>The hosts countered with Izet Hajrovic blazing over Sneijder’s cutback and from another rapid Chelsea break, Ramires, with his bloodied nose plastered from an earlier aerial challenge, fired a Schuerrle cross high and wide.</p>
<p>Torres was denied a second by a sprawling save from Fernando Muslera soon after the restart but the game then went through a scrappy period, punctuated by a flurry of yellow cards shown by Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo.</p>
<p>With their tails up following Chedjou’s equaliser, Galatasaray pressed forward and Alex Telles forced Petr Cech to turn over his stinging drive but the Premier League club stood firm.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1995081&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Real Madrid staked its claim as the main challenger to Bayern Munich&#8217;s supremacy in Europe with a 6-1 rout of Schalke on Wednesday. With its star forwards firing on all cylinders, Madrid outclassed Bayern&#8217;s Bundesliga rival and only a miracle would now see the Spanish side fail to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League.</p>
<p>&#8220;Real and Bayern are the two best teams in the world,&#8221; Schalke coach Jens Keller said. This could be Madrid&#8217;s season. The club is sitting alone atop La Liga for the first time since the 2011/12 season, when it won the title.</p>
<p>And the devastating display against Schalke underscored Madrid&#8217;s ambition of taking Bayern&#8217;s crown in the Champions League, where it is seeking an elusive 10th title after being eliminated in the semifinals the last three seasons.</p>
<p>Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo scored two goals apiece to tear apart Schalke and coach Carlo Ancelotti was full of praise for his team.</p>
<p>&#8220;We played a very, very good match,&#8221; Ancelotti said.  &#8221;We got well into the match, scored two early goals and that opened the game and left us able to counter and to use the speed of our players.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goals from Benzema and Bale gave a Real a two-goal lead after 21 minutes, but in between Iker Casillas pulled off a stunning save from Julian Draxler. Jefferson Farfan sent a long cross that was slightly deflected and Draxler pounced from three meters, only to see Casillas react with an amazing reflex stop.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was an incredible save, maybe the crucial moment of the match,&#8221; Ancelotti said.  &#8221;It protected our lead.&#8221; And that from the `keeper who has slipped down the pecking order. Casillas only plays in the Champions League, while in the Spanish Liga, Diego Lopez takes his place.</p>
<p>After that, Schalke rarely threatened, although Klaas-Jan Huntelaar&#8217;s volley in stoppage time was the most spectacular of all seven goals on the night. Madrid&#8217;s individual class was never in doubt but the side now also plays with a newly found team spirit and seems to have a lot of fun on the pitch,  although that may be the easy part when a team is winning comfortably.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t just win anything with one player. It&#8217;s a team game. We&#8217;re all really working hard for each other,&#8221; Bale said. Benzema got the scoring going in the 13th. Bale played the ball to Ronaldo, who used his backheel to pass it through to Benzema to find the net.</p>
<p>The second came after a mistake by defender Felipe Santana who lost the ball to Benzema, although he had plenty of time to clear. Benzema fed it to Bale, who dribbled past three defenders before finding the left corner of Ralf Faehrmann&#8217;s goal.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Bale&#8217;s best game of the season,&#8221; Ancelotti said of the world&#8217;s most expensive player. Ronaldo hit the post in the first half and had some clear chances thwarted by Faehrmann. But Ronaldo finally scored in the 52nd, before each of the trio scored again.</p>
<p>Ronaldo and Benzema traded passes and waltzed through Schalke&#8217;s defense before Ronaldo fed the France striker with another backheel. Benzema raced past two defenders and rounded the keeper to score easily in the 57th.</p>
<p>Schalke then lost the ball in midfield in the 69th minute and Sergio Ramos sent Bale through, leaving the forward to slot the ball past Faehrmann and inside the far post. Ronaldo scored his second by rounding Faehrmann after collecting a pass from Benzema in the 89th.</p>
<p>It was that kind of night for Real, entertaining dribbles, powerful shooting, clever passing, a performance that had everyone at the stadium in awe.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difference in class was clear,&#8221; Schalke&#8217;s Draxler said.  &#8221;We can forget about the second leg and concentrate on the Bundesliga.&#8221;</p>
<p>Defender Benedikt Hoewedes said every mistake was punished, &#8220;and we made too many mistakes. Real was a class better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Madrid&#8217;s victory ended the team&#8217;s poor run in Germany, of its previous 25 matches there, the Spanish giants had won only one, a 3-2 success in 2000 at Bayer Leverkusen. The Spanish league leader is unbeaten in 27 games, its best run since 1988/89 when it went a record 34 games unbeaten.</p>
<p>Ronaldo now has a competition-high 11 goals this season and 61 goals in 98 Champions League matches, third behind Raul Gonzalez (71) and Lionel Messi (66). In the other last-16 match on Wednesday, Chelsea earned a 1-1 draw at Galatasaray.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994369&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>&#8220;I think my players saw what we are capable of, and we now know we can actually go through.&#8221;</p>
<p>His opposite number Jose Mourinho, who replaced Mancini as Inter Milan coach in 2008 and subsequently guided the Italian club to the Champions League title in 2010, was also satisfied.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Turkish football, it&#8217;s very emotional, Galatasaray are a big club with big players and it was not easy,&#8221; the Portuguese said.<br />
&#8220;In the second half they put pressure on us, they had attacking full-backs and powerful strikers. It&#8217;s better to be 1-1 than 0-0.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kagisorabadaiccm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994221" alt="Rabada (Right) cut the Australian batting to ribbons, claiming six wickets in just 8.2 overs (ICC)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kagisorabadaiccm.jpg" /></a> Rabada (Right) cut the Australian batting to ribbons, claiming six wickets in just 8.2 overs (ICC)
<p>While it was Dale Steyn who ripped apart the Australian batting line-up in a fiery spell on the fourth day at Port Elizabeth, it was the turn of Kagiso Rabada, playing for the South Africa under-19s to serve up a similar kind of treatment to the Australian colts on Wednesday. It almost seemed as if it was Rabada against the Australians, as the 18-year-old from Johannesburg troubled them with his pace and bounce, ending with 6/25. South Africa made the final with an 80-run win.</p>
<p>The pacer idolises South Africa’s bowling spearhead for his aggression and the ability to move the ball at high speed. If Steyn had watched Rabada on Wednesday evening, he would have been proud. The strapping Rabada pummeled the Australian batsmen with accurate bouncers and when he pitched it full, he got it to come in sharply, often surprising batsmen with late movement.</p>
<p>Rabada cut the Australian batting to ribbons, claiming six wickets in just 8.2 overs. South Africa will now face Pakistan for the title on Saturday at the Dubai International Stadium.</p>
<p>Rabada’s fifth over, with Australia at nine for no loss chasing 231 to win, was a fearsome display of the 18-year-old’s strength and control. He began with a vicious bouncer, angled into the body of Mathew Short. The ball, bowled at over 135 kmph, something that Rabada does without too much fuss, climbed swiftly on to the batsman. Short’s weak attempt at a pull only resulted in an edge which Clyde Fortuin gobbled up. Last ball of the over, Rabada showed that he wasn’t all about pace. He pitched one on good length, got it to shape in just a touch. The movement coupled with Rabada’s customary pace seemed to catch Damien Mortimer completely by surprise, as the ball rattled the stumps. At the end of the over, Australia were 18 for 2. A couple of overs later, Rabada made a mess of Jaron Morgan’s stumps with the score at 33.</p>
<p>Alex Gregory, the Australian skipper, had picked this moment to shepherd his side home. Gregory and Jake Doran, Australia’s highest run-scorer over the tournament, stitched a watchful 63 run partnership. However, just as it looked like Australia had finally found some sort of stability, Rabada was back, albeit in a different capacity. Corbin Bosch’s full ball was hammered to mid-off by the Aussie skipper. The ball hit ferociously, seemed headed for the fence, only for Rabada to magically get his hands on the ball. With Gregory gone, Australia looked to have thrown in the towel. Doran, their biggest hope, was dismissed lazily wafting at a ball that seamed away. A run-out opened up the tail and Rabada ran through them.</p>
<p><strong>Unbeaten Saffers</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, South Africa who are unbeaten in the tournament, won the toss electing to bat. They were given a great start by their opening pair who put on 105 runs in just 20 overs. Skipper Aiden Markram scored a studious 45 but it was the wicket-keeper, Fortuin, who really took the attack to the Australians. The right-hander slammed 74 off 92, slashing and pulling his way to eight boundaries, providing a strong foundation for the rest of the Protea batters. However, with the departure of Markram and Fortuin, the rest of the batters found the going tough.</p>
<p>The Australian bowlers did a sterling job of bowling tight and exactly to the field that was set for them. Mathew Short was the pick of the lot being miserly with his off-breaks. The 18-year-old gave away just 14 runs in the seven overs that he bowled and most importantly sent back the dangerous Fortuin and Kirwin Christoffels. Short was well supported by Tom Andrews, the leg-spinner. Valli was responsible for taking South Africa past the 200-run mark after the innings seemed to have stagnated dangerously.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> South Africa 230 for 9 in 50 overs (C Fortuin 74, A Markram 45; M Short 2/14, B Stanlake 2/36) beat Australia 150 all out in 42.2 overs (J Doran 36, A Gregory 31; K Rabada 6/25, C Bosch 2/25)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994216&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was bound to happen with Ravichandran Ashwin. He has been trying so many variations for a very long time now. In this case a bowler is bound to lose his original style and that is exactly what I feel is happening with him. He is basically doing what he is comfortable with at the minute because he doesn’t know his original action.</p>
<p>When a bowler starts relying on so many variations he is bound to lose his consistency. I feel Ashwin is using more variations than he has numbers of balls to bowl in an over. When you do that you are going to lose control. I sometimes wonder what the bowling coach does with him, letting the lead spinner drift away like that.</p>
<p>I think we should seriously get rid of a bowling coach like that. I feel proper guidance from somebody who is a spinner is very important before we totally ruin these spinners.</p>
<p>If Ashwin has started bowling a lot of variations then simply the captain and the coach are letting him do it. When the whole world knew what it was leading up to, the captain and the coach didn’t know? They should have just ask him to stop there and then. If they don’t do it even now, we may see him bowling medium pace soon.</p>
<p>I won’t say that it will be too tough for him to get back to what he used to bowl like but if anybody doesn’t tell him to focus on his off-spinners, then it will get a bit difficult. Here it is important that somebody who knows spin bowling should guide Ashwin. Someone who has bowled a lot of spin should be made to counsel these (spin) bowlers.</p>
<p>I doubt what Dawes can tell our spinners. He was a fast bowler himself. So it is time that we turn to someone who has bowled in the domestic circuit and international stage. As a cricket lover and a former Indian cricketer, I felt so bad when I saw Rayudu bowling like that. It is a joke and I said I am not watching it.</p>
<p>I feel as a spinner you should base your variations around your stock ball. I remember he replaced Harbhajan Singh because Harbhajan was getting twenty overs in a Test to get a wicket. I think Ashwin is becoming very similar. I really feel that it is high time that we should start thinking about how to improve these bowlers for the 2015 World Cup. We just need to bring in right people. It is a long time until the World Cup and a lot of good can still be done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ashwinreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994210" alt="Ashwin’s long-time coach Sunil Subramaniam for one had seen it coming (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ashwinreutersm.jpg" /></a> Ashwin’s long-time coach Sunil Subramaniam for one had seen it coming (AP)
<p>Ravichandran Ashwin had a wicket with the first ball he bowled on Wednesday. It came off a flighted delivery that Mominul Haque inside-edged onto his pads with the ricochet getting to Dinesh Karthik who smartly broke the stumps before the batter could react. Ashwin couldn’t have imagined a better start to his spell, you would have thought, especially considering the drought of wickets that has plagued his bowling in recent times.</p>
<p>It wasn’t his early success, however, that took everyone by shock. Instead it was his drastically changed bowling action. India’s premier off-spinner has had a tendency to employ different actions in Test and ODI cricket. Here at Fatullah, though, he had opted for a complete makeover. If anything it looked like a taller, heftier version of Sunil Narine was in action donning India colours.<br />
Ashwin might not have managed any trademark Narine doosras, but a few of his deliveries did leave the Bangladeshi right-handers. Just for the record, he was also operating with full sleeves on.</p>
<p>The change in action had come out of nowhere. There were no hints of it in the nets during India’s practice session on the eve of their Asia Cup opener. In fact, Ashwin hardly bowled and seemed more keen on working on his batting skills. Replicating Narine in a bid to get back to wicket-taking ways might come across as a desperate move. But the desperation is understandable. It was also an indication of the 27-year-old’s muddled state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>Desperate measure?</strong></p>
<p>From being his country’s lead spin exponent, Ashwin’s stocks have dipped rapidly over the last couple of months. While he’s already lost his place in the Test XI to Ravindra Jadeja, his ODI returns in South Africa and New Zealand were nothing short of disastrous — two wickets put together in eight matches at an average of 198 apiece.</p>
<p>Ashwin’s long-time coach Sunil Subramaniam for one had seen it coming. He had made his apprehensions regarding his ward’s fast dipping fortunes public following the ODI series in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“He has lost his way a bit. But this is a technical thing. Perhaps, the team thinks he is a sorted-out guy and someone who can handle himself. They keep overstating that fact that he will take care of himself. But that’s not how spin bowling works,” Subramaniam had said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Subramaniam is likely to have been one of the many to have cringed at Ashwin’s latest delivery style, more so after he had only last month pointed out the deficiencies that had crept into the Tamil Nadu offie’s original bowling action. “There is no body in his action. He is just bowling from his hands. How can you expect to take wickets,” Subramaniam had lamented.</p>
<p>Though he conceded only two boundaries — a six and a four — against Bangladesh, he rarely had the likes of Mushfiqur Rahim in any discomfort. Even his altered style of delivery didn’t see him flighting the ball more and hitting a fuller length like his coach would have liked him to. Despite the encouraging start, he eventually ended up with the not-so-impressive figures of 1/50 in his 10 overs.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994204&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shihab Jishan Chowdury, a co-owner of Dhaka Gladiators in the Bangladesh Premier League, has been found guilty of ‘being party to an effort to fix’ a match during the 2013 season of the event. However, Kent batsman Darren Stevens and five others, against whom formal charges for being part of the fix were laid, have been found not guilty by an International Cricket Council tribunal that investigated the alleged corruption in the BPL.</p>
<p>Apart from Stevens, two other Gladiators players who were named in the case, Mahbubul Alam and Mosharraf Hossain, were also let off the hook with ‘not guilty’ judgements by the tribunal, as were Salim Chowdhury, owner of the Gladiators, Gaurav Rawat, CEO of the Gladiators franchise, and Mohammad Rafique, former Bangladesh spinner and Gladiators’ bowling coach.</p>
<p>However, cricket’s parent board ICC and the head board for cricket in Bangladesh BCB, are not pleased with the tribunal’s verdicts. In a statement on Wednesday, the ICC and BCB had this to say: “The ICC and the BCB have received the determination and are surprised and obviously disappointed with the outcome. Both organisations await the tribunal’s detailed written determination setting out the reasons for the outcome, which will be provided shortly, and will consider it carefully before determining the next steps, including whether to appeal any aspect(s) of the judgment.”</p>
<p>Others, it goes without saying, were pleased with the ruling. “I am absolutely delighted by the verdict,” said Mosharraf Hossain. “There was a lot of pressure on me, but I feel relieved. Now I will start playing domestic cricket again, try to get a place in the national team. I just got embroiled. But thanks to the judges, now I can play again.”</p>
<p>Shihab’s punishment, along with that of Bangladesh batsman Mohammad Ashraful — who had confessed to have fixed matches in the BPL — will be declared at a later date.</p>
<p>The allegations of spot and match fixing in the BPL first surfaced when Nazmul Hassan, president of BCB, confirmed that a few players in the tournament had been questioned by the ICC. While Ashraful was the first player to admit that he was involved in corruption, the other player to be questioned and indicted is yet to be named.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Kent player in clear</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stevens, the 37-year-old all-rounder from Kent, had been charged with two counts of failing to report a corrupt approach while playing for the Dhaka Gladiators, and faced a five-year suspension from cricket if found guilty.</p>
<p>“I would officially like to thank the tribunal for their verdict today and in particular their determination of non guilty findings in charges brought against me by the Bangladesh Cricket Board,” Stevens said in a statement on Kent’s website.</p>
<p>“I can assure all of the fans of the Dhaka Gladiators, the people of Bangladesh and all cricket followers, that I have always played the game of cricket honestly, with integrity and to the best of my ability,” he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994196&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/davidwarnerm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994194" alt="David Warner alleged that de Villiers used his gloves to rough up one side of the ball, helping SA bowlers gain reverse-swing in the second Test (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/davidwarnerm1.jpg" /></a> David Warner alleged that de Villiers used his gloves to rough up one side of the ball, helping SA bowlers gain reverse-swing in the second Test (File)
<p>Australia opener David Warner’s claim that South Africa tampered with the ball during the second test has “added 10 percent motivation” ahead of the series decider, Proteas coach Russell Domingo said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Warner told Sky Sports Radio the Australians felt AB de Villiers had used his wicketkeeper gloves to rough up one side of the ball, helping their bowlers gain reverse-swing during South Africa’s crushing 231-run victory on Sunday.</p>
<p>“We were actually questioning whether or not AB de Villiers would get the ball in his hand and, with his glove, wipe the rough side every ball,” the left-hander told Sky Sports Radio.</p>
<p>“That’s another thing we have to try to bring up with the umpires.”</p>
<p>Domingo dismissed the comments and said it gave his side extra motivation to claim a first home series win over Australia in 44 years in the decider at Newlands starting on Saturday.</p>
<p>“It’s disappointing when guys throw these accusations around, it’s added an extra 10 percent motivation to the guys following the comments he has made,” Domingo said. “We pride ourselves on playing the game as hard as we can, but also in a fair manner. I just don’t think it is a nice comment to make, I don’t think teams should be accusing other sides of that.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Sour grapes’</strong></p>
<p>Proteas manager Mohammed Moosagee also rejected Warner’s complaint as “sour grapes” and said few people took the outspoken Australian’s words seriously.</p>
<p>“David Warner’s remarks are disappointing and discouraging. It takes the gloss off a great Proteas team performance, having come back from losing the first test and then going on to win the next,” Moosagee told South African newspaper DFA.</p>
<p>“It smacks of sour grapes and it could just be a tactical plan to get us involved in matters that will distract our attention from this crucial test in Cape Town,” he said.</p>
<p>The Proteas would not seek any action against Warner, who followed up his first innings 70 with a belligerent 66 in the second, and would leave it to the game’s governing ICC to look into the remarks, Moosagee added.</p>
<p><strong>Johnson handled</strong></p>
<p>Turning to Australia’s bowling, Domingo said South Africa had mastered Mitchell Johnson after restricting the quick to three wickets in the second test. Johnson blitzed the opposition batsman as he took 12 wickets for 127 runs in Australia’s impressive 281-run victory on a lively wicket in the first test in Pretoria.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994190&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/virendersehwagm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994188" alt="While Gambhir is expected to open the batting, it is not clear whether Sehwag will join him at the top of the order (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/virendersehwagm.jpg" /></a> While Gambhir is expected to open the batting, it is not clear whether Sehwag will join him at the top of the order (File)
<p>In thirteen visits to the wicket during the Ranji Trophy season, Virender Sehwag scored just one half century — against Vidarbha at the Roshanara Club Grounds in New Delhi. The first innings knock came after Vidarbha were bowled out for just 88 but as Delhi piled 448, Sehwag’s highest score of the season was overshadowed by a century by Mithun Manhas in a game his side won by an innings and 156 runs. For a batsman who used to dominate bowling line-ups, Sehwag has failed to put even a domestic attack to sword.</p>
<p>In an effort to make runs, Sehwag dropped himself down the order except for the final league game against Karnataka, a side which arguably has the best bowling attack. Opening with Gautam Gambhir, Sehwag made 32 and 11 at the Feroze Shah Kotla, which remains his last outing.</p>
<p>From Thursday, Sehwag, now 35, will get another opportunity to find form when the zonal leg of the Vijay Hazare Trophy begins. At the Feroz Shah Kotla nets on the eve of Delhi’s first game against Jammu and Kashmir, Sehwag chose to practice the cover drive against a series of throwdowns. Delhi skipper Gambhir’s stint in the adjacent nets against the fast bowlers and the spinners was longer.</p>
<p>But more than the duration in the nets or the intensity of practice, what will matter is whether Gambhir and Sehwag put a price on their wicket and show the intent to bat for long periods in a tournament they wouldn’t have been playing if they remained Team India regulars.</p>
<p>Gambhir has had a better Ranji Trophy season compared to Sehwag. A century against Haryana, three half-centuries and 123 against West Indies A has kept him in the reckoning. In the run-up to the Vijay Hazare Trophy, there has been enough happening off the field &#8211; Gambhir and Kotla curator Venkat Sundaram had another run-in over the nature of the wicket on Monday &#8211; to distract him.</p>
<p><strong>Differences settled</strong></p>
<p>On Wednesday, the difference between Gambhir and the curator was ‘amicably solved’, which means he can now focus on the task at hand — of leading the defending champions from the front.</p>
<p>Gambhir and Sehwag fall in the category of those India players who have fallen down the pecking order and are striving to make a comeback. The Baroda trio of Irfan Pathan, Yusuf Pathan and Munaf Patel will also strive to catch the eye of the selectors. Both the Pathan brothers were handed pay cuts at the IPL auction, a reflection of the fact that they are not considered to be as valuable as they used to be but they are better off than Munaf Patel who remained unsold. Uttar Pradesh medium-pacer Praveen Kumar too suffered the same fate as of Munaf at the IPL auction, hence opportunities to prove his worth will be limited. Kumar will be captained by Suresh Raina, culled from the Indian ODI team for the Asia Cup and currently only part of India’s Twenty20 side.</p>
<p>Bengal batsman Manoj Tiwari returns to action following an injury-layoff after knee surgery. Tiwari missed the first-class season after going under the knife and the injury-prone batsman will be hoping that he lasts the full tournament on his comeback. His appearances for India has been limited to eight ODIs and three T20Is since making his international debut seven years ago.</p>
<p>Punjab skipper Harbhajan Singh’s progress will be keenly followed following the recent poor form of Ravichandran Ashwin, who replaced him in the Indian side.</p>
<p>Outside those who have played for India and are looking for a foothold to make a comeback are a set of hopefuls with potential. Among them are Jammu and Kashmir captain Parvez Rasool, Rajasthan’s medium-pacer Pankaj Singh, Himachal Pradesh’s all-rounder Rishi Dhawan &#8211; the highest wicket-taker in Ranji Trophy this season &#8211; Karnataka middle-order batsman Manish Pandey. Of these Rasool came the closest when he was part of the Indian team, which toured Zimbabwe last year but didn’t get a game in the 5-0 series win.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Jammu and Kashmir, which reached the knock-out stages of the Ranji Trophy for the first time in over two decades this season, face a Delhi side that comprises Gambhir, Sehwag and Ashish Nehra. Since being eliminated in the quarterfinals by Punjab, Rasool and his side will get a platform to show that they can compete against teams which have big names in their ranks.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994183&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mananvohram.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994180" alt="Manan Vohra was retained by the Kings XI Punjab for IPL 7" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mananvohram.jpg" /></a> Manan Vohra was retained by the Kings XI Punjab for IPL 7
<p>When Punjab and Haryana walk out to take the field at the Jamia Millia Islamia, a lot of attention will be directed towards an unusual suspect. It is not Harbhajan Singh or Yuvraj Singh, or even Mohit Sharma but Manan Vohra. The 21 year-old from Chandigarh recently hit the headlines when he was retained by Kings XI Punjab alongside David Miller, despite being an uncapped player. Manan Vohra will shoulder a huge responsibility when he takes guard on Thursday against Haryana in the Vijay Hazare Trophy as it also marks his List A debut.</p>
<p>The expectations are bound to be high but Vohra seems relaxed and knows that the Vijay Hazare tournament is a different challenge. “Being retained by KXIP is a huge confidence for me. The IPL itself is a great platform as some good performances can open a lot of doors. I feel a bit under pressure but I guess pressure sometimes helps you perform better. Vijay Hazare is my priority right now and I would like to get big runs under my belt,” says Vohra.</p>
<p>Vohra said but he wasn’t expecting to be retained by the KXIP. “I clearly had no idea that something like this would happen. I was busy playing the Ranji game in Jharkhand when I got a call from one of the KXIP officials that I have been retained and not going into the auction,” Vohra says.</p>
<p>When Vohra walked back after batting in the nets, coach Bhupinder Singh praised his ward. “He is a very talented player. He is in fine form and I expect him to take the side through. At the same time, I want him to be more responsible as a batsman. I am saying this because in the past he has played unnecessary shots and gotten out at crucial junctures. He is not a kid anymore and he has to realise that he is playing first class cricket. And there is no age to play higher grade of cricket. If he can make 50-60, he can go on to make a hundred and century is the minimum benchmark for a batsman. So this a great platform for him,” Singh says.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of patience</strong></p>
<p>Even Vohra admits that his lack of patience led him to miss out on big scores, but that is something he has changed over the course of the season. “Earlier I used to get impatient while playing. I wanted to score fast and used to throw away my wicket. I have started to focus more on scoring singles just to ease pressure off me,” he says.</p>
<p>The results have been there to see as Vohra has been a changed player since the CK Nayudu Trophy this year. He scored three back to back hundreds and took his form into the Ranji Trophy and scored a century against Jharkhand. Then before coming to Delhi for the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he was adjudged the best batsman in the Katoch Shield (senior inter-district tournament).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994173&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Manchester City won their first Premier League title in 44 years in 2011/12, while Dortmund won their second-consecutive Bundesliga title then. Since then, both teams have peaked and crested, struggling to find equilibrium.</p>
<p>As the adage goes, it is easier to get to the top than to stay there. Outside of the occasional outlier, this is true of most football clubs.</p>
<p>While their performances may not have dipped much — both clubs have entrenched themselves near the top of their leagues —there has been a noticeable change in results. In seasons when City had, arguably, the best squad in the league, City won 27 out of a possible 36 points against other teams in the top seven in 2011/12. The count dropped to 20 of 36 in 2012/13 when they finished second and this season, City have 18 out of 24 so far.</p>
<p>While losing their best player each year since their last title, Dortmund, against the rest of the top seven, have gained 25 of 36 in their league-winning season, 18 of 36 when finishing second and 0 of 18 this time round.</p>
<p>City and Dortmund have stated objectives of building dynasties. Dynasties are built on stability and the ability to change. As the French say, the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>
<p>One may glean from this a certain truth gained from countless hours of playing Football Manager &#8212; it gets boring to win all the time if one does not have a culture of winning serially. It takes a certain ruthlessness and an unending well of motivation to keep reinventing oneself, and stay one step ahead of the opposition.</p>
<p>New teams are built around the &#8216;Have money, will buy&#8217; principle but it is difficult to buy trophies consistently, for a league is a season-long grind and a great marker of team culture. Money can rarely buy that. That is why, however much you may dislike them, Ferguson, Mourinho and Guardiola, among modern managers, cannot be discounted. They have found their own methods of beating the law of diminishing returns. Manuel Pellegrini and Jurgen Klopp, with their constant tinkering and infusion of players, are trying to find their own paths to put one over that same law.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/championsleaguem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994143" alt="Olympiakos' Alejandro Dominguez scored past United goalkeeper David de Gea in the 38th minute (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/championsleaguem.jpg" /></a> Olympiakos&#8217; Alejandro Dominguez scored past United goalkeeper David de Gea in the 38th minute (AP)
<p>Manchester United&#8217;s troubled season took another turn for the worse on Tuesday as David Moyes&#8217; side slumped to a 2-0 first leg defeat to Olympiakos in the last 16 of the Champions League. Moyes described the match as “the worst performance in Europe” he&#8217;d seen from his players, and took full responsibility for the result.</p>
<p>Argentine striker Alejandro Dominguez broke the deadlock at Karaiskaki Stadium when he got his foot to a shot from Yiannis Maniatis in the 38th minute and turned the ball past goalkeeper David de Gea.</p>
<p>First-half composure from the visitors soon turned to complacency after the break when striker Joel Campbell, on loan from United&#8217;s Premier League rival Arsenal, caught De Gea off guard with a well-placed shot in the 55th minute.</p>
<p>Wayne Rooney produced no threat up front and strike partner Robin van Persie missed the visitors&#8217; only clear chance — a shot over the crossbar in the 82nd minute — as United slipped to its first defeat in the Champions League this season.</p>
<p>“It was a very poor performance, and we didn&#8217;t deserve to get anything. To a man there was nothing,” Moyes said.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m just surprised. I just didn&#8217;t see that level of performance coming. We didn&#8217;t offer enough on the night to create any goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Olympiakos coach Michel Gonzalez played down the implications of the result, saying that 2-0 wasn&#8217;t a big enough margin to give an advantage in terms of qualifying.</p>
<p>“I will never say anything bad about Manchester United, because I have such great respect for them. The players know that we still have more to do,” Gonzalez said.</p>
<p>“But I can&#8217;t hide it. I am very happy. It&#8217;s the players I&#8217;m so proud of &#8230; to get this result against a team of this caliber.”</p>
<p>Runaway leaders in the Greek league, Olympiakos fielded its untested strikers after the sale last month of Kostas Mitroglou. But the hosts threatened early with Dominguez nearly grabbing a goal in the eighth minute, stopped only by a last-ditch tackle from Nemanja Vidic.</p>
<p>Moyes brought on Danny Wellbeck and Shinji Kagawa in the second half but they made little impact, while Olympiakos nearly made it 3-0 in 67th but Michael Olaitan failed to finish.</p>
<p>Premier League champions last season under Alex Ferguson, United is currently sixth in the domestic standings — 15 points adrift of leader Chelsea. It also made an early exit from the FA Cup at the hands of Swansea.</p>
<p><strong>Dortmund’s opening blitz </strong></p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund struck twice in the first five minutes and Robert Lewandowski grabbed a second-half double as last season&#8217;s Champions League runners-up won 4-2 at Zenit St Petersburg in their last 16, first-leg tie on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dortmund got off to a flying start when Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marco Reus scored two quickfire goals to stun Zenit, who were playing their first competitive game since the two-month winter break.</p>
<p>A dramatic second-half spell saw four goals in 14 minutes as Oleg Shatov and Hulk, with a penalty, scored for Zenit and Lewandowski quickly replied each time for the visitors.</p>
<p>Zenit, who are trying to reach the quarter-finals for the first time, were left with an almost impossible task of having to score at least three goals in the return on March 19.</p>
<p>Zenit were quickly in trouble as Reus burst into the area and, although he stumbled, the ball ran kindly to Mkhitaryan and the Armenian fired the ball past Yuri Lodygin.</p>
<p>The Zenit goalkeeper had to pick the ball out of his net again 70 seconds later after Mkhitaryan burst down the right and found Kevin Grosskreutz who laid the ball off for Reus to score with a clinical first-time finish.</p>
<p>Zenit were penned back in their own half and their problems mounted when midfielder Andrey Arshavin went off injured and was replaced by Anatoliy Tymoshchuk.</p>
<p>Dortmund began the second half on the attack as their Poland striker Lewandowski had a powerful shot turned around the post by Lodygin.</p>
<p>The Russians reduced the deficit in the 57th minute with a scrambled goal when Oleg Shatov fired home from the rebound after Jose Salomon Rondon had one effort headed away and then hit the post.</p>
<p>Lewandowski restored Dortmund&#8217;s two-goal advantage four minutes later after combining with compatriot Lukasz Piszczek in a counter-attack down the right.</p>
<p>Hulk pulled another back for the hosts with a controversial penalty in the 69th minute, awarded after Viktor Fayzulin dribbled into the area and collided with Piszczek.</p>
<p>But Zenit gifted Dortmund another goal when Tymoshchuk was dispossessed in his own half by Reus, who slipped the ball through for Lewandowski to score with a low, angled shot.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994136&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kohlirahaneapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994083" alt="Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane stitched a crucial partnership under pressure (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kohlirahaneapm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane stitched a crucial partnership under pressure (AP)
<p><em>Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane&#8217;s 213-run stand was the talking point of India&#8217;s convincing run-chase against Bangladesh.</em></p>
<p>With the first opener &#8211; Shikhar Dhawan &#8211; back in the hut as early as the 12th over of the innings, the onus of chasing another stiff target was on champion chaser Virat Kohli. The burden on Kohli&#8217;s captain shoulders increased when he saw a delivery crash into Rohit Sharma&#8217;s stumps. Sharma, after a decent start, couldn&#8217;t carry on and was dismissed for 21.</p>
<p>In walked Ajinkya Rahane, a player trying to cement his position in this Indian ODI outfit, with a lot of expectations. With the scorecard reading a disappointing 54/2, it was required that the duo stay there and lay a solid platform. They not only did that, but ensured India humble the hosts in their Asia Cup opener in Fatullah on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>Caution and aggression</strong></p>
<p>Kohli-Rahane partnership was a perfect mix of caution and aggression. During the first 50 runs, it was a Kohli show. The Delhi dasher scored freely and faced most of the deliveries as Rahane continued to play an able partner&#8217;s role. The ball was doing a bit early on, with the odd one keeping very low. The host&#8217;s seamers were bowling in a great channel as there weren&#8217;t too many scoring opportunities on offer.</p>
<p>For India, it required a lot of adjustment, especially after away tours of South Africa and New Zealand, to dictate terms in the middle, especially with the bat. Kohli and Rahane did what the doctor ordered.</p>
<p>Survived the early phase, and went about doing business professionally.</p>
<p><strong>Captain, you beauty!</strong></p>
<p>For the record books, this was captain Virat Kohli&#8217;s eighth win on the trot. And, all of them have come away from home.</p>
<p>With this hundred, his 19th in ODIs, Kohli now becomes the batsman with most ODI hundreds in Bangladesh &#8211; five.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s knock? Oh, how well did he play. His ability to rock back on to the back-foot in a flash, drive it on the up, slash it behind square and clear the ropes with ease makes him a champion chaser. There is no area where you can keep this run-machine quiet. He adjusted very early to the slow nature of this surface, and when the time came he opened his shoulders &#8211; first to accelerate the scoring and then to celebrate his 19th ODI hundred.</p>
<p>There was no punch in the air, no swearing, no shouts or signals to the dressing room, but just the raise of the arms and a kiss on the crest. Meet the mature Kohli.</p>
<p><strong>Unsung hero</strong></p>
<p>While all the limelight went to skipper Kohli, very little went to the one who deserved the larger share of the success pie. Rahane, coming into this tournament with a Test hundred and a poor ODI series under his belt, faced a do-or-die situation. With Cheteshwar Pujara warming the bench, an ordinary tournament here can well direct him back to the bench.</p>
<p>But the Mumbaikar had other plans. He came into bat in a pressure situation and was happy to rotate the strike and observe Kohli champion another chase from the other end. There was no flamboyance in his stroke play, but a lot of thought and intelligence. The right-hander paced his innings brilliantly and played a perfect partner to Kohli.</p>
<p>Had it not been Rahane&#8217;s application in the middle, it could have been a different story altogether.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1994080&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rahimappm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993950" alt="Bangladesh's Mushfiqur Rahim, center left, embraces teammate Nasir Hossain after scoring a century during the Asia Cup match against India (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rahimappm.jpg" /></a> Bangladesh&#8217;s Mushfiqur Rahim, center left, embraces teammate Nasir Hossain after scoring a century during the Asia Cup match against India (AP)
<p><em>Varun Aaron&#8217;s erratic spell of fast bowling, which almost knocked out the Bangladesh skipper, was the talking point of the first half of the game.</em></p>
<p><strong>Express pace, now hide your face</strong></p>
<p>Varun Aaron marked his longish run-up, ran in hard, bowled a delivery well over the 140 km/h mark, only to see Anamul Haque dance down the track and dispatch it into the stands for a maximum, not once but twice.</p>
<p>This pretty much summed up Aaron&#8217;s erratic day with the ball. There was no lack of effort or intent, but the seamer failed to hit the right areas. On batting havens like this one, an express bowler erring in line is a bonus for the batsman, who loves the extra yard or two on a misdirected delivery. One such delivery almost knocked out the Bangladesh skipper. It seemed the ball slipped out of his hand, but the umpires were not pleased. This was the second occasion that he bowled full above the waist line and the umpires wasted no time in getting him off the attack.</p>
<p>Yes, there was nothing in the surface for the quicks, but Mohammed Shami bowled an inspiring enough spell with the new ball first up. He did bowl full early on, but made the quick adjustment to a rather shortish length. Result: He ends with impressive figures of 4/50 and Aaron with 1/74 in 7.5 overs.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rahim.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993957" alt="Rahim" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rahim.jpg?w=480&#038;h=673" width="480" height="673" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The little dynamo</strong></p>
<p>The pint-sized Bangladesh skipper definitely punched above the weight against an Indian side very successful in home-like conditions. Mushfiqur Rahim was not bogged down, both by the Indian attack and the occasion, as he worked his way to fine century against the attack comprising of specialist ODI bowlers.</p>
<p>The little right-hander was in no hurry at the start and rotated the strike well. He was happy to give on-song Anamul Haque more strike, and found the ones and twos well. Once he crossed the 50-run mark, there was a sense of urgency in his shot selection. The skipper started creating room, cleared the front leg on occasions and placed the ball with perfection. In his 113-ball 117, Rahim played all around the wicket and made the Indian bowlers pay for an ordinary effort with the ball.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ashwin.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993956" alt="Ashwin" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ashwin.jpg?w=480&#038;h=799" width="480" height="799" /></a></p>
<p><strong>New action, old problems</strong></p>
<p>R Ashwin, with long sleeves and a different action, picked a wicket on the first ball of his spell. He tossed it up, beat the batsman in flight and exposed the slow nature of the surface early on. Those visuals promised a spinners&#8217; day out.</p>
<p>That was probably the only high of Ashwin&#8217;s spell. After that wicket, he looked very ordinary. Yes, there was a change in action, especially before he delivered the ball, but there was no change in the deliveries he bowled. No consistency, shortish length, wayward line and the hosts were all at ease against his slow and gentle offies.</p>
<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/shami.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993958" alt="Shami" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/shami.jpg?w=480&#038;h=403" width="480" height="403" /></a></p>
<p><strong>No yes, no mine as Rayudu collides</strong></p>
<p>Shami, in between of a fine spell of fast bowling, forced the batsman &#8211; Shamsur &#8211; to play a false stroke on a rising delivery. The ball, after taking the outside half of the batsman&#8217;s blade, spooned up in the air. And, there was silence!</p>
<p>Two fielders &#8211; the bowler Shami and Ambati Rayudu &#8211; were charging towards the ball, but didn&#8217;t bother to call for the catch. Result: They crashed into each other, but to India&#8217;s relief Shami held on to that one.</p>
<p>Veteran Indian opener Sunil Gavaskar was livid with this act and said this is something which you learn at the junior level. Is this cricket at the highest level?</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993947&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohli100apm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994077 " alt="Virat Kohli celebrates after reaching the three-figure mark during the match against Bangladesh on Wednesday (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohli100apm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli celebrates after reaching the three-figure mark during the match against Bangladesh on Wednesday (AP)
<p>After India were reduced to 54 for two in 12.5 overs, chasing 280 for victory, it became imperative that captain Virat Kohli stayed till the end, score big and see the side through. Kohli didn’t finish things off, but by the time he got out, after scoring 136 off 122 balls, India had already won the game. Any apprehension about the stand-in skipper being bogged down by the added responsibility were dispelled at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium’s dew-sodden outfield on Wednesday. It was Kohli’s 12th ton in a successful run chase and 19th overall in ODIs, which put him on par with Brian Lara. On Wednesday, he went about his task very methodically and made most out of the loose balls. His innings was laced with 16 fours and two sixes and he had a strike rate of 111.</p>
<p>There was just a half-chance when Kohli was on 35, but Rubel Hossain at square-leg dived over the ball and let the opportunity slip.</p>
<p>The latter somewhat made up for his error by sneaking through the defence of India captain but it was a little too late.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>A Score to settle</strong></p>
<p>India had some score to settle. Two years ago in the Asia Cup here, they lost to the hosts. And ahead of this game, there were some big talks from the Bangladesh camp with medium pacer Mashrafe Mortaza taking a dig at their more fancied rivals, saying it would not be an upset for Bangladesh to beat India. Normal service was restored on Wednesday. Ajinkya Rahane, preferred over Cheteshwar Pujara despite scoring 2, 3, 3, 36 and 7 in his last five ODIs, responded positively. An 83-ball 73 was classy but Rahane would be disappointed to perish softly &#8212; a tame scoop to long-on with just eight runs left for victory. “I backed myself. Also, I scored a century in the last Test in New Zealand and carried forward that confidence into this game,” said Rahane.</p>
<p>Together, he and Kohli added 213 runs in 32.5 overs for the third wicket to help India get back to winning ways after a series of losses. Their stand also silenced about 17,000-odd fans who turned up at this small venue. Most of them started to leave midway into India’s run chase.</p>
<p>The pitch was good for batting, though the odd ball kept low. Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan began steadily but once again they wasted their starts. Dhawan went first when he played over a straight delivery from left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak and was caught plumb in front. Rohit was bowled through the gate by Ziaur Rahman. Bangladesh were just one more wicket away from putting India under serious pressure, but Kohli and Rahane didn’t let that happen. In the end, the six-wicket win looked very comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>A bold statement</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Mushfiqur Rahim made a bold statement with the bat. Ahead of their Asia Cup opener, the Bangladesh captain was summoned by his cricket board for publicly making his displeasure felt on matters of team selection. Also, without Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan, he was the team’s main batting hope. He came at a time when Bangladesh were under pressure, having lost Shamsur Rahman and Mominul Haque for just 49 runs. Rahim started off cautiously but soon found his rhythm.</p>
<p>He countered R Ashwin — the off-spinner was bowling with a changed action — by using his feet to very good effect. He withstood pain to complete his second ODI hundred. Interestingly, it was only the second time in ODIs that both captains scored centuries in the same match.</p>
<p>The 39th over in the Bangladesh innings was eventful. Rahim had already hit Varun Aaron for 14 runs in his first four balls. Aaron’s response was a beamer that rammed into Rahim’s rib-cage. The skipper was grimacing in pain but didn’t cut short his innings. He reached his hundred in the 46th over. Later, while fielding, he badly hurt his right shoulder and was taken to the hospital for an x-ray. The beamer cost Aaron dear. It was his second offence that barred him from bowling further in the match. Rahim let nothing to affect his concentration and ended up with 117 runs in 113 balls. It was a fantastic effort.</p>
<p><strong>Different strokes</strong></p>
<p>If Rahim’s batting was picture-perfect, Amanul Haque was a bit ungainly. He preferred to stand and deliver but was effective anyway. His 77 off 106 balls was a good effort which allowed his captain the time to settle. Together they added 133 runs for the third wicket which was Bangladesh’s highest partnership for any wicket against India.</p>
<p>For India, Mohammed Shami picked up four wickets, keeping it tight upfront and varying his pace and length in the death overs. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was steady with the new ball without being threatening, while Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja managed to get in some tight overs. But Aaron, despite working up serious pace, leaked runs freely and conceded 74 in his 7.5 overs before being removed for the transgression.</p>
<p>The Indian bowlers managed to keep Bangladesh to a par total on this surface but matches against stronger opponents will give a better idea of where they stand. For the first time in a long while, the seamers tried to utilise the two bouncers per over rule. The flip side was that Ambati Rayudu had to bowl in the middle-overs. Without Yuvraj Singh or Suresh Raina, India lacked a proper sixth bowling option. They might need one against Sri Lanka and Pakistan.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993729&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/royhodgsonreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994053" alt="England have suffered a miserable record in penalty shootouts (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/royhodgsonreutersm.jpg" /></a> England have suffered a miserable record in penalty shootouts (Reuters)
<p>England manager Roy Hodgson is considering using a psychologist to help his side avoid more penalty heartbreak at the World Cup in Brazil later this year.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not averse to using a psychologist,” the 66-year-old told Sky Sports.</p>
<p>“We are considering the possibility of inviting someone with us but I think it&#8217;s very important they&#8217;re someone who is part of the group. I&#8217;m not sure just suddenly shipping someone in to give the players a lecture would work.</p>
<p>England have suffered a miserable record in penalty shootouts, having been knocked out of six tournaments since 1990 after failing from the spot, including their quarter-final defeat by Italy at the 2012 European Championships, Hodgson&#8217;s first event in charge of the national team. Their only success in that period came in a quarter-final win over Spain at Euro 1996, and Hodgson said he was prepared to enlist the help of a professional to help his players prepare, as well as spending time practising on the training pitch. “I think there&#8217;s another possibility, we should be encouraging players to know their penalty, to practise that penalty. When you practise penalties within your group the goalkeeper knows the players, so maybe we won&#8217;t do it with a goalkeeper.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a matter of how we assure ourselves that when those players go up they are as well prepared as they can be. In the final analysis it will be their character, their confidence and their ability to block out tomorrow morning&#8217;s headlines.Some players are good at that, other players find it harder. If a psychologist can find a way of getting a player to block that out we’ll be very, very happy.” Hodgson has also invited Dave Brailsford, the man who helped grow British cycling into a global force, to speak to his players.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993347&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Galatasaray&#8217;s Didier Drogba will be full of emotions when he strides out to face former club Chelsea on Wednesday but Jose Mourinho knows the striker will be as clinical as ever on the field.</p>
<p>Klaas-Jan Huntelaar of Schalke has gone on to become one of the Bundesliga&#8217;s most prolific strikers since he was shunned at Real Madrid and will finally have a chance to show his former club what they are missing on Wednesday. The Champions League last-16 first-leg clash in Istanbul will be the first time the Ivorian will share the pitch with the Blues since scoring the winning penalty when Chelsea lifted the trophy in May 2012.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old, who media reports say could return to the London club as striker coach, is Chelsea&#8217;s record European scorer with 34 goals in 69 games. Including the spot kick in the Munich shootout and his header late in normal time, he has also bagged nine goals in nine domestic and European finals. His sizeable contribution to the club&#8217;s recent history is apparent from the number of posters of him still dotted around Stamford Bridge.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a strange feeling but, as we know him so well, we know that for him no friends during the game,” Chelsea boss Mourinho, who managed Drogba during his first spell at the club, told reporters. Drogba moved to Chelsea in 2004, Mourinho&#8217;s first season, and stayed after the Portuguese departed in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>PREVIOUS MEETINGS</strong></p>
<p>Mourinho, who rejoined Chelsea in the close season, has already experienced playing against Drogba in the Champions League. Both times Mourinho was on the winning side. Galatasaray manager Roberto Mancini was not too optimistic about his side&#8217;s fate. “I know Chelsea very well. For us it will be a very difficult game because Chelsea are used to playing these important games but we want to play a good game if it&#8217;s possible,” the Italian said. Mourinho is hoping Brazil defender David Luiz and Nigeria midfielder John Obi Mikel, who missed the 1-0 win over Everton on Saturday with minor injuries, will be fit for Wednesday.</p>
<p>Oscar is carrying a knock while January signings Mohamed Salah and Nemanja Matic are cup-tied.</p>
<p><strong>MADRID&#8217;S GERMAN HOODOO</strong></p>
<p>Huntelaar&#8217;s Schalke 04 host the nine-times European champions on Wednesday in the first leg of their round-of-16 tie and the Dutchman, who has scored 51 goals in 89 league appearances for the German side, is looking forward to it as much as anyone.</p>
<p>“I worked very hard to return as soon as possible and now I am back, playing, helping the team and scoring goals,” the 30-year-old, who returned to action in mid-January after a four-month layoff caused by a knee injury, told the Spanish sports daily Marca.Real bought Huntelaar from Ajax for 27 million euros in January 2009 and he scored a respectable eight goals in 20 appearances, yet it failed to impress one of the world&#8217;s most demanding clubs.</p>
<p>Just eight months later, he was sold to AC Milan for 15 million euros.Huntelaar ended up spending a season at AC Milan, where he scored seven goals in 30 appearances, before joining Schalke in 2010. Coincidentally, Milan and Real met in the Champions League that season but Huntelaar was an unused substitute in both games.</p>
<p><strong>NO OPTION</strong></p>
<p>“Madrid is a great club, with fantastic people,” he said. “I arrived during a difficult time for the club in every sense. “Despite everything I was focused on playing, on fighting for a place in the team, but they didn&#8217;t give me a chance and they left me no option.” Schalke, eliminated by Galatasaray at the same stage last season, have won six and drawn two of their last eight games but it would still be a huge upset if they could overcome Real, beaten semi-finalists in each of the last three season.</p>
<p>Real, on the other hand, scored 20 goals in the group stage, with a record nine coming from Cristiano Ronaldo, and they dropped only two points. They are unbeaten in their last 26 games in all competitions, a run stretching back to October. However, they have a very poor record in Germany with only one win in 25 previous visits and their 18 defeats included last season&#8217;s humiliating 4-1 loss to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993342&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rogerfedererreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994056" alt="Roger Federer wants to do well in Dubai to show his Australian open semi-final last month represented a step forward and not backwards (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rogerfedererreutersm.jpg" /></a> Roger Federer wants to do well in Dubai to show his Australian open semi-final last month represented a step forward and not backwards (Reuters)
<p>Grand Slam record-holder Roger Federer began the second phase of what he hopes will be a revival of his fortunes by racing into the second round of the Dubai Open. In the process, he displayed some care-free hitting, lively footwork, and an air of authority which evoked his greatest days. Beating Benjamin Becker, the German once ranked in the top 40, 6-1, 6-4, was some way from suggesting these might return, but Federer did look pleasingly upbeat and confident as he dispatched a competent middle-range opponent in only 62 minutes.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Swiss legend, now ranked only eight, wants to do well in Dubai to show his Australian open semi-final last month represented a step forward and not backwards, and that his game still has the potential to reach its former levels.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m playing top tennis right now, so I don&#8217;t need to top that stuff,” Federer claimed for his Melbourne efforts, which saw him beat Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and former Australian Open finalist Tomas Berdych.</p>
<p>“For me it&#8217;s a matter of staying healthy now, staying consistent, and getting to semi-finals and finals consistently and giving myself opportunities really. I feel I am in good enough shape as in a year at least now.” Certainly Federer has never made a more eye-catching start to this tournament. He made several effective forays to the net and found an extra gear with his ground strokes when he had chances to break serve, which he did twice in the first set and once in the second.</p>
<p><strong>Hot dog</strong></p>
<p>He also managed one moment of pure theatre. Forced by a Becker lob to make a hasty retreat from the net, Federer not only managed that but responded with a hot dog — a shot between the legs — which  parabola-ed into a perfect counter-lob, and set up an unanswerable drop shot.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s rare to hit a lob with a hot dog, and I&#8217;m happy he got the ball back,” said Federer, probably wishing not to humiliate Becker, though the rapture with which the winning two-shot combo was received must have been disconcerting. Federer&#8217;s only faltering moments came while he was closing the match out at 5-4. He failed to convert two match points, made three unforced errors in a row and went break point down when he volleyed wide.But afterwards he seemed satisfied with his work. “You have to be a little bit confident to play attacking tennis,” he said. “Thank god I served well, which you have to in the quicker conditions here in Dubai. Then if you hit well you have an opportunity to come in.”</p>
<p>It had been, he suggested “really good fun out there.” Relaxation was at the root of his confidence, and days of practice on these Dubai courts was how he engendered the confidence. “Really I&#8217;ve been preparing for this like for a really big tournament. I&#8217;ve been here since Saturday now, or Friday”, Federer said.<br />
“I&#8217;ve had over a week&#8217;s preparation with not much to do other than practise, so it&#8217;s been a really good preparation. I hope it&#8217;s going to pay off.”</p>
<p>If he wins the title back he will prevent Novak Djokovic from equalling his record of five titles here. He next plays the winner between Radek Stepanek, the gifted former top ten Czech, and Michael Russell, the 106th ranked American, and is seeded to play Djokovic in the semis. Djokovic begins his campaign on Tuesday against Denis Istomin, the world number 54 from Uzbekistan.</p>
<p><strong>Bopanna-Qureshi in QF</strong></p>
<p>Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-ul-haq Qureshi progressed to the doubles quarterfinals of the Dubai Duty Free Championships after overcoming qualifiers Nikolay Davydenko and Victor Hanescu via Super Tie breaker. The second seeded Indo-Pak pair defeated the Russian-Romanian combo 6-1 5-7 10-8 in one hour and 28 minutes in the opening round of the USD 2,359,935 hard court tournament. They meet winners of the first round match between the pairs of the Oliver Marach/ Florin Mergea and Mahesh Bhupathi/Denis Istomin.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993339&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Napoli are six points behind second-placed AS Roma after continuing their frustrating habit of dropping points against mid-table opponents.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993328&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Napoli&#8217;s decision to loan Emanuele Calaio to Genoa came back to haunt them on Monday when the 32-year-old scored with a late free kick in a 1-1 Serie A draw costing his owners two points in the race for a Champions League spot.</p>
<p>Third-placed Napoli had taken a first-half lead with Gonzalo Higuain&#8217;s 13th Serie A goal this season before Calaio curled a left-foot free kick over the wall and in off the post with six minutes left. Calaio, who joined Napoli when they were in Serie C in 2005 and helped them return to the top flight, was muted in his celebrations. Calaio left Napoli in 2008 but returned last year before being loaned to Genoa, who have an option to buy him, this season. Napoli are six points behind second-placed AS Roma after continuing their frustrating habit of dropping points against mid-table opponents.</p>
<p>Rafael Benitez&#8217;s side, who occupy the Champions League playoff place, have 51 points, six clear of fourth-placed Fiorentina, who earlier drew 2-2 at Parma in a game which produced three red cards. Roma, with a game in hand over the other teams in the top four, have 57 points and leaders Juventus 66. Fiore&#8217;s Matias Fernandez curled in a majestic 30-metre free kick five minutes from time to earn them a point at Parma. The Chilean sent an ambitious, diagonal shot over the wall into the far top corner as they twice came from behind despite playing most of the second half with 10 men.</p>
<p>Parma&#8217;s Antonio Cassano fired in from close range to give the hosts the lead after 39 minutes and Juan Cuadrado levelled two minutes later for Fiorentina.<br />
controversial penalty Parma, who are seventh on 37 points, regained the lead six minutes after halftime with a controversial penalty awarded for a high challenge by Nenad Tomovic on Jonathan Biabany and converted by Amauri. Fiore, already seething over that decision, were further aggrieved two minutes later when Modibo Diakite was sent off for a second bookable offence after a foul on Cassano.</p>
<p>There was more trouble in stoppage time when Parma were awarded a free kick outside the Fiorentina penalty area and a scuffle broke out as the visitors tried to organise their wall. Fiorentina playmaker Borja Valero and Parma substitute Gianni Munari, who had only been on the field for 10 minutes, were sent off for lashing out.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993328&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[In 2018, the indoor ice sports will be in Gangneung, a northeastern coastal city of about 230,000. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993332&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The sun was shining once more by the Black Sea, and the jackets were off with the Olympic flame still a few hours away from being extinguished. “You better bring your jacket to Pyeongchang,” said Kim Jin-sun, head of the organizing committee for the 2018 Games in South Korea. “Much colder than Sochi.”</span></p>
<p>As the Russians and the members of the International Olympic Committee begin recovering from the sleepless nights that surely accompanied their wild, seven-year ride to Sochi’s closing ceremony, the cosmic question is this: Where do the Winter Games go from here in a world of climate instability, declining winter sports participation numbers in the West and spiraling costs and scale for Olympic organizers?</p>
<p>For now, all that is clear is that the next Games are going to Pyeongchang, long the leading destination for winter sports in South Korea and now eager to challenge Japan for that role in East Asia.</p>
<p>The good news for those who still cannot wrap their head around Sochi’s reported total expenditure of $51 billion &#8211; trains, roads and gondolas included &#8211; is that Pyeongchang does not need to build everything from scratch.</p>
<p>It already has five of its 13 venues, and a different plan. As has become fashionable, the 2018 Games will be a two-cluster affair: with the indoor ice sports in the city and the snow and sliding sports in the mountains. But the difference in Pyeongchang’s case is that the mountain sites are taking the lead in symbolic and practical terms.</p>
<p>In 2018, the indoor ice sports will be in Gangneung, a northeastern coastal city of about 230,000. But the focal point in terms of identity will be Pyeongchang, the more lightly populated nearby county where the mountain sites will be based and which will also be the site of the opening and closing ceremonies.</p>
<p>One of the first orders of business will be to try to halt the flood of phonetically challenged Westerners who continue to confuse Pyeongchang with the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Mutual development of both countries is a hopeful prospect, and so &#8211; in a much more minor key — is Pyeongchang’s centralized attempt to put the accent on atmosphere. Kim said he expects full venues because of local enthusiasm and relatively easy access from Seoul’s capital.</p>
<p>“The finish areas of the venues are very close to the ski resort,” he said. “So we think we can create the Olympic atmosphere there, and the Seoul metropolitan area, with 25 million, will be one hour away by the high-speed railway and one and a half hours by car on the new expressway.”</p>
<p>As future Olympics approach, the I.O.C. needs to reconsider whether it truly wants to raise the sociopolitical bar to hosting the Games: creating even clearer language about discrimination or freedoms or transparency. But after all the effort, most of it not by Vladimir V. Putin, it seemed churlish to emphasiSe the negative Sunday night as the athletes and officials and even a few fans streamed out of the gold medal hockey game onto the new esplanade to snap photos of the sun setting over the Black Sea.</p>
<p>There was a Russian girl, no more than 8, wrapped tightly in a Canadian flag. There were young Russian women with Canadian flags painted on one cheek and Swedish flags on the other. Everywhere there were people laughing, posing, enjoying (and smoking).</p>
<p>The palm trees by the shore were soon silhouetted against an orange sky, underscoring once more that this was an outside-the-box Winter Olympics. It was also a polarizing Winter Olympics: one that like a classic Russian novel was brimming with darkness and light and all the shades in between.</p>
<p>Next fascinating subject: Pyeongchang. Don’t forget to bring a warmer jacket.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993332&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Defending champion Suresh Rana, 2013 Asia Pacific Rally Championship winner Gaurav Gill and former World Rally champion (production class) Karamjeet Singh all crashed out of the Maruti Suzuki Desert Storm during the first stage of the opening leg that was flagged off from Sardarshahar close to midnight on Monday and concluded in the wee hours of Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>Rana was the first one to bow out after he failed to complete the very first competitive stage of this year’s edition. The drivers had to make an 85.92km journey within Sardarshahar in Rajasthan, driving through the deserts and braving the dunes during the first stage. Rana, the two-time champion with the highest number of motorsport golds in the last two decades, did not get an opportunity to test his car before the race and that cost him dear. The clutch plate of his Grand Vitara for Team Maruti wore out during last 10kms of the night stage and he was forced to withdraw. He will continue competing in the race but is out of contention for the overall title.</p>
<p>While the night stage claimed the first high-profile victim, Gill fell by the wayside during the second part of the opening leg on Tuesday morning. Driving from Sardarshahar to Bikaner, Gill’s car suffered an electrical failure 60kms off the finish line.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993330&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Anirban Lahiri, the two-time defending champion, will attempt a hat-trick of titles at the SAIL-SBI Open, the Asian Tour’s season opener, which begins at the Delhi Golf Club from Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>The win in the last edition kick-started a good year where Lahiri finished runner-up at the Worldwide Selangor Masters, Venetian Macau Open and Indian Open. The string of consistent performances earned him a spot in Team Asia for the inaugural EurAsia Cup next month in Malaysia. With a career high-ranking of 106, Lahiri is aiming to break into the top-50 this season and he appears optimistic about his chances.</p>
<p>“I had a good couple of seasons in the last two years because I had a good start to those seasons. And this is the only year that I have played a lot of golf before the SAIL open, so in a way I am match fit,” Lahiri said.</p>
<p>The strong field will feature five players from the top-10 of last year’s Order of Merit. Bangladesh’s Siddikur Rahman, who bagged fourth place on the 2013 Order of Merit, two-time Hero Indian Open champion Thaworn Wiratchant (Thailand), past winners Chapchai Nirat and Swedish Rikard Karlberg will be the other top contenders.</p>
<p>The Indian challenge will be strengthened by the presence of former Asian Tour winners SSP Chowrasia, Jyoti Randhawa, Digvijay Singh, Rahil Gangjee,and Himmat Singh Rai. Himmat said, “We always look forward to DGC. It is so unique and its variation always offers something new in it. The golf course is in good shape and there would be plenty of scoring opportunities and I hope I can club together four rounds of exciting golf.”</p>
<p>Lahiri added, “I played nine holes. It is playing good but there have been rains. But conditions will improve if it gets some more sunshine.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993325&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rooneyreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994060" alt="Wayne Rooney's contract is reportedly worth about $26 million per year (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rooneyreutersm.jpg" /></a> Wayne Rooney&#8217;s contract is reportedly worth about $26 million per year (Reuters)
<p>The day after Manchester United made Wayne Rooney the highest-paid player in Britain, a fan (or fans) of an opposing team threw coins at him as he prepared to take a corner kick.</p>
<p>Rooney&#8217;s reaction was measured and mature. He picked the loose change off the turf, handed it to the referee, and got on with his game. For good measure, Rooney later scored the goal of the game in United&#8217;s 2-0 victory at London&#8217;s Crystal Palace. The pittance hurled at the player is no laughing matter. Coins thrown in anger or derision can blind. It was at this same ground 19 years ago where Eric Cantona launched a kick into the face of a fan who had taunted him.</p>
<p>Rooney did well not to respond with anger or aggression. In fact, he channeled his own mercurial mix of the belligerence and beauty into the class act of the game when he scored the second conclusive goal of Saturday&#8217;s match. Manchester United had by then worn down the well-organized defiance to its patently greater talents. Palace had played on the back foot, until a clumsy tackle by Marouane Chamakh upended United fullback Patrice Evra just inside the penalty box. With consummate ease and might, Robin van Persie dispatched the penalty kick.</p>
<p>That was the second-best kick of the match. Six minutes later, Rooney topped it. Juan Mata and Evra set up the incisive attack down the left before Rooney let fly with a line of four defenders retreating in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>Worth his wages</strong></p>
<p>It was the kind of skill that might make Rooney worth his wages. Balanced like a ballerina on the toes of his left foot, he let the ball come across his body before applying a touch with his right foot that sent it powerfully and precisely into the corner of the net. Very few players can pull off a volley as sweet as that. It is not a skill that can be taught. It is born of rare instinct and technique, and it allows Rooney to swipe his foot across the ball so that it rises and arcs beyond the reach of the goalkeeper.“I&#8217;ve been trying to let my football do the talking,” Rooney later said on television.</p>
<p>He was replying not just to the question about what comes into his head when such an opportunity presents itself. The real and ongoing questions surrounding Rooney have been about his protracted negotiations before he signed a new contract on Friday that ties him to United until 2019. The haggling had been going on all season long, following attempts by Chelsea to entice him away. Rooney&#8217;s agent held United to ransom, not for the first time, to keep its own player. The old contract, which had 18 months left, was replaced by a new one that is reportedly worth 300,000 pounds per week, or about $26 million per year. On one hand, it suits the club to show its ambition to hold on to a star player. On the other, the salary figures are between the club, the player and the tax authorities.</p>
<p>The club is expected to reap about 420 million pounds of income in the current financial year. It would have to pay considerably more, in both transfer fee and wages, if it tried to find an adequate replacement for Rooney. Now 28, Rooney has shown year after year that he has the muscle, the aptitude and the team spirit to thrive in the physical intensity of English soccer. Right now, Mesut Ozil, Arsenal&#8217;s record-setting acquisition, is omitted from the team because his skills and confidence have waned in his first season in the Premier League. Ozil will come back. He has even more vision, a more refined soccer brain, than Rooney.</p>
<p>Whether he could slog through 10 seasons, as Rooney already has, is a gamble. And so, in a sense, is whether Rooney can do it for another five seasons. There are a lot of miles on Rooney&#8217;s engine. He runs 10 kilometers every game and is heavily built; there is a reason why Saturday&#8217;s goal was his first in the league since Christmas. Rooney had been a frequent visitor to the trainer&#8217;s table for a deep groin strain. Throwing money at him cannot put that right.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993324&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Australia will look to reach their second consecutive final of the U-19 World Cup when they take on South Africa in Dubai on Wednesday. While the Australian side has won the title thrice, if the Proteas go through, it would only be for the third time that they have reached the final. Australia will depend on Jaron Morgan to come good once again. The opener is the side&#8217;s top scorer with 213 runs in four innings. </span></p>
<p>The South Africans, meanwhile, will count on captain Aiden Markram and all rounder Yaseen Valli. In Valli, South Africa has a batsman who has impressed with his patience, shot selection and range of strokes. He has scored 208 runs with a century and two half-centuries. Captain Markram has found form towards the business end of the competition. He scored an unbeaten 120 in his side&#8217;s last league game against Zimbabwe and then hit another unbeaten ton (105 n.o) in the quarterfinal against Afghanistan. In the bowling department, medium pacer Justin Dill has taken ten wickets while left arm spinner Valli has eight wickets.</p>
<p><strong>Bangla, NZ in Plate final</strong></p>
<p>Bangladesh and New Zealand will play the Plate Championship final on Thursday after comfortably winning their play-off matches on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bangladesh, which has previously won the Plate title in 1998, 2004 and 2010, defeated Zimbabwe by 72 runs while New Zealand recorded a comfortable five-wicket victory over the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>
<p>In the Super League fifth/sixth position semifinal, West Indies edged out Afghanistan by nine runs. West Indies will now take on India in the fifth/sixth position match.</p>
<p><strong>Plate Championship semi-final</strong></p>
<p>Bangladesh 265-6, 50 overs (Mosaddek Hossain 83 not out, Joyraz Sheik 58, Litton Das 47, Shadman Islam 34; Patrick Mambo 2-55) beat Zimbabwe 193-9, 50 overs (Luke Jongwe 50, Malcolm Lake 38; Mehedy Hasan 3-43, Mustafizur Rahman 2-19) by 72 runs; UAE 140 all out, 49.2 overs (Moaaz Qazi 21; Josh Finni 2-5, Jeremy Benton 2-23) lost to NZ 141-5, 30.2 overs (Ken McClure 62 not out, Raki Weerasundara 30; Justin James 2-38) by 5 wickets</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/davidwarnerreutersm-copy.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1994069" alt="David Warner wants umpires to give a closer scrutiny to the manner in which South Africa are scuffling the ball (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/davidwarnerreutersm-copy.jpg" /></a> David Warner wants umpires to give a closer scrutiny to the manner in which South Africa are scuffling the ball (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Four days before the start of the series-deciding third Test at Cape Town, Australian opener David Warner has questioned the spirit of the South Africans after stating that his side would ask the umpires to give a closer scrutiny to the manner in which South Africa are scuffing the ball. </span></p>
<p>Warner directed his comments at wicket-keeper batsman AB de Villiers, who the Australians suspected was pushing the limits of the spirit of the game by scuffing up the ball in order to help South African fast bowlers attain reverse swing.</p>
<p>“We were actually questioning whether or not AB de Villiers would get the ball in his hand and with his glove wipe the rough side every ball,” Warner told Sky Sports Radio.</p>
<p>South Africa levelled the series in Port Elizabeth on the fourth day following a inspired bowling performance by Dale Steyn, who generated reverse swing after tea to return figures of four for 55. From 141 for one at tea, Australia were bowled out for 216 in 73.1 overs.</p>
<p>Warner said Australia’s 231 run loss was caused by the amount of reverse swing the South African fast bowlers were able to generate.</p>
<p>“I think it comes down to the umpires warning both teams not to throw the ball into the wicket which you generally try and do,” Warner said.</p>
<p>“They did it better than what we did, or more obvious than what we did. At the end of the day it comes down to who can do that the best and work on the ball,” Warner said.</p>
<p>“We worked on the ball a lot in England and we got the ball to reverse a lot there and we got the ball reversing a little at home and this time it just didn’t work for us because the outfield was probably a little bit moist under the ground and day one it was obviously quite hard to get it to go reverse as well. That’s what happens in the game. You have to try and work out how to do that. Sometimes that happens.”</p>
<p><strong>Newlands, a fortress</strong></p>
<p>Capetown: South Africa will head to their favourite ground with momentum in their favour when they take on Australia in the series-deciding third Test at Newlands, batsman Hashim Amla said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Proteas have suffered just one loss in Cape Town in 12 years, to Australia in 2006, a run of 16 matches at a venue where crowds are traditionally good and the wicket conducive to positive results.</p>
<p>“Newlands has been a happy ground for the Proteas over the last few years but Australia is a good team,” Amla said ahead of the match which starts on Saturday.</p>
<p>“There is a lot riding on the last game and fortunately we have momentum and that is what we are going to try and take into the match. Going into the last Test it will be important to assess the conditions as soon as we can.”</p>
<p>Australia’s last two visits to Cape Town, in 2009 and 2011, resulted in defeats by an innings and 20 runs, and eight wickets. Three years ago they were bowled out for 47 in their second innings.</p>
<p>South Africa’s thumping 231-run victory in the second Test following an equally decisive 281-run loss in the first game in Pretoria left the series on a knife-edge.</p>
<p>Amla, who scored an elegant hundred in the second innings in Port Elizabeth, said the squad felt they were now playing much better cricket.</p>
<p>“Players got hundreds and the bowlers bowled well, it’s a better situation to be in going in one-all, having won the second Test,” he said. Captain Graeme Smith spoke of his side’s character and resilience after the Port Elizabeth win and Amla said they had learnt how to get positive results from losing positions.</p>
<p>“Over the last few years we’ve had quite a few fightbacks. I say fight-backs to win the Test as well as fightbacks to hold on to the draw like the matches at the Wanderers (against India) and Adelaide (against Australia),” Amla said. — Reuters</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993311&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Once the premier Indian drag-flicker, Singh has fallen behind Rupinder and VR Raghunath in the pecking order. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993306&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 52nd minute of the HIL2 final, with both, Punjab Warriors and Delhi Waveriders locked 3-3, Sandeep Singh had the opportunity to give his side what would perhaps have been a decisive lead. He had already converted 10 penalty corners in the tournament but his shot, though cleanly hit, went wide of the post.</p>
<p>Had that gone in, it would have been the perfect high for a player who has seen more than his share of lows recently. Once the premier Indian drag-flicker, Singh has fallen behind Rupinder Pal Singh and VR Raghunath in the pecking order.</p>
<p>Even though he had been the top goal scorer of HIL 1, his side, Mumbai Magicians, chose to replace him with junior Gurjinder Singh. While his drag flicking was still effective, the rationale had been that Sandeep’s defensive skills had steadily eroded, making him a liability who conceded more than he scored. HIL2 saw Sandeep, 27, move to a new side and coach, in Warriors and Barry Dancer. The Australian stated his priorities were simply to find a good drag-flicker and improve on his side’s poor PC conversion in the first season.</p>
<p>Sandeep has done exactly that. While the Warriors appear to have suffered defensively — they conceded more goals than any other team in the top four — Sandeep’s PC ability more than made up for it as they also scored the most goals (40, 10 more than any other team).</p>
<p>Over the course of the tournament, Sandeep’s defensive ability, long the object of ridicule, also showed a marked improvement as seen in the league game against UP Wizards when he consistently negated three-time FIH player of the year Teun de Noijer. Sandeep’s improved play at the back drew praise from his teammate, Australian Jamie Dwyer.</p>
<p>“He has improved his field play by leaps and bounds. He listens, he learns and he is quite intelligent. He is a better player than what he was last year,” Dwyer had said.</p>
<p>Despite Sandeep’s tournament — he once again finished as the highest goalscorer — it’s uncertain where he lies in the national team’s scheme of things. Dwyer still reckons Rupinder Pal is better than Sandeep and VR Raghunath. Rupinder Pal didn’t have a poor tournament by any means — he finished with 6 goals — and was versatile enough to move up into midfield or revert to defense, depending on the situation. Raghunath showed the worth of his experience on the field.</p>
<p>The one clear loser amongst India’s drag-flickers was Gurjinder Singh. Intended as Sandeep’s replacement, Gurjinder only managed two goals and his side conceded 29 — the second-worst record of the tournament.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gamini-silva.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993529" alt="Silva is a Sri Lankan who is now Bangladesh Cricket Association’s chief curator." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gamini-silva.jpg" /></a> Silva is a Sri Lankan who is now Bangladesh Cricket Association’s chief curator.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">When at work, Gamini Silva loves to wear tracksuits and a white Panama hat. Even at the ripe old age of 54, he is fighting fit and looks after his ‘babies’ (cricket grounds, of course) well.</span></p>
<p>Silva is a Sri Lankan who is now Bangladesh Cricket Association’s (BCB) chief curator. He has been here for the last four years and is in charge of all seven cricket grounds in the country. Cricket allows him to relax, and this bit of relaxation he deserves thoroughly, for he led a life of enormous struggle, danger and pain during his youth.</p>
<p>Back then, Silva was the assistant superintendent of the Sri Lankan police force. For 15 years, from 1982 to 1996, he lived on the edge during the years of strife. Then he quit the job, acquired a diploma in agriculture and finally concentrated solely on cricket.</p>
<p>“While LTTE was at the height of its power, I was in the combat force when the government was dealing with the Tigers. And I always had death at my doorstep,” Silva recounts, as he speaks to The Indian Express while standing in the middle of the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium on a sunny Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>“Everyone in the police force, army, and also the civilians — we always had the nightmares that the next day could be our last. I went to combat operations in Jaffna and Trincomalee and saw dead bodies lying in heaps. I went through the horrific experience of watching my colleagues and innocent people being ripped apart by bombs and Kalashnikovs. I was lucky to survive.”</p>
<p><strong>Bravery award</strong></p>
<p>According to Silva, life in Sri Lanka wasn’t easy during those days. “The biggest challenge was their unpredictability. You never know when and how they could hit you, the tightest security measures notwithstanding. And they had human bombs which made things almost impossible to counter. We checked and rechecked but still some of them managed to sneak through. It was inevitable,” says Silva.</p>
<p>He had many acts of valour which were commended by the Sri Lankan government. A medallion for bravery was the reward. What makes his passion for the game even more incredible is the fact that Silva found time to play serious cricket — he nearly represented his country — by taking time off his work as a cop.</p>
<p><strong>Nearly there</strong></p>
<p>“I played trial matches for Sri Lanka but never got a chance to play international cricket. I don’t regret it. My life as a police officer taught me to put things in perspective,” he adds.</p>
<p>“I was always very passionate about my cricket and completed the Grade 2 coaching course after my playing days were over. I also became a qualified umpire. But curatorship was my first preference. My education in agricultural science prompted me to go that way. So I went to England, passed the curatorship exam and here I am, looking after the grounds in Bangladesh.”</p>
<p>But why in Bangladesh and not back home in Sri Lanka?</p>
<p>“I applied after the BCB came up with an advert and was selected. I took it as a challenge, coming to another country and help their cricket.” Silva’s contract expires in July. Will he seek an extension, or return home?</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I am comfortably settled here, but it’s up to the BCB to decide. If I am retained, I will stay. Otherwise I will go back to Sri Lanka where I have a small business,” Silva says with a smile.</p>
<p>The work at the main stadium is almost finished for the day, but Silva is summoned by the board to the BCB academy ground to attend a women’s game. The man is as much in demand here as he used to be in the Sri Lankan police force. But back then, that job was to live to fight another day.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993196&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/virat1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993500" alt="Virat Kohli is leading the team in the absence of M S Dhoni." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/virat1.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli is leading the team in the absence of M S Dhoni.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Chesteshwar Pujara bowled a longish spell of high and flighty leg-spin at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium, as India trained for a couple of hours on the eve their Asia Cup opener against Bangladesh. He batted for about 15 minutes, padding up after Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane. India may not have revealed their playing XI yet, but going by Pujara’s activities, he looks a likely candidate to fill one slot of India’s gaping middle-order.</span></p>
<p>For the first time in close to a decade, the Indian one-day side is without the services of even one of MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina. And following their harrowing experiences in the shorter formats in South Africa and New Zealand (they were blanked in both series’), the stable hands of Pujara might just be one of many answers India are looking for.</p>
<p>The Asia Cup has failed to create a buzz in Bangladesh. This, despite the fact that the hosts are taking on the world champions at the Fatullah Cricket Stadium on Tuesday. And what happened the last time India took on Bangladesh in the Asia Cup? One, Sachin Tendulkar scored his hundredth hundred. Two, Bangladesh chased down the target of 290, denying the men in blue of a chance of making the final.</p>
<p><strong>Many changes</strong></p>
<p>Much has changed since that game in 2012. But not in a good way for India. Yes they have found some terrific players who had terrific seasons during the one-dayers that were played at home last year. But when push came to shove abroad, India and their new heroes were swept away. Now, a relatively new-look Indian team with an inexperienced middle-order have arrived to turn things around. Come to think of it, Dinesh Karthik, Ambati Rayudu, Rahane and Pujara — men who could constitute the new Indian middle-order — have in total played just 98 matches between them.</p>
<p>The onus then, is on Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, the only two players in this young and inexperienced Indian side to have played more than 100 matches each. If the rumours are to be believed, Kohli, the stand-in captain, has decided to stick to his number three slot, Dhoni’s absence notwithstanding. Without the best finisher in the game, a top-heavy India can only hope that the lower middle-order and the tail never do get exposed during the stipulated batting period of 50 overs.</p>
<p><strong>Bowling worries</strong></p>
<p>Talking of the tail, India’s pace bowling has been an age-old problem area for India. Bhuvaneshwar Kumar returned with an economy rate of 5.79 from South Africa and New Zealand. Mohammed Shami conceded more, at 7.07 runs per over. Varun Aaron, in the three matches he played in New Zealand, gave away 164 runs in 23.1 overs. Will Kohli think out of the box and will add an extra spinner in form of Amit Mishra? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>On a positive note, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will have wickets that favour their restrictive styles. Whether one or both of them bowl within the first powerplay period is yet to be known, one thing is for sure. If India leak runs upfront, the spin twins will surely look to put the brakes on during the middle-orders — a period when India have turned matches their way. A period that will in all likelihood make them favourites against the hosts on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bangladesh’s Mashrafe Mortaza, however, doesn’t think so. “It is no longer an upset when we beat India. We have done it before. Also, we are playing in home conditions,” said the veteran Bangladesh all-rounder. “Don’t forget, the crowd support is with us as well.”</p>
<p>Bangladesh may not have the record to follow up on the talk, especially after being drubbed 3-0 by Sri Lanka in the recent one-dayers, but the side’s coach, Australian born Shane Jurgensen, was happy that the team has finally learned to believe in itself.</p>
<p>Applauding their positive body language, Jurgensen said: “Bangladesh have gotten rid of their inferiority complex. They don’t fear anyone. Also, the series against Sri Lanka was close which could have gone either way. And tough competitions helped us nicely to prepare for the Asia Cup.”</p>
<p><strong>Big Ban theory</strong></p>
<p>But Bangladesh too have their fair share of problems. Opener Tamim Iqbal has been rested to keep him fit for the World T20 next month, while the country’s biggest match-winner, Shakib Al Hasan, is busy serving a three-match ban. Still, Habibul Bashar, former Bangladesh captain and current national selector, claims that his side is not deterred. “We have won matches without Shakib before,” Bashar said. “And we can do it again.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/malinga.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993188  " alt="Malinga celebrates after dismissing Pakistan’s Bilawal Bhatti during the opening match of the Asia Cup in Fatullah on Tuesday." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/malinga.jpg" /></a> Malinga celebrates after dismissing Pakistan’s Bilawal Bhatti during the opening match of the Asia Cup in Fatullah on Tuesday.
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Lasith Malinga took five for 52 as Sri Lanka beat Pakistan by 12 runs to begin their Asia Cup campaign. The win, however, didn’t come that easy. Despite Lahiru Thirimanne’s 102 and Kumar Sangakkara’s 67 that lifted Sri Lanka to a competitive 296-6, the Lankans struggled to pull off their four-point lead in the Asia Cup points table from the opening game.</span></p>
<p>It was a challenging total but not beyond Pakistan’s reach. Pakistan’s openers stuttered at the start in reply, losing both Sharjeel Khan and Ahmed Shehzad with 77 runs on the board. Then Mohammad Hafeez got out after getting into the groove. It was a real blow, considering Hafeez had scored 449 runs in five ODIs in the bilateral series against Sri Lanka in December. Here, however, he could manage only 18. Soon, the defending champions were reduced to 121 for four in 23.3 overs as Shoaib Maqsood departed. Sri Lanka all but smelled victory.</p>
<p><strong>Misbah stands tall</strong></p>
<p>Misbah-ul-Haq, however, looked unfazed. The Pakistan captain has made a habit of scoring half centuries in chases. Today was no different, when he scored his eighth fifty in his last 10 innings. He got an able ally in Umar Akmal and together they put on 121 runs for the fifth wicket to bring their side back in the contest.</p>
<p>Pakistan reached 242 in the 43rd over when Akmal departed. But with Misbah still at the crease and Shahid Afridi joining him, they still had a big advantage. But Malinga changed the complexion of the game with just two consecutive balls in the 45th over. Both Afridi and Misbah were deceived by his subtle change of pace.</p>
<p>Malinga was not finished yet. He removed Umar Gul — the man who had kept Sri Lanka in check in the first innings with figures of 2/38 from eight overs — and then accounted for Saeed Ajmal and Bilawal Bhatti to return with a five-for. More importantly, his spell in the final overs decided the contest in Sri Lanka’s favour.</p>
<p>After early jitters, Pakistan had managed to pull it back and had gone on to a position of strength. They needed just 55 runs off 46 balls with six wickets in hand — with both Misbah and Akmal at the crease.</p>
<p><strong>Short, but sweet</strong></p>
<p>Yet, in the end, the equation came down to 17 off 12 after Bhatti and Ajmal clattered 17 runs in the 47th over. Then, Malinga came up with his yorkers and cleaned up the tail. Pakistan were all out for 284 in 48.5 overs. Although Pakistan lost by a dozen runs, Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews believed that the Lankans may have been at least 20 runs short.</p>
<p>“I still think we were 20 runs short considering the start Thirimanne and Sangakkara gave us,’’ Mathews said. If not for slinger Malinga, Mathews acknowledged, the Islanders perhaps wouldn’t have taken four points from this game. “Malinga is the best bowler for us, whenever we are under pressure he is our go-to man and he did it again,’’ said the captain.</p>
<p>Misbah, however, was understandably disappointed. “I think Umar (Akmal) batted really well, that was a crucial partnership, we had six wickets in hand and we should have won this game,’’ he said. “The way the pitch was playing, no turn, nothing for the fast bowler, this should have been chased.’’</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993187&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mashrafemortazaapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993052" alt="Mashrafe Mortaza admitted that the team will miss the services of Tamim Iqbal (injured) and Shakib al Hasan (banned) (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mashrafemortazaapm.jpg" /></a> Mashrafe Mortaza admitted that the team will miss the services of Tamim Iqbal (injured) and Shakib al Hasan (banned) (AP)
<p>Bangladesh&#8217;s premier pacer Mashrafe Mortaza said that beating a heavyweight Indian cricket team is no longer considered as an &#8220;upset&#8221; as the hosts have defeated them on a few occasions in the near past including the last edition of Asia Cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t count a win against India as an upset. We have done it before. They are a good team in sub-continent. We have that in our mind,&#8221; the 30-year-old said ahead of their Asia Cup opener against India.</p>
<p>Mortaza feels that playing in front of home crowd would be a boost and the <a title="With Dhoni’s exit, a change of the established order" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/with-dhonis-exit-a-change-of-the-established-order/" target="_blank">Indian team will also have to make some adjustment</a> having played their last couple of series in South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have been playing on different wickets in SA and NZ. We are playing in front of a home support. If we can come up with our best cricket I think we can fight it out. God willing, we will.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mortaza was quick to add that they would have to be in the top of their game to beat a<a title="Asia Cup: Will try and use whatever little experience I’ve had, says Dinesh Karthik" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-will-try-and-use-whatever-little-experience-ive-had-says-dinesh-karthik/" target="_blank"> world class side like India</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have a world-class batting line-up, they are never weak. Their recent performance in the sub-continent has been great. It won&#8217;t be an easy task, and we have to play our best cricket. We beat them two years ago, the most important thing is what happens tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p><a title="Injured Mahendra Singh Dhoni ruled out of Asia Cup; Virat Kohli to lead" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/injured-mahendra-singh-dhoni-ruled-out-of-asia-cup-virat-kohli-to-lead/" target="_blank">On Dhoni&#8217;s absence</a>, he said:&#8221;They are without key player Dhoni but their batting line-up is still world-class. They can beat anybody. They can beat anybody in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not only India&#8217;s batting mainstay <a title="Asia Cup: Can Virat Kohli be aggressive enough as he is not the regular captain?" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-can-virat-kohli-be-aggressive-enough-as-he-is-not-the-regular-captain/" target="_blank">Virat Kohli</a> but Bangladesh are also keeping in mind the opening duo of Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma who could be threatening on sub-continent wickets.</p>
<p>&#8220;He (Kohli) has won many matches for India and has proved his capability many times. But our focus will be on everyone. But they have other good players too, like the two openers who are also world class.&#8221;</p>
<p>After winning the New Zealand series 3-0, Bangladesh went down to Sri Lanka by an identical margin in the one-dayers as Mortaza feels it&#8217;s time to get back to winning ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t played our best cricket recently, but we will hopefully recover quickly. A team takes a bit of time to recover from a bad patch, be it with batting, bowling or fielding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are trying to settle down quickly. We are talking to each other, to make a quick turnaround. We are discussing in our practice, hopefully we will return to winning ways soon,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Mortaza admitted that the team will miss the services of Tamim Iqbal (injured) and <a title="Shakib banned for three ODIs after ‘crotch gesture’ on TV" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shakib-banned-for-three-odis-after-crotch-gesture-on-tv/" target="_blank">Shakib al Hasan (banned)</a> but he expected the youngsters to step up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone is positive, and will try to support the team. Those two are big players. We will miss them. But we have good players, from whom we can expect a good result.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all are excited, especially the younger players. They want to show something. It is the same in all International matches. It is a major event, and I know that everyone is trying their best. If most of us are going to perform, we have a good chance.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993050&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dineshkarthikm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1993032" alt="Dinesh Karthik has featured in 67 ODIs with a strike rate of 73.64 (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dineshkarthikm.jpg" /></a> Dinesh Karthik has featured in 67 ODIs with a strike rate of 73.64 (File)
<p>Pressed into service after <a title="Injured Mahendra Singh Dhoni ruled out of Asia Cup; Virat Kohli to lead" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/injured-mahendra-singh-dhoni-ruled-out-of-asia-cup-virat-kohli-to-lead/" target="_blank">injury to Mahendra Singh Dhoni</a>, Dinesh Karthik said being an &#8220;outsider&#8221; he can add a bit of freshness to <a title="With Dhoni’s exit, a change of the established order" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/with-dhonis-exit-a-change-of-the-established-order/" target="_blank">India&#8217;s Asia Cup campaign</a> after the battering in recent international engagements.</p>
<p>India will start their Asia Cup campaign with a match against Bangladesh. Karthik, who was not a part of the squad which went winless in the recent tours of South Africa and New Zealand, said he is not scarred by the disastrous results.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old Indian has featured in 67 ODIs with a strike rate of 73.64.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to know about three-four days back, I guess I&#8217;m used to it now being called so many times. It doesn&#8217;t play on my mind too much,&#8221; Karthik said after the team&#8217;s practice at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me it&#8217;s about coming out here&#8230; It&#8217;s important to get into the zone just before the game. Obviously as a player I&#8217;m very excited to be a part of this Indian cricket team. It&#8217;s one of the best teams available. For me, it&#8217;s an honour to represent India and do the best that I can,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Asked about India&#8217;s prolonged winless patch with the last coming in against visiting West Indies in November last year, a nonchalant Karthik said: &#8220;Actually, you should have asked this question to somebody who was a part of these eight ODIs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From an outsider point of view, I&#8217;m coming into this team fresh. As an individual I can talk of my perspective and say that for me it&#8217;s going to be exciting. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the same for all the players. But somebody who has played those eight games will answer this question much better.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karthik went on to add that the team has an exciting bunch of youngsters who would be keen to do well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Definitely, it&#8217;s a big tournament for all of us. It&#8217;s going to be exciting for all the young players in the team, so we all are really looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Indian team might not have the experience of Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina but Karthik said there are other players who have been around for quite a long time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been around scene for some time. Given the opportunity, I will try and use whatever little experience I&#8217;ve had and bat to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having said that, quite a few guys have played 100 games which is a lot of experience now. They have been playing now for a year or two. They have been given a good run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously everybody will pull in their experience whatever little that we have, go out there and give it our best shot,&#8221; he added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1993014&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Manchester United boss David Moyes is banking on the form of his fit-again strikers Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney when they face Olympiakos Piraeus in their Champions League last 16 first leg on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rooney also boosted United by pledging his long-term <a title="Wayne Rooney set to end career at Manchester United" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/wayne-rooney-set-to-end-career-at-manchester-united/" target="_blank">future to the club last week</a>, signing until June 2019 before scoring a superb goal against Palace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think both Rooney and Van Persie are back in really good shape and they&#8217;re scoring goals, and in the big games we can do far better when they are with us,&#8221; said Moyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;To win the group has given us an added edge, but we still have to play well to qualify. We have an opportunity to try and win a competition, if possible, but we first have to get through this tie.&#8221;</p>
<p>For his part, Rooney revealed that he would love nothing more than to celebrate his new contract by claiming a second Champions League winner&#8217;s medal.</p>
<p>&#8220;One is never enough, especially at this club,&#8221; he said, referring to their 2008 triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;The feeling you get when you win it is incredible, so there is no way that you want to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rooney added: &#8220;I want to be remembered as a winner. That&#8217;s what we aim to do &#8211; win trophies &#8211; so that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll be judged on when you finish your career. That&#8217;s not just me &#8211; that&#8217;s the whole team.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992902&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohlilapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992888" alt="Virat Kohli, who totals 732 with four hundreds and three fifties, was the leading run-getter in the last Asia Cup (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohlilapm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli, who totals 732 with four hundreds and three fifties, was the leading run-getter in the last Asia Cup (AP)
<p>Embarrassed in South Africa and New Zealand, regional powerhouse India would hope for a turnaround under a new captain when they take on a troubled Bangladesh in their Asia Cup opener on Wednesday.</p>
<p>For the five-time champions India, the build up to the 12th edition of the regional tournament has been quite similar to that of 2012 when they landed here on the back of eight successive Test defeats in England and Australia.</p>
<p>Now they have come here after <a title="India defeated but not deflated" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/india-defeated-but-not-deflated/" target="_blank">losing to South Africa</a> 0-1 in Tests and 0-2 in ODIs. They suffered similar <a title="Brendon McCullum’s 302 seals series 1-0" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/brendon-mccullums-302-seals-series-1-0/" target="_blank">humiliation at the hands of New Zealand</a>. The world champion side capped their two overseas tours with four successive defeats in One dayers.</p>
<p>However, playing against an opponent, who are struggling with their own set of problems and against whom they enjoy a good record, India would hope to finally notch up their first win in the 2014 calender.</p>
<p>Bangladesh&#8217;s attacking opener Tamim Iqbal has been ruled out of the event because of a neck strain and their all-rounder Shakib-Al-Hasan will also miss the action against India due to his two-match ban <a title="Shakib banned for three ODIs after ‘crotch gesture’ on TV" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/shakib-banned-for-three-odis-after-crotch-gesture-on-tv/" target="_blank">for showing lewd gestures on live TV</a>.</p>
<p>Fitness doubts also hang over veteran pacer Mashrafe Mortaza (swollen knee) while captain Mushfiqur Rahim is nursing an injured finger that had kept him out of the two T20Is against Sri Lanka earlier this month.</p>
<p>Adding to the woes, the host nation clearly did not give a happy picture with selection-related controversy marring the their build-up. Skipper Musfiqur hit out at their chief selector for picking the squad without consulting him.</p>
<p>All this gives India a good chance to make a winning start even without the finishing abilities of skipper <a title="Injured Mahendra Singh Dhoni ruled out of Asia Cup; Virat Kohli to lead" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/injured-mahendra-singh-dhoni-ruled-out-of-asia-cup-virat-kohli-to-lead/" target="_blank">Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who was ruled out due to a side-strain</a>, and left-handed Suresh Raina.</p>
<p>Apart from the usual expectation of being the captain, <a title="Asia Cup: Can Virat Kohli be aggressive enough as he is not the regular captain?" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-can-virat-kohli-be-aggressive-enough-as-he-is-not-the-regular-captain/" target="_blank">Virat Kohli will also be the Indian batting mainstay</a> as India would take solace from the fact that the stylish right hander&#8217;s average against Bangladesh is a staggering 122.</p>
<p>Kohli, who totals 732 with four hundreds and three fifties, was the leading run-getter in the last Asia Cup, including tournament&#8217;s highest 185 against Pakistan.</p>
<p>After being made the captain as Dhoni&#8217;s replacement for the first time in a tri-series in the West Indies also involving Sri Lanka, Kohli has one loss and seven wins under his belt.</p>
<p>But Asia Cup may prove to be his biggest challenge as games against Sri Lanka and especially Pakistan would be high pressure contests.</p>
<p>Test regular Cheteshwar Pujara will lend stability to the middle order but more than that India would want him to reinvent himself from the classical mould to suit to the demands of the shorter version.</p>
<p>With Kohli having adapted himself to No 3 and Ajinkya Rahane at No 4, it remains to be seen where the Saurashtra batsman is accomodated in the order., But as the tournament will proceed to the business end, India&#8217;s biggest worry will be to find somebody who is as dependable as Dhoni in crisis situations.</p>
<p>While many have seen Dinesh Karthik&#8217;s ability as a hard-hitting batsmen in the IPL, it&#8217;s time for him to prove himself in the One-day format while there would be pressure on Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin down the order.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, India would look to make use of Stuart Binny to play the role of finisher, who at the same time can be handy with his medium pace bowling.</p>
<p>But overall, it would be an astounding feat for Kohli if India go all the way to retain their supremacy in the subcontinent&#8217;s mega tournament.</p>
<p>Last year&#8217;s runners-up Bangladesh have been the sub continent&#8217;s perennial under achievers as they would approach the tournament to fulfill their Trophy drought.</p>
<p>This time, it won&#8217;t be easy though.</p>
<p>Left-handed Tamim&#8217;s injury has left a big void in the batting department while Shakib&#8217;s absence from the matches against India and Afghanistan would make their final progression even tougher.</p>
<p>Imrul Kayes who has not played an ODI since December 2011 has been recalled as he would have to justify his selection.</p>
<p>In the bowling Shakib&#8217;s two game suspension will leave a void but it would be an opportunity to excel for left-armer Abdur Razzak who has emerged as a limited overs specialist with his tidy bowling.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992882&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sure, Ben Duckett&#8217;s wicket was a potential turning-point. But Vijay Zol&#8217;s crazed celebration after his catch at short cover to dismiss Duckett, England&#8217;s top-scorer in the Junior World Cup quarters, was plain over-the-top.</p>
<p>Manic roars, infused with a large smattering of profanity reflected an attitude that this generation of Indian juniors has grown up watching. Just like Amir Gani&#8217;s expletive-laden send-off for Ed Barnard. <a title="Vijay Zol suspended for offensive language in loss vs England" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/vijay-zol-suspended-for-offensive-language-in-loss-vs-england/" target="_blank">While Zol copped a one-match ban, Gani was let off with a reprimand</a>. Spouting off streams of abuse, crass brandishing of bats and menacing stares have become the celebration-du jour for this young team.</p>
<p><strong>But can we really blame them?</strong></p>
<p>As impressionable boys of 12, some even younger, when India won the U-19 WC under Virat Kohli, they would&#8217;ve watched India&#8217;s current flavour of the season, fire abuses into the sticky Kuala Lumpur air. After that, it was the IPL. In the heady cocktail of franchise sport, glamour and entertainment, aggression by way of obscene gestures and bursts of beeped-out language, fit right in.</p>
<p>Every time, Rohit Sharma or Kohli reach a milestone, a crazed expression sat on their face — cuss words ready on the lips. And it was these images of boorish behaviour, bordering on obnoxious, that got played on loop as promos for events, while creatives lapped them up as endorsements for companies targeting the youth.</p>
<p>This current India U-19 crop demonstrated more of this same mindless behavior, increasingly mistaking it for &#8216;aggression&#8217;. Kohli&#8217;s all-too-frequent outbursts had seldom earned him sanctions, nor had Sharma&#8217;s violent bat twirling hurt his pockets. Shikhar Dhawan&#8217;s mocking of Shane Watson was even celebrated as &#8216;cool.&#8217;</p>
<p>Indian batsmen no longer seem to believe that a rasping cover-drive is enough to stamp their authority on the bowler. Or shattering stumps is a definitive statement from a bowler. Having learned that aggressively staring down a batsmen or sending him away with copious abuse is what seniors &#8211; their role-models and India&#8217;s ambassadors &#8211; adopt, are these young boys expected to act any different?</p>
<p>The BCCI needs to step in urgently. Abuse and overtly aggressive behavior should be clamped down, and what better place to start than the under-15 Polly Umrigar Trophy. It needs to be drilled in that abuse is hardly an acceptable medium of celebration. When the next India under-19 coach is picked, the brief handed to him should be cultivating a team which asserts itself only through its cricketing skill-set. Ultimately, the onus is on the Kohlis and Sharmas to clean up their act. For, a foul-mouthed U-19 captain at the colts&#8217; World Cup isn&#8217;t the best advertisement of India&#8217;s cricketing future.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/yuvrajwalmikim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992779" alt="Yuvraj Walmiki scored five field goals in the 2014 edition of the Hockey India League" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/yuvrajwalmikim.jpg" /></a> Yuvraj Walmiki scored five field goals in the 2014 edition of the Hockey India League
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Over the last month, Sardar Singh and Gurbaj Singh would constantly work on knocking the ball into the opposition D, knowing that Yuvraj Walmiki would stand poised there, ready for the pass. More often than not, the prolific poacher was at the right place at the right time to deflect the shots home.</span></p>
<p>Along with the two midfield anchors, forwards Simon Child and Akashdeep Singh too worked on the strategy. The blueprint paid off for the Delhi Waveriders, as all of Walmiki&#8217;s five field goals proved to be crucial to their success.</p>
<p>It helped that he was relatively unmarked when receiving the passes. “People say the goals happened because I was unmarked. But these are top quality defenders. I had to work hard to get into a good position, and also lose the defenders at the same time,” says Walmiki.</p>
<p>The 23-year old, who claims that his sense of positioning is his best quality, was keen on using this year&#8217;s HIL to prove his call-up to the national camp was justified. But before Walmiki donned India colours at the Hockey World League in January, he was nowhere near the national scene.</p>
<p>Fading out of the scene after the Olympic qualifiers, the Mumbaikar had found himself out of the core group of 48 too. Dropped after India&#8217;s dismal run in the Indian team&#8217;s test-series against The Netherlands, the Mumbai-lad went into a state of depression and contemplated leaving the sport altogether.</p>
<p>“That was the biggest blunder of my life. It was a terrible mistake and I&#8217;m happy that my family, coaches, friends and teammates got me out of it,” he says.</p>
<p>But the nine-month lay-off ignited a fresh commitment to the sport. Depression was soon replaced by determination to get back into the Indian side. “It&#8217;s easy getting into the Indian team. But very hard to stay there,” Walmiki declares.<br />
focus on fitness</p>
<p>The immediate focus was on fitness. Walmiki became a regular at the gym and worked on his diet. He was underweight, and he says it was the root cause of him being injury prone.</p>
<p>The hard work paid off for the youngster, who is currently rated as one of the fittest Indian players. He also focused on improving his game. A stint in Germany for second-division side, Frankenthaal HC, laid the base for a new learning experience.</p>
<p>Participation in the HIL gave that experience greater strength. “I got a chance to talk to players like Simon Child and Timothy Drummond. They were always helping me improve my game. Sardar paaji was there too and he has always been very helpful and approachable,” he says.</p>
<p>While the youngster&#8217;s poaching skills in front of goal have become well recognised since the HIL, he wants to be seen as someone who is capable of more than feeding off passes. “I don&#8217;t want to be a forward who is good at only that. I want to help out in creating attacks, and even earn penalty corners and contribute more to the team,” he explains.</p>
<p>Walmiki declares that his goal is to stay in the Indian team and play in the 2016 Olympics, having missed out on London due to injury. And while his prolific goal-poaching ability has brought him into the limelight, it can be recalled that the Indian team had lacked a finisher at the 2012 Olympics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992529&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Rafael Nadal returned from a troublesome back injury to win the Rio Open on Sunday, defeating Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine 6-3, 7-6 (3). Nadal’s victory comes four weeks after losing the Australian Open final to underdog Stanislas Wawrinka after tweaking his back while warming up. </span></p>
<p>Nadal looked more comfortable in the final and improved his record on clay to 298 wins and 21 losses, the best in the Open Era. The Spaniard declined to talk about his back, focusing instead on the victory. He said the heat, the court preparation and the quick balls used in the event made it difficult. He has complained about the fast balls all week.</p>
<p>Nadal has won three times in Brazil and hopes to return next year. He’s also eyeing the 2016 Rio Olympics where he’d seek a second gold medal. He won gold in 2008 in Beijing. Top-ranked Nadal used the Latin American clay-court swing to launch his comeback a year ago from a left knee injury.</p>
<p>Dolgopolov has lost all five matches against Nadal. At center court after the match he mentioned the near-civil war in Ukraine. In the women’s final at the combined ATP-WTA event, Kurumi Nara of Japan defeated top-seeded Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 to win her first WTA singles title. Nara, the 22-year-old Japanese, was seeded fifth in the tournament and is Japan’s top-ranked woman. She prefers to play on hard courts but adapted to the heat and clay in Rio.</p>
<p>The victory is projected to push Nara into the top 50 — probably No. 48 — when the WTA publishes its rankings on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Somdev moves to No. 78</strong></p>
<p>New Delhi: Courtesy his Delhi Open triumph, India’s Somdev Devvarman on Monday jumped 18 places to become World No. 78 in the latest ATP rankings. Somdev had collected 100 ranking points after beating top seed Alerksandr Nedovyesov in the final on Sunday.</p>
<p>Somdev will next play against Juan Martin Del Potro in the first round of the ATP 500 Dubai Duty Free championships on Tuesday. Somdev’s career-best rank was 62, which he achieved in July 2011.</p>
<p>India’s No.2 singles player Yuki Bhambri slipped to 146, a loss of three places. In the doubles, Leander Paes continued to be India’s top player at No.10. Rohan Bopanna lost a place to be 16th while Mahesh Bhupathi further slipped to 41.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Jason Day never stopped believing he would win the Match Play Championship, even in the midst of so many shots by Victor Dubuisson that simply defied belief. With his ball at the base of a cactus, Dubuisson took an all-or-nothing swing though the sharp needles and a TV cable and incredibly hit it to 4 feet to save par. Seemingly out of it on the next playoff hole, the 23-year-old Frenchman somehow whacked a wedge through a desert bush and rocks and onto the green for another par.</span></p>
<p>Day finally ended the madness Sunday on the 23rd hole with a pitch to 4 feet on No. 15 for birdie. It was the first time the championship match went overtime since the inaugural year in 1999 at La Costa, when Jeff Maggert chipped on the second extra hole of a 36-hole final. That was like watching paint dry compared to the show Dubuisson put on.</p>
<p>Day, with his first World Golf Championship, walked away with his second PGA Tour title that will take the Australian to No. 4 in the world. This tournament might better be remembered for Dubuisson’s magical escapes.</p>
<p>Two holes down with two holes to play, Dubuisson rapped in a 15-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole and then took advantage of a rare lapse by Day, who bogeyed the 18th hole with a three-putt from 50 feet on the upper tier. The Frenchman saved par from the bunker to force extra holes. It looked like it would be over quickly.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992522&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/vindudarasinghptim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992703" alt="Gurunath Meiyappan had lost a huge bet Vindu Dara Singh claims (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/vindudarasinghptim.jpg" /></a> Gurunath Meiyappan had lost a huge bet Vindu Dara Singh claims (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Vindu Dara Singh, one of those allegedly involved in the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal, has made some startling claims in a sting operation on the subject aired by Zee News, an Indian television channel. Singh claims that the real battle regarding the IPL lies in the fight between the current chief of the BCCI, N. Srinivasan, and former IPL commissioner, Lalit Modi.“This entire case is actually a tussle between Modi and Srinivasan. We have nothing to do with it,” Vindu tells the reporter. “Lalit Modi just needed a chance to get Srinivasan out.”</span></p>
<p><strong><a title="I feel bad for Sakshi Dhoni: Vindoo Dara Singh" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/print/i-feel-bad-for-sakshi-dhoni-vindoo-dara-singh/" target="_blank">Vindu: I feel bad for Sakshi Dhoni</a></strong></p>
<p>Singh goes on to add that he was involved in betting and claims that just as he was being used as a pawn to get to Srinivasan.“They (cops) said, ‘We know you haven&#8217;t done anything, but there&#8217;s pressure from Sharad Pawar sahab and until Srinivasan isn&#8217;t nabbed you will have to stay. You will have to stay here for 10-15 days or a month’,” he says.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Gurunath Meiyappan was a Chennai Super Kings team official" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/gurunath-was-a-csk-team-official/" target="_blank">Meiyappan </a></strong>had lost a huge bet Singh claims. Asked why he was the chosen medium, he says: “<strong><a title="Srinivasan handed over control to Meiyappan to run CSK: Michael Hussey" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/srinivasan-handed-over-control-to-meiyappan-to-run-csk-michael-hussey/" target="_blank">Gurunath is Srinivasan&#8217;s son-in-law</a></strong>. If anything is proved against Guru then&#8230;”</p>
<p>Singh also says that the IPL is “100 percent fixed” and that he is only aware of one owner who is directly involved in betting, Vijay Mallya.“Barring Vijay Mallya nobody knows anything. <strong><a title="IPL betting: Scams happen in every sport, says Vijay Mallya" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/ipl-betting-scams-happen-in-every-sport-says-vijay-mallya/" target="_blank">Mallya is himself involved in betting</a></strong>, he earns 100-200 crores in IPL,” he says.</p>
<p>Singh claims that Modi, who started the IPL under Sharad Pawar&#8217;s watch, rubbed the Congress the wrong way when the took the IPL to South Africa. Back by Pawar, Modi took Shashi Tharoor, an investor in an IPL team, to task and that was the basis for this battling.</p>
<p>Singh&#8217;s last statement though, raises questions. “Sharad Pawar is a ‘great’ man. These people are challenging him and we are getting dragged into it&#8230; Today you (media) are taking the fight to him — he can shut your channel,” he says.</p>
<p>Nowhere during or after the interview, has it been explained how or in what capacity the reporter approached Vindu Dara Singh. Also, how was he able to specify to the reporter that Sharad Pawar could shut the channel in question, especially as he did not know that he was being recorded?</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992519&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pakistanu19iccm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992710" alt="Zafar Gohar and Amad Butt helped Pakistan recover from 142/7 to win with five balls to spare (ICC)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pakistanu19iccm.jpg" /></a> Zafar Gohar and Amad Butt helped Pakistan recover from 142/7 to win with five balls to spare (ICC)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Pakistan started well, survived a hiccup, recovered and then seemed to have lost it again. However, Zafar Gohar&#8217;s timely intervention along with a steely knock by Amad Butt helped Pakistan under-19s to a wafer-thin three-wicket victory over England in the semi-finals of the under-19 World Cup at the Dubai International stadium. Gohar and Butt shared a vitally important 63-run stand for the eighth wicket to take Pakistan home after their middle order imploded to leave them at 142 for seven while chasing down England&#8217;s 204-run target.</span></p>
<p>Gohar&#8217;s 53-ball 37 along with Butt&#8217;s 26 off 37 balls ultimately saw them get over the line with five balls to spare. The decisive moment of the game, perhaps, was the second ball of the 48th over. At that stage Pakistan needed 22 runs from 16 balls. Rob Sayer bowled a full toss and Butt swung but despite connecting cleanly appeared to have found the fielder at long off. Jack Winslade backpedalled to take the catch but despite getting both hands to the ball only managed to palm it over the ropes. Instead of Pakistan being another man and dot ball down, they had brought the equation to 16 off 15 deliveries.</p>
<p>Butt&#8217;s lucky escape ensured that the game was right back into Pakistan&#8217;s hand and as Butt crashed a wide Winslade full-toss, the first ball of the last over, for a boundary, it sparked wild celebrations in the Pakistan camp. Earlier, Imam ul-Haq, playing with a pulled hamstring, had given Pakistan a good start, putting up 41 runs with skipper Sami Aslam. Pakistan then lost four wickets in the space of 16 runs but responsible batting by Saud Shakeel and Ameer Hamza ensured that the innings came back on track with a 74 run stand. They suffered another collapse as they went from 131/4 to 142/7 but Gohar and Butt&#8217;s heroics took them through.</p>
<p>Earlier, England&#8217;s captain, Will Rhodes led a rousing fight-back after the Pakistan bowlers had reduced England to 119 for six after 37.4 overs. Rhodes&#8217; 76 off 79 balls contained just four boundaries and a six but importantly it allowed England some breathing room, as he kept the score ticking over. Ryan Higgins and Ben Duckett had earlier led a rescue mission after the Pakistan pace duo of Zia ul-Haq and Amad Butt had reduced England to one for two. Higgins&#8217; patient, often laborious, 52 came off 99 balls and included just a single boundary. However, the right-hander ensured that he held one end up, allowing the other batsmen to settle. England at one stage appeared certain to finish at a sub-200 total but a brisk 50-run stand in just 31 balls between Rhodes and Rob Sayer for the eighth wicket took England to 204.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: </strong>England 204 for 7 in 50 overs (W Rhodes 76 n. o, R Higgins 52; K Ali 2/36, A Butt 2/43, Z-ul-Haq 2/46) Pakistan 205 for 7 in 49.1 overs (S Shakeel 45, Z Gohar 37 n.o, A Hamza 35, I-ul-Haq 28, A Butt 26 n.o; M Fisher 2/21, R Sayer 2/39, R Jones 2/39)</p>
<p><strong>Hooda shines in India win</strong></p>
<p>A Deepak Hooda inspired India claimed an easy 76 run victory over Sri Lanka in the fifth-place play-off. India, batting first, scored 291 for seven with Hooda smashing his way to 76 runs. Hooda was aggressive from the start, striking seven boundaries and four sixes in his 56-balls effort. Earlier, the Indian openers stitched a 57-run partnership before they both returned to the pavillion in quick succession. However, Shreyas Iyer and Sanju Samson, who captained the side in absence of Vijay Zol, calmed nerves with an 87-run stand. However a poor period of play saw India struggling at 210/7 after 41.1 overs. There would be no chance of Sri Lanka chasing a modest total. Hooda and Kuldeep Yadav shared an 81-run stand for the eighth wicket, of which Yadav contributed just 19 runs.</p>
<p>In reply, Sadeera Samarawickrama and Priyamal Perera were the only two Sri Lankan batsmen to put up any fight, Samarawickrama, the opener, scored 58 off 67 balls. Hooda shone with the ball for India, picking up three wickets for 31, using his off-spin to good effect. He was supported well by pacer Chama Milind who picked up a couple of wickets along with Karan Kaila and Yadav to hand India an easy victory.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: </strong>India 291 for 7 in 50 overs (D Hooda 76 n.o, S Iyer 59, S Samson 40; H Ramanayake 2/46, A Tyronne 2/59) Sri Lanka 215 all out in 49.1 overs (S Samarawickrama 58, P Perera 47; D Hooda 3/31, C Milind 2/19, K Kaila 2/39, K Yadav 2/54)</p>
<p><strong>Other result: </strong>Scotland 209 all out in 48.3 overs (M English 72, RMcLean 41; N Pokana 3/27, A Nao 2/29, K Morea 2/31) beat PNG 132 all out in 43.3 overs (R Hekure 26, A Joseph 26; M Watt 3/26, R McLean 3/31, Chayank Gosain 2/22) by 77 runs</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992514&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gautamgambhiriem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1982917" alt="Kotla curator Sundaram accused Gautam Gambhir of interfering with his job (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/gautamgambhiriem.jpg" /></a> Kotla curator Sundaram accused Gautam Gambhir of interfering with his job (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ahead of the North Zone matches of the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the curator at the Feroz Shah Kotla, the venue of Delhi’s first game against Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday, accused Gautam Gambhir of ‘using abusive language’ following a difference of opinion over the nature of the wicket. </span></p>
<p>Venkat Sundaram’s allegation was dismissed by Gambhir, the Delhi skipper, as a ‘piece of fiction’.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is not the first time that Sundaram and Gambhir have not seen eye-to-eye. Delhi played a majority of their Ranji Trophy matches at the Roshanara Club grounds after Gambhir felt that his request for a sporting wicket at the Kotla was not granted.</p>
<p>Sundaram had then accused Gambhir of interfering with his job, while the Delhi skipper had said that he was only trying to go for an outright win.</p>
<p>However, on Monday, differences of opinion between Gambhir and Sundaram resurfaced ahead of the 50-over matches after which the latter complained to the DDCA that Gambhir had ‘misbehaved and ‘abused’ him.</p>
<p>Though Gambhir admitted that he told Sundaram to prepare a wicket that would suit the team, he said there was no truth to the curator’s allegations.</p>
<p>“I got calls from the media saying that DDCA curator Venkat Sundaram has accused me of using abusive language. I can categorically tell you that there is no truth in this. Yes I did meet him on Monday at Ferozshah Kotla but there was no heated argument at all. Being the well-wisher of Delhi cricket my only suggestion to Venkat Sundaram was to give us a wicket that suits the Delhi team. Yes we have differences of opinion when it comes to the nature of pitch but to say that I abused him is a piece of fiction,” Gambhir said in a statement.</p>
<p>Gambhir also recalled that this was not the first time that Sundaram had criticised him.</p>
<p>“Even some time back he accused me in the media of interfering in his job as a curator. Being the captain of the Delhi team I have enough things to worry about and Venkat is the last person on my mind. We are the defending champions of Vijay Hazare trophy and therefore the onus is on us to maintain consistency this year as well. Stories like these are a distraction and I’d like to stay away from them,” Gambhir added.</p>
<p><strong>DDCA to decide</strong></p>
<p>A top official confirmed that Sundaram had informed DDCA president Sne Bansal that Gambhir had abused him on Monday.</p>
<p>“We will talk to both sides and listen to their versions. It does not reflect well on Delhi cricket if the curator and captain can’t get along,” the DDCA official said.</p>
<p>During the Ranji Trophy season, when Delhi was forced to return to the Kotla since the ground at the Roshanara Club was not available due to New Year celebrations, Sundaram, in an outburst, had claimed that Gambhir was trying to fiddle with the pitches.</p>
<p>“If you have to fiddle with pitches so much, then you are not fit to play Test cricket,” Sundaram had said while referring to Gambhir.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992511&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pakistan.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992510" alt="Team Pakistan observe their afternoon prayers before a practice session in Dhaka, on the eve of their Asia Cup opener against Sri Lanka.AP" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/pakistan.jpg" /></a> Team Pakistan observe their afternoon prayers before a practice session in Dhaka, on the eve of their Asia Cup opener against Sri Lanka (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">The opening match of the 12th Asia Cup features two teams which are the new ‘familiar foes’ of international cricket. </span></p>
<p>Across formats, over the past three months, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have played against each other in 10 matches (5 ODIs, 2 T20Is and 3 Tests) and their recent record suggests no clear favourite. The T20 games were tied at 1-1, the Test series ended with a similar scoreline.</p>
<p><a title="Asia Cup: Neighbours lock horns for supremacy" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/sports-gallery/asia-cup-neighbours-lock-horns-for-supremacy/" target="_blank"><strong>Photos: Neighbours lock horns for supremacy</strong></a></p>
<p>Only in the ODIs did Pakistan gain an insurmountable 3-1 lead in Dubai, before Sri Lanka took a consolation win. Yet what this scoreline does not tell you is that these two teams have been rather evenly matched.</p>
<p>A common factor in these contests has been the venue — all the matches have been played in the Gulf — which now changes to the Fatullah Cricket Stadium, about 37 kilometres from Dhaka. A different setting, though conditions are expected to be similar, will help break the monotony of the contests.</p>
<p>An unusual number of matches between two particular teams can lead to fatigue among the fans and spectators. The India and Sri Lanka cricket boards indulged in some overkill when the two teams played each other a dozen times each in 2008 and 2009 and this figure is only the number of ODIs. Lanka and Pakistan are in danger of going down that road.</p>
<p><strong>Plenty at stake</strong></p>
<p>Renewed interest could develop among fans from either side because there is more at stake here than bragging rights of a bilateral series win. Pakistan are defending champions of the Asia Cup while Sri Lanka have won the tournament on four occasions, second only to India with five titles.</p>
<p>On paper both sides have reason to believe they are better than their opponents but a Sri Lanka win, considering Pakistan’s status in the tournament, will be termed as an upset.</p>
<p>Pakistan have reason to believe they can beat Sri Lanka. They have found a settled opening pair in Sharjeel Khan and Ahmed Shehzad, after struggling to find one since the departure of Nasir Jamshed.</p>
<p>All-rounder Mohammad Hafeez has been outstanding since his return to the limited-overs format. His 449 runs at 149.33 in the series at UAE proves that he likes to bat against the Sri Lankans. They have an in-form skipper in Misbah-ul-Haq. Misbah-ul-Haq has scored seven half-centuries in his last nine innings. His form and seniority means he can command respect — vital in a team famous for their cliques.</p>
<p>The Pakistan bowling attack has been their strength over the years and continues to be so. Twenty-two-year-old medium pacer Bilawal Bhatti has shown promise while Junaid Khan has fulfilled his to a large extent. Junaid had 13 wickets in five matches in the series against Sri Lanka and will be keen to add more to his tally.</p>
<p>And then there’s Shahid Afridi, a match-winner on his day but increasingly more with the ball than the bat these days. Afridi braved a jaw injury to take part in a training session on the eve of the Asia Cup opener. Saeed Ajmal has not been at his very best in recent times but under-estimating him would be a folly.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka, after their flurry of meetings with Pakistan, travelled to Bangladesh, where the bulk of the action over the next 45 days will take place (The Asia Cup is followed by the World T20 ).</p>
<p>Angelo Mathews side won the Test series 1-0 and registered a 3-0 clean sweep in the ODIs against Bangladesh.</p>
<p>While playing Bangladesh — finalist from the previous edition — at home can be a daunting challenge, Pakistan will be a tougher opponent in conditions that are expected to suit both sides. Skipper Angelo Mathews has not got carried away with his team’s good showing against Bangladesh. “We played some good cricket in the past months but that’s not going to win us the Asia Cup. It’s a new tournament in Bangladesh and the battles are different,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Pace versus big hits</strong></p>
<p>Sri Lanka have the batting to counter Pakistan’s bowling threat, especially on the slow and low pitches here. Kumar Sangakkara is in fantastic form with an ODI hundred against Bangladesh just five days ago. It came on the heels of his monumental 319 in the Test match at Chittagong. Mahela Jayawardene will add to the quality and experience of the batting line-up.</p>
<p>The Sri Lankans , however, will miss the experience of Tillakaratne Dilshan, Nuwan Kulasekara and Rangana Herath — both out injured — and the onus will once again be on Lasith Malinga to deliver. Also the Sri Lankans will know that they are the most successful team in the Asia Cup having won more matches than any other side (29 out of 43).</p>
<p>On Tuesday, when the two sides meet, the aforementioned statistic is unlikely to have a bearing on the result nor will the recent records between these sides who have played each other a little too often. Rather the familiarity between the two sides will ensure a keen contest.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mohammadnabiapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992690" alt="Mohammad Nabi, captain of Afghanistan, learned to play the game on the streets of Peshawar in Pakistan, where he was a refugee (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mohammadnabiapm.jpg" /></a> Mohammad Nabi, captain of Afghanistan, learned to play the game on the streets of Peshawar in Pakistan, where he was a refugee (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">For someone who began life as a refugee, Mohammad Nabi has learnt to accept crises with a smile.</span></p>
<p>Nabi, 29, is the captain of the Afghanistan cricket team with 655 runs and 23 wickets in 27 ODIs to his name.</p>
<p>Cricket, however, doesn’t always offer a level playing-field and Nabi, having faced more than just financial hardship and travails associated with a refugee, knows this from experience. As recently as five months ago, his father, Haji Khobi, had been abducted by local thugs in Jalalabad. Sitting in the cosy lobby of the Sheraton Hotel in Dhaka, Nabi turns pale as he recounts the event.</p>
<p><a title="Asia Cup: Neighbours lock horns for supremacy" href="http://indianexpress.com/photos/sports-gallery/asia-cup-neighbours-lock-horns-for-supremacy/" target="_blank"><strong>Photos: Neighbours lock horns for supremacy</strong></a></p>
<p>“My father is retired and we never had money. I don’t know why he was picked up and held to a ransom of $2 million. They were just local goons without any political connection,” Nabi says, speaking to The Indian Express. “I was in Ireland playing a series and badly wanted to come back. But my family persuaded me to stay and thankfully, my father walked free after two months as the culprits were nabbed. The government was very helpful. They saved my father.”</p>
<p>For a cricketer who survives on $2,300 per month, Nabi does not classify his sport as a get-rich-quick kind of career. Even so, he says cricket and the Afghanistan players have come a long way since he first played for the national team.</p>
<p>“At least we are getting something now, after the Afghanistan Cricket Board introduced central contracts. The national team players are under Grade A and get paid monthly. We even have a sponsor now but things were very different, just four-five years ago. We had nothing — no proper ground and very little money. We struggled to buy the equipment,” he explains. “Still, I didn’t choose a different profession because I always wanted to be a cricketer, ever since I picked up a cricket bat for the first time, as a kid in Peshawar.”</p>
<p>Back in 2000, Afghanistan had a tenuous link to cricket. Nabi, still a refugee in Pakistan, was making his presence felt in local cricket tournaments in Peshawar. He returned home two years later, attended a selection trial and got picked for the national team.</p>
<p><strong>Trying times</strong></p>
<p>“It was very difficult to convince my family. It was quite natural of them not to be interested, for cricket seemed to have no future, but I put my foot down. Looking back, I feel I took the right decision,” Nabi says. Cricket, however, has made deep inroads in Afghanistan now. Even the Taliban is interested.</p>
<p>“Cricket in our country is free from politics. Everyone became a follower after we got ODI status in 2010. We also played the World T20 and it made every kid want to pick up a cricket bat,” Nabi says. “As for the Taliban, we don’t have any problems. They too support cricket.”</p>
<p>Cricket-related infrastructure is also developing in Afghanistan but international exposure still remains the most essential factor for the country’s players, feels Nabi. “We have two international grounds in Kabul and Jalalabad, and a full-fledged domestic tournament where 24 provinces play. We play all three formats — three-day matches, one-dayers and T20,” he says. “I wish the BCCI allows us to play in the Ranji Trophy, which is a huge tournament. If Afghanistan gets a chance to play there, we would benefit immensely.”</p>
<p>The Afghanistan team received a lukewarm response to a request to allow them to train and play warm-up matches in India to prepare for the Asia Cup.</p>
<p>“We requested the BCCI but they didn’t respond and we had a month-long camp in Hambantota, Sri Lanka, instead,” Nabi says, with a touch of disappointment.</p>
<p>Still, the captain is very fond of India because the country had presented him with a great opportunity.</p>
<p>“I was playing an exhibition game in India against MCC in 2005 and scored a 39-ball century. Mike Gatting (now MCC president) was very impressed and took me to their academy at Lord’s where I trained for two years. I hope India will help us grow as a team,” Nabi says.</p>
<p><strong>Odd upset</strong></p>
<p>Afghanistan are rank underdogs in the Asia Cup, though this team has the ability to pull off the odd upset. Nabi, however, is not very concerned about results. “This tournament allows us to share the stage with big teams like India and Pakistan. It’s a huge bonus and a priceless experience.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992502&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dortmundapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992719" alt="Dortmund and Zenit scrapped into the knockout round in contrasting fashion, with 12 and 6 points respectively (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dortmundapm.jpg" /></a> Dortmund and Zenit scrapped into the knockout round in contrasting fashion, with 12 and 6 points respectively (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Borussia Dortmund fans will be offered tea and pies at Zenit St Petersburg on Tuesday but there will be no such generosity on the pitch with the Russians intent on reaching their first Champions League quarterfinal. Zenit would appear to be rank outsiders against last season’s runners-up after scraping through the group stage with a measly six points, the lowest-ever total with which a team has reached the round of 16.</span></p>
<p>They mustered only one win in six group games and finished their campaign by losing 4-1 at Austria Vienna. They will also be rusty after a two-month winter break and will have to close part of the Petrovsky stadium as a punishment for racist behaviour by their fans in the Austria Vienna match.</p>
<p>Even in an unusually mild Russian winter, it all adds up to a pretty grim outlook, yet Zenit coach Luciano Spalletti is anything but discouraged, claiming that the group stage results did not reflect their performances.</p>
<p>“The team live for this competition and their careers are driven by it,” the Italian, whose team will be playing their first competitive match since early December, told UEFA.com.</p>
<p>“We have played in the Champions League for many years now, and we’ve fought well this season. We have many important qualities which means we can play at this level,” he added.<br />
HEAVY DEFEAT</p>
<p>Dortmund amassed 12 points in a much tougher group, featuring Napoli, Arsenal and Olympique Marseille although their domestic form has been inconsistent. After winning the Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012 and finishing second last season, they have had some ups and downs this season and are currently third.</p>
<p>On Saturday, they suffered their heaviest away defeat for four seasons when they went down 3-0 at Hamburg SV but coach Juergen Klopp was confident they would rally.</p>
<p>“We have often shown the right reaction in the Champions League in the past after losing league games,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s a completely different competition,” added midfielder Nuri Sahin. “We will be well prepared in St Petersburg and we want to get a good result to bring back to Dortmund.”</p>
<p>Zenit have been ordered to close four sections of the Petrovsky stadium used by ultras and organise extra security measures following the incidents in Vienna, where their fans displayed racist banners and let off fireworks.</p>
<p>The club’s general manager Maxim Mitrofanov said that season ticket holders for the ultras sections would not be allowed in other parts of the stadium, even if they bought tickets.</p>
<p>He also warned of delays entering the ground as club employees checked that none of the banned fans was trying to get in.</p>
<p>“We understand that it’s hard to be outside at the stadium for a long time,” he said. “Petrovsky does not have the most comfortable infrastructure, unfortunately, especially in winter time. So we’re going to give Borussia fans hot tea, and treat them to pirozhki (Russian pies). We’ll show them true Russian hospitality, to soften the influence of any cold weather on the match.”<br />
good chance for greeks</p>
<p>Athens: Olympiakos Piraeus may never have a better chance to overcome their Manchester United hoodoo than in Tuesday’s first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie. Yet a rejuvenated United served the runaway Greek league leaders a warning of improving form in their 2-0 win at Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Greek champions, who have reached this stage of the competition for the first time in four years, will have to make a piece of history if they are to overcome United after losing their four previous meetings. There is scope for optimism, for Michel’s team are in imperious form, unbeaten in 26 league matches and holders of a 23-point lead at the top of the Super League.</p>
<p>Olympiakos head into the match on the back of a 4-0 win over OFI Crete on Saturday in which recent Serbian signing Marko Scepovic scored the first hat-trick of his career. “I would like to see the same concentration, passion and appetite from my players against United as they showed in the game against OFI,” Michel said after the club’s 24th victory in 26 league matches.</p>
<p>“We have turned a page and our minds are fully focused on the Champions League match with United, I can see the appetite in the eyes and on the faces of my players; they are so eager for it,” he commented on his Facebook account on Sunday.<br />
Michel will, however, be without one of his senior players after former Argentina striker Javier Saviola picked up a leg injury and was ruled out. Saviola’s absence means 21-year-old Nigerian striker Michael Olaitan, who has scored eight times in 15 appearances this season, is likely to start up front with Argentine attacking midfielder Alejandro Dominguez playing just behind.</p>
<p>United travel to Greece with the Champions League their only chance of winning a trophy this season, although that chance is a long shot at best. On the plus side, Wayne Rooney pledged his long term future to United last week before scoring a superb goal in Saturday’s victory. Also, manager David Moyes was able to include Marouane Fellaini in the starting lineup against Palace after his long injury absence.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992409&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Barcelona has paid 13.55 million euros ($18.6 million) to Spanish tax authorities to cover any potential irregularities in its signing of Neymar while maintaining its innocence of fraud charges levied against it.</p>
<p>The Spanish champion said in a statement on Monday it had paid the &#8220;complimentary&#8221; amount to cover any &#8220;eventual interpretations that could come out of the contracts signed relating to the transfer of Neymar. Meanwhile we are convinced of the legality of our initial fulfilment relating to our tax obligations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barcelona&#8217;s actions take the price of Neymar&#8217;s transfer to 100 million euros ($138 million) after the Catalan club initially said it had paid 57.1 million euros ($74 million) for the Brazil forward.</p>
<p>Neymar&#8217;s signing forced the resignation of Sandro Rosell as president last month.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992305&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:medium;">Jason Collins became the first openly homosexual player in the National Basketball Association, breaking ground in major professional U.S. team sports as the country&#8217;s growing acceptance of gay rights continues.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:medium;"> He entered the first game with his new team Sunday night just hours after signing a 10-day contract with the Brooklyn Nets, and said, “I don&#8217;t have time to really think about history right now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:medium;"> The 35-year-old Collins revealed at the end of last season he is homosexual, but he was a free agent and had remained unsigned until Sunday. After his announcement last year, numerous NBA players insisted he would be welcomed in the locker room.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:medium;">Speaking at a press conference before his Sunday night game in Los Angeles against the Lakers, Collins said he was aware of the magnitude of his signing, but he said he was most concerned with learning the Nets&#8217; plays.&#8221;The pressure is playing in an NBA game tonight, and last time I played in an NBA game was last April,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So I think that&#8217;s enough pressure right there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:medium;"> Collins played 10 scoreless minutes with two rebounds and five fouls in the Nets&#8217; 108-102 victory.&#8220;I know that I can play in the NBA, and it felt good to be out there tonight,&#8221; he said. Collins had played 12 NBA seasons before his announcement. He has played for five other teams and is well respected inside and outside the league.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:medium;"> &#8216;The decision to sign Jason was a basketball decision,&#8221; Nets general manager Billy King said in a statement. &#8220;With his experience and size, we felt he was the right choice for a 10-day contract.&#8221;</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:medium;"> The Nets posted a photo on their Twitter account of Coach Jason Kidd watching Collins sign his contract, encouraging followers to retweet it to welcome Collins to Brooklyn.</span></p>

<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:medium;"> &#8220;Jason told us that his goal was to earn another contract with an NBA team. Today, I want to commend him on achieving his goal. I know everyone in the NBA family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment,&#8221; NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said.</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:medium;"> &#8220;Life is more exciting for me. I mean, I don&#8217;t have to hide who I am and I can be my normal self. The past 10 months have been incredible. I&#8217;m making new friends, hearing different people&#8217;s stories, sharing experiences. It&#8217;s just been an overall positive.&#8221;, said Collins</span></p>
<p lang="en-US"><span style="font-size:medium;"> &#8220;I know Jason Collins is a competitor. One thing I know about him is he fouls very hard,&#8221; Miami&#8217;s Dwyane Wade said with a laugh. &#8220;He&#8217;s one of those tough veterans. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s happy to be back playing in the league. Welcome back.&#8221;</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/southafricareuterm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1992163" alt="South Africa, three-time semi-finalists, have had no previous World Cup success (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/southafricareuterm.jpg" /></a> South Africa, three-time semi-finalists, have had no previous World Cup success (Reuters)
<p>South Africa will play a minimum of 23 warm-up one-day internationals against five different countries to boost their preparation for next year&#8217;s World Cup, the country&#8217;s cricket board said on Monday.</p>
<p>The three-time semi-finalists have had no previous World Cup success and a litany of dramatic failures have earned them a cruel reputation as &#8220;chokers&#8221; in the limited overs format.</p>
<p>&#8220;With it being a World Cup year in 2015, we have placed a lot of emphasis on the 50-over format and have tried to maximise our preparations by playing as many matches as possible in conditions that will be similar to those in New Zealand and Australia,&#8221; coach Russell Domingo said in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>The board also announced six Tests in a six-month period between July and January next year that includes fulfilling a two-match series against Sri Lanka postponed last year.</p>
<p>The top-ranked test Team will play two Tests and three one-day internationals in the island nation in July, followed by a single test in Zimbabwe in August and then a triangular ODI series there also involving Australia.</p>
<p>If they reach the final of the triangular in Harare, that will take to 24 the number of their pre-World Cup ODIs.</p>
<p>South Africa have arranged a three-match ODI series in New Zealand in October and then take on Australia away in three Twenty20 internationals and five ODIs in November.</p>
<p>The Proteas will host a three-Test series and five ODIs against the West Indies in December and January before heading to the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>South Africa have been clubbed in Pool B along with Zimbabwe, India, West Indies, Ireland, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992153&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Courtesy his Delhi Open triumph, India&#8217;s numero uno singles player Somdev Devvarman jumped 18 places to become world number 78 in the latest ATP rankings.</p>
<p>Somdev had collected 100 ranking points after <strong><a title="Somdev Devvarman ends singles title drought with Challenger" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/tennis/somdev-devvarman-ends-singles-title-drought-with-challenger/" target="_blank">beating top seed Alerksandr Nedovyesov</a></strong> in the final on Sunday.</p>
<p>Somdev&#8217;s next clash is on Tuesday against world number five and 2009 US Open winner Juan Martin Del Potro in the first round of the ATP 500 Dubai Duty Free championships.</p>
<p>Somdev&#8217;s career best rank was 62, which he achieved in July 2011.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s number two singles player Yuki Bhambri slipped to 146, a loss of three places. The Delhi boy had made a shock first round exit at the Delhi Open.</p>
<p>In the doubles, Leander Paes continued to be India&#8217;s top player at number 10. He is unchanged this week. Rohan Bopanna lost a place to be 16th while Mahesh Bhupathi, who is set to retire this year, further slipped to 41.</p>
<p>Left-handed Divij Sharan was the next best at 65.</p>
<p>In the women&#8217;s rankings Sania Mirza dropped out of top-10. She is now placed 11th. The top Indian star last week made a shock first-round exit from the Dubai event with partner Cara Black.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992088&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will not sacrifice his side&#8217;s thrilling attacking style in favour of tightening up the defence as the Merseysiders continue to keep themselves in the hunt for a first Premier League title.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Liverpool edge Swansea in thriller" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/football/liverpool-edge-swansea-in-thriller/">Sunday&#8217;s 4-3 win over Swansea City</a> </strong>moved Liverpool back to within four points of leaders Chelsea with 11 matches remaining, and also saw them leapfrog third-placed Manchester City as the league&#8217;s leading scorers with 70 goals.</p>
<p>Despite seeing England&#8217;s Daniel Sturridge match former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy&#8217;s feat of scoring in eight consecutive Premier League matches, Liverpool allowed Swansea to twice pull level before Jordan Henderson&#8217;s second goal with 16 minutes remaining secured the three points.</p>
<p>Rodgers said his side needed to tighten up at the back, but did not want to curb their attacking ways that have allowed Luis Suarez and Sturridge emerge as the league&#8217;s top two scorers with a combined 41 goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s not our style,&#8221; former Swansea manager Rodgers told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I worry always to play good football. I&#8217;m not one who is totally satisfied to always just grind out results. It is about winning, that&#8217;s what professional sport is about at this level. But for us I always concentrate on performance because I think that the consequence of performing well consistently is getting results and this season we&#8217;ve shown that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve shown that when we play well we get the win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liverpool, whose last title came in the 1989-90 season, before the start of the Premier League, have conceded more goals that their three title rivals &#8211; Chelsea, Arsenal and City &#8211; and struggled to contain Swansea&#8217;s Wilfried Bony on Sunday, with the Ivorian scoring twice.</p>
<p>Martin Skrtel, who gave away a penalty that allowed Bony to equalise at 3-3, was given a torrid time before being replaced by Kolo Toure, who himself has made two costly errors in recent weeks that led directly to goals.</p>
<p>Rodgers said that at times his players were failing to defend &#8220;anywhere near well enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem is that it&#8217;s not coaching,&#8221; Rodgers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the things we conceded goals in you can&#8217;t coach that. There&#8217;s a feel when you&#8217;re in the game of how to defend and you have to use that experience to be able to defend properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We concede poor goals, which not so (much) structural as mistakes or decision making, which costs us. We will continue to work on that side of it. The balance in our training is very much equal in relation to our pressing, defensive mentality and also our offensive side.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992063&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">South Africa achieved something in the second Test that would have been beyond most teams, said captain Graeme Smith after his side&#8217;s 231-run win over Australia on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>The world&#8217;s top-ranked outfit came under under-fire after their crushing 281-run defeat in the opening Test but Smith was proud at the way his players responded as they set up a thrilling third and final match in Cape Town on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had to draw on past experiences in this match to find a way to win,&#8221; he told reporters after South Africa bowled Australia out for 216 in their second innings on the fourth day.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been a difficult week for us after the Pretoria Test. We knew we needed to be smart and clinical and work on good ideas on how we could respond.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say not many teams could respond in the way we did but it is something this side has done before,&#8221; added Smith.</p>
<p>Having set a daunting victory target of 448, South Africa were on the back foot when the tourists raced to 126 without loss but fired-up paceman Dale Steyn suddenly got the ball to reverse-swing and claimed four victims as Australia lost 10 wickets for 90 runs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dale always ranges from very angry to extremely angry when he bowls,&#8221; Smith joked. &#8220;But it was a hell of an effort from all the bowlers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The intensity they showed with the ball on a wicket that did not do that much was amazing. To get nine wickets in a session is remarkable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We always know Dale is one spell away from being able to create something for us. It is great to see that when the game is on the line he can respond like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith had an ominous warning for the Australians too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dale was carrying an injury going into this series,&#8221; said the captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;He did not bowl much in the lead-up to the first Test and he&#8217;s going to get better and better the more he bowls and the more we play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith, though, was annoyed with the number of catches his side put down in Port Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually took about 28 wickets in this Test which is a great effort from our bowlers,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1992003&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mourinhoreutersn.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1952263" alt="Didier Drogba moved to Chelsea in 2004, Mourinho's first season, and stayed after the Portuguese left in 2007 (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/mourinhoreutersn.jpg" /></a> Didier Drogba moved to Chelsea in 2004, Mourinho&#8217;s first season, and stayed after the Portuguese left in 2007 (Reuters)
<p>Chelsea will find it strange to be up against their Champions League-winning hero Didier Drogba in Wednesday&#8217;s clash with Galatasaray, said manager Jose Mourinho.</p>
<p>While the London club&#8217;s players and backroom staff will maintain their friendship with the Ivorian before and after the match, they will be fierce rivals during the 90 minutes of the last-16 first leg tie in Istanbul.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a strange feeling but we know him well and if you know him well you know that for him there are no friends during the game,&#8221; Mourinho told reporters after a late John Terry goal secured a 1-0 win for the Premier League leaders over Everton on Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us just before the game we will be big friends and have big respect for a real legend of the club. During the game we will have a job to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has his nature and that nature is to want to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drogba is Chelsea&#8217;s record European scorer with 34 goals in 69 games.</p>
<p>He bagged nine goals in nine domestic and European finals and his sizeable contribution to the club&#8217;s recent history is apparent from the number of posters of him still dotted around Stamford Bridge.</p>
<p>Drogba moved to Chelsea in 2004, Mourinho&#8217;s first season, and stayed after the Portuguese left in 2007, his goals against Bayer Leverkusen, Valencia, Napoli and in the semi-final against Barcelona helping them into the 2012 Champions League final.</p>
<p>In the final against Bayern Munich at the German team&#8217;s own Allianz Arena, Drogba headed a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw and then struck the winning penalty in the shootout.</p>
<p>He left the club a few days later, saying he had achieved everything he wanted with Chelsea, before spending a few months playing in China and then moving on to Turkey.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Past meetings</strong></p>
<p>Mourinho, who rejoined Chelsea in the close season, said he had already experienced the strange feeling of playing against Drogba.</p>
<p>The Portuguese was at Inter Milan four years ago when he took on Drogba and Chelsea, and also held the reins at Real Madrid last year when the Spanish giants met Galatasaray.</p>
<p>Both times Mourinho was on the winning side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last season my team was a team ready to win the Champions League and we had trouble against them,&#8221; said the Chelsea manager.</p>
<p>&#8220;We won in Madrid but we lost in Istanbul and we were in trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have a good team, a very experienced team, people who have had a long run at a high level&#8230;they have Champions League winners,&#8221; Mourinho said.</p>
<p>He cited Dutchman Wesley Sneijder, Drogba&#8217;s Ivory Coast team mate Emmanuel Eboue and Brazilian Felipe Melo as &#8220;people who have played with the best clubs in the world&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Turkish guys are the best Turkish players,&#8221; added Mourinho. &#8220;They have (Hamit) Altintop, (Burak) Yilmaz, (Selcuk) Inan. They are a top team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mourinho is hoping Brazil defender David Luiz and Nigeria midfielder John Obi Mikel, who missed the Everton game with minor injuries, will be fit for Wednesday as new signing Nemanja Matic is cup-tied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a tie to go to the end, really to the end,&#8221; said the Chelsea manager.

<p>Dale Earnhardt Jr. drove his Chevrolet to victory in a rain-interrupted, crash-marred Daytona 500 on Sunday in the season-opening NASCAR race at Daytona International Speedway.</p>
<p>Denny Hamlin was second in a Toyota and Brad Keselowski took third in a Ford, placed ahead of Jeff Gordon in his Chevrolet after a video review by officials following the jam-packed finish.</p>
<p>Earnhardt used a push from his team mate Gordon to win a two-lap shoot-out to the finish line after one of a series of crashes in the race.</p>
<p>&#8220;We got a little help from Jeff to get away,&#8221; said Earnhardt.</p>
<p>It was a marathon day and night at the speedway with the Great American Race completed after a six hour, 21 minute rain delay that came after the 38th lap and was the longest single day interruption in 56 editions of the race.</p>
<p>It was Earnhardt&#8217;s second Daytona victory, coming 10 years after the 2004 triumph of NASCAR&#8217;s most popular driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Winning this race is the greatest feeling you can feel in this sport,&#8221; Earnhardt said in an on-track TV interview.</p>
<p>Earnhardt had notched three second-place finishes in the race over the last four years, including the last two.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d ever get a chance to feel that again. And it feels just as good, if not better, than the first because of how hard we tried year after year after year,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The biggest crash of the race happened three-fourths of the way through, involving 13 cars including the one driven by Danica Patrick, who last year became the only woman to win the pole position for the event.</p>
<p>No drivers were seriously injured.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991964&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jasondaym.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991962" alt="Jason Day kisses the Walter Hagen Trophy after winning the final round of the World Golf Championships - Accenture Match Play Championship at The Golf Club at Dove Mountain (Photo: USA Today Sports)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/jasondaym.jpg" /></a> Jason Day kisses the Walter Hagen Trophy after winning the final round of the World Golf Championships &#8211; Accenture Match Play Championship at The Golf Club at Dove Mountain (Photo: USA Today Sports)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Jason Day had heard all the criticism, that a player of his undoubted talent should have won a lot more than just one PGA Tour title even though he is just 26.</span></p>
<p>It felt like a long time coming but finally, on Sunday at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, the Australian secured his second victory on the U.S. circuit by beating Frenchman Victor Dubuisson after 23 holes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked very, very hard in the off-season,&#8221; Day told reporters after knocking in a four-foot birdie putt to clinch a one-up win in the title match at Dove Mountain in Marana, Arizona.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve worked very hard on my physical fitness and mental fitness and it certainly paid off this week at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like it&#8217;s been a long time coming since my last win. I&#8217;ve heard things in the media saying he&#8217;s only got one win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Day&#8217;s maiden PGA Tour victory came at the 2010 Byron Nelson Championship, and he had come very close to adding a second before this week and made a habit of performing at his best when the pressure was at its most intense.</p>
<p>Since he turned professional in 2006, he has recorded six top-10s at the majors, including three runner-up spots.</p>
<p>In November, he won the coveted World Cup of Golf by two strokes at Royal Melbourne, along with the team title in partnership with Adam Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a lot of consistent finishes in big events and obviously I said to myself I&#8217;ve got to keep working hard and work, work, work, work, work smart,&#8221; said Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as I don&#8217;t give up and keep pushing through, it (a win) will happen again, and hopefully happen in bunches.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took me nearly three years, I guess. I got my second win finally. But just that hard work has paid off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Day became the second Australian to win the Match Play title following Geoff Ogilvy, who triumphed in 2006 and 2009.</p>
<p>Asked whether he had been at all disappointed with the progress of his career, Day replied: &#8220;No, no, no. A career is very long in golf.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see guys like Adam Scott, Justin Rose winning major championships in their early 30s. You see guys winning in their 20s like Rory and Tiger.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest thing for myself is just to understand I&#8217;m not Rory (McIlroy). I&#8217;m not Tiger (Woods). I&#8217;m not Adam Scott. I&#8217;m not Justin Rose,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Jason Day. And I need to do the work and it will happen, I&#8217;ve just got to be patient.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/muellerreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991949" alt="Bayern Munich's Thomas Mueller celebrates after scoring during the German Bundesliga first division soccer match against Hanover 96 (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/muellerreutersm.jpg" /></a> Bayern Munich&#8217;s Thomas Mueller celebrates after scoring during the German Bundesliga first division soccer match against Hanover 96 (Reuters)
<p>Runaway leaders Bayern Munich appeared to barely break sweat in a 4-0 win at Hanover 96 to chalk up their 14th Bundesliga win in a row on Sunday, leaving them a huge 19 points clear at the top.</p>
<p>The defending champions, unbeaten in their last 47 league matches, look well-placed to beat last season&#8217;s record when they wrapped up the title with six matches to spare.</p>
<p>Thomas Mueller scored twice for Bayern Munich while Thiago Alcantara and Mario Mandzukic helped themselves to one piece in an embarrassingly one-sided affair watched in near silence by a demoralised 49,000 crowd.</p>
<p>Bayern Munich, who have 62 points from a possible 66 and a goal difference of 52, went ahead with their first clearcut chance when Rafinha broke free on the right and crossed for an unmarked Mueller to head in at the near post.</p>
<p>Nine minutes later, Bastian Schweinsteiger chipped a diagonal ball over the Hanover defence and Alcantara fired past Ron-Robert Zieler.</p>
<p>Mandzukic cleverly set up the third for Mueller in the 59th minute with a neat backheel and the Croatia forward headed the fourth himself from another Rafinha cross seven minutes later, taking his league tally for the season to 13.</p>
<p>At the other end, Bayern, whose last league defeat was at Bayer Leverkusen in October 2012, kept a clean sheet for the sixth consecutive match in all competitions.</p>
<p>Bayern&#8217;s nearest challengers Bayer Leverkusen lost 3-1 at VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday, leaving them stuck on 43 points. Borussia Dortmund are a point further back in third after losing 3-0 at Hamburg SV.</p>
<p>Eintracht Frankfurt and Werder Bremen remained uncomfortably close to the danger zone after drawing 0-0 earlier on Sunday. Both have 22 points, three clear of Hamburg who are 16th and in the relegation playoff spot.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991938&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/atleticomadridap.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991934" alt="Atletico de Madrid's Diego Costa of Brazil, right, leaves the pitch while Osasuna's Roberto Torres, Damia Abella, Oriel Riera, and Emiliano Armenteros of Argentina, left to right, celebrate after they won the match 3-0 (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/atleticomadridap.jpg" /></a> Atletico de Madrid&#8217;s Diego Costa of Brazil, right, leaves the pitch while Osasuna&#8217;s Roberto Torres, Damia Abella, Oriel Riera, and Emiliano Armenteros of Argentina, left to right, celebrate after they won the match 3-0 (AP)
<p>Atletico Madrid&#8217;s La Liga title challenge took a nosedive when they slumped to a shock 3-0 defeat at Osasuna on Sunday, leaving Real Madrid three points clear at the top.</p>
<p>Champions Barcelona and Real were held to draws at Osasuna&#8217;s El Sadar stadium earlier in the season and Atletico fell behind in the sixth minute when Alvaro Cejudo arrived unmarked at the back post to volley a corner into the net.</p>
<p>An error by fullback Juanfran allowed Emiliano Armenteros space to score with a long-range drive in the 21st minute and Roberto Torres nodded a third goal three minutes before the break.</p>
<p>It was the first time Atletico conceded three goals in the first half since Argentine coach Diego Simeone took over at the end of 2011.</p>
<p>Simeone left several regulars out of his starting lineup before bringing on playmakers Koke and Arda Turan and attacking midfielder Raul Garcia in the second half.</p>
<p>Atletico forward Diego Costa, who has 21 goals in La Liga this season, toiled up front but a typically gritty defensive performance from Osasuna kept him at bay as they climbed to 12th on 29 points.</p>
<p>&#8220;When your opponent is superior all you can do is congratulate them and Osasuna played very well today,&#8221; Simeone told a news conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second half was better from our side but we couldn&#8217;t find the goal that would have put us back in the match.&#8221;</p>
<p>Atletico&#8217;s defeat in Pamplona came after Barcelona lost 3-1 at fifth-placed Real Sociedad on Saturday as coach Gerardo Martino&#8217;s decision to rest key players backfired.</p>
<p>Real Madrid had earlier cruised to a 3-0 win at home to promoted Elche. They have the outright lead for the first time since the end of the 2011-12 season, on 63 points with 13 matches left.</p>
<p>Barca, chasing a fifth title in six years, and Atletico have 60 points with the Catalan giants ahead on goal difference.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Seeking revenge</strong></p>
<p>Atletico and Barca won impressively away from home in midweek Champions League action. The latter beat Manchester City 2-0 and the former overcame AC Milan 1-0 but both teams were unable to carry their form into the weekend.</p>
<p>Real, who play their Champions League last-16 first leg at Schalke 04 on Wednesday, are unbeaten in 26 matches in all competitions and visit Atletico next Sunday when they will be seeking to avenge a 1-0 defeat at home to their city rivals in September.</p>
<p>&#8220;The third goal was a real blow,&#8221; said Atletico full back Filipe Luis.</p>
<p>&#8220;All we can do is congratulate Osasuna on a great performance. We need to keep working and try to keep up with the leaders which is a very tough task,&#8221; added the Brazil international.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have always said this league is a two-horse race. But we are very strong at home so we will do our best to beat Real next weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao remained on course for a berth in Champions League qualifying when they won 2-0 at bottom club Real Betis who had a player sent off in each half.</p>
<p>Sevilla and Valencia stayed in the hunt for European places when they won 1-0 at struggling Rayo Vallecano and 2-1 at home to mid-table Granada respectively.</p>
<p>Seventh-placed Sevilla and Valencia, in eighth, have 35 points, five behind Villarreal in sixth who visit Espanyol on Monday.<br />
Sociedad are on 43 points in fifth, four adrift of Basque rivals Bilbao.

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ishantm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991896" alt="'Sir' Ishant Sharma..." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ishantm.jpg" /></a> &#8216;Sir&#8217; Ishant Sharma&#8230;
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Some things in cricket are meant to be funny. Inzy’s running, Rameez’s commentary, Sir Ishant Sharma’s bowling at the death… here are a few video collections for you to laugh at.</span></p>
<p><strong>MS Dhoni shows that he could have been a great comedian if he hadn’t happened to be the best wicketkeeper-batsman ever.</strong></p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/eff5OIIX6BI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Inzamam-Ul-Haq gets people run-out. Till you watch this video, you never quite appreciate that.</strong></p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/vQh70VV-RaY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Sir Ishant Sharma didn’t always have the Sir in his name. That happened when he gifted 30 runs to James Faulkner. He did something so terrible that even Hitler took notice:</strong></p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/yPaL3nhPE_s?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p><strong>Kamran Akmal dropping catches is much more fun when set to music.</strong></p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/cmfpSff_Ek0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span><br />
<strong>Finally, the worst cricket performance ever, commemorated through scorecard screenshots.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohliaplm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991869" alt="Virat Kohli addresses a press conference ahead of the Asia Cup tournament in Dhaka (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/viratkohliaplm.jpg" /></a> Virat Kohli addresses a press conference ahead of the Asia Cup tournament in Dhaka (AP)
<p>Far from being bogged down by captaincy, <strong><a title="Asia Cup: Will Virat Kohli be able to step into MS Dhoni’s captaincy shoes on big stage?" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-will-virat-kohli-be-able-to-step-into-ms-dhonis-captaincy-shoes-on-big-stage/" target="_blank">Virat Kohli said he is looking forward</a></strong> to leading an under-fire Indian cricket team in the Asia Cup starting Tuesday even though it is a tough position to be in.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Injured Mahendra Singh Dhoni ruled out of Asia Cup; Virat Kohli to lead" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/injured-mahendra-singh-dhoni-ruled-out-of-asia-cup-virat-kohli-to-lead/" target="_blank">Kohli has been made stand-in captain</a></strong> for the regional mega-event after <strong><a title="With Dhoni’s exit, a change of the established order" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/with-dhonis-exit-a-change-of-the-established-order/" target="_blank">regular skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni</a></strong>, who is under the scanner following the team&#8217;s dismal showing in the recent tours of South Africa and New Zealand, was forced out due to a side strain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this is anything compared to what he has gone through in the past few years,&#8221; Kohli said while addressing the media after the team&#8217;s arrival in Dhaka.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am captain for just one tournament. It is completely different from regularly captaining the side. When you win, you&#8217;re praised, when you lose, you&#8217;re criticised. It is all a part of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not in a position right now to experience all that. I have got this one-odd opportunity like I did in the past as well. I am sure it is a very tough position to be in. You have to be ready to take all the criticism and praise that comes your way,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>India will open their Asia Cup campaign on Wednesday against Bangladesh at Fatullah.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old batsman, whose fine form was one of the few positives that India could latch on to during their winless streak in South Africa and New Zealand, said he is excited about leading the side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have only been captain for about eight games till now. It went pretty good but this is a big tournament. It&#8217;s a challenge I&#8217;m looking forward to. We have got a young group of guys and some exciting players,&#8221; Kohli said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that excites me to have a group that I can have a chat with and be on the same page. It&#8217;s important to have an understanding. It&#8217;s really exciting for me to improve the record which is already good. I&#8217;m looking forward to the tournament.&#8221;<br />
When asked about the much-anticipated match against Pakistan on March 2, Kohli said the team&#8217;s target was to win the tournament and not just one grudge match against the traditional rivals.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously we are here to win the tournament. We haven&#8217;t just come here to play one game and go back home, that&#8217;s not our aim. Our aim is to win every game that we play. A game against Pakistan is always a hyped game for us, obviously a big pressure match.</p>
<p>&#8220;We take every game the same way. You know, the aim is to win the tournament, not just one game, and make sure the people are happy,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991865&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rafaelnadalreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991854" alt="Rafael Nadal of Spain bites his trophy after winning against Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine at the 2014 Rio Open men's final tennis match (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rafaelnadalreutersm.jpg" /></a> Rafael Nadal of Spain bites his trophy after winning against Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine at the 2014 Rio Open men&#8217;s final tennis match (Reuters)
<p>Rafael Nadal returned from a troublesome back injury to win the Rio Open on Sunday, defeating Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine 6-3, 7-6 (3).</p>
<p>Nadal&#8217;s victory comes four weeks after losing the Australian Open final to underdog Stanislas Wawrinka after tweaking his back while warming up.</p>
<p>Nadal, who had to fend off two match points in the semifinal against Pablo Andujar, looked more comfortable in the final and improved his record on clay to 298 wins and 21 losses, the best in the Open Era.</p>
<p>The Spaniard declined to talk about his back, focusing instead on the victory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearly, it was important for me to get back and win after what happened in the final in Australia,&#8221; Nadal said.</p>
<p>He said the heat, the court preparation and the quick balls used in the event made it difficult. He has complained about the fast balls all week.</p>
<p>Nadal has won three times in Brazil and hopes to return next year. He&#8217;s also eyeing the 2016 Rio Olympics where he&#8217;d seek a second gold medal. He won gold in 2008 in Beijing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I leave with the sensation that Brazil is something special for me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Top-ranked Nadal used the Latin American clay-court swing to launch his comeback a year ago from a left knee injury. It went just fine with titles in the French and US Open.</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll take the same approach this time, hoping injuries don&#8217;t slow him heading to the French Open in three months.</p>
<p>Dolgopolov has lost all five matches against Nadal. At center court after the match he mentioned the near-civil war in Ukraine</p>
<p>&#8220;As you know there are some troubles in my country,&#8221; he told thousands of fans, who applauded in support. &#8220;Hopefully there&#8217;s going to be peace in my country as I left it a few months ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the women&#8217;s final at the combined ATP-WTA event, Kurumi Nara of Japan defeated top-seeded Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 to win her first WTA singles title.</p>
<p>Nara, the 22-year-old Japanese, was seeded fifth in the tournament and is Japan&#8217;s top-ranked woman. She prefers to play on hard courts but adapted to the heat and clay in Rio.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love Rio,&#8221; Nara said, cracking a huge smile. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I won the tournament, but I am very happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The victory is projected to push Nara into the top 50 &#8211; probably No. 48 &#8211; when the WTA publishes its rankings on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to think too much about being No. 1 in Japan,&#8221; Nara said. &#8220;I just want to focus on my game _ every game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nara said Japanese players are getting better on clay because a new clay-court facility has been built in the country.</p>
<p>Maria Bueno, Brazil&#8217;s greatest female player who won seven Grand Slam singles titles &#8211; her last in the US Open in 1966 &#8211; helped hand the winning trophy to Nara.</p>
<p>Zakopalova won two WTA titles 10 years ago, but has now lost 12 consecutive singles finals. In parts of the match she seemed unwell, probably bothered by the 32 Celsius (90 Fahrenheit) heat and intense humidity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have an asthma problem so I couldn&#8217;t breathe,&#8221; Zakopalova said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s not an excuse. Well done to Kurumi. She deserved it. She played really well.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991850&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/chanderpaulm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991848" alt="Shivnarine with Tagenarine, who is making waves in U-19 Cup" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/chanderpaulm.jpg" /></a> Shivnarine with Tagenarine, who is making waves in U-19 Cup
<p>A left-hander, Tagenarine marks his guard by hammering the bail into the pitch and in true family tradition prefers grinding away at the opposition rather than beating them to a pulp. Unlike other star sons though, this 17-year-old who has been the mainstay of the West Indies team in the ongoing Under-19 World Cup in the UAE wasn’t coached by his famous father, Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Nor did the opener grow up under his wing. In fact, it was only in 2009, when Tagenarine was 13, that the Chanderpauls even started living together as a family at their ancestral home in Guyana’s Unity village.</p>
<p>With the senior Chanderpaul, the Caribbean’s most capped Test cricketer and the highest run-getter in the country’s Test history, based in Florida with his second-wife, Amy, Tagenarine (pronounced Tej-narine) spent his growing up years in Unity with mother Annalee. However, he made it a point to catch every innings of his father on television.</p>
<p>“He would call to ask about me, and we would meet at times when he was in Guyana on tour. It’s been good having him around since he returned,” Tagenarine says. Shivnarine settled back in Unity five years ago.</p>
<p>One of the rare periods they spent together during Shivnarine’s peak cricketing years was in 2009, when he took Tagenarine along when India toured the Caribbean for a short ODI series.</p>
<p>It was the afternoons Tagenarine spent at his paternal grandparents’ place, particularly with grandfather Khemraj, that marked his initiation to cricket. Originally a fisherman, Khemraj had been the first to spot Shivnarine’s talent and hone it. During the hours that Tagenarine spent with him waiting for mother Annalee to return from work, Khemraj put him through a similar grind.</p>
<p>“I was around six when grandad started throwing balls at me. He had small nets under the house, a concrete strip where my father had been trained,” says Tagenarine. While Khemraj was strict, the 17-year-old adds, he was probably not as tough as he had been with Shivnarine. Tagenarine also says it was Khemraj who essentially turned him into a left-hander, though he started out batting right-handed. While Tagenarine is ambidextrous with the ball, he has stuck to bowling left-arm orthodox spin.</p>
<p>Local lore has it that Khemraj got villagers to bowl at Shivnarine with concrete balls back in the late 1970s to toughen him up. The grandson wasn’t spared this, though he may have escaped with fewer bruises.</p>
<p>At the dinner table even now, Tagenarine adds, Khemraj dominates the conversation that centres for a large part around cricket.</p>
<p>Though his stance might not be as idiosyncratic as his father, Tagenarine says there are many similarities. Their careers too have followed similar paths, with the youngster making his first-class debut for Guyana at 16, one year younger than Shivnarine had been when he debuted in regional cricket in 1992.</p>
<p>In March 2013, they became only the second West Indian father-son combination to play first-class cricket together, when they turned up for Guyana against Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you how proud grandad was,” Tagenarine laughs. “We didn’t get to bat together but I did have to behave with dad around.”</p>
<p>A few months later, the father and son found themselves in opposition camps when the Stainsby Hall Cricket Club represented by Tagenarine faced a Derbyshire team that included Shivnarine. The match even saw an intense contest between father and son, and Tagenarine believes he had the upper hand.</p>
<p>“We bowled to each other. Who conceded more runs? Him, him, him. He bowled seam-up and I hit him for a six and a four. When I bowled, he could only knock me around for a single or two,” quips Tagenarine, who is better known as Brandon, a name given to him by his maternal grandmother.</p>
<p>It is this confidence that holds the 17-year-old in good stead as he steels himself for the inevitable comparisons with his father. Admitting that his chest swells up every time he walks up the road leading to the Bourda ground, now called the Shiv. Chanderpaul Drive, Tagenarine says: “It’s nice to be a Chanderpaul because of the great reputation that my dad has created. But I try not to think too much about it and try to be myself.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991730&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sochiolympicsreutersm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991822" alt="When performers formed the Olympic rings during the closing ceremony of the Sochi Games, they parodied their own error from the opening ceremony, when one of the rings had failed to display (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sochiolympicsreutersm1.jpg" /></a> When performers formed the Olympic rings during the closing ceremony of the Sochi Games, they parodied their own error from the opening ceremony, when one of the rings had failed to display (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Flushed with pride after a spectacular showing at the costliest Olympics ever, Russia celebrated 17 days of sport-driven global unity with a farewell show that hands off the Winter Games to their next host, Pyeongchang in South Korea. </span></p>
<p>Fireworks and a countdown kicked off the closing ceremony in the Fisht Olympic Stadium, packed with raucous spectators who chanted &#8220;Ro-ssi-ya! Ro-ssi-ya!&#8221; —&#8221;Russia! Russia!&#8221; — and were in a party mood.</p>
<p>In a charming touch, the Sochi organizers used the ceremony to make a joke at their own expense. Dancers in shimmering silver costumes formed themselves into four rings and a clump in the center of the stadium. That was a wink to a technical glitch in the Feb. 7 opening ceremony, when one of the five Olympic rings in a wintry opening scene failed to open. The rings were supposed to join together and erupt in fireworks.</p>
<p>This time, it worked: As Russian President Vladimir Putin watched from the stands, the dancers in the clump waited a few seconds and then formed a ring of their own, making five, drawing laughs from the crowd.</p>
<p>The closing ceremony, a farewell from Russia with love, pageantry and protocol, started at 20:14 local time — a nod to the year that Putin seized upon to remake Russia&#8217;s image with the Olympics.</p>
<p>The nation&#8217;s $51 billion investment —topping even Beijing&#8217;s estimated $40 billion layout for the 2008 Summer Games — transformed a decaying resort town on the Black Sea into a household name. But the Olympic show didn&#8217;t win over critics of Russia&#8217;s backsliding on democracy and human rights under Putin and its institutionalized intolerance of gays.</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye the flame</strong></p>
<p>As dusk fell Sunday, Russians and international visitors streamed into the stadium for the ceremony featuring the extinguishing of the Olympic flame. Day and night, the flame became a favorite backdrop for &#8220;Sochi selfies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Athletes were saying goodbye to rivals-turned-friends from far off places, savoring their achievements or lamenting what might have been — and, for some, looking ahead to 2018.</p>
<p>Winners of Russia&#8217;s 13 gold medals marched into the stadium carrying the country&#8217;s white, blue and red flag, which was raised alongside the Olympic flag. Athletes streamed by their hundreds into the stadium, dancing and taking photos of themselves. With a 3-0 victory over Sweden in the men&#8217;s hockey final Sunday, Canada claimed the last gold from the 98 medal events.</p>
<p>Absent were six competitors caught by what was the most extensive anti-doping program in Winter Olympic history, with the IOC conducting a record 2,631 tests — nearly 200 more than originally planned.</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s athletes topped the Sochi medals table, with a record 33 total. It represented a stunning turnaround from the 2010 Vancouver Games. There, a meagre 3 golds and 15 total for Russia seemed proof of its gradual decline as a winter sports power since Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Russia&#8217;s bag of Sochi gold was the biggest-ever haul by a non-Soviet team.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991708&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Top-ranked Rafael Nadal survived a scare at the Rio Open on Saturday, fighting off two match points before defeating fellow Spaniard Pablo Andujar 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (10) to advance to the final. Nadal will next face Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine, who upset second-seeded David Ferrer 6-4, 6-4 on Rio’s outdoor clay.</span></p>
<p>This was not Nadal’s night as he needed nearly three hours to defeat Andujar. “I felt empty the whole match,’’ he said.</p>
<p>“It was very humid, and this was the toughest day of all. I just didn’t feel that great physically, and I’m not talking about the back. I just didn’t feel that great. It was close because he played well, and I didn’t play my best,’’ Nadal added.</p>
<p>Nadal acknowledged his victory was lucky. “The tiebreak was a lottery,’’ he said. “But I played better in the tiebreak than the rest of the match.’’</p>
<p>Andujar had two match points in the third-set tiebreaker but couldn’t convert either.</p>
<p>Dolgopolov, who had beaten Ferrer only once in seven previous matches, won handily and didn’t flinch. “I always have these type matches with him, and usually at the end he would beat me,’’ the Ukrainian said. “I knew I’d have to make those shots. If you don’t win the points against him, he takes it away. I’m really happy I didn’t get tight and give away a lot of shots.’’</p>
<p>Dolgopolov has won two previous ATP titles. Ferrer won the Copa Claro last weekend in Buenos Aires, his third consecutive title in that clay-court event. He has 21 ATP titles.</p>
<p>In the women’s tournament, top-seeded Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic and fifth-seeded Kurumi Nara of Japan will face off in the final. Zakopalova defeated local hope Teliana Pereira 6-2, 6-1, and Nara won over Nastassja Burnett of Italy 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991704&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/somdevdevvarmanptim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991818" alt="Somdev Devvarman held serve to claim the title, winning the final point in characteristic fashion (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/somdevdevvarmanptim.jpg" /></a> Somdev Devvarman held serve to claim the title, winning the final point in characteristic fashion (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Somdev Devvarman won his first singles title in more than three years after breezing past Aleksandr Nedovyesov 6-3, 6-1 in the final of the Delhi Open Challenger on Sunday. As the scoreline would suggest, Devvarman dominated on most counts, but the Indian also benefitted from Nedovyesov’s capitulation. </span></p>
<p>Top seeded Kazhak player completely lost his rhythm midway through the first set to concede eight games in a row, later admitting that he had come into the final fatigued and with an injury bothering him.</p>
<p>Though Nedovyesov was going through the motions at the end, he started the brighter of the two in the opening games of the final. The first two service games saw Nedovyesov hit a forehand cross court winner, an inside-out forehand winner, a backhand down the line winner and three drop shots that even Devvarman could not get near. Devvarman could not take a single point of Nedovyesov’s serve in this period but managed to hold from his end without too much bother. The players split the first six games.</p>
<p>Devvarman relied mostly on the placement of his serve and on moving Nedovyesov from side to side, hoping to draw an error or open up the court. This is Devvarman’s usual strategy and, of course, would not have come as a surprise to Nedovyesov. The Kazakh, on the other hand, won most of his points through aggressive ground strokes, finding depth and power.</p>
<p>If that was how the players were lined up, then it is not difficult to see (at least retrospectively) who was going to falter first. If the Kazakh continued to reel off winners at the rate at which he was doing in the early part of the game, then it appeared there would be little Devvarman could do. But, it was a high risk strategy and when Nedovyesov’s consistency and hitting levels dropped, he was in trouble as Devvarman was happy to put everything back.</p>
<p><strong>Flawless serving</strong></p>
<p>To make things worse for the Kazakh, Devvarman would enjoy one of his best serving days of the tournament in the final, losing just ten points on serve all match. In the seventh game of the first set, it began to unravel for Nedovyesov.</p>
<p>Nedovyesov tried the drop shot for about the fifth time in the game but this time Devvarman was able to run it down and dispatch it for a winner to get a look in at 15-30. A forehand winner on the next point gave Devvarman his first break point of the match.</p>
<p>Nedovyesov seemed in control of the next point and just as he was presented with an open court, rushed his forehand and put it into the net. Devvarman consolidated with crisp serving, sending down three service winners to move 5-3 up.</p>
<p>Around this time, Nedovyesov’s ground strokes began to desert him and his challenge began to fall apart pretty quickly. It may have been injury or just tiredness — he has played several three-setters here in the lead up to the final — but Nedovyesov just could not string two shots together. He was broken once more as Devvarman took the first set 6-3.</p>
<p>The Indian second-seed did not get his foot off the pedal and ran up a 5-0 lead in the second as Nedovyesov lost eight games in a row. Nedovyesov finally snapped out of his funk in the sixth game, closing it out with an ace, but Devvarman was too far ahead by this point.</p>
<p>Just as the lights came flickering on at the RK Khanna stadium, Devvarman held serve to claim the title, winning the final point in characteristic fashion. Devvarman was scampering to keep the ball in play and was perhaps out of position, but Nedovyesov pulled his attempted winner long to put an end to his misery. The final had lasted under an hour.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991703&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/delhiwaveridersptim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991812" alt="With a 3-1 win in the shootouts over Punjab Warriors, Delhi Waveriders won the second edition of the Hockey India League (PTI)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/delhiwaveridersptim.jpg" /></a> With a 3-1 win in the shootouts over Punjab Warriors, Delhi Waveriders won the second edition of the Hockey India League (PTI)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Penalties aren&#8217;t usually seen as a desirable way of determing the winner of a big match. Luck seems to play too much of a role. Yet, it was quite appropriate that the winner of the 2014 edition of the Hockey India League was determined by shootouts. In an exhilarating match, where momentum swung one way and then another, it was a golden goal (and not shootouts) that would have been the unfair way to separate Delhi Waveriders and Punjab Warriors, locked 3-3 after regular time at Ranchi&#8217;s Astroturf Hockey Stadium.</span></p>
<p>The fact that the penalties were taken from the 25-yard line (colloquially known as the &#8216;running penalty’, where the striker has eight seconds to score) made the skill of both the striker and the &#8216;keeper decisive. That, and the fact that the two sides had the world&#8217;s two best goalkeepers — Dutchman Jaap Stockman for the Warriors and Germany&#8217;s Nicolas Jacobi for Waveriders — made the contest doubly just.</p>
<p>It was Jacobi who clinched the issue, by denying three attempts out of four as compared to a solitary save by Stockman. Jacobi stayed on his feet despite all of Simon Orchards&#8217; attempt to make him commit to a dive, then kicked Jamie Dwyer&#8217;s attempt wide. The German would then stretch his massive 6&#8217;4&#8221; frame to sweep the ball to safety before Satbir Singh could even get a shot away.</p>
<p>Stockman wasn&#8217;t as succesfull. Matt Gohdes, Simon Child and Stephen Edwards all managed to dodge, weave and then shoot past him. Edwards&#8217; attempt, a casual jink to the right followed by a simple pat in, was enough for a 3-1 win for the Waveriders. A year after they finished runners up in the inaugural edition of the HIL on the same ground, they had finished champions.</p>
<p>The match, however, could not have begun in a worse fashion. With seven Australian players and an Australian coach in Barry Dancer, Warriors were always going to play in a certain style. Waveriders&#8217; strategy, on the other hand, has typically been to defend well and attack on the counter. But the Delhi side hadn&#8217;t even got their backline organised when Warriors went one up. Just 73 seconds into the game, Mark Knowles had scored thanks to an accurate pass from Affan Yousuf. He had been unmarked in the circle and even Jacobi could do nothing about his shot from point blank range.</p>
<p>For a long enough period, it seemed the Warriors had their foot on Waveriders&#8217; throat as attack followed attack. Waveriders earned a penalty corner to break the momentum, but Lucas Rey, who had conceded the strike, made amends with a goalline save off Rupinder Pal&#8217;s strike. But even as Warriors seemed to have the upper hand, momentum swung the other way with a couple of goals in as many minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing level</strong></p>
<p>Waveriders drew level in the 33rd minute. Akashdeep Singh began the move with a steal from half line, then ran nearly the length of the enemy half and finished with a pass to Lloyd Norris-Jones. The South African, himself on full tilt, crashed home a reverse flick into the tiniest bit of the goal that Stockman had left unguarded. At the stroke of halftime, Delhi had another. It came through a PC, but while Rupinderpal&#8217;s hit was off, Sardar Singh found himself in place for the rebound. Now, even though the angle was a tight one, he sent the ball to the roof of the net.</p>
<p>Warriors would have to claw their way back to the lead, again. In the 44th minute, Gurmail Singh crossed hard from the right side of the 25-yard line and Shivendra Singh got the perfect deflection. When the situation repeated itself three minutes later, Delhi had midfielder Gurbaj Singh and defender Rupinder Pal to blame for leaving the two opposition players unmarked. Yousuf, in the centre of the D, punched home after a cross from Keiran Govers.</p>
<p>Four minutes later, Waveriders would draw level for the second time in the game. This time it was the Warriors defender Knowles who left a player unmarked. And Yuvraj Walmiki, after a accurate cross from the right flank, could take his time before smashing home the equaliser. Warriors had another chance to go in front but Sandeep Singh, who has 10 PC goals in the tournament, shot wide in the 52nd minute. The last few minutes of regulation time saw Warriors all over the Waveriders half. Attacks came from both flanks but Jacobi would deny them.</p>
<p>He ensured the match stayed locked until penalties. Once there, he would seal the game and the silverware.</p>
<p><strong>Ranchi Rhinos finish third</strong></p>
<p>The HIL final wasn&#8217;t the only game of the day to be decided by the shootout. Penalties were also needed in the third place match between defending champions Ranchi Rhinos and Uttar Pradesh Wizards. The Rhinos clinched the shootout 3-2 after the two teams were locked at 1-1 at regulation time. VR Raghunath scored off a PC strike in the 15th minute, while Manpreet Singh equalised in the 30th minute for Rhinos.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991701&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dalesteynreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991805" alt="South Africa's Dale Steyn celebrates the wicket of Australia's Michael Clarke (not pictured) during the fourth day of the second Test (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dalesteynreutersm.jpg" /></a> South Africa&#8217;s Dale Steyn celebrates the wicket of Australia&#8217;s Michael Clarke (not pictured) during the fourth day of the second Test (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Dale Steyn ripped the heart out of Australia’s batting in the late afternoon and part-time spinner Dean Elgar took the final wicket in the day’s last over in the early evening to give South Africa a series-leveling 231-run victory in the second test on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>Australia could have been moments from a draw if the forecasts of persistent rain through the final day on Monday are realised. A draw would have ensured it couldn’t lose the series.</p>
<p>The fourth day went past 6 p.m. local time and offered late drama after umpires gave South Africa the extra 30 minutes to seal a result. Chris Rogers was then run out by a direct hit from substitute fielder Alviro Petersen for 107 in the second last over after he looked like taking Australia to the final day, when the weather might have come to its rescue.</p>
<p>Elgar had last man Nathan Lyon lbw for a duck with two balls to go in the day after the umpires had ruled the fading light wasn’t good enough for Steyn to bowl. TV replays also suggested Lyon hit the ball and shouldn’t have been given out but Australia had no decision reviews left.</p>
<p><strong>Great response</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, Steyn removed the weather equation with 4-55 as Australia was bowled out for 216 in a little over two sessions facing a target of 448, giving top-ranked South Africa a big victory and revenge for its 281-run humbling in the first test.</p>
<p>“I don’t think many teams would have been able to respond like we did from that defeat,’’ South Africa captain Graeme Smith said.</p>
<p>Smith insisted he believed there would have still been enough time for South Africa to clinch victory on the last day, but it was a hectic finish to the test as Australia lost a stunning 10 wickets for just 90 runs, starting when David Warner was out for 66 to break an opening partnership of 126 with Rogers.</p>
<p>“We were outplayed with both bat and ball throughout this test match,’’ Australia captain Michael Clarke said.</p>
<p>The end came quickly on Sunday after Australia had started its second innings so positively with Warner and Rogers.</p>
<p>With Australia already toppling at 153-3, the momentum swung convincingly when Steyn removed Clarke and Steve Smith in successive deliveries and smashed over Brad Haddin’s middle stump in a three-over burst of pace and deadly reverse swing. When a fired-up Steyn blasted out Haddin’s middle peg for the second time in the match, he ended his trademark downward fist pumping celebration by pointing at the stump lying prone on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>‘Angry, very angry, extremely angry’</strong></p>
<p>“His anger goes from very angry to extremely angry,’’ Smith said of his bowling spearhead.<br />
Australia eventually collapsed from 126-0 to 216 all out, sending the series to a deciding test in Cape Town with the momentum now with South Africa. “It was only seven days ago we were playing fantastic cricket,’’ Clarke said. “I’m not too concerned, to be honest.’’</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: </strong>South Africa 423 &amp; 270/5 dec (H Amla 127*, Q de Kock 34; M Johnson 2/51, P Siddle 2/89 beat Australia 246 &amp; 216 all out (C Rogers 107, D Warner 66; D Steyn 4/55, V Philander 2/39) by 231 runs</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991698&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/vijayzolm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991808" alt="Vijay Zol will miss Monday’s play-off match against Sri Lanka (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/vijayzolm.jpg" /></a> Vijay Zol will miss Monday’s play-off match against Sri Lanka (File)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">India’s Under-19 captain Vijay Zol has been suspended for one match, while off-spinner Aamir Gani has been reprimanded after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup quarter-final match against England.</span></p>
<p>Zol was found to have breached Article 2.2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “using language or gesture(s) that is seriously obscene, seriously offensive or of a seriously insulting nature to another player, player support personnel, umpire, match referee or any other third person during an international match”.</p>
<p>While Gani was found to have breached Article 2.1.4 of the Code, which relates to “using language or a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting during an international match”.</p>
<p>Graeme La Brooy of the ICC Regional Referees Panel imposed the sanctions after both the players pleaded guilty to the offences and accepted the proposed sanctions. One suspension point in the code equates to a suspension from the next match in which the player is most likely to participate in. As such, Zol will miss Monday’s play-off match against Sri Lanka at ICC Academy 1.</p>
<p>The incident involving Zol happened in the 30th over when the captain caught England’s Ben Duckett at short mid-wicket off Kuldeep Yadav and then used seriously offensive language at the batsman at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>In a separate incident, Gani used obscene language after having England’s Ed Barnard caught by Sanju Samson in the 26th over. Both the incidents were captured on television. The charges were laid by on-field umpires Ranmore Martinesz and Chris Gaffaney, as well as third umpire Simon Fry.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991694&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">At Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue in Dhaka, they revel in traffic commotion. Vehicles move at snail’s pace and for the outsiders, it’s always a test of patience. The locals, however, don’t complain, for the traffic chaos signifies normalcy. During ferment, the buzz evaporates and life comes to a halt which was the case here just a few months ago.</span></p>
<p>There was a big question mark over Bangladesh hosting the Asia Cup but peace descended on the eastern part of Bengal just in time for the cricket season and the tournament was given the go-ahead by the Asian Cricket Council.</p>
<p>For India, however, the question marks don’t end with the staging of the event. <strong><a title="Injured Mahendra Singh Dhoni ruled out of Asia Cup; Virat Kohli to lead" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/injured-mahendra-singh-dhoni-ruled-out-of-asia-cup-virat-kohli-to-lead/" target="_blank">Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s eleventh hour withdrawal</a></strong>, owing to a side strain, has thrown his new age successor, <strong><a title="Asia Cup: Exciting for me to improve the record which is already good, says Virat Kohli" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/asia-cup-exciting-for-me-to-improve-the-record-which-is-already-good-says-virat-kohli/" target="_blank">Virat Kohli</a></strong>, in at the deep end. Not just as captain, but as the <strong><a title="With Dhoni’s exit, a change of the established order" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/with-dhonis-exit-a-change-of-the-established-order/" target="_blank">leader in the batting order</a> </strong>as well. After back-to-back series losses in South Africa and New Zealand, India’s every move on conducive pitches against fellow Asian giants will be under microscopic scrutiny.</p>
<p>Kohli’s winning percentage as India captain is better than his batting strike rate of 89.48 in One Day Internationals. So far, he has led eight times and won seven. Five of those wins, however, came against Zimbabwe during India’s tour of the southern African nation last year. The Asia Cup, however, which would be underway from Tuesday (India’s first match is on Wednesday), throws up a completely different challenge.</p>
<p>Both defending champions Pakistan and Sri Lanka, would be keen on having an upper hand over an Indian team that is low on confidence. India need Kohli to fire with the bat to help his unit get back to the winning ways. And then there’s the added responsibility of leading his troop.</p>
<p><strong>The spotlight</strong></p>
<p>On Sunday, at the Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in Mirpur, the Delhi lad looked rather tired at the team’s arrival press conference. He played down the captaincy issue, saying that he’s doing the job for “just one series” and is not unnecessarily putting himself under pressure.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s a big tournament, my first as a captain and I’m looking forward to it. I don’t think I have to do things differently. I don’t really look into something unless I am appointed which is the case right now in this tournament,” Kohli said. Some former cricketers, people who have been there and done that, believe that the make-shift role shouldn’t prevent him from asserting his authority.</p>
<p>“Virat should be quite good. In fact, it’s good for India that they have a new captain for the Asia Cup. Every individual offers something different and (after the recent losses) Kohli will bring in new ideas,” former India captain Ajit Wadekar said, speaking to The Indian Express. “Kohli is aggressive and leads from the front, and to be in charge of the team for the Asia Cup will help him groom properly for the future. Dhoni may not be there after the World Cup and Kohli is the only candidate to take over from him.”</p>
<p>But can Kohli be aggressive enough as he is not the regular captain? “Polly Umrigar and Ravi Shastri led just one Test each but led aggressively. Kohli’s job is relatively easy because deep down he knows that he will succeed Dhoni in the near future,” Wadekar added.</p>
<p><strong>Few apprehensions</strong></p>
<p>The big fear, however, is that, like on many occasions in the past, making the best batsman in the side as the team’s leader could have an adverse effect on his batting. Something that will not play well for India in this tournament, were it to happen again.</p>
<p>“Kohli is India’s best batsman and as we have seen in the past, even some big legends struggled with the extra burden. But Kohli is a very confident young man and a successful captaincy stint will help him earn the legendary status a few years down the line. The Asia Cup could be the beginning of a successful journey,” Wadekar observed.</p>
<p>The veteran, however, doesn’t think that time has come to appoint Kohli as a full-time captain. “Not yet. He must serve the apprenticeship period. Dhoni still is a very fine captain and I don’t believe he is getting bogged down by negativity. When your bowlers are not doing anything, you get frustrated. It happened to me at times as well. Frustration creates indecision.”<br />
Mohinder Amarnath, too, is looking forward to Kohli’s new role.</p>
<p>“His body language gives an impression that his captaincy would be pretty similar to his batting – proactive and authoritative. And I don’t think his batting would be affected. When you are playing for your country, you should be ready for everything. Kohli doesn’t seem to have a fear of failure. This is a very good opportunity for him and the strong character that he is, I expect him to embrace the challenge,” said Amarnath.</p>
<p>That challenge begins three days from now.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991687&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Four days after affirming its European credentials by toppling Manchester City, Barcelona slumped to a stinging 3-1 loss at Real Sociedad to relinquish the provisional Spanish league lead to Real Madrid on Saturday.</span></p>
<p>Gareth Bale scored a blistering long-range strike to help Madrid brush aside Elche 3-0 at home, and Barcelona was unable to match that with a win. Instead, it was overrun by Sociedad’s dynamic attack led by forwards Antoine Griezmann and Carlos Vela.</p>
<p>Athletic Bilbao strengthened its hold on fourth place in the Spanish league by winning 2-0 at Real Betis on Sunday after the bottom side had two players dismissed while Sevilla ended a six-match winless streak with a 1-0 win at Rayo Vallecano.</p>
<p>Barcelona’s defeat confirmed the change in course in the league title race over the past two months, leaving Madrid in command and waiting to see if Atletico can keep up when it visits Osasuna on Sunday. After starting the season with 13 wins and a draw, Barcelona has dropped points in four of its last seven games. Bilbao’s first victory in four rounds lifted it four points clear of Real Sociedad.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991590&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In tying down Wayne Rooney, Manchester United’s chief chaser of lost causes, David Moyes and the United hierarchy hope to send out a message. Following Juan Mata’s £37.1m arrival, Rooney’s £85m five-year contract was meant to show the Red Devils meant business.</p>
<p>Still, did binding a player, who some believed may already have peaked, make sense for a club that has been famous for discovering and promoting young players while shunting out those past their prime?</p>
<p>The current Manchester United team that David Moyes is moulding, has Rooney at its heart. His vision, work rate and leadership are something that Moyes would love to rub off and sprinkle on those around him. Since his old manager’s arrival, Rooney has shown traces of being the player he was once touted to be. If one were to judge his place in the current team, Rooney is as close to indispensable as any player in world football.</p>
<p>Even so, the numbers make the mind boggle. At £3,00,000 per week — reportedly £2,40,000 as a basic salary plus image rights and other commercial bonuses — Rooney is now the highest-paid player in English football. He has also been promised a shot at being captain, ostensibly after Vidic leaves at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Despite the numbers, United may just get lucky. For one, they would have found it tough to mine the transfer market and get someone of Rooney’s quality for that price. Also, having Rooney is better than facing Rooney, something Moyes will know well from his years at Everton.</p>
<p>Many have questioned if the United team have taken to their new manager. For Moyes to be his own man and step out of his predecessor’s gargantuan shadow, he had to be seen to make a statement. This deal is exactly that.<br />
With the objective of overhauling an ageing and underpowered squad, Moyes has got off to a decent start after the travails of the July transfer window. In Mata, Rooney, Januzaj, Van-Persie, Carrick and De Gea, United supporters will see some semblance of a spine. More work remains to be done though for the Moyes-Rooney axis to work.<br />

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Daniel Sturridge struck twice to keep Liverpool’s Premier League title hopes alive with a thrilling 4-3 win over Swansea City on Sunday.</span></p>
<p>The win lifted Liverpool back to within four points of leaders Chelsea while Newcastle United ended a three match-losing streak when Loic Remy scored a stoppage-time winner to seal a 1-0 win over Aston Villa.</p>
<p>Robert Snodgrass scored early in the second half to earn Norwich City a precious 1-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur and ease the pressure on under-fire manager Chris Hughton.</p>
<p>Sturridge became only the second player to score in eight successive Premier League matches when he grabbed a third-minute opener and Jordan Henderson put Liverpool in control before Jonjo Shelvey and Wilfried Bony drew Swansea level.</p>
<p>Sturridge, who matched former Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy’s feat, was on target again before the break, only for Bony to equalise once more from the penalty spot.</p>
<p>Henderson clinched the points for the hosts 16 minutes from time at Anfield, keeping them fourth with 56 points from 27 matches.<br />
Arsenal are second, one point behind Chelsea, with Manchester City a further two points back in third.</p>
<p>“A wonderful victory for us, Swansea played really well, especially when were 2-0 up to come back into the game,” Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told Sky Sports. “An outstanding result for us and again typified the character of this team.”</p>
<p>Newcastle, who had lost their past three matches and not scored in four, appeared to be on their way to another disappointing result before Remy, returning after a three-match suspension, struck with moments remaining at St James’s Park. The win lifted Newcastle to eighth with 40 points while Norwich’s 1-0 win moved them up to 14th, four points above the relegation zone.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991584&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/waynerooneyreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991981" alt="Rooney will become a club ambassador when his playing career ends (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/waynerooneyreutersm.jpg" /></a> Rooney will become a club ambassador when his playing career ends (Reuters)
<p>Less than a year after pushing to leave Manchester United, Wayne Rooney committed his long-term future to the struggling Premier League champion on Friday by signing a lucrative new contract through June 2019. The 28-year-old’s future at United has been mired in uncertainty since Chelsea tried to sign him last year, and he had only 18 months remaining on his current deal.</p>
<p>But Rooney now looks set to end his playing career at the club he has been at since 2004 after signing a new contract, reportedly worth up to 300,000 pounds ($501,000) a week. The deal makes Rooney the league&#8217;s top earner, and softens the blow of potentially not playing in Europe. In the first season since David Moyes replaced Alex Ferguson, United is seventh in the league with 12 matches remaining.</p>
<p><strong>Club ambassador</strong></p>
<p>AS part of the new contract, Rooney will become a club ambassador when his playing career ends. And already, he is central to the club&#8217;s global marketing operation, as one of the team&#8217;s most high-profile players. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been here since I was 18 and this contract will take me through to my 30s, which is almost my entire professional career,&#8221; Rooney said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991136&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HE may not feature in Team India’s scheme of things and the selectors may virtually shut the doors on him, but Sandeep Singh always serves up a reminder of his abilities. At least from penalty corners. On Saturday, he was at it again.</p>
<p>The India discard scored twice from penalty corners to end defending champions Ranchi Rhinos dreams of winning back-to-back titles and guide Punjab Warriors to their maiden final. Warriors beat Rhinos 3-2 in a closely-contested semifinal in front of a packed crowd. Sandeep scored in the 24th and 52nd minute to take his tournament tally to 11. He was also the highest scorer last season. Jake Whetton scored the third goal for Punjab while Ashley Jackson and Floris Evers were on target for the home team.</p>
<p>This was Punjab’s 10th win on the trot this season. However, momentum alone won’t assure them of a win in Sunday’s final, where they will meet Delhi Waveriders.</p>
<p>If Sandeep was the star in Punjab’s close win, another player who is aiming to earn a permanent spot in the Indian team did the star turn for Delhi Waveriders against Uttar Pradesh Wizards in the first semifinals. Yuvraj Walmiki scored the winning goal for Delhi in their 1-0 victory over Uttar Pradesh. This will be Delhi’s second consecutive appearance in the final, having finished as runners-up to Ranchi last season.</p>
<p><strong>Walmiki winner</strong></p>
<p>Walmiki scored a field goal in the 15th minute in front a packed 6,000 capacity stadium to dash Uttar Pradesh Wizards’ title hopes. While the Waveriders had the better share of ball possession in the first half, the UP side dominated the proceedings in the second half.</p>
<p>The only difference between the two sides in the evenly-matched contest was that the Waveriders made use of an early chance, whereas the Wizards were guilty of wasting numerous goal-scoring opportunities that came their way.</p>
<p>Wizards skipper VR Raghunath had a bad day in office as he failed to convert any of the three penalty corners his side earned in the match. The Waveriders got the first real scoring opportunity in the 12th minute but wasted it as Rupinderpal Singh failed to capitalise on his side’s first penalty corner.</p>
<p>The Delhi outfit, however, took the lead soon through a field strike from Walimiki. An opportunist Walimiki found himself at the right place at the right time to deflect in from close range a Justin Reid-Ross’ pass.</p>
<p>Wizards got a chance to draw level in the second quarter when they earned their first penalty corner but skipper Raghunath’s flick went wide after getting a deflection from the sticks of an onrushing Rupinder.</p>
<p>The Uttar Pradesh side needed a goal in the second half to keep their hopes alive and expectedly went for the offensive from the start. Their efforts resulted in two penalty corners in the third quarter but as has been the story for the Wizards in the match, Raghunath wasted both the opportunities.</p>
<p>Wizards kept up the pressure but Rupinder was solid as a rock, perhaps playing his best game this season. He single-handedly kept them at bay. Waveriders, on the other hand, created a few chances on the counter-attack but their forward line failed to capitalise.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991134&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somdev Devvarman made the final of the USD 100,000 Delhi Challenger on the back of an unexpected straight-set win over Russian Evgeny Donsky, ranked 114th in the world.</p>
<p>Devvarman had gone down to Donsky during the Kolkata Challenger last week, so it was interesting to see if the Indian would come up with a different approach on the slower center court of the RK Khanna tennis stadium. Devvarman had a rather up-and-down first round game against compatriot Karunuday Singh, but since then, had appeared rather solid. Still, he slipped to a 3-0 deficit in the first set of the semifinal, raising spectres of another defeat at the hand of the Russian.</p>
<p>Devvarman though, found his groove soon after. The pace of the court was to his liking and he soon got his familiar retrieval style of play in. The Indian got as many balls as he could into play, challenging Donskoy to hit a clean winner, or to maintain a level of domination in the rally with a sufficiently potent hit. At the Challenger level, such levels of domination are difficult to maintain and as soon as Donskoy hit a ball that was either long (in which case the point would end instantly) or too short, Devvarman capitalised with an angled winner. On the back of this rebuttal, Devvarman ran up four games in a row, to go 4-3 up in the first set.</p>
<p>Devvarman concentrated on moving Donskoy about, making him hit one more  shot than he would have liked to, a strategy that pays big dividents at the Challenger level. Donskoy often hit his purpoted winner into the net or wide under not too much pressure as Devvarman did not allow the Russian the joy of hitting too many outright winners. Though Donskoy struck a clean forehand, Devvarman often managed to cling on, and it was the Russian who erred first. Devvarman would go on to win 12 of the next 15 games, though both participants could not really exert too much influence on their serves.</p>
<p>Devvarman claimed the first set 6-4 and broke Donskoy in the very first game of the next. Donskoy broke him in the next and the two semifinalists held serve as the second set was on an even keel at 2-2. Again, Devvarman stepped up, winning four games in a row, mainly because he did not commit too many unforced errors. The match was Somdev&#8217;s, as Donskoy committed too many unforced errors, as he had done through the match.</p>
<p>Myneni, Singh triumph</p>
<p>Saket Myneni and Sanam Singh picked up their second successive Challenger title as they beat the Ratiwatana twins 7-6(5), 6-4 in the doubles final. Myneni and Singh had also triumphed in the Kolkata Challenger. The former is likely to break into the top 200 with the result in Chennai.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991130&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Opener Kusal Perera hit his maiden century as Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh by six wickets to sweep the one-day series 3-0 on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka scored 246/4 in reply to Bangladesh&#8217;s 240-8 with captain Angelo Mathews smashing a six to complete the third ODI victory at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Perera made 106 and added 138 runs with Dinesh Chandimal, who scored 64.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka won the toss and made Bangladesh bat. Mominul Haque hit a run-a-ball 60. Seamer Dhammika Prasad claimed three wickets in his first match of the series as new-look Sri Lanka restricted Bangladesh in the third and final one-day international.</p>
<p>New-ball partner Suranga Lakmal finished with two for 24 in 10 overs after Sri Lanka, enjoying an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, won the toss and elected to field at the Sher-e-Bangla stadium.</p>
<p>Mominul Haque top-scored with a run-a-ball 60, while valuable contributions from Nasir Hossain (38), Naeem Islam (32) and skipper Mushfiqur Rahim (30) gave the hosts their highest score in the series.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka took the field without either of their three veterans, Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara and Tillakaratne Dilshan, for the first time in a one-dayer since 2000.</p>
<p>Jayawardene and Dilshan were nursing injuries, while Sangakkara was rested ahead of the five-nation Asia Cup which opens in Bangladesh on Tuesday. The hosts missed premier all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, who was handed a three-match ban for a lewd on-camera gesture during the second one-dayer on Thursday. Sri Lanka won both the preceding Test and Twenty20 series.</p>
<p>Brief scores: Sri Lanka 246/4 in 47.3 overs (K Perera 106, D Chandimal 64, Mahmudullah 2/38) bt Bangladesh 240/8 in 50 overs (M Haque 60, N Hossain 38; D Prasad 3/49, S Lakmal 2/24)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991124&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Yuki Bhambri will take a few days’ break after his early exit in the Delhi Challenger and then hit the hard court swing in the US. He speaks about the changes he has brought to his game, how far he hopes to make it in tennis and the emerging rivalry among India’s singles players.</em><br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Have you made a deliberate effort to work on the physical side of your tennis?</strong><br />
The game has change so much, especially physically. The courts have slowed down and you have to run around a lot more. The bodies of Europeans, Americans and Australians develop quicker. My tennis is up there with the standards of a top-50, top-100 player and physically to get there, I need to put in a lot of effort.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Over the last year, what aspects of your game have changed and what else needs to improve?</strong><br />
I needed to improve my backhand. It was a steady shot but I wanted to hit more winners, which I am able to do now. Playing doubles has helped too — the ability to volley well has helped me with the confidence of going to the net during crucial points. I can get more accurate on ground strokes and improve the speed of my serve.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How long does it take for improvements to kick in?</strong><br />
It takes time. There is a huge difference a year makes, from when I was Ramkumar’s age and where I am now. One has to realise it is not a sprint, it is a marathon. You are not playing one match or tournament. You are playing a season, for the next ten years or so. You are not going to change the way you hit your forehand or change the grip on your volleys. It might just be hitting an extra slice on the ball or hitting it a little bit closer to the line. In matches the difference is just a point or two.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How far do you see yourself go?</strong><br />
Success is measured in Grand Slams and if that is the case, then Ferrer and Berdych have had mediocre careers but they have actually been fantastic. For me, just competing at the Grand Slams, being in the second week, the third-fourth rounds are going to be as good as winning a Slam. It is going to take a long time and big effort. The goal is to break into the top 100 to play the Slams and the bigger tournaments.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>You’ve not had good luck with injuries. Do you feel you are finally hitting a stretch where you can push yourself without fear of breakdown?</strong><br />
My main problem has been the ankle, which has happened over and over again. It is something that you cannot predict. Before Chennai I was walking by the side of the road and tripped over and fell. I came to the Chennai Open with a huge tape on my ankle. I am a lot careful now. I have also learnt different ways to deal with it. In the Australian Open, I saw a lot of players do rehab work on their knees and ankles even though they hadn’t hurt themselves. That is something that I have implemented. I feel if I can play a whole year, I will do well. I’ve always had good results every time I’ve been injury free.</p>
<p><strong>Do Davis Cup ties help in player development? After all, most of the things you work on, you do by yourself on the tour.</strong><br />
Playing in a team is fun. You are out here playing by yourself, for yourself, for 30 weeks a year. Davis Cup gives you the chance to play for the country, together, instead of playing each other. In terms of development, not really. But for me it (Davis Cup) gives me a chance to play three out of five sets, which I don’t do on a regular basis. I can assess how far I have come physically and how much I can push myself.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a minor under-current of rivalry between you, Somdev and Ramkumar?</strong><br />
The media enjoys it a bit more than the three of us. There is still a big gap between me and Ramkumar, and me and Somdev. We will have to be a lot more consistent — the rest of us, Ramkumar, Saket (Myneni) and Sanam (Singh) — to reach Somdev’s level.<br />
— Raakesh Natraj</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991119&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dhoniteamm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991120" alt="So while Dhoni, the captain, might not be missed much, the loss of Dhoni, the batsman, will surely pinch India more. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dhoniteamm.jpg" /></a> So while Dhoni, the captain, might not be missed much, the loss of Dhoni, the batsman, will surely pinch India more. (Reuters)
<p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s absence from the Asia Cup is a double-blow for the Indian team. His leadership has been questioned after a string of away losses, both in the longer and shorter versions. But in the sub-continent, skipper Dhoni enjoys a healthy record. His replacement, the talented Virat Kohli, isn&#8217;t expected to be weighed down by the extra-responsibility because of the familiar conditions and short duration of this not-too-important tournament.</p>
<p>So while Dhoni, the captain, might not be missed much, the loss of Dhoni, the batsman, will surely pinch India more. Replacing Dhoni in the playing XI will be Dinesh Karthik. He is a safe option behind the stumps but it will be interesting to see where he bats in the new-look Indian batting line-up. If the team management are not in a mood to tweak the batting order, Karthik could occupy the vacant No.6. slot behind Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Ambati Rayudu.</p>
<p>Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar doesn&#8217;t want the team management to take a knee-jerk reaction to Dhoni&#8217;s absence. &#8220;Dhoni is priceless in limited-overs format, both with his batting and captaincy. But Karthik is a very good replacement. He&#8217;s a very smart cricketer who can change his game as per situation. And he can hit sixes as well. He has been given an opportunity and I believe he will perform,&#8221; Vengsarkar said.</p>
<p>Former chief selector Kiran More said that a player of Dhoni&#8217;s caliber would certainly leave a void but Karthik was, at least, a like-for-like replacement. &#8220;Yes, Dhoni will be missed because he&#8217;s a special player in the shorter format. But Karthik&#8217;s strike rate (73.64) suggests he, too, can score quickly. He can bat in the final overs as well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Statistics tell a very different story. Karthik has so far played 23 ODI, of which, he has opened in eight games at an average of 40. Rest of the times he has batted at No.7 and his average is an absymal 19. Besides, during his stunning show for Mumbai Indian in the last Indian Premier League, he had opened the innings. So wouldn&#8217;t Karthik be more suited up the order?</p>
<p>The team would most certainly not disturb a set batting order for a player who might not even be in the team once Dhoni is fit again. Still, Karthik does give the team more options. In case the wicket-keeper bats up the order, Rohit Sharma could move into the No.6 slot. Shamra&#8217;s IPL hitting in the final overs proves this point, but dropping him down the order will see the team sacrifice a set and successful opening combination.</p>
<p>The only other option is to make Ajinkya Rahane open, which is not the preferred alternative.</p>
<p>More rules out Rahane&#8217;s promotion. &#8220;He has a decent strike rate but his game is meant for the top order. Don&#8217;t think he can up the ante when the asking rate hovers around 12-15. He will go to the Asia Cup under pressure. He hasn&#8217;t scored runs in the last few ODIs and that can happen. The Asia Cup gives him the opportunity to get back to form.  On his day he can even send the ball flying to all part of the ground. But he certainly doesn&#8217;t give the kind of stability that Dhoni provides down the order,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>This means India will have to tweak their batting up. The ODI templates needs power-hitters at No. 5 and 6 to make the second power-play count and India now have only one of that type in Ravindra Jadeja.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991111&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Yuki, Somdev and, now, Ramkumar, have ensured that India have more options on the first day of the Davis Cup, and the country’s </em><em>singles players are at home on hard courts. <strong>Raakesh Natraj</strong> says Indian tennis is no longer doubles-centric or grass-obsessed.</em></p>
<p>You immediately notice that Yuki Bhambri has bulked up recently. You find this reassuring in the same irrational way that the sight of Michael Carrick sporting a Pirlo-esque beard becalms a Manchester United fan seconds after being confronted with the line up of the side and the composition of the back four on television.</p>
<p>Even as you realise that a player’s ability to generate power — long acknowledged to be aspects that Yuki would have to incorporate in his game to make the next step — is only marginally, if at all, dependent on sheer physical size, the change, nonetheless, reassures you.</p>
<p>“If that was the case, then you would have wrestlers winning tournaments. It is a balance of everything. I can run for five hours or hit a tennis ball at 200 kilometers an hour but if I do not know what to do on a 30-all point, it makes no sense having that strength or speed. In today’s sport, the strength part is not about hitting the ball harder but being able to last out there,” he says, later.</p>
<p>But in the first few moments, an equation forms in your head: a beefed up Yuki equals a fitter, stronger Yuki. This optimism may be illogical, but it is not extravagant. You do not expect Yuki 2.0 to go collect a Grand Slam or two right after he towels off at the gym. Even he doesn’t expect to. (See Box) But you wonder if an improved Yuki would not go someway in putting back together something that is very nearly broken.</p>
<p><strong>Tennis, a team sport</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, Indian tennis’ best moments on the international stage have, invariably, come in the Davis Cup. Despite quality singles players trickling in once in a generation, India have been plucky over-achievers in the Cup, having thrice made the final. The last of these final appearances, however, came in 1987, when India had arguably its most rounded Cup side — Ramesh Krishnan and Vijay Amirtraj were the first-choice singles players while Anand Amirtraj partnered his brother in the doubles rubbers.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the drought in singles talent since the 90s (making a brief exception for the time when Leander Paes rose up to No. 78 in the rankings before giving up singles altogether), India’s performances in the Cup have also tapered off. The side is currently ranked 26th in the ITF list, behind Romania, Israel and Ecuador, and had to stave off Indonesia in a Asia/Oceania Group 1 relegation play-off last year.</p>
<p>In so far as the Davis Cup still retains a certain level of significance, the last few months have provided Indian hopes in the international event some buoyancy. Since his return from an ankle injury in August-September last year, 21-year-old Yuki has steadily moved up the singles ranking on the back of a good run of form.</p>
<p>He made the quarterfinal of the ATP 250 Chennai Open, beating the 16th- and 64th-ranked players in the world along the way, and won the Challenger in Chennai last week, beating India’s top singles player Somdev Devvarman in the semifinal. The ATP’s ranking cycle is annual, meaning that Yuki has no points to defend until August and there is a good chance he will be able to push on from his current high of 143 to break into the top-100 soon.</p>
<p>“I have this sort of gap now (until August) where I can play freely, enjoy, take a few risks, play bigger tournaments and hopefully pick up points. It (top 100) is definitely possible, but it is not going to be easy,” says Yuki.</p>
<p>If indeed it does happen, India, in Somdev (ranked 96 currently, but could improve because of his run at the Delhi Challenger) and Yuki, could have two players in ATP’s top-100 list for the first time in a really long while.</p>
<p>“We have recently struggled to put up two singles players (in the Davis Cup team). There has been Somdev and we have struggled to find a good second player. But Yuki has upped his game this year and the confidence has come with the results. We may not have two great singles players, but soon we will have two solid players, who, on a given day, can upset a higher-ranked player,” says Zeeshan Ali, the coach of the Indian Davis Cup side.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome addition</strong></p>
<p>The emergence of 19-year-old Ramkumar Ramanathan, who beat Somdev at the Chennai Open and has moved up to 407 in the world in little time, has Zeeshan excited too. “Ramkumar is a huge talent. He definitely has the potential to be in the top 100. He has a big serve and a good physique too,” he says.</p>
<p>In a way, both of India’s promising singles players have benefited from being exposed to the Western circuits early in their career. Ramkumar has trained at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona since he was 17 and Yuki was a part of the IMG Bollettieri academy in Florida for a few years.</p>
<p>The exposure, the availability and affordability of support staff (Yuki has a trainer accompanying him on tour while Ramkumar has just begun his association with a personal coach while on the circuit), and the homogenisation of surfaces and equipment, has helped more-and-more Indian players stay within touching distance of the international competition. But ironically, these developments have also, over time, blunted whatever edge India held in Davis Cup ties.</p>
<p>Hard court tournaments dominate the international calender and historically, India, with its fairly robust tradition of lawn tennis, had in its ranks several players who were brought up on grass courts. Visiting teams, who would otherwise very rarely visit India, had to contend with an unfamiliar country, playing surface and even equipment. All that has, of course, changed now.</p>
<p>“We have had a good Davis Cup record (in the past) but part of that advantage was because the home matches were played on grass courts. Now it is played on the hard courts and people who visit are comfortable playing on them,” says Ramesh Krishnan.</p>
<p>“The only advantage we have now is the crowd. In 1987, when we made the final, leading up to Australia in the semifinal, we played all our games at home. Half the battle was won when we announced we would be playing on grass,” says Zeeshan. “Now, it is the same hard courts and even the same ball. Earlier, the balls we used in home ties were made in India. Even that was unfamiliar to the visiting side. Now, we are in Asia Zone I and a lot of the Asian players are used to playing in India. They know the conditions and the players. There are no surprises left.”</p>
<p>When the world is flat, there is no edge to be had, except perhaps in quality. If Somdev doesn’t slide away in the near future (he is 29 now), and if Yuki and Ramkumar keep their promise, India might yet get its bite back, as the Davis Cup underdog.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991114&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/englandm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991109" alt="England beat India by three wickets to book their place in the semifinals of the U-19 World Cup.

(2014 © IDI/Getty Images)
<p>Defending champions India crashed out of the Under-19 World Cup after suffering a three-wicket defeat at the hands of a disciplined England side in the quarterfinals. Batting first, India managed 221 for eight, and then saw England chase down the target with five balls to spare at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.</p>
<p>On conditions favourable to seamers due to overcast conditions, Deepak Hooda (68) and Sarfaraz Khan&#8217;s 46-ball 52 helped India post a decent total on a slowish track.</p>
<p>But England rode on Ben  Duckett&#8217;s 64-ball 61 and Joe Clarke&#8217;s 42 off 45 balls to enter the last-four stage. Needing four off the last over, Rob Sayer slashed left-arm seamer Chama Milind over covers to complete the job, leaving his teammates jubilant.</p>
<p>However, it was the penultimate over bowled by offie Hooda, which cost India dear as he conceded 11 runs to bring the equation down to a gettable four off six balls from 15 runs in two overs.</p>
<p><strong>Fisher, the difference</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, seamer Matthew Fisher was the most successful bowler for England, picking up three wickets for 55 runs, his early blows giving his team the initial advantage.</p>
<p>Left-arm chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav, India&#8217;s most impressive bowler in the event, took as many wickets but, on this day, he ended up being on the losing side.</p>
<p>The seventh-wicket stand of 51 runs between Clarke and Rob Jones (28 not out) proved to be crucial for England. Jones then added 23 runs with Sayer (10) to help their side cross the line. Opting to bat first, India were off to a disastrous start losing four wickets with just 24 runs on the board, including last match&#8217;s top-scorer Sanju Samson.</p>
<p>Deepak Hooda tried to stabilise the innings and played carefully along with skipper Vijay Zol, to keep the team in the hunt for a good score.</p>
<p>Brief scores: India U19 221/8 in 50 overs (Deepak Hooda 68, Sarfraz Khan 52; Mathew Fisher 3/55) lost to England U19 222/7 in 49.1 overs (Ben Duckett 61, Joe Clarke 42; Kuldeep Yadav 3/46)</p>
<p><strong>Second quarterfinal</strong></p>
<p>Brief scores: Pakistan U19 279/9 in 50 overs (Sami Aslam 95, Imam-ul-Haq 82; Binura Fernando 4/56) bt Sri Lanka U19 158 in 42.3 overs (Sadeera Samarawickrama 51, Priyamal Perera 68; Zia-ul-Haq 2/36, Kamran Ghulam 2/19)</p>
<p><strong>Ninth-place playoff, quarters:</strong></p>
<p>Brief scores: Canada U19 75 in 27.1 overs (Keenan Tinto 16; Mustafizur Rahman 3/11, Mehdey Hasan 2/11) lost to Bangladesh U19 76/1 in 13.5 overs (Shadam Islam 35*; Armaan Kapoor 1/2)</p>
<p>Brief scores:Namibia U19 194/8 in 50 overs (Xander Pitchers 78, Loftie-Eaton 45; Patrick Mambo 4/31) lost to Zimbabwe U19 197/4 in 45.1 overs (Ryan Burl 55*, Malcolm Lake 39*; Marius Delport 2/23)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991099&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/amlam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991097" alt="Hashim Amla was hit by Mitchell Johnson on the helmet once again, but displayed positive intent to take SA to a position of strength in the second Test. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/amlam.jpg" /></a> Hashim Amla was hit by Mitchell Johnson on the helmet once again, but displayed positive intent to take SA to a position of strength in the second Test. (AP)
<p>Hashim Amla&#8217;s blistering stroke-play and Morne Morkel&#8217;s fearsome bowling put South Africa in control of the second Test against Australia as they closed the third day on 192 for four on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Proteas led by 369 runs with six second-innings wickets remaining and two days to go on a ground where the highest score chased down for victory was 271 by Australia in 1997.</p>
<p>Amla will resume on 93 not out with 21-year-old debutant Quinton de Kock on nine.</p>
<p>Amla&#8217;s positive stroke-play against all the Australian bowlers helped South Africa score at more than four runs an over and accelerated the game forward after a slow first two days.</p>
<p>Australia did make inroads into the top order, Graeme Smith (14) failing again after being bowled by Mitchell Johnson off the inside edge. Johnson also accounted for AB De Villiers (29).</p>
<p>Peter Siddle weighed in with two wickets, Dean Elgar (16) and Faf du Plessis (24), both caught behind by Brad Haddin.<br />
Fast bowler Morkel proved the catalyst for a sizeable South African lead as his fiery bowling helped restrict Australia to 246 in their first innings.</p>
<p>Having resumed on 112 for four, Australia battled to contain a rampant Morkel, who landed a number of sickening body blows to the body, including one into the side of the helmet of Johnson.</p>
<p>Morkel claimed three wickets in the innings, but his two spells of fearsome shot-pitched deliveries had the Australian hopping around the crease.</p>
<p>David Warner was the top scorer for the tourists with 70, but as he looked to score at the opposite end to Morkel he edged Philander to Smith at first slip.</p>
<p>Steve Smith made 49 before he was controversially given out on review by TV umpire Aleem Dar, caught by De Villiers off Morkel. There seemed little evidence to overturn the not verdict from on-field umpire Richard Illingworth.</p>
<p>Johnson made a brisk 27 but his blow to the head appeared to unsettle him and shortly afterwards he played all around a delivery from spinner JP Duminy and was bowled.</p>
<p>Ryan Harris (26) and Siddle (11 not out) put on 37 for the final wicket before the former edged Morkel to Du Plessis at second slip.</p>
<p>Australia won the first test of the three-match series by 281 runs in Pretoria.</p>
<p><strong>BRIEF SCORES:</strong> South Africa 423 and 192 for 4 (Amla 93*, de Kock 9*) lead Australia 246 (Warner 70, Smith 49, Morkel 3-63) by 369 runs</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991093&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/terry.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1991013" alt="Terry" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/terry.jpg" /></a> Chelsea&#8217;s Frank Lampard, left, embraces his captain John Terry, after scoring against Everton.
<p>Chelsea scrambled a stoppage-time winner to snatch a 1-0 victory over Everton on Saturday, showing their Premier League title mettle by claiming three points when they looked on course to suffer another damaging blow.</p>
<p>After drawing their last league game against West Bromwich Albion and suffering a chastening FA Cup defeat to rivals Manchester City, Jose Mourinho&#8217;s side were looking for a morale-boosting return to form.</p>
<p>Yet they looked sluggish for most of the match and after finally sparking into life they came up against a stubborn Everton rearguard, which only crumbled deep into added time.</p>
<p>Chelsea won a free kick wide on the left which Frank Lampard whipped into the penalty area and Everton keeper Tim Howard deflected it into his own net with John Terry sliding in to challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted with the win and the three points. We made it difficult but they are a very good side and are playing well under (manager Roberto) Martinez. It was a tough game today,&#8221; Terry told BT Sport.</p>
<p>&#8220;We recently dropped points to West Brom so it was important to get the points.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaders Chelsea moved to 60 points from 27 games, four clear of second-placed Arsenal who face Sunderland at home later on Saturday.</p>
<p>Everton stayed sixth with 45 points from 26, eight adrift of Liverpool in fourth.</p>
<p>With Chelsea having never lost a home league match under Jose Mourinho and Everton without a win at Stamford Bridge in 20 years, it came as a surprise to see Martinez&#8217;s men make all the running in the first half.</p>
<p>With Lampard returning to centre midfield in place of the energetic Ramires, Chelsea looked flat, their passes lacked zip, and movement in attack was limited and uninventive.</p>
<p>The visitors dominated the opening 45 minutes with Leon Osman forcing a fine finger-tip save from Petr Cech, Phil Jagielka glancing a header wide when unmarked and Kevin Mirallas having one shot blocked by Gary Cahill before snatching at another.</p>
<p>At the other end, Everton&#8217;s Howard was called into action only once to keep out a Samuel Eto&#8217;o shot with his legs.</p>
<p>Predictably, Chelsea changed things up at the break and Ramires was prematurely summoned from the bench to replace a tired-looking Oscar.</p>
<p>It had an immediate impact on the flow of the game with Lampard making a trademark run into the box before shooting low at Howard&#8217;s legs while the Everton keeper pulled off a stunning double save to deny first Hazard and then Ivanovic.</p>
<p>The pressure on the Everton goal built as the game wore on but Chelsea&#8217;s attacking waves broke down at the final hurdle until the third minute of stoppage time.</p>
<p>The feeling of injustice was heightened for Everton as it looked like Ramires had gone down easily under a challenge from Jagielka.<br />
&#8220;It was one of those situations where players were trying to buy too many free kicks,&#8221; Martinez said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need a strong referee&#8230; The second half is a very, very tough game for referee.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see they are trying to get a dead ball situation because they couldn&#8217;t get any joy from open play.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see the reaction and way the way he loses his footing, it&#8217;s not because of contact, he is looking for the free kick.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1991011&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The credibility of figure skating&#8217;s judging system was firmly under the microscope on Friday as experts tried to fathom exactly what Adelina Sotnikova had brought to the ice that enabled her to dethrone South Korean Kim Yuna as Olympic champion.</p>
<p>While the hosts of the Sochi Games rejoiced in hailing the teenager who had finally ended the motherland&#8217;s long search for a women&#8217;s champion, there was confusion, bewilderment and outrage outside Russia about a result that seemed steeped in bias. “How the hell were Yuna and Sotnikova so close in the components, I just don&#8217;t get it?” exclaimed Canadian great Kurt Browning. “Yuna Kim outskated her, full stop. I&#8217;m shocked. What, suddenly, she just became a better skater overnight?.”</p>
<p>If a four-times world champion could not work out how or why Sotnikova managed a major upset, neither could anyone else. What was even more incomprehensible was how did Sotnikova smash her own personal best by more than 18 points in just a month? Her mark of 149.95 was just 0.11 of a point shy of Kim&#8217;s world record  score of 150.06 &#8211; which she earned for a blinding performance at the 2010 Olympics. In layman&#8217;s terms, Sotnikova&#8217;s performance was the equivalent of a little-known sprinter improving his best time from 10.5 seconds to 9.6 in just four weeks to beat Usain Bolt over 100 metres.</p>
<p>To compound matters, Sotnikova was the only one of the leading trio whose free programme contained an obvious mistake — a two-footed landing from a double loop — but as far as the nine-member judging panel were concerned, she was superior to the more graceful Kim and bronze medallist Carolina Kostner.</p>
<p>While Sotnikova&#8217;s camp were eager to point out that she performed one more triple than Kim, hence the 5.76 point margin, that did not explain why the Russia was 7.34 points ahead of Kostner who also performed seven clean triples.</p>
<p><strong>Scrutiny on judges</strong></p>
<p>Within seconds of the decision being announced on Thursday, Twitter went into overdrive with people divided over who should have won while loyalties and past records of those on the nine-member judging panel were scrutinised.</p>
<p>One judge was identified as having served a one-year suspension for trying to fix an event at the 1998 Olympics, while another, Alla Shekhovtseva, is the wife of the general director of the Russian figure skating federation. Russian dynamo Julia Lipnitskaya&#8217;s coach Eteri Tutberidze was quick to justify Shekhovtseva&#8217;s presence on the panel. “Alla Shekhovtseva has been an international judge for many years and there has never been any allegations,” Tutberidze said.</p>
<p>The accumulative scoring system that was introduced post 2002 Olympics as a replacement for the 6.0 system, that was open to corruption and vote swapping, was supposed have made things more transparent.But it is a scoring system that even the skaters struggle to understand and to make matters worse, the judges are able to hide behind a cloak of anonymity as no one knows which score was given by which official.</p>
<p>With Russia united in the belief that Sotnikova won the gold fair and square, with the teenager even declaring she was relieved to have “skated cleanly”, it seemed as if nothing put a dampener on the celebrations. “Maybe there is speculation overseas (that Adelina was not the deserving winner) but we don&#8217;t feel it here,” said Russian team&#8217;s choreographer Peter Tchernyshev, who represented the United States at the 2002 Olympics.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re very pleased with the result and we were following the rules &#8230; and we won this game.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990551&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[After CL losses last week, Arsenal and City face easier challenges in EPL this weekend <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990546&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Having been brought down to earth by Bayern Munich in the Champions League, Arsenal doesn&#8217;t have time to lick its wounds as Arsene Wenger&#8217;s team prepares for a tricky English Premier League match against relegation-threatened Sunderland on Saturday.</p>
<p>Manchester City also saw the limits of its European ambitions with a 2-0 home loss to Barcelona and is expected to bounce back at home against Stoke. Third-place City is unbeaten in its last nine games against Stoke in all competitions. Leading Arsenal by one point at the top of the standings, Chelsea hosts Everton.</p>
<p><strong>Ozil worries</strong></p>
<p>Germany midfielder Mesut Ozil had an immediate impact when he became Arsenal&#8217;s most expensive player last summer. Arguably the best passer in European football, Ozil got off to a strong start in London, delighting the Emirates crowd with displays of sheer class. But his form over the past three months has been disappointing and he reached his nadir on Wednesday, missing a spot kick with a feeble shot as Arsenal was crushed 2-0 at home by Bayern. After his missed penalty, Ozil was constantly overrun. “He was affected by (the penalty),&#8221; Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger said. “He wanted to do so well that it affected him. You could see even five or 10 minutes later on the pitch he still was shaking his head. It had a huge impact on his performance.” Ozil is a world-class player. But at the moment, he looks out of his depth, bereft of an ounce of self-belief.</p>
<p><strong>Vidic set for move</strong></p>
<p>Since joining the club at the start of 2006, Nemanja Vidic has been a key element of Manchester United&#8217;s triumphs, winning the Premier League five times as well as the Champions League. With United&#8217;s defense too often exposed this season, manager David Moyes has plans to rebuild his back four and Vidic will leave at the end of the season when his contract expires. His next stop is likely to be Italy. Inter Milan president Erick Thohir confirmed on Thursday the Serie A club is very close to completing a deal for the 32-year-old Serb. “Vidic? I can&#8217;t say anything even if the deal is 90 percent done,” Thohir said.</p>
<p><strong>Mourinho mind games</strong></p>
<p>Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, always keen on playing mind games, has managed to anger both Arsenal and Barcelona in the space of a week. After labelling his old foe Wenger a “specialist in failure,” Mourinho&#8217;s team lost to Wenger&#8217;s. Mourinho also said Barcelona was the “worst in many, many years,” then Barcelona beat Manchester City 2-0. Barca midfielder Cesc Fabregas asked the Portuguese coach to mind his own business: “He should talk about Chelsea and their tie. I don&#8217;t think he should talk about anything else. It is not his business. Some people want us to fail all the time, some people have been talking a bit too much, for a few days they will have to shut up.” Chelsea faces Everton, which needs a result at Stamford Bridge after being cut adrift eight points behind Liverpool in the race for the fourth Champions League place.</p>
<p>While Mourinho has played down the Blues&#8217; chances of winning the title defender David Luiz is feeling the pressure mounting on the leaders. “We are not afraid, we are top of the league now, we are happy with this,” the Brazil international said.</p>
<p><strong>Fulham in relegation fight</strong></p>
<p>New Fulham manager Felix Magath is convinced his team will avoid relegation. Ahead of Saturday&#8217;s game at West Brom, the Cottagers are bottom of the league, four points adrift of safety. But the former Bayern Munich coach believes hard work will ultimately pay off. “In the next months we will have a lot of work to avoid relegation but in the first days here the work we&#8217;ve achieved has been very good,”Magath said. “I&#8217;m sure we will avoid relegation with this team as the players are willing to avoid relegation.&#8221; Fulham appointed Magath on an 18-month contract on Friday after firing Rene Meulensteen. A strong disciplinarian, Magath has won three Bundesliga titles as a coach.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990546&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shakib Al Hasan, former Bangladesh captain and the senior-most member of the current Mushfiqur Rahim-led side, copped a three-match ban from his cricket board BCB for making a lewd gesture on camera during the second one-dayer against Sri Lanka on Thursday.</p>
<p>About 10 overs after Shakib was dismissed during Bangladesh’s attempt of chasing 290 in Mirpur, the large screen at the Sher-e-Bangla ground showed replays of his dismissal, before the camera panned towards the Bangladesh dressing room.</p>
<p>It was then that Shakib gestured towards his crotch and then the camera, a footage that was played live on television and across the stadium’s monitors. It was later suggested that the all-rounder perhaps did not take well to the criticism dished out by the commentators on-air when they discussed his dismissal.</p>
<p><strong>Fine and ban</strong></p>
<p>Apart from being fined $3800 for this ‘inappropriate gesture’, Shakib will be forced to miss the third one-dayer against Sri Lanka on Saturday and the first two matches of the Asia Cup, which Bangladesh are hosting next week. While the Lanka one-dayer is a dead rubber encounter, the two Cup matches against India (February 26) and Afghanistan (March 1) are not.</p>
<p>Shakib was dealt with the ban after he was summoned to appear before a disciplinary committee on the eve of the final ODI against Sri Lanka on Friday.</p>
<p>“Bangladesh cricketer Shakib Al Hasan has been penalised for breaching the BCB Code of Conduct,” the board said. “Shakib appeared at a disciplinary hearing of the BCB today and admitted the offence and accepted responsibility for the act.”</p>
<p>According to ESPN Cricinfo, Nizamuddin Chowdhury, the acting president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, said the following in a statement. “Shakib was repentant for the incident and readily accepted that the behavior was unbecoming of a player of his experience and stature. We also reminded him that his action was unacceptable.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990535&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/abdevillersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990528 " alt="AB de Villiers ended his innings on 116 against Australia on Friday. This, incidentally, was his 12th straight Test with a score over fifty in an innings, a new world record. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/abdevillersm.jpg" /></a> AB de Villiers ended his innings on 116 against Australia on Friday. This, incidentally, was his 12th straight Test with a score over fifty in an innings, a new world record. (Reuters)
<p>Wayne Parnell returned to test cricket after four years with two wickets in his first three balls as South Africa forced life out of a previously placid pitch to have Australia 112-4 and 311 behind on a day the home team hopes is series-swinging on Friday.</p>
<p>Trailing 1-0, top-ranked South Africa found prolonged momentum for the first time in the series on the second day of the second test at St. George’s Park, first when AB de Villiers and JP Duminy made centuries and shared a 149-run stand to take the Proteas to 423 in its first innings.</p>
<p>And then when Parnell and Vernon Philander got a little sideways movement and bounce out of the sluggish surface to snatch four Australian wickets in 25 overs at the end of the day.</p>
<p>It could have been six, but opener David Warner was still there on a rapid 65 after being dropped by wicketkeeper De Villiers, and nightwatchman Nathan Lyon avoided a review that would have shown he was out and another dropped catch by Duminy diving in the gully in a breathless final two hours.</p>
<p>“It could have been (worse) if they took a couple of chances,’’ Australia coach Darren Lehmann said. “They bowled very well, give them credit there.’’</p>
<p>Parnell had 2-19 at his home ground and Philander 2-26. Philander removed opener Chris Rogers early lbw and Parnell’s life off the pitch got rid of Alex Doolan for 8 and Shaun Marsh for a duck in his first three deliveries in his first test since 2010 and first on his ground.</p>
<p>Captain Michael Clarke reflected Australia’s gung-ho approach to the start of its first innings with 16 of his 19 runs coming from boundaries, but he mistimed another attacking shot to Philander and was caught in the covers for 81-4, leaving Lyon to battle through the last eight overs.</p>
<p>With Warner racing past 50, after being dropped by De Villiers on 43, and Lyon hanging on grimly, South Africa missed the chance to inflict serious damage. “We let ourselves down in the end there with two dropped catches,’’ Duminy said. “Hopefully we’ll catch them tomorrow.’’</p>
<p>De Villiers made 116 for his 12th score of 50 or better in his last 12 tests, six of them centuries. Duminy top-scored with 123 after being under pressure for his place in the team as South Africa preferred to grind its way to a big first-innings score rather than race away like the Australians.</p>
<p>Australia’s left-arm quick Mitchell Johnson, South Africa’s destroyer in the first test, finished with 1-70 as the Aussie quicks struggled through the two days and 150.5 overs they were forced to remain in the field, and offspinner Lyon led the attack with his 5-130.</p>
<p>But the significance of South Africa’s score, which also featured half-centuries by Dean Elgar and Faf du Plessis on the first day &#8212; and the significance of Clarke placing four catchers at short midwicket at one point in a desperate ploy to unsettle De Villiers — was not clear until Australia’s hectic start to its reply.</p>
<p>The pitch was deemed sluggish, almost lifeless, and De Villiers responded to Clarke’s unorthodox plan by nonchalantly launching a six over those fours fielders’ heads. Johnson and his fellow Australian fast bowlers went over 140 overs without a wicket. Yet Parnell, Philander and the bounce of Morne Morkel, combined with Australia’s attacking mindset, saw wickets fall, edges fly and chances go down at the end of the day and the game move on at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>“The Aussies always come out fighting and play a few shots,’’ Duminy said. “Fortunately that played into our hands.’’<br />
Lehmann still backed his middle order to find a way back into the match on Saturday, relying on the signs mainly Warner showed when he blasted 40 off his 65 runs off 67 balls in fours that there are plenty of runs on offer.</p>
<p>Brief scores: SA 423 all out (JP Duminy 123, AB de Villiers 116; N Lyon 5/130) vs Aus 112/4 (D Warner 65*; W Parnell 2/19, V Philander 2/26)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990521&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rafael Nadal showed no problem with his tender back in his second match since returning from the injury, defeating fellow Spaniard Albert Montanes 6-1, 6-2 to reach the quarterfinals of the Rio Open on Thursday. The No. 1-ranked Nadal tweaked his back warming up for the Australian Open final, which he lost almost four weeks ago in a major upset against Stanislas Wawrinka.</p>
<p>His first stop after the layoff is the clay in Rio as he tests the back and tries to stay healthy for the French Open. A year ago he used the Latin American swing to test his recovery from an injured left knee. Nadal seemed to move freely against Montanes and wore a large, blue elastic bandage on his lower back as a precaution.</p>
<p>“The back, well, it’s bothering me a little,” Nadal said. “Right now it’s not hurting my game, but I’m serving a little more gently than I’m used to doing.” Nadal said he pushed his recovery “a little bit” to play in Rio, after pulling out of the tournament the week before in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>“I am here and very happy being here,” he said. “When you get an injury in the final of a Grand Slam, and you stop (playing/practicing) for 2 1/2 weeks, the comeback is not easy.” Asked if nagging injuries might force an early retirement, the 27-year-old joked a bit before getting serious. “I can’t predict the future, but my intention is to play many years,” he said. In the other key men’s match, third-seeded Fabio Fognini reached the last eight beating Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-3. Second-seeded David Ferrer advanced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine advanced to his second quarterfinals of the year, beating Facundo Bagnis of Argentina 6-7 (4), 6-2, 7-6 (4). Dolgopolov said he hadn’t considered leaving the tournament to return to his Kiev birthplace, where more than 100 people have died in anti government protests this week. Government snipers killed at least 70 on Thursday. “It’s sad. I can’t do much, but just support,” he said. “Whoever is right doesn’t matter now when people are dying.”</p>
<p>On the women’s side of the combined ATP-WTA event, fifth-seeded Kurumi Nara of Japan and Lourdes Dominguez Lino of Spain set up a quarterfinal matchup after second-round wins. Nara defeated Anna-Lena Friedsam of Germany 6-0, 7-6 (3), and was in sight of her first WTA semifinals. Dominguez Lino beat Chanelle Scheepers of South Africa 2-6, 7-6 (7), 6-1.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990508&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Champions Red Bull cut short testing in Bahrain on Friday after being sidelined by yet another unexpected mechanical problem. Australian Daniel Ricciardo managed just 28 laps at the Sakhir circuit before the team decided to suspend running to prepare the car for the final day of the second pre-season test on Saturday.</p>
<p>Red Bull have struggled to get their Renault-powered car running reliably while Mercedes and Ferrari-powered rivals have been getting in the laps.</p>
<p>Vettel did 59 laps on Thursday, more than twice as many as the team had managed in all five previous days of testing in Spain and Bahrain, but the gremlins returned for his new Australian team mate.</p>
<p>Ricciardo did his best to sound positive, however, and said the car was definitely making progress.The team’s race engineering co-ordinator Andy Damerum said the mechanics had their work cut out and explained that the mechanical issue was not one the team had experienced<br />
previously.</p>
<p>While Red Bull struggled, Mercedes powered on with Britain’s 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton fastest and putting in 67 laps. Compatriot Jenson Button did more laps than anyone, 103 in his Mercedes-powered McLaren, and was second fastest.</p>
<p>Swedish rookie Marcus Ericsson managed the most laps in a Renault-engined car, with 98 for Caterham. The distance covered meant he had done more than the 300km required to gain the mandatory super licence to race. The season starts in Australia on March 16.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990506&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Going by form as well as reputation, Delhi Waveriders would start  as favourites against Uttar Pradesh Wizards in the first semifinal of the HIL on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Waveriders, ended their league engagements on the second spot with 39 points from 10 games ahead of the Wizards. The Wizards endured a mixed form this year and finished their league campaign in third position with 28 points.</p>
<p>On head-to-head record this year, the Sardar Singh-led side has a better record than the Wizards. While the match between the two sides ended in a 1-1 draw, the Waveriders recorded a close 4-3 win over the Wizards in their next meeting this year.</p>
<p>But come Saturday, it will be a completely different ball game as this would be the first knock-out match of the tournament for both teams. Under new coach Cedric D’souza, the Delhi outfit has looked formidable. In young Yuvraj Walmiki, Akashdeep Singh, Talwinder Singh, Kiwi Simon Child and veteran Rajpal Singh, the Waveriders possess a talented forwardline.</p>
<p>The Waveriders’ midfield is led by the Sardar and Gurbaj Singh, while the backline will be manned by goalkeepers in Nicolas Jacobi. On the other hand, Wizards failed to get their campaign going in the tournament.</p>
<p>Ramandeep Singh looked ordinary in the tournament so far, but youngsters such as Nikkin Thiimaiah, SK Uthappa and PradeepMor has impressed with their skills. In such a situation, the Wizards would look to draw inspiration from Dutchman Teun de Nooijer, VR Raghunath, Australian Luke Doerner and Tushar Khandekar.</p>
<p>In the second semifinal,table-toppers Jaypee Punjab Warriors would look to continue their winning streak against Ranchi Rhinos. Punjab Warriors had a dream campaign in the this year, having lost just one match so far, that too against Delhi Waveriders in the tournament-opener.</p>
<p>After the initial hiccup, the Warriors won seven games while two ended in no result to draw curtains to their league engagements on top with 40 points from 10 games. To add to it, the Warriors boast of a 100 per cent record against the Rhinos this year, having beaten them 4-2 and 3-2.</p>
<p>So understandably, the Warriors would go into the crucial match high on confidence against a side which has looked a pale shadow of itself this year. The Warriors forwardline will be led by Jamie Dwyer of Australia.</p>
<p>Apart from Dwyer, the Warriors have a mixed bag of youth and experience like Affan Yousuf, Gurmail Singh, Malak Singh, Dharamvir Singh, S V Sunil, Shivendra Singh and Australian Kieran Govers among others.</p>
<p>Sandeep threat</p>
<p>The Warriors also have a dangerous penalty corner specialist in Sandeep Singh, while the goal will be manned by none other than world’s best goalkeeper Jaap Stockmann of The Netherlands.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Rhinos’ campaign in the tournament has been far from impressive this year. The title holders won just four and lost five matches while one ended in draw to finish the league stages at the fourth position with just 26 points.</p>
<p>But Rhinos know it well that it will be a completely new game and if they can post a win against the Warriors, the results of the league stages will be a thing of the past.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Advances to semifinal after China’s Ze Zhang pulls out with shoulder injury<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990487&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somdev Devvarman made the semifinal of the Delhi Challenger after his opponent Ze Zhang pulled out with a troubled shoulder a set into the quarterfinal clash. Somdev had pocketed the first set 6-2 but the Chinese player seemed handicapped. Ze had taken a medical time out five games into the first set, but with his right shoulder not responding to treatment, pulled out soon after.</p>
<p>Ze was arguably the form player coming into the quarterfinal, having already beaten former World No.52 Marco Chiudinelli in straight sets.</p>
<p>Somdev, on the other hand, had struggled in his first round match against Karunuday Singh and had just about found his game in a straight-set win in the second round.</p>
<p>Ze had served big and put his powerful forehand to good use during his win against Chiudinelli but there was something amiss right away, as the 23-year old double-faulted early and netted a volley with the court gaping to concede a break in the first service game of the match.</p>
<p>Somdev later said that he had only an inkling that Ze was not perhaps 100 per cent because his opponent had not served with any zest. Somdev proceeded to take the pace out of his shots, preferring instead to keep the ball in play until the opponent erred. This strategy bore disproportionately large dividends, and Somdev was up 5-0 in no time. It soon emerged that Ze was in some trouble as he called the trainer on to the court.</p>
<p>Playing an injured opponent is never straightforward and Somdev dropped his serve right after the time out. Though Ze held his to close the gap a little bit, Somdev was still two breaks to the good. He served the set out without much difficulty but Ze found it impossible to continue and informed the chair umpire.</p>
<p>The seeded players did not face much difficulty else where too. Top seed Aleksandr Nedovyesov beat Lucas Pouille 6-2, 6-4 while winner of the Kolkata Challenger Ilija Bozoljac also triumphed in straight sets 6-4, 7-6(7) against Illya Marchenko. Fourth seed Evgeny Donskoy beat Radu Albot 6-2, 6-2 in another quarterfinal clash.</p>
<p>The Ratiwatana twins stood in the way of an all-Indian doubles final when they beat Jeevan Nedunchezhian and Vishnu Vardhan 3-6, 6-3, 10-7. In the other semifinal, wildcards Saketh Myneni and Sanam Singh upset fourth seed Adrian Mendez-MacEiras and Aleksandr Nedovyesov 6-3, 6-2.</p>
<p><strong>Spirited show by Ankita</strong></p>
<p>In the women’s singles quarterfinals, India’s number one player Ankita Raina put up a spirited fight against third seed Yulia Beygelzimer from Ukraine as she saved three match points before losing 3-6 5-7 in two hours and five minutes on court number one. Ankita did not lack in her effort but had an experienced rival, currently ranked 180 but once world number 83, who was well attuned to play according to situation. Ankita played with a lot of conviction but tried too hard and consequently made errors on crucial points.</p>
<p>Ankita, 285th ranked, managed to hold her serve only four times out of 11 service games. But most of the time she fell back, she managed to break Yulia back.</p>
<p>It did not happen when she was down 3-4, despite having a breakpoint which she earned with a stunning backhand winner. Yulia was struggling with her first serve but managed to hold for a 5-3 lead. Serving to stay in the set, Ankita hit a forehand on to the net to be down by two set points. Yulia could capitalise on none, hitting unforced errors. The Ukrainian earned herself a third set point with a forehand winner and converted with a similar shot.</p>
<p>Ankita got an early break in the second set but let go the advantage by dropping her serve in the second game. Another break of serve saw her trail 2-4 but her persistence paid as she broke back and held her own for 4-4.</p>
<p>A forehand error following a long rally had Ankita facing her first match point but saved it with a backhand winner, her most impressive and consistent shot. Yulia failed to capitalise on the second match point and Ankita held to make it 5-5, keeping her alive in the contest.</p>
<p>The Indian was again serving to stay in the match. Yulia smashed an overhead volley after a superb rally to get her third match point but hit her backhand out, going for a winner.</p>
<p>Three consecutive errors ended Ankita’s campaign in the 12th game as she netted a low ball, hit a forehand long and buried a backhand to the net.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/neymarreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990261" alt="Neymar's high-profile move to Barcelona in the close season was initially shrouded in mystery and it was unclear what exactly was paid to whom and when (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/neymarreutersm.jpg" /></a> Neymar&#8217;s high-profile move to Barcelona in the close season was initially shrouded in mystery and it was unclear what exactly was paid to whom and when (Reuters)
<p>Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu has said the operation to bring Neymar to the Catalan capital was “completely legal” and reiterated the club&#8217;s innocence of tax fraud in signing the Brazil international.</p>
<p>In the latest twist to a saga that prompted Bartomeu&#8217;s predecessor, Sandro Rosell, to step down last month, a Madrid court on Thursday charged the Spanish champions with defrauding the tax authority.</p>
<p>The club was forced on the defensive after a member filed a complaint against Rosell alleging misappropriation of funds and when details of Neymar&#8217;s move from Santos to Barca came to light the judge overseeing the case granted the public prosecutor&#8217;s request to lay charges for tax fraud.”We are very comfortable because the contract is completely normal,” Bartomeu said on Thursday. “We took advice, ourselves, the player, Santos, and we did everything legally,” he added. “We now intend to explain the nature of the negotiation and what the contracts are and we will show that they are completely legal. Everything that was done was done correctly. We would do the same again.”</p>
<p>Neymar&#8217;s high-profile move to Barcelona in the close season was initially shrouded in mystery and it was unclear what exactly was paid to whom and when.</p>
<p>After Rosell stepped down, Barca admitted he had cost 86.2 million euros ($118 million), including payments to the player and his family, and not 57.1 million as they originally said.</p>
<p>The judge has requested Barca&#8217;s tax records relating to the deal and had asked the tax authority to calculate the scale of any alleged fraud.Local media reported the club should have paid 9.1 million euros more in tax than they did. It is unclear what punishment is likely to be handed down if Barca are deemed culpable.</p>
<p>In a separate development on Thursday the court accepted a complaint by a Spanish non-governmental organisation that fights corruption called “Clean Hands”.</p>
<p>The complaint accuses Rosell, Bartomeu, who was closely involved in the transfer negotiations, and another Barca vice president, Javier Faus, as well as Neymar&#8217;s father, of misappropriation of funds and document fraud. “Seeing as we are very relaxed it doesn&#8217;t matter if they (Clean Hands) file a complaint against us,” Bartomeu said. “We will defend ourselves from a position of strength and we will go where we have to go. This will all end up being a mere anecdote.”</p>
<p>Barca&#8217;s legal woes do not appear to be affecting their results on the pitch.</p>
<p>They secured a 2-0 win away to English Premier League side Manchester City in Tuesday&#8217;s Champions League last 16, first leg, are joint top of La Liga with 14 games left and are through to April&#8217;s King&#8217;s Cup final to face Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Coach Gerardo Martino said on Friday that he could obviously not ignore the situation but wanted to focus on matches.</p>
<p>“I am not surprised and it is not something I can ignore either,” the Argentine, in his first season in charge at the Nou Camp, told a news conference previewing Saturday&#8217;s La Liga game at Real Sociedad.”I guess the players already know what it is all about. But it is not something I should talk about,” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Alba out of Sociedad tie</strong></p>
<p>Barcelona full back Jordi Alba has failed to shrug off a thigh strain and will miss Saturday&#8217;s La Liga match at Real Sociedad, the Spanish champions said on Friday. The Spain international, who spent more than two months on the sidelines with a hamstring problem before Christmas, played in the 2-0 win at Manchester City in Tuesday&#8217;s Champions League last-16 first leg. However, tests conducted when the squad returned to the Catalan capital on Wednesday confirmed Alba&#8217;s injury, representing a blow to coach Gerardo Martino at a critical stage of the season.</p>
<p>“The discomfort caused by the strain in the muscles at the back of the right thigh remains and therefore the player is rested as a precaution for the (Sociedad) match,” Barca said. Barca, chasing a fifth La Liga title in six years, are joint top on 60 points with Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid with 14 games left.</p>
<p>The Catalan club have two more La Liga games, at home to Almeria on March 2 and at Real Valladolid the following weekend, before they host City in the return leg on March 12.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990258&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The IPL was held in South Africa in 2009 as well because of the general elections in India.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990039&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A large part, if not the whole of the seventh edition, of the Indian Premier League (IPL) is likely to be held overseas as the government has said that it cannot guarantee security because of the upcoming general elections.</p>
<p>Though the dates of the elections have not been announced it is likely to be held by mid-May, which means it will coincide with the regular schedule of the IPL.</p>
<p>“Due to general elections, it will be difficult to provide adequate security to IPL matches,” Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told reporters in New Delhi.</p>
<p><strong>Massive personnel</strong></p>
<p>More than 1.20 lakh central paramilitary force personnel, in addition to state police forces, are expected to be deployed for the multi-phased Lok Sabha polls, which are likely to be held in April-May.</p>
<p>The BCCI, keeping in mind that the general elections were around the corner, have not finalised the schedule for IPL 7. South Africa was one the venues being considered but IPL chairman Ranjib Biswal said on Friday that the BCCI was talking to other cricket boards.</p>
<p>“The (central) government had expressed its inability to provide adequate security for IPL 7 in view of the upcoming general elections. So we have started talking to different countries to hold the tournament,” he said.<br />
Asked if South Africa is a likely venue, he said, “South Africa is a favoured venue to host the matches but we will have to decide.”</p>
<p><strong>Meet to decide venue</strong></p>
<p>The Indian board will now hold their working committee meeting in Bhubaneswar on February 28 and discuss the IPL issue. BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel has said apart from discussions on the IPL the working committee will also discuss the changed ICC structure.</p>
<p>“We have options ready but we will be discussing on all the minute details. South Africa, UAE and Bangladesh are the venues where IPL can be hosted. BCCI will see all possibilities before finalising the venue,” Patel said.<br />
The BCCI is hoping to host the final stages of the league of IPL at home.</p>
<p>In the meeting on Wednesday, it is learnt that the BCCI secretary met the home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and was told that the BCCI could host the IPL post-May 11.</p>
<p>Patel is confident that half the games will be played in India and the BCCI will announce the venues in the coming days.</p>
<p><strong>Government clearances</strong></p>
<p>Biswal said in any case the IPL will have to get all government clearances before holding the tournament in another country.”There is not going to be any IPL without government clearance. We will get all the clearances before the tournament,” he said.</p>
<p>It won’t be the first time that the IPL will be played abroad. Five years ago under IPL commissioner Lalit Modi’s tenure BCCI had taken the IPL to South Africa in 2009.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990039&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/indiau19teamiccm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990332" alt="The Indians kick-started their campaign with a 40-run victory over arch-rivals Pakistan (ICC Photo)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/indiau19teamiccm.jpg" /></a> The Indians kick-started their campaign with a 40-run victory over arch-rivals Pakistan (ICC Photo)
<p>Having won all their group stage matches convincingly, defending champions India will have a slight edge when they lock horns with England in the quarterfinals of the Under-19 World Cup.</p>
<p>In-form India had notched up a mammoth 245-run win over Papua New Guinea in their last round-robin match to top Group A and having posted 300-plus runs on a difficult batting wicket, the Vijay Zol-captained side will fancy its chances at the Dubai International Stadium.</p>
<p>India’s victory margin was the seventh-biggest in the history of youth ODIs. England, though, will not be as easy as they also have proven players  who have impressed in the tournament.</p>
<p>The Indians kick-started their campaign with a 40-run victory over arch-rivals Pakistan. They struggled a bit against Scotland before pulling off a five-wicket win in their second match. The holders then roared back to form with a thrashing of New Papua Guinea on a Sharjah track that was not one of the best for batting.</p>
<p>Leading the side, Zol has been having a decent outing, but the batsman to look out for will be Sanju Samson. The 19-year-old, who plays for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL), had smashed his way to a 48-ball 85 against the hapless Papua New Guinea, giving enough indications about what the batsman is capable of when in form.</p>
<p><strong>Strong middle-order</strong></p>
<p>Provided the openers get starts, it could be difficult for the English bowlers to contain the Indian middle-order, with Zol and Samson holding fort. Both the openers, Ankush Bains and Akhil Herwadkar had decent outing in their last match, with the former scoring a solid half-century that stabilised the innings.</p>
<p>Left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav has been the most impressive Indian bowler in tournament, and he is expected to play a key role. He had returned with impressive figures of 4 for 10 against PNG, after failing to take a wicket in his 10 overs against Pakistan. He will look to maintain his reputation, being captain Zol’s go-to bowler.</p>
<p><strong>Great Record</strong></p>
<p>India can take a lot of comfort from the fact that it leads 6-1 on head-to-head with England in the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup. However, when the two sides met last, England defeated India by 31 runs with Ben Stokes scoring 100, in Lincoln in the 2010 event in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Zol, who was a member of the India side that won the tournament in Townsville in 2012, said: “It doesn’t matter that we’re playing England in the quarter-final. We have set our standards in all the three departments &#8211; batting, bowling and fielding. So, we’d like to live up to our standards.”</p>
<p>As far as England is concerned, they registered big wins against New Zealand (by 115 runs) and UAE (by 213 runs). Their only blip has been the narrow one-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/andyflowerreuterm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990398" alt="A report in a newspaper said that a Board official had held a round of talks with former Zimbabwe skipper Flower (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/andyflowerreuterm.jpg" /></a> A report in a newspaper said that a Board official had held a round of talks with former Zimbabwe skipper Flower (Reuters)
<p>The BCCI rubbished a report that it had held discussions with former England coach Andy Flower about taking over as the chief coach of the Indian team in place of incumbent Duncan Fletcher following the country&#8217;s dismal show in South Africa and New Zealand.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s rubbish. I am the secretary of the Board and no such discussions (with Flower) have taken place,&#8221; BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel told PTI when asked for his reaction.</p>
<p>The report in a national daily quoting a highly-placed source in the BCCI said that a Board official had held a round of talks with former Zimbabwe skipper Flower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing has been finalised as these are preliminary talks with the Board likely to invite applications from suitable candidates for the post next month. Routine process would be followed before handing the responsibilities to the new coach. But so far, Flower has been contacted and let&#8217;s see who wins the race,&#8221; the source had said, according to the report.</p>
<p>Patel said he would like to know which Board official had said this to the newspaper.</p>
<p>Patel, however, said the Board would talk to India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Fletcher, in all probability after the ICC T20 World Cup in Bangladesh, over the recent poor display of the squad in South Africa and New Zealand where the team lost ODIs as well as Test rubbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we will be talking to them. This is a normal procedure that we adopt after every tour. In all probability that would happen only after the T20 World Cup,&#8221; informed Patel.</p>
<p>The World T20 event is scheduled in Bangladesh from March 16 to April 6.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Board&#8217;s working committee meeting in Bhubaneswar on February 28 would discuss the Indian Premier League, which could be held outside the country as it clashes with the general elections in April-May and the union government has said that it cannot provide security cover for the cash-rich league.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, IPL will be discussed at the meeting. Also the new changes in ICC (structure),&#8221; said Patel.<br />
Asked whether the later stages of the IPL, after the conclusion of the general elections, could be staged in the country, Patel said, &#8220;100 per cent, they can be held&#8221;.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990395&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Jamaican sprint star Usain Bolt, Rafael Nadal, Cristiano Ronaldo, Sebastian Vettel are among the top favourites to win the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year Award, to be announced in Kuala Lumpur on March 26.</p>
<p>The list of contenders also includes Argentine footballer Lionel Messi, NBA player LeBron James, long-distance runner Mo Farah of Britain and Chinese swimmer Sun Yang.</p>
<p>The Laureus World Sports Awards, now celebrating its 15th year, is recognised as the premier honours event in the international sporting calendar.</p>
<p>The names of the six nominees for the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year Award, as voted by the Laureus Media Selection Panel, will be announced later this month and the winner will be unveiled at a ceremony on March 26.</p>
<p>The awards recognise sporting achievement during the calendar year 2013. The awards will also be decided in six other categories by the jury comprising leading sports editors, sports writers, broadcasters and online journalists<br />
from around the world.</p>
<p>The list of nominations for the awards includes boxers Floyd Mayweather Jr and Wladimir Klitschko of Ukraine, Rugby player Kieran Read, gymnast Kohei Uchimura of Japan, British rider Chris Froome and Austria&#8217;s Alpine racer Marcel Hirscher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever is nominated, it&#8217;s going to be one of the closest contests ever for the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year Award. You have a great star like Usain Bolt, from my own sport of track and field, trying to equal the record of four Laureus Awards, but you also have some wonderful feats from so many sportsmen in so many sports. There is quality everywhere,&#8221; said Laureus World Sports Academy Chairman and Olympic legend Edwin Moses.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990382&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sri Lanka&#8217;s veteran batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan is in doubt for the upcoming Asia Cup after picking up a finger injury which has ruled him out of the rest of the ongoing series against Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&#8220;He would return home today,&#8221; Sri Lanka Cricket announced.</p>
<p>He may miss the Asia Cup tournament also to be played in Bangladesh from February 25 as the selectors would not want to risk him ahead of the World T20 also to be held in Bangladesh from March 16.</p>
<p>The left-handed middle-order batsman Lahiru Thirimanna would replace Dilshan for the Bangladesh tour.</p>
<p>Dilshan hurt his finger in the second ODI which Sri Lanka won on Thursday to clinch the series.</p>
<p><strong>Afridi hurts jaw in practice match</strong></p>
<p>The Pakistan cricket team suffered an injury scare ahead of the Asia Cup when their flamboyant all-rounder Shahid Afridi hurt his jaw during a practice match at the Gaddafi stadium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the injury is not a serious one but doctors have advised him to speak less for two days because the impact was on the jaw,&#8221; national coach Moin Khan told reporters.</p>
<p>Afridi was hit near the jaw when trying to paddle sweep pacer Junaid Khan. The ball flew off the edge of the bat and hit his helmet&#8217;s visor which struck the jaw. Afridi was seen walking around with a big bruise on the right side of his face.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990224&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/neymar.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990192" alt="neymar" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/neymar.jpg" /></a> Barcelona&#8217;s most expensive transfer in history, Neymar, at Camp Nou.
<p>Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu has reiterated the club&#8217;s innocence of tax fraud in the signing of Neymar and insisted the operation to bring the Brazil forward to the Catalan capital was &#8220;completely legal&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the latest twist to a saga that prompted Bartomeu&#8217;s predecessor, Sandro Rosell, to step down last month, a Madrid court on Thursday charged the Spanish champions with defrauding the tax authority.</p>
<p>The club was forced on the defensive after a member filed a complaint against Rosell alleging misappropriation of funds and when details of Neymar&#8217;s move from Santos to Barca came to light the judge overseeing the case granted the public prosecutor&#8217;s request to lay charges for tax fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are very comfortable because the contract is completely normal,&#8221; Bartomeu said in an interview with Spanish television broadcaster TVE late on Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We took advice, ourselves, the player, Santos, and we did everything legally,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We now intend to explain the nature of the negotiation and what the contracts are and we will show that they are completely legal. Everything that was done was done correctly. We would do the same again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neymar&#8217;s high-profile move to Barcelona in the close season was initially shrouded in mystery and it was unclear what exactly was paid to whom and when.</p>
<p>After Rosell stepped down, Barca admitted he had cost 86.2 million euros ($118 million), including payments to the player and his family, and not 57.1 million as they originally said.</p>
<p>The judge has requested Barca&#8217;s tax records relating to the deal and had asked the tax authority to calculate the scale of the alleged fraud.</p>
<p>Local media reported the club should have paid 9.1 million euros more in tax than they did. It was unclear what punishment is likely to be handed down if Barca are deemed culpable.</p>
<p>In a separate development on Thursday the court accepted a complaint by a Spanish non-governmental organisation that fights corruption called &#8220;Clean Hands&#8221;.</p>
<p>The complaint accuses Rosell, Bartomeu, who was closely involved in the transfer negotiations, and another Barca vice president, Javier Faus, as well as Neymar&#8217;s father, of misappropriation of funds and document fraud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seeing as we are very relaxed it doesn&#8217;t matter if they (Clean Hands) file a complaint against us,&#8221; Bartomeu told TVE.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will defend ourselves from a position of strength and we will go where we have to go. This will all end up being a mere anecdote.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barca&#8217;s legal woes do not appear to be affecting their results on the pitch.</p>
<p>They secured a 2-0 win away to English Premier League side Manchester City in Tuesday&#8217;s Champions League last 16, first leg, are joint top of La Liga with Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid with 14 games left and are through to April&#8217;s King&#8217;s Cup final to face Real.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990189&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mahendrasinghdhonikohlim.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990068" alt="Mahendra Singh Dhoni's leadership has come under heavy fire of late following the disastrous tour to New Zealand (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mahendrasinghdhonikohlim.jpg" /></a> Mahendra Singh Dhoni&#8217;s leadership has come under heavy fire of late following the disastrous tour to New Zealand (File)
<p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni has been ruled out of the Asia Cup, which starts next week in Bangladesh, owing to a side strain that he picked up during the second Test in New Zealand. The Indian skipper, who landed in Mumbai along with the rest of the team on Wednesday night, will now undergo a 10-day rehabilitation to recover from a Grade I left side-strain that he suffered while diving to collect a ball in Wellington. Virat Kohli will take over the reins as India fight it out against sub-contintental rivals Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan during the two-week tournament.</p>
<p>“He has informed the BCCI that he has a pain in his side and that he is still unsure whether he can travel to Bangladesh next week. Virat will be leading the side at the Asia Cup,” a BCCI official said.</p>
<p>Sanjay Patel, BCCI secretary, told The Indian Express that Dhoni’s injury wasn’t so serious that he would miss the upcoming World T20 in Bangladesh. “It isn’t serious. He picked up the injury during the third day of the second Test against New Zealand. The team physio submitted his report and then a second physio, the NCA physio, was consulted, and accordingly the decision was taken. He would be available for the World T20,” Patel said.</p>
<p>The enforced break though could very well be a blessing in disguise for the beleagured Indian skipper. His leadership has come under heavy fire of late following the disastrous tour to New Zealand, where Dhoni &amp; Co failed to win a single international match—not to forget his abysmal record away from home over the last few years. At the same time, the 33-year-old has also been playing non-stop cricket for close to seven months. And the two weeks off prior to the World T20, also in Bangladesh, will be an opportunity for the experienced skipper to fight off his fatigue, both physical and mental.</p>
<p>This will also be a chance for Kohli to showcase his captaincy credentials. While many experts have called for the youngster to step in as captain even in Tests, this will be his first major ODI assignment after he had led India to a 5-0 win in a series in Zimbabwe last year.</p>
<p>Kohli surely won’t have it as easy as he did in Zimbabwe, considering the circumstances in which he will be taking over the leadership role. India were thrashed by both New Zealand and South Africa in the one-dayers before the Test matches on those respective tours and his side have more than just pride to play for in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>And what will make matters worse for this rookie captain is the fact that his side, minus Dhoni the finisher, will be taking on the Asian powerhouses in conditions rather suitable for their exploits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dhoni will be replaced behind the stumps by Dinesh Karthik, who recently hit back-to-back centuries in the ongoing Corporate Trophy for India Cements.</p>
<p><strong>‘Can’t afford to fail again’</strong></p>
<p>Sourav Ganguly believes it is only experience that forces MS Dhoni to remain as captain for India’s tour of England and Australia, countries in which they got blanked in Test cricket the last time around, later this year.<br />
“If he fails again, then it’s time to bring a new captain,” Ganguly said. “He has to be bold in taking decisions. He needs to take risks to win. Sometimes, his decisions are negative.” <strong><em>—PTI</em></strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1990065&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even if the quality of the tennis convinced you on occasion that the players belonged at a higher rung of the tennis circuit, there were remainders all around that top-seed Aleksandr Nedovyesov and Yuichi Sugita were indeed playing at the Challenger-level.</p>
<p>Unlike several matches so far, most points in the second round game were decided by winners than unforced errors; there were fewer breaks of serve too.</p>
<p>In this pre-quarters game, Nedovyesov prevailed in three tight sets 4-6, 6-3 7-6 (3), the first and second decided by the solitary break of serve while the third went to a tie-break after the players traded breaks.</p>
<p>Sugita served for the game at one point and even had a couple of match points, but eventually cracked after Nedovyesov upped his game — the Kazakh sent down eight aces in the second and third sets and dialled up the power on his ground strokes to first take the decider to a tie-break and then win it comfortably.</p>
<p>But there were other indicators that this wasn&#8217;t quite the center court at Wimbledon. An oblivious spectator wandered down the aisle with the ball in toss, prompting the chair umpire, players and scattered spectators to holler at him. There was, of course, the perennial problem with the line calls, leaving one player or the other distraught.</p>
<p>Delhi is just a pit-stop for the floaters and drifters of the tennis world in what is a gruelling, endless scrape. Participants usually travel thousands of kilometers only to eke out paltry ranking points — the winner here gets 100.</p>
<p>After the win, Nedovyesov said he had no idea where he was going next. His options are between Chandigarh (the venue of a Futures tournament next week), Doha (Qatar Open), Miami (Indian Wells) and Astana, his hometown in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>“It all depends on what happens tomorrow,” he says, referring to his quarterfinal clash.</p>
<p>The anonymity of the Challenger circuit also encourages him to be a little forthright. He is not happy with the scheduling that drags matches out late into the night.</p>
<p>“If there are a lot of people watching (because of the evening matches), I understand. It was just three people out there today. One was his (Sugita&#8217;s) coach and the other was his friend. The third guy had no idea what he was doing there (in the stands),” he says.</p>
<p>Nedovyesov will play French teenager Lucas Pouille, in what is likely to be another evening game. Still, Nedovyesov would not have minded staying on in Delhi for one more day, late match or not.</p>
<p><strong>Tough task for Somdev</strong></p>
<p>Somdev Devvarman, the lone Indian in the singles draw, will face Ze Zhang in a quarterfinal on Friday.</p>
<p>The 23-year old Chinese player disposed of Marco Chiudinelli, who was raked 52nd in the world at one point, in fairly straight forward fashion and will present a considerable obstacle for the Indian. Ze, six feet two inches tall, has a big serve and his ground strokes are hit cleanly.</p>
<p>Roger Federer was sufficiently impressed to invite Ze to partner him for the doubles leg of the Shanghai Masters last year, a move that yielded the Swiss his first doubles win of the year.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989902&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mithunpereram.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990089" alt="Mithun Perera's score of 8-under 62 in Round Two of the Louis Philippe Cup helped his team top the standings" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mithunpereram.jpg" /></a> Mithun Perera&#8217;s score of 8-under 62 in Round Two of the Louis Philippe Cup helped his team top the standings
<p>Mithun Perera hates golf. He is passionate about gathering stamps. He proudly boasts of having collected roughly 50,000 stamps from all over the world by visiting post offices of every city he travels to for tournaments.<br />
He has also stamped his class in the sport inspite of his dislike for it.</p>
<p>“I hate golf,” the short and stocky Sri Lankan adds, rather unconvincingly. “I play just to earn my living. I love football. I used to play a lot. By playing golf, I have become like a football.”</p>
<p>For someone with such loathing for the sport, Perera has been taking giant strides and almost single-handedly brought Sri Lanka on the map of pro golf.</p>
<p>He did that again on Thursday, when he equalled the course record at the Bombay Presidency Golf Club, outclassing some of the top Indian pros in the process. His score of 8-under 62 in Round Two of the Louis Philippe Cup, an IPL-style competition, helped his team Navratna Ahmedabad leapfrog to the top of the table in the eight-team tournament.</p>
<p>Sri Lankan golfers have been making waves on the Indian tour of late. Two of them feature in the top five of the Order of Merit and Perera, second on the table behind Anirban Lahiri, has been leading the charge. But the journey hasn’t been a smooth one. Because the country was embroiled in ethnic strife, there was hardly any time for sport. Golf in particular.</p>
<p>Impact of civil war</p>
<p>Perera was 11 when the sport felt the biggest impact of LTTE’s activities. “I was very young and can’t recall the tournament’s name. In 1997, Sri Lanka was to host its first professional tournament; equivalent to the Avantha Masters in India,” he says. “But on the eve of the tournament, the city (Colombo) was rocked by bomb blasts. The tournament was cancelled and the sponsors, who had invested a lot of money, never returned.”</p>
<p>After that incident, sponsors were hard to come by and professional golf never really became popular. “We did not have proper roads, how could we dream of having golf courses? Sponsors too stayed away from the sport, it was too big a financial risk,” Perera says.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has only three golf courses, — in Colombo, Kandy and Nuwara Eliya. The players are amateurs and since golf clubs are not affordable, most have learnt the art by using makeshift equipment made of palm tree branches.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, the 27-year-old has been fighting an uphill battle and following the footsteps of his father, Nandasena, who is considered to be among the all-time greats in his country.</p>
<p>He depended on donations from individual golf enthusiasts and started competing on the Indian tour. He became the first Sri Lankan to have multiple wins on the Indian tour and also to have a full card on the Asian Tour.</p>
<p>Looking at his success, many other Sri Lankans started taking golf seriously. “We saw that he is doing well on the Indian tour and making good money as well. That has motivated many golfers back home,” says his compatriot N Tharanga, who is fourth in PGTI Order of Merit.</p>
<p>Perera says he wishes to develop a pro tour in his home country. Currently, the pro tour scene is heavily dependent on PGTI, which hosts two events in Sri Lanka. “The situation has changed post war. There are more courses coming up now; in the next two-three years, we hope to have around five to six golf courses across the country. I may hate the sport, but my ultimate dream is to introduce pro tour there. It will change many lives,” he  says.hates golf. He is passionate about gathering stamps.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mohun Bagan take on Churchill Brothers in the Airtel I-League at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Friday. The teams clashed in the Federation Cup semi-final last month and there are contrasting moods in the two squads since that meeting, which Churchill Brothers won 2-1.</p>
<p>While Mohun Bagan are lacking confidence after an early exit from the IFA Shield and defeat to Salgaocar in their last I-League game on Sunday, Churchill Brothers are the in-form team as they are unbeaten in eight matches in all competitions and a win will move them within one point of the Kolkata club with a game in hand.</p>
<p>The Goan outfit showed great defensive organisation to earn a goalless draw against East Bengal on Tuesday and now will be confident of securing maximum points from this match to go five clear of rock-bottom Rangdajied United.</p>
<p>The Mariners need to a win to stay away from the relegation battle but they will once again be without club captain Odafa Okolie. The green-and-maroon brigade have failed to score in their last three matches in all competitions and coach Karim Bencherifa will be hoping for a change of fortunes in front of goal.</p>
<p>“Even though results haven&#8217;t gone our way recently, we have played some good football so hopefully with a bit of luck we will get the right result in this game,” the Moroccan coach was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Mohun Bagan will take heart from the fact that before the defeat to Churchill Brothers in the Federation Cup they had lost just once in 11 matches stretching over three different competitions and even recorded a morale-boosting win over arch-rivals East Bengal in the Calcutta Football League.</p>
<p>Churchill Brothers though would look to make the most of the home team&#8217;s poor recent form and continue their revival since the Federation Cup with the presence of technical director Subhash Bhowmick adding a spring in their step.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989898&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hockeyfilem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990079" alt="Sardar Singh was one of the handful of India players who held their own in the Hockey India League (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hockeyfilem.jpg" /></a> Sardar Singh was one of the handful of India players who held their own in the Hockey India League (File)
<p>In a bid to increase the player pool and find fresh faces for the national team while giving the regulars some rest, Hockey India has decided that none of the 33 players in the core group will take part in the national championships, which begin in Lucknow on February 27.</p>
<p>The national governing body has advised all participating units not to consider the national team players for their respective squads, especially those who have played in the Hockey India League, in order to avoid player burnout.</p>
<p>Instead, the core group will assemble in New Delhi on March 9 for the national camp under chief coach Terry Walsh.</p>
<p>National team selector BP Govinda said since the performance of Indian players who are taking part in the HIL has been thoroughly monitored by them and coaches, they found it necessary to look at a new set of players during the nationals. The tournament will be held in Lucknow from February 27 to March 23 and for the first time, will be played under elite and plate divisions.</p>
<p>“The selectors will watch all the Division A matches, where all the top teams with some of the best domestic players will play. Our objective is to inject fresh blood in the national squad. If same set of players will take part in the international tournaments, HIL and nationals, we will never be able to monitor other upcoming players,” Govinda said. “We also thought it necessary to give the core group players a break before they return for the camp on March 9. Hence, we have decided that the core group players, who also played in the HIL, need not play the nationals.”</p>
<p>Fringe players and those returning from injury may be allowed to take part in the tournament. The likes of Sandeep Singh and Shivendra Singh have been excluded from the squad but on the back of a decent HIL, especially in the case of Sandeep, they will be hoping for a comeback. It’s the same case with Gurwinder Singh Chandi, who has been out injured for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>No new finds</strong></p>
<p>India will be taking part in four major competitions in the second half of the year: World Cup, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and Champions Trophy. Walsh has insisted on having a large pool of players to choose from. However, the HIL has not helped in unearthing new talents this season.</p>
<p>In the inaugural edition, youngster Mandeep Singh burst onto the scene with a few scintillating performances for Ranchi Rhinos. It’s been a rather different story this time. Barring a rare flash of brilliance, the performances of the Indian players have been mediocre.</p>
<p>Most disappointing has been Ramandeep Singh. The striker became the highest paid player of the HIL when he was picked up for $81,000 by Uttar Pradesh Wizards. He entered the tournament on the back of an injury and has not scored even once this season.</p>
<p>Of the younger lot, Akashdeep Singh, Yuvraj Walmiki, Mohammad Nizammudin, Affan Yousuf and Harjot Singh have had a decent tournament whereas usual suspects of the national team, VR Raghunath, Rupinderpal Singh, SV Sunil and SK Uthappa too have had good outings.  But none of them, barring Sardar Singh and Gurbaj Singh, have stood out with their performances.</p>
<p>The selectors are keen to add new faces to the national squad for the upcoming camp. The selectors and coaching staff have identified goalkeeping as the key gray area which they want to address on priority basis. “Indian goalkeepers did not enjoy a good HIL and we have been suffering on that front for quite some time. We hope to find at least one good keeper from the nationals who have be drafted in the national squad,” India coach MK Kaushik said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989881&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kumarsangakkaraapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990076" alt="Kumar Sangakkara hit a fluent 128 off 115 balls (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kumarsangakkaraapm.jpg" /></a> Kumar Sangakkara hit a fluent 128 off 115 balls (AP)
<p>Kumar Sangakkara continued his awesome batting form in Bangladesh as Sri Lanka won the second one-dayer by 61 runs in Dhaka to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.</p>
<p>The left-hander, who scored 319 and 105 in the second Test earlier this month after making 75 in the first Test, hit a fluent 128 off 115 balls to lift Sri Lanka to 289-6.</p>
<p>Bangladesh, facing a must-win situation after losing the first match, caved in under pressure and were dismissed for 228 with seven overs to spare at the Sher-e-Bangla stadium.</p>
<p><strong>Early fight</strong></p>
<p>Skipper Mushfiqur Rahim top-scored with 79 off 83 balls and opener Anamul Haque made 42, but none of the other batsmen settled in as Sri Lanka grabbed wickets at regular intervals. Lasith Malinga, Sachithra Senanayake, Thisara Perera and Ajantha Mendis picked up two wickets each, while part-time off-spinner Ashan Priyanjan took one.</p>
<p>The series win sealed Sri Lanka’s domination during the month-long tour where they won the two-Test series 1-0 and secured both the Twenty20 matches. The final one-dayer will be played on Saturday.</p>
<p>It was just the boost Angelo Mathews’ men needed ahead of the five-nation Asia Cup one-day tournament which opens in Bangladesh on Tuesday. Priyanjan (60) helped Sangakkara put on 114 for the fourth wicket after the tourists, who elected to bat, were reduced to 63-3 by the 13th over.</p>
<p>Mathews lifted the total with an unbeaten 56 off 39 balls, having added 83 for the fifth wicket with Sangakkara.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> Sri Lanka 289/6 in 50 overs (K Sangakkara 128, A Priyanjan 60, A Mathews 56*; Rubel Hossain 3/76, Arafat Sunny 1/44) beat Bangladesh 228 all out in 43 overs (Mushfiqur Rahim 79, Anamul Haque 42; S Senanayake 2/33, T Perera 2/40, A Mendis 2/42) by 61 runs</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989875&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/deanelgarapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990056" alt="Dean Elgar, who took 20 balls to score his first run in this match, opened his tally against Australia, having been dismissed for a pair in Perth on his Test debut (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/deanelgarapm.jpg" /></a> Dean Elgar, who took 20 balls to score his first run in this match, opened his tally against Australia, having been dismissed for a pair in Perth on his Test debut (AP)
<p>Australia showed patience on a sluggish pitch and against a stubborn Dean Elgar to take two late wickets and reclaim control over South Africa on the first day of the second test on Thursday. Spinners Nathan Lyon, who took 2-47, and Steve Smith removed Elgar for 83 and Quinton de Kock cheaply on debut in the final session to have the hosts 214-5 when bad light stopped play at St. George’s Park.</p>
<p>The visitors had initially reduced South Africa to 11-2 but then had to absorb pressure itself when Elgar shared a century stand with Faf du Plessis (55) and half-century partnership with AB de Villiers, who was 51 not out.  “Test match cricket is all about patience,’’ Lyon said.</p>
<p>South Africa found some solace from Mitchell Johnson’s slower pace on a sleepy seaside pitch, to be 181-3 at one point, but Elgar threw away his wicket and a second test century trying to heave offspinner Lyon down the ground.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old De Kock, flown in on Wednesday night to make his debut, tried to do the same in the first over from legspinner Smith and was caught at mid-off for 7 and trudged back to the pavilion utterly despondent.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty much the slowest I’ve seen PE play,’’ Elgar said, praising the Australians’ persistence. “They stuck to their game plan the whole day.’’</p>
<p>Earlier, No. 1 test batsman De Villiers, the one South African to resist the lethal performance from left-arm quick Johnson in Australia’s 281-run win in the first test, resisted again and has now made half-centuries in 12 consecutive tests, a record.</p>
<p>Du Plessis and Elgar made half-centuries, with Elgar responding to the challenge of opening after Alviro Petersen was ruled out by illness on the morning of the test.</p>
<p>Du Plessis was out to Lyon for 55, but his 112-run stand with Elgar lifted the South Africans from real trouble early on when fast bowlers Ryan Harris and Johnson initially pounced on a shaky buildup by the home team, which had problems naming its team because of Petersen’s illness and a late injury to bowler Vernon Philander and was uncertain of its lineup until minutes before the toss.</p>
<p><strong>Worthy promotion</strong></p>
<p>Elgar had already been in line to replace injured allrounder Ryan McLaren, but South Africa pushed him up to open and brought in De Kock after Petersen’s late viral infection. Wayne Parnell was recalled for spinner Robin Peterson and bowler Philander passed a fitness test on a tight right hamstring just minutes before the toss, with South Africa captain Graeme Smith finalizing his team with a pen and paper in a frenzied few minutes out in the middle just before choosing to bat under heavy cloud cover.</p>
<p>With South Africa in early disarray, Harris and Johnson struck, with Harris extracting seam movement off a fairly grassy surface to send Smith back lbw for 9. Johnson had Hashim Amla, also lbw, for a duck and Australia had South Africa under grinding pressure again in the muggy and overcast conditions.</p>
<p>The South Africans didn’t completely subdue Johnson but they found the going much easier on the south coast after their first-test nightmare against the fast bowler on a cracking surface up in Centurion.</p>
<p>Elgar and Du Plessis managed Johnson more than dominated him, with Elgar hit on the upper arm and on the shoulder by short-pitched balls from Johnson. He took a painstaking 20 balls and 42 minutes to score his first run, but gritted it out and later unleashed two sixes off Lyon as he passed 50 for the second time in tests.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores:</strong> SA 214/5 in 83 overs (D Elgar 83, F du Plessis 55, Ab de Villiers 51*; N Lyon 2/47, S Smith 1/18, R Harris 1/36)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989868&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mahendrasinghdhonimreuters.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990052" alt="India haven't won an overseas Test match in 12 attempts, in which time they have lost four away Test series (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mahendrasinghdhonimreuters.jpg" /></a> India haven&#8217;t won an overseas Test match in 12 attempts, in which time they have lost four away Test series (Reuters)
<p>If I was allowed one question of India’s Test cricketers, and was guaranteed an honest answer, I would ask “Do you, deep down in your heart, believe you can win Test matches away?” I wouldn’t ask it out of sarcasm, or a desire to play to the gallery, I would ask it because a lot of actions emerge from true feelings. I would also ask it because I have asked it of players who travelled overseas in the late eighties and nineties and they were honest enough to say that they didn’t believe they could.</p>
<p>But since it doesn’t matter what I ask, or what I feel, it is important that someone who matters does. Eight Test matches were lost in England and Australia and if the question was indeed asked then, it remained secret. But the answer, and the resultant solution, didn’t manifest itself. You could say, as Dhoni has tried to, that this is a different side, that the ageing batting line-up of those crippling losses has given way to a younger lot, and that therefore this team needs time. In fairness to that argument, India created winning positions in two of the last four tests but the ease with which those were subsequently squandered was indicative of a deeper issue.</p>
<p><strong>On field battles</strong></p>
<p>And so, now the hard question must be asked. And answered. And it must begin with whether or not the players, individually and as a team, genuinely believe they can win overseas; whether they respect each other enough as players to think that one of them can effect a turnaround in a Test match. India’s cricket administration, having won so many off-field battles with well planned campaigns, needs to spend a little more time in trying to win a battle on the field. For that, you must know why you are losing.</p>
<p>If you look at the away scorecards of matches between 2002-07, which was a good phase, some things become apparent. For a start, the batsmen made a lot of runs; it was the coming together of an extraordinary quintet of batsmen. With Dhawan, Pujara, Kohli and Rahane, maybe that phase can return though it is best not to live with such expectation. In seven Tests in Australia and Pakistan in 2003-04, India had scores of 409, 523, 366, 705, 211-2, 675 and 600! India won three out of those seven Tests but lost two and again the scorecards tell a story. While there were sporadic individual bursts, Agarkar at Adelaide, Pathan and Balaji in Pakistan, India’s bowling wasn’t scaring anyone. The opposition in those Tests made 323, 284-3, 556, 558, 474, 376-6, 407 and 489. What India seem to have done well was to capitalise on opportunities created which, in the years ahead, came from shooting stars like Sreesanth, RP Singh, and from Zaheer Khan.</p>
<p>There was another reason. Inevitably Anil Kumble and/or Harbhajan Singh would pick up wickets. There might have been long periods of toil but there were wickets. Kumble took five in the first innings in the win at Adelaide and they took eleven between them in that heartwarming win at Leeds. And so it is my theory that India are missing a quality spinner which, if anything, must hurt those that manage Indian cricket even more.</p>
<p>There could be another factor and that is why I would ask that first question of the captain. Does Dhoni believe that India can win overseas and I greatly fear that the answer to that question is “no”. Sanjay Manjrekar has a theory, propounded on air, that Dhoni likes bowlers who keep things quiet and therefore delay the march of the opposition. Hence, he says, the fascination with Ishant Sharma. Given the fields he so often sets it is a theory that has some legs to it.</p>
<p><strong>Short-format bullies?</strong></p>
<p>The other theory, also worth giving time to, is that India’s relative success in limited overs cricket in recent times has created a mindset where things must happen quickly and so India cannot retain intensity beyond 50 overs. In Indian conditions, the game often changes in that much time and so it could explain why Dhoni seems to let the game drift after a while in overseas conditions. And might offer an explanation for England’s win in 2012 where they forced India to field long hours.</p>
<p>Losing overseas is now an epidemic and epidemics must call for tough measures. India have got what they wanted off the field and so now might be a good time to start giving their army of fans what they want on the field. Maybe there is a second question to be asked, this time of those that run the game. “Do you genuinely want India to be the number one team in the world for a significant period of time?”</p>
<p>There are nine away Tests in the next twelve months. Many tough questions will be asked on the field. If tough questions were asked off it, it might lighten the questions on it.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989861&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barcelona have been charged by a Spanish court with committing tax fraud in the signing of Brazil forward Neymar last year in the latest twist to a saga that has already claimed the scalp of one club president. Neymar’s high-profile move to the Catalan capital from Santos in the close season was initially shrouded in mystery and it was unclear what exactly was paid to whom and when.</p>
<p>After president Sandro Rosell stepped down last month following an allegation of misappropriation of funds made by a club member, Barca admitted Neymar had cost 86.2 million euros ($118.6 million), including payments to the player and his family, and not 57.1 million as they originally said.</p>
<p>“Judge Pablo Ruz has charged FC Barcelona with an infringement against the tax authority relating to the purchase of the Brazilian player (Neymar),” a spokesman for the Madrid court hearing the case said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The judge had requested Barca’s tax records relating to the Neymar deal and had asked the tax authority to calculate the scale of the alleged fraud.</p>
<p>Barca denied wrongdoing after local media reported on Wednesday that Spain’s public prosecutor had asked the judge to lay charges.</p>
<p>“The club’s actions have, at all times, regarding that operation (to sign Neymar) and in line with the available information, been fully compliant with existing law,” Barca said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Spanish champions added they would be sending legal representatives to court “in the coming days” to defend their rights and interests. “At the same time (Barca) states its complete availability to collaborate with the justice authorities.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989859&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bayernmunicharsenalm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1990097" alt="Arsenal’s Wojciech Szczesny (L) challenges Bayern’s Arjen Robben (R) before he was sent off (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/bayernmunicharsenalm.jpg" /></a> Arsenal’s Wojciech Szczesny (L) challenges Bayern’s Arjen Robben (R) before he was sent off (Reuters)
<p>Bayern Munich and Barcelona are among the most accomplished and most attractive teams in the world. Both are capable of winning the Champions League outright and neither needs outside assistance to beat opponents along the way.</p>
<p>They seem to be getting the breaks anyway.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Barca won, 2-0, at Manchester City after the home side was reduced to 10 men for most of the second half. On Wednesday, Bayern won by the same score at Arsenal after the home side was reduced to 10 men before halftime.</p>
<p>There was nothing sinister or wrong in either case. City defender Martin Demichelis made a desperate tackle on Lionel Messi and the law says it is an automatic red card to deny a goal- scoring opportunity with a foul.</p>
<p>Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny took a rash kick, missed the ball and swiped the shin of Arjen Robben, and once again the referee correctly applied the letter of the law. He sent Szczesny off and awarded Munich the clear penalty.</p>
<p>As it happened, Bayern’s David Alaba missed the kick, hitting the base of a post. But Bayern Munich is too good a side not to hurt a depleted opponent — and fine goals from Toni Kroos and Thomas Muller converted the numerical advantage into a comfortable away win.</p>
<p><strong>DOUBLE JEOPARDY</strong></p>
<p>The rule amounts to double jeopardy. The law states that a foul that denies an obvious scoring opportunity will automatically be punished by the red card. And if it occurs inside the 18-yard penalty box, then the award of a penalty kick (an obvious scoring opportunity) is automatic as well.</p>
<p>Most people of fair mind regard this double punishment as excessive. FIFA sees it as the answer to foul play. The red card is mandatory and the referee has no discretion to decide whether a penalty kick is sufficient. And often — certainly in the two Champions League encounters this week — the game is marred as a spectacle thereafter.</p>
<p>In the words of the Bayern coach, Pep Guardiola, on television after the game, “Arsenal was much, much better than us for the first 10 to 15 minutes. After the red card, it was another game.”</p>
<p>Certainly it was. Arsenal, even Wenger’s Arsenal — noted for its adventurous, even romantic play — withdrew all nine remaining outfield players behind the ball. Against the reigning European champion, that time could not last forever.</p>
<p><strong>MISSED CHANCES</strong></p>
<p>Arsenal had its chances early. After eight minutes, Mesut Ozil, a German and a national team colleague of many on the Bayern team, missed a penalty kick of his own. Ozil had won the penalty award when he tricked Jerome Boateng into a clumsy foul that the Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli decided was worth a yellow card.</p>
<p>But it is a puzzle why Ozil was Arsenal’s designated penalty taker. He had fluffed his two previous penalties and confidence has drained from him over the past two months. But attempt it he did. His run-up was tentative, his shot tame and Manuel Neuer, the goalkeeper who has known all there is to know about Ozil since they grew up together, stopped the shot with a mighty right hand.</p>
<p>So two penalties awarded, none converted. However, with the relentless Munich attacks bearing down, the defiant but tiring Arsenal defense was bound to fall. It did so twice.</p>
<p>At 54 minutes, Kroos, Robben and Philipp Lahm, the most inventive performers on the field, combined.</p>
<p>The shot from Kroos, arched toward the top corner, had just enough swerve and surprise to brush the glove of Arsenal’s reserve goalie, Lukasz Fabianski, before it nestled in the net.</p>
<p>Then, minutes before the end of the game, a Bayern substitute, Claudio Pizarro, made a decoy run to pull Arsenal’s big defender, Per Mertesacker, away from the goalmouth. It was all planned.</p>
<p>Muller, another sub, was fit, fresh and alert enough to strike with a well-timed stooping header.</p>
<p>Arsenal’s resolve was demolished. Every Wenger player, and the coach himself, will tell himself that they won in Munich a year ago, so why would they not believe they can do the same in the second leg next month?</p>
<p>The answer is that Bayern’s players know they were complacent then. They did not need the points, so they relaxed and were beaten. No one dared, as Arsenal dared that night in Bavaria, to take the game to Munich.</p>
<p><strong>HOME BLUES </strong></p>
<p>Bayern has not lost a game it needed to win in the past 16 months in becoming the Bundesliga, German Cup, Champions League and World Club Cup holder.</p>
<p>There is a pattern developing, and not only in Munich. All four matches in Champions League this week were won by the away team. None of the four home teams scored even one goal.</p>
<p>That was the case in Italy, where A.C. Milan, trying to rebuild under new coach Clarence Seedorf, succumbed, 1-0, to Atletico Madrid on Wednesday. Diego Costa, That may have been the closest encounter of the round of 16 games this week, but Atletico often finds a way to eke out a goal in tight contests — and often that way is Diego Costa, whose topwering looping header won it for them.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989858&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/msdhoniapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1974703" alt="Dhoni picked up the injury during the third day of the second Test against New Zealand." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/01/msdhoniapm.jpg" /></a> Dhoni picked up the injury during the third day of the second Test against New Zealand.
<p>Mahendra  Singh Dhoni has been ruled out of the Asia Cup, which starts next week in Bangladesh, owing to a side strain that he picked up during the second Test in New Zealand. The Indian skipper, who landed in Mumbai along with the rest of the team on Wednesday night, will now undergo a 10-day rehabilitation to recover from a Grade I left side-strain that he suffered while diving to collect a ball in Wellington. Virat Kohli will take over the reins as India fight it out against sub-contintental rivals Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan during the two-week tournament.</p>
<p>“He has informed the BCCI that he has a pain in his side and that he is still unsure whether he can travel to Bangladesh next week. Virat will be leading the side at the Asia Cup,” a BCCI official said.</p>
<p>Sanjay Patel, BCCI secretary, told The Indian Express that Dhoni’s injury wasn’t so serious that he would miss the upcoming World T20 in Bangladesh. “It isn’t serious. He picked up the injury during the third day of the second Test against New Zealand. The team physio submitted his report and then a second physio, the NCA physio, was consulted, and accordingly the decision was taken. He would be available for the World T20,” Patel said.</p>
<p>The enforced break though could very well be a blessing in disguise for the beleagured Indian skipper. His leadership has come under heavy fire of late following the disastrous tour to New Zealand, where Dhoni &amp; Co failed to win a single international match—not to forget his abysmal record away from home over the last few years. At the same time, the 33-year-old has also been playing non-stop cricket for close to seven months. And the two weeks off prior to the World T20, also in Bangladesh, will be an opportunity for the experienced skipper to fight off his fatigue, both physical and mental.</p>
<p>This will also be a chance for Kohli to showcase his captaincy credentials. While many experts have called for the youngster to step in as captain even in Tests, this will be his first major ODI assignment after he had led India to a 5-0 win in a series in Zimbabwe last year.</p>
<p>Kohli surely won’t have it as easy as he did in Zimbabwe, considering the circumstances in which he will be taking over the leadership role. India were thrashed by both New Zealand and South Africa in the one-dayers before the Test matches on those respective tours and his side have more than just pride to play for in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>And what will make matters worse for this rookie captain is the fact that his side, minus Dhoni the finisher, will be taking on the Asian powerhouses in conditions rather suitable for their exploits.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dhoni will be replaced behind the stumps by Dinesh Karthik, who recently hit back-to-back centuries in the ongoing Corporate Trophy for India Cements.</p>
<p><strong>‘Can’t afford to fail again’</strong></p>
<p>Sourav Ganguly believes it is only experience that forces MS Dhoni to remain as captain for India’s tour of England and Australia, countries in which they got blanked in Test cricket the last time around, later this year.</p>
<p>“If he fails again, then it’s time to bring a new captain,” Ganguly said. “He has to be bold in taking decisions. He needs to take risks to win. Sometimes, his decisions are negative.”</p>

<p>India Test discard Virender Sehwag has been roped in to captain the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) squad in a four-day Champion County match against Durham starting March 23 in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>“Virender Sehwag and Muttiah Muralitharan have been confirmed as part of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) squad that will travel to Abu Dhabi next month,” the MCC said in a statement.</p>
<p>Also in the squad are England’s Monty Panesar and Sri Lankan wicket-keeper batsman Prasanna Jayawardene, as well as a host of young county players including Kent’s Daniel Bell-Drummond, Lancashire’s Luis Reece and Middlesex opener Sam Robson, who has been in great form for England Lions in Sri Lanka this winter.</p>
<p>Sehwag, who is confirmed to appear in the MCC v Rest of the World Lord’s Bicentenary match on July 5, said: “I was delighted to be asked to play in this match, and being able to captain the MCC side makes it even more of a privilege. We’re taking a very strong squad out to Abu Dhabi so I’m sure the standard of cricket on show will be very high. It’s also very exciting to be playing under lights with the pink ball.</p>
<p>The MCC team will arrive in Abu Dhabi to take part in the Emirates T20 tournament on March 21 which also features Lancashire, Sussex, Durham and an Emirates Select XI. Lancashire will then play 50-over matches against an MCC Universities Combined XI and MCC Young Cricketers.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989585&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ireland added to their list of giant-killing victories with a six-wicket win over World Twenty20 champions West Indies in the first T20 international at Jamaica&#8217;s Sabina Park.</p>
<p>It was at the Kingston venue where Ireland dramatically defeated Pakistan in a St Patrick&#8217;s Day 50-over World Cup match back in 2007.</p>
<p>And seven years on from that success, Ireland &#8212; the leading non-Test cricket nation &#8212; upset one of the sport&#8217;s &#8216;big boys&#8217; once again, with former England batsman Ed Joyce making a decisive 40 not out.</p>
<p>After the West Indies won the toss and batted, a good all-round Ireland effort in the field saw the hosts restricted to 116 for eight in their 20 overs.</p>
<p>Tim Murtagh, Alex Cusack and Kevin O&#8217;Brien took two wickets apiece, with Cusack capturing the prize scalp of dangerman Chris Gayle for a meagre innings top score of 18.</p>
<p>Ireland, coached by former West Indies batsman Phil Simmons, collapsed to 37 for three in reply.</p>
<p>But a stand of 58 between Joyce, captain of English county side Sussex, and Andrew Porter steadied the innings.</p>
<p>Joyce&#8217;s runs came off 49 balls, and it was left to Kevin O&#8217;Brien &#8212; just one of two survivors from the Ireland team that beat Pakistan at Sabina Park in 2007 &#8212; to hit the winning runs as the men in green got home on 117 for four with five balls to spare.</p>
<p>West Indies and Ireland meet again over 20 overs at Sabina Park on Friday before contesting a one-off one-day international at the same ground on Sunday.</p>
<p>Next month sees the West Indies defend their global title at the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh &#8212; a tournament where Ireland&#8217;s first match is a St Patrick&#8217;s Day clash against Zimbabwe on March 17.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989535&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>By: SAMUEL PETREQUIN</strong></p>
<p>Despite a ruling damaging to his already tarnished image, Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone won a multimillion-dollar case at London&#8217;s High Court on Thursday relating to the sale of F1 in 2005. The case was dismissed but the judge said it had nevertheless been a corrupt deal and questioned Ecclestone&#8217;s honesty.</p>
<p>“Even making allowances for the lapse of time and Mr. Ecclestone’s age, I am afraid that I find it impossible to regard him as a reliable or truthful witness,” Judge Guy Newey said.</p>
<p>A former F1 shareholder, German media company Constantin Medien, sued Ecclestone and other defendants for up to $144 million, claiming F1 was undervalued at the time of the sale to investment group CVC Capital Partners.</p>
<p>The 83-year-old Ecclestone was accused of entering into a “corrupt agreement” with German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to facilitate the sale of Formula One Group to a buyer chosen by him. The High Court said the deal was corrupt, but ruled that Constantin Medien did not lose out as a result.</p>
<p>“No loss to Constantin has been shown to have been caused by the corrupt arrangement with Dr. Gribkowsky,” the judge said in his conclusions. “That fact is fatal to the claim.”</p>
<p>Ecclestone’s camp played down the judge&#8217;s decision, arguing that his ruling was made after hearing only partial evidence. “The judge has expressed his opinion that on the balance of probabilities there was an unlawful agreement made with Dr. Gribkowsky and that payments that Mr. Ecclestone made for Dr. Gribkowsky&#8217;s benefit were a bribe, but this view is not underpinned by reliable evidence,” read a statement on behalf of Ecclestone.</p>
<p>“The source of these allegations is Dr. Gribkowsky himself, who did not give evidence in this case. The judge expressly recognised there was clearly considerable force in the point that there had been no opportunity for Mr. Ecclestone’s (and the other defendants) legal team to cross examine important witnesses, including Dr. Gribkowsky.”</p>
<p>During the trial, which ran from October to December last year, Constantin Medien’s lawyers said that payments totaling about 27 million pounds ($45 million) were made to Gribkowsky at the instigation of Ecclestone.</p>
<p>Gribkowsky, who was in charge of selling German bank BayernLB’s 47 percent stake in F1 to CVC, has already been found guilty of corruption, tax evasion and breach of trust and is serving a prison sentence. Ecclestone acknowledged during Gribkowsky&#8217;s trial that he made the payment to avoid being reported by the banker to authorities over his tax affairs.</p>
<p><strong>Payments not above board </strong></p>
<p>“The payments were a bribe,” the judge said. “They were made because Mr. Ecclestone had entered into a corrupt agreement with Dr. Gribkowsky in May 2005 under which Dr. Gribkowsky was to be rewarded for facilitating the sale of BLB&#8217;s shares in the Formula One Group to a buyer acceptable to Mr. Ecclestone.”</p>
<p>Constantin said it would appeal the decision. “The judge ruled against Constantin essentially on technical grounds — including extremely complicated questions of German law which is the governing law in the case — and Constantin will be appealing those findings,” said lawyer Keith Oliver, head of commercial fraud litigation at Peters and Peters Solicitors.</p>
<p>Ecclestone is also facing trial in Germany. He is charged with bribery and incitement to breach of trust connected with the payment to Gribkowsky. The trial will begin on April 24 and is set to run until September 16.   <strong>(AP)</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989528&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Pakistan&#8217;s bowling coach Muhammad Akram has said that the upcoming Asia Cup in Bangladesh will be a tough assignment for all teams and not just arch-rivals India but minnows Afghanistan too can pose serious threats on batsman-friendly conditions.</p>
<p>Akram, a former Test pacer who has been given a new two-year contract by the Pakistan Cricket Board, said it was not just about India in the Asia Cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think overall it will be a tough tournament for all teams because in conditions which favour the batsmen even Afghanistan can be a threat,&#8221; Akram told reporters at the Gaddafi stadium.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even Afghanistan can&#8217;t be taken lightly in the Asia Cup and it is a competition that any team can win,&#8221; he pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the teams are tough customers in tough conditions but obviously the India match will be important. But the way our bowlers have been bowling in recent times I am confident we can do well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked to comment on India&#8217;s strong batting line-up, Akram said Pakistan possesses a formidable bowling attack to tame the willow-wielders of the neighbouring country.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will give you an interesting fact that in the 2200 overs we have bowled in Test and ODIs in last one and half year, our bowlers have just sent down four no-balls,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Insisting that this was an indication of how disciplined the bowlers were, he said in the last 55 matches Pakistani bowlers had bowled out a team 30 times for less than 200 runs.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am not wrong only five times a team has crossed 300 against us in these conditions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Akram also talked about implementing a rotation policy for the Pakistani bowlers given the huge amount of international cricket being played these days.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have spoken to the two captains about having a rotation policy for the bowlers. With Muhammad Talha joining us and Umar Gul returning to the team, I think we have the back up to adopt a rotation policy,&#8221; he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989515&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/zaheerkhanreutersm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989355" alt="Zaheer Khan is the second most successful India seamer after Kapil Dev (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/zaheerkhanreutersm1.jpg" /></a> Zaheer Khan is the second most successful India seamer after Kapil Dev (Reuters)
<p>Former captain Rahul Dravid feels it is time for Zaheer Khan to start deliberating on his future as it would be difficult for the senior pacer to survive the rigours of five Test matches when India tour England later this year.</p>
<p>Zaheer, who made a comeback to the Test team during the disastrous tours of South Africa and New Zealand after a long injury lay-off, failed to trouble the batsmen.</p>
<p>Although he bowled 51 overs and took a five-wicket haul in the second innings of the Wellington Test against New Zealand recently, he looked far from impressive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can he survive five Test matches in England? I am not so sure,&#8221; Dravid was quoted as saying by &#8216;ESPNcricinfo&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is a question he deeply needs to ask himself. He doesn&#8217;t want to end up being someone who struggles his way through to the end. It can be really hard. And we have seen, he struggled to back up time and time again in these two series. So that&#8217;s an issue he needs to consider, Indian selectors need to consider,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With 311 wickets in 92 Tests, Zaheer is the second most successful India seamer after Kapil Dev but his career has been plagued by injuries.</p>
<p>Dravid said he would hate to see Zaheer end his career on a low.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been a great bowler for India, arguably the finest India fast bowler since Kapil Dev. I would hate to see Zaheer Khan end his career bowling 120-125 kph and limp away from international cricket.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has done a great job to get himself fit for these two series and to be fair, he has bowled well in patches, he has bowled consistently,&#8221; said Dravid.</p>
<p>Talking about Indian spinners, Dravid said in the past also they had struggled in overseas conditions and people need to be patient with them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will need to show some patience with our spinners, whether it is R Ashwin or whether it&#8217;s (Ravindra) Jadeja, it&#8217;s early days for both in international cricket,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have seen some greats of Indian cricket, including Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, take a long time to get used to bowling with a Kookaburra ball in overseas conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought we were a little bit impatient with Ashwin. We haven&#8217;t given him as much a run as I would like, so I think there is an opportunity for him to get back into the side and play a few more games. He will only learn if he play more games,&#8221; insisted Dravid.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989353&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Holders Bayern Munich survived an early battering to beat 10-man Arsenal 2-0 on a night of high drama in the Champions League on Wednesday as both teams missed penalties and home goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off.</p>
<p>A year to the day after the Germans beat Arsenal 3-1 at the Emirates Stadium in their last-16 first leg tie, Bayern handed out another beating to Arsene Wenger&#8217;s men at the same stage of the competition.</p>
<p>Second-half goals from the outstanding Toni Kroos, who curled in a right-foot shot, and substitute Thomas Mueller put the champions a giant step closer to the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Earlier, Arsenal&#8217;s Mesut Ozil missed an eighth-minute penalty and David Alaba did the same for Bayern 32 minutes later after Szczesny was dismissed by Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli for clattering Arjen Robben in the area.</p>
<p>Arsenal now have to better what they did a year ago in the second leg when they almost defied the odds by coming back to win 2-0 in Munich as Bayern advanced on the away goals rule.</p>
<p>The Bavarians returned to London in May to beat Borussia Dortmund in an all-German final at Wembley and Wednesday&#8217;s game was their first match back in the capital since.</p>
<p>Bayern&#8217;s victory came 24 hours after Barcelona inflicted a 2-0 home defeat on Manchester City, making it unlikely that two of England&#8217;s dominant clubs will advance much further this season.</p>
<p>Arsenal, like City on Tuesday, ended the match with 10 men but unlike their Premier League rivals they took the game to their opponents and, certainly until Szczesny&#8217;s sending-off, gave as good as they got.</p>
<p>&#8220;The referee made a decision that basically killed the game,&#8221; Wenger told reporters. &#8220;I think our keeper went in for the ball, he touched Robben who made more of it (than he should) and I told Robben that.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t over because we will fight until the end. Last year we lost here and won there and we have to try and do that again.&#8221;<br />
Pep Guardiola, who took over from Jupp Heynckes as Bayern coach in the close season, said his team were somewhat fortunate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were lucky,&#8221; said the Spaniard. &#8220;Our keeper Manuel Neuer, the best in the world, showed his qualities.</p>
<p>&#8220;After that we played better and started dominating the game and in the end we deserved to win it.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Bright start</strong></p>
<p>Arsenal, mindful that Bayern virtually had last year&#8217;s tie won inside the first 20 minutes, ripped into their opponents from the start but their early dominance failed to produce a goal.</p>
<p>The London club&#8217;s attacking opening should have brought them the lead when Rizzoli awarded a penalty after Jerome Boateng tripped Ozil. But the German playmaker wasted the spot kick with a soft chipped attempt down the middle that Neuer easily saved.</p>
<p>Arsenal kept surging forward with Santi Cazorla, who made way for substitute goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski after the red card, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain having chances to score.</p>
<p>At the other end Kroos brought a superb flying one-handed saved from Szczesny, his main contribution before he was sent off.</p>
<p>After the dismissal Bayern wrestled away control of the midfield with Lahm and Kroos causing problems on the right and Robben marauding down the middle.</p>
<p>Their undoubted superiority was rewarded with two fine goals in the 54th and 88th minutes and the visitors could have had a third when a rasping shot from Kroos hit the post in stoppage time.</p>
<p>Bayern have now scored in 51 consecutive matches since Arsenal beat them last year and on this form look capable of becoming the first team to retain the trophy since the Champions League format began in 1992-93.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1989283&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/himanshuthakurreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989274" alt="Himanshu Thakur did manage to complete two runs, a feat beyond nearly a quarter of the 109 on the start list (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/himanshuthakurreutersm.jpg" /></a> Himanshu Thakur did manage to complete two runs, a feat beyond nearly a quarter of the 109 on the start list (Reuters)
<p>India’s only Olympic Alpine skier Himanshu Thakur finished last in the men’s giant slalom on Wednesday and cannot wait for the Sochi Games to end. Not because he is homesick or fed-up with his performance — he just wants to walk with his country’s flag at the closing ceremony after being denied that honour when the torch was lit nearly two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old from the foothills of the Himalayas had to march behind an Olympic flag when the Games began because of a ban on India’s Olympic Association due to the election of a corruption-tainted official as secretary general.</p>
<p>The ban was lifted last week after fresh elections, meaning India’s team of three — who entered the Sochi Games as “independents” — can wear their country’s colours with pride.</p>
<p><strong>‘Bad Feeling’</strong></p>
<p>“It was a bad feeling I think at the opening ceremony because I was under the IOC flag,” Thakur said on Wednesday after finishing 72nd — 26 seconds behind his favourite skier, Ted Ligety of the United States.</p>
<p>“It was a bad feeling because I was not representing my country. After February 11 the IOC gave us our country back because of the fresh elections.</p>
<p>“I’m proud to put the flag up (in the athletes village). My parents, teacher and friends were very proud.</p>
<p>“The closing ceremony I will be under my own flag and it will be nice for me.”</p>
<p>Despite being out of his depth on the slope, Thakur did manage to complete two runs, a feat beyond nearly a quarter of the 109 on the start list.</p>
<p>“I was a bit nervous when I came down but it was a good feeling when I finished my run,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988874&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Paris St Germain’s “Dream bigger” tagline may never sound so relevant. The French champions displayed their European ambitions with an impressive 4-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday that all but secured their place in the Champions League quarter-finals.</p>
<p>It also suggested they could be serious contenders for the title this season. “We had to send a clear message, and I think we have done that,” defender Maxwell said.</p>
<p>PSG were eager to be tested by tough opposition in Germany. But they proved too strong for Bayer in all areas, even without their injured Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani.</p>
<p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored twice — including another special strike from distance — to bring his European tally to 10 this term, and Yohan Cabaye celebrated his first PSG goal since arriving from Newcastle United in January. They were, though, aided by a Leverkusen team that had Emir Spahic sent off.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Paris is back&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>There had been doubts recently about PSG’s capacity to raise their level, after they were eliminated at home by Montpellier in the French Cup last-32 round and laboured to beat some low-key sides.</p>
<p>But the questions were gone on Wednesday morning. “The great Paris is back,” declared the sports newspaper L’Equipe. “Paris showed inspiration and character,” it added.</p>
<p>Midfielder Blaise Matuidi, who scored the third-minute opener and set up Ibrahimovic for the Swede’s second goal, said he had had the same feeling on the pitch. “We felt that we were strong,” the France international said. “We have a high-level midfield. With what we’ve achieved in the Champions League for two seasons, we are not going to hide ourselves. We are a great team.”</p>
<p>Ibrahimovic’s double on Tuesday took him ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo as the competition’s leading scorer this season with ten.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988873&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barcelona dismissed any notion they are a declining force when they won 2-0 at Manchester City on Tuesday to virtually guarantee their place in the quarterfinals of the Champions League for the seventh successive season. A match billed as a possible turning point in Manchester City’s history following their glitzy cash-laden rebirth fuelled by Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mansour’s heavy investment, ended in a comprehensive Barcelona win.</p>
<p>Barca, top of La Liga and in the Spanish Cup final, now look set to advance and make a mockery of the words of Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who said before the match: “This is the worst Barcelona team for many, many years, so City have a chance.”</p>
<p>However, this is City’s best team for many, many years too but it looks like that chance has already slipped away. While the second leg at the Nou Camp on March 12 is not entirely a formality, City will have to overcome considerable odds if they are to keep alive any dream of winning four trophies this season.</p>
<p>Since they first met English opposition in European competition in 1960, Barcelona have lost only two of 27 home matches with Liverpool winning both of them: A UEFA Cup match in 1976 and a Champions League game in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>Home defeats</strong></p>
<p>And only twice since the Champions League began 22 years ago has a side progressed after a home first leg defeat, a rare feat at the best of times and one City are likely to have to attempt without their coach Manuel Pellegrini on the bench.</p>
<p>The normally taciturn Chilean launched an astonishing verbal attack on referee Jonas Eriksson after the game, questioning his impartiality and accusing the Swedish official of deciding the outcome of the game.</p>
<p>City went behind when Eriksson awarded a penalty to Barcelona in the 53rd minute for a foul by Martin Demichelis on Lionel Messi that appeared to initially take place outside the area. Eriksson immediately dismissed Demichelis, leaving City with 10 men as Messi scored from the spot before Dani Alves added a second goal in the 90th minute.</p>
<p>Angry about the penalty and frustrated by conceding a second late goal, Pellegrini said, among other things: “I spoke to the referee at the end and told him he should be very happy because he decided the match.</p>
<p>“The referee was not impartial. He did not have any control of the game. I think it was not a good idea to have a referee from Sweden in such an important match. “More important football is played in Europe than in Sweden so a big game with two important teams &#8211; that kind of game needs a referee with more experience.”</p>
<p>Of more immediate concern to Pellegrini, rather than where he watches the game from, will be to devise a way City can turn this tie around after conceding two goals at home without scoring themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Blessing in disguise </strong></p>
<p>One blessing in disguise is that he will not be able to play Demichelis because the defender will be banned for the second leg and Pellegrini’s risk in playing him backfired. Demichelis has been one of the best defenders in Europe but is not the player he was and whether his lunge on Messi was just outside the box or not, he had no chance of catching his compatriot fairly.</p>
<p>Despite this setback, which could yet, though unlikely, still be overcome, Pellegrini and City have had a superb season and are still in contention for an English treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Capital One (League) Cup trophies.</p>
<p>They matched Barcelona well for periods of the game and although the visitors dominated the game in terms of possession and goals, City never made it easy for their opposition.</p>
<p>Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta told reporters afterwards that despite the win, the tie was far from settled and they would be taking nothing for granted in the second leg. “The result is fantastic for us because after the penalty and red card, they came back at us strongly, but our aim was to keep possession and we did that and won. But we are not over-confident for the second leg. A lot can happen in 90 minutes.”</p>
<p>Manchester City should have their Argentine striker Sergio Aguero back for the second leg on March 12.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988867&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2000, Jaywant Lele probably became the first man to deny a quote he gave to a television news channel. “I have been misquoted on television,” was his contention. Fourteen years since the late BCCI secretary’s famous faux pas, a former cricket administrator from across the border ended up with his foot in the mouth to equally hilarious effect.</p>
<p>Ex-Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ijaz Butt, speaking outside Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium, had barely managed to contain his disgust towards the ganging up of BCCI, ECB and CA while orchestrating the now contentious ICC revamp when he called the three boards ‘sons of pigs’. It was a comment  uttered in Punjabi, resulting in a lot of raised eyebrows, especially from the new PCB boss Najam Sethi, who standing next to him.</p>
<p>Butt had earlier requested the media to keep the statement off record, funnily with at least 10 cameras trained on him and a dozen microphones spread infront of him.</p>
<p>“Listen don’t quote me but in my personal opinion all three are sons of pigs,” he had said. He was quick to retract his statement, claiming, like Lele, that his quotes had been twisted. But it was too late for Butt, as his infamous ‘porky’ views had by then gone viral all over the internet.</p>
<p>Incidentally, he had aired his sentiments moments after a meeting Sethi where he discussd ICC’s structural changes. The Pakistan board were quick to distance themselves from their erstwhile chief’s judgements of the ‘big three’ leaving him standing tall as the ‘Butt’ of the cricket world’s jokes</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988858&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rafael Nadal is taking it easy at the Rio Open, nursing a back injury and hoping it gets better.  No. 1-ranked Nadal defeated fellow Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver in his first-round match on Tuesday night, his first in more than three weeks after losing the Australian Open final to Stanislaw Wawrinka.</p>
<p>Nadal was an overwhelming favorite in Australia to win his 14th Grand Slam title, but he picked up the back strain warming up and was never the same.  “When one comes back from an injury in a short period of time, you can always feel a need to be cautious,” he said. “I felt it (the back) a bit. But I hope things continue to improve day by day. Little by little the back will be strong again. I&#8217;ll get used to the competition and the back won&#8217;t keep me from playing future tournaments.<br />
”<br />
“I had a problem from Australia,” Nadal said. “I tried to work on it at home and I&#8217;m back playing again. At the beginning one is a bit afraid coming back from a problem. I&#8217;ve worked hard to try to come back.”</p>
<p>Nadal was sidelined for much of the 2012 season with a left knee injury. He used the Latin American clay-court circuit as his testing ground for the knee early in 2013. It went OK. He won the French and US Open. He&#8217;s at it again early in 2014 with his back, reminding some that Nadal&#8217;s big swings and aggressive play may be taking a toll on his 27-year-old body.</p>
<p>Nadal said after Tuesday&#8217;s match — his 800th —that he&#8217;d played better than he&#8217;d practiced. “It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve played on the surface (clay), so It&#8217;s normal to return without the best feeling,” he said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988854&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/barcelonaplayerm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989267" alt="Bidyananda (C) was nicknamed 'Honda' due to his resemblence to AC Milan's Japanese international Keisuke Honda" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/barcelonaplayerm.jpg" /></a> Bidyananda (C) was nicknamed &#8216;Honda&#8217; due to his resemblence to AC Milan&#8217;s Japanese international Keisuke Honda
<p>A shock of blonde hair ensured Bidyananda Singh was often the centre of attraction at a football training camp at Doha&#8217;s Aspire Academy, even though he was among a group of junior footballers featuring players from the Netherlands and Australia.</p>
<p>The week-long camp saw the India U-17 regular being rechristened &#8216;Honda&#8217;, due to his stark resemblance to AC Milan&#8217;s Japanese international, Keisuke Honda.</p>
<p>“They also called me that because they couldn&#8217;t pronounce my name,” said the 16-year-old, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>Singh, a defensive midfielder, was at the academy in the Qatari capital for a camp conducted by youth academy coaches from Barcelona, Manchester United and Inter Milan. By the end of his stint there, scouts from Barcelona had expressed an interest and have been following the youngster&#8217;s progress since.</p>
<p>Singh became one of the first Indians, along with Milan Basumatary, to play in the academy&#8217;s All Star team. Incidentally, he also scored the opening goal in his side&#8217;s 3-1 win over Ajax.</p>
<p>The irony of the nickname was that Singh&#8217;s involvement in the team came at the expense of other Japanese players at the academy. Despite the achievement, he lamented that his trip home would be delayed because of his Doha visit.</p>
<p><strong>A long journey</strong></p>
<p>Not long before Singh stepped on the neatly-manicured grass at the state-of-the-art Aspire Academy in Doha, where the Barcelona coaches declared him the player of the camp, he played his football on a surface littered with pebbles near his home in Moirang, Manipur.</p>
<p>Singh trains at the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Academy in Navi Mumbai, which has kept him away from home for a year.</p>
<p>Singh recalls leaving home at the age of 11 in 2008, to train at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) complex in Manipur, 45 km away from Moirang, where his skills were first recognised.</p>
<p>The decision wasn&#8217;t solely based on his love for the game. As the second son of a retired army-man from the Assam Rifles and a mother who ran a grocery store from their home, Singh recognised the strain his footballing ambitions put on the family. additionally, there were no coaches and very few coaches near his home.</p>
<p>“Moving to the SAI complex meant that my parents didn&#8217;t have to worry about my meals, nor did they have to worry about my equipment as the academy provided me with the boots and kit,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>National call-up</strong></p>
<p>A call-up to the national team arrived soon as the AIFF selected Singh to play in the U-13 team in 2009. He put in a string of steady performances at the base of the team&#8217;s midfield; this resulted in limited trips home.</p>
<p>One of his rare forays home, however, is not one he remembers fondly, even though it followed a U-14 tournament in Goa in 2010. “Nobody was home when I got there,” he recalls.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988850&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/delhiopentennism.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989251" alt="Maro Chiudinelli lost 7-5 6-4 to Ze Zhang of China" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/delhiopentennism.jpg" /></a> Maro Chiudinelli lost 7-5 6-4 to Ze Zhang of China
<p>Long before Stanislas Wawrinka was cast as “The Other Swiss” there was Marco Chiudinelli.</p>
<p>Chiudinelli, whose ranking rose to a career-high 52 in 2010, would be considered a reasonably successful tennis player by most yardsticks. He has made close to $1.5 million in prize money, reached the third round of the US Open a couple of times, defeated the likes of Marat Safin and Richard Gasquet when form and fitness came together and, for close to a decade, has been an integral part of his country’s Davis Cup team. Except that another eight-year old that Chiudinelli hit with at the All Boys tennis club in Basel, Roger Federer, would go on to re-define success.</p>
<p>It is something, this association with Federer, that the 32-year old has been asked about all his career, so much so that Chiudinelli has sort of devised a rule of thumb when confronted with it.</p>
<p>“Yeah well”, he says, “I had quite a lot of them (Federer-questions) last week in Kolkata. I am happy to answer a couple, but if there are too many I stop talking about it because, you know, I am not here to talk about Federer with people who cannot get hold of him.”</p>
<p>Chiudinelli, currently ranked 168, has just come off a surprise loss to Ze Zhang (ranked 229) in the second round of the Challenger event at Delhi, a tournament several rungs below the Grand Slams and the ATP Masters, events that Federer holds sway in.</p>
<p>In fact, Delhi is an unlikely setting for the 32-year old Chuidinelli too. The Challenger events are usually populated by rookies looking to accumulate enough points to allow them direct entry at tournaments of a better grade or by journeymen, playing both singles and doubles, trying to break even after paying for their travel and sometimes even lodging.</p>
<p>For Chuidinelli, this is perhaps one last shot at getting back to the elite level.</p>
<p>“It is a challenge at my age to stay focussed. I wish I was playing the bigger tournaments but that is the way it is, I have to work my way up from the Challenger level,” he says.</p>
<p>Chiudinelli may be border-line brutal in the assessment of his career (“Throughout my career it has never been easy. I haven’t really achieved that much,” he says) but he has his own piece of history. Along with Stanislas Wawrinka, Chiudinelli was a part of the longest doubles game in tennis history &#8211; the doubles rubber of Switzerland’s Davis Cup first round tie against the Czech Republic in 2013 lasted seven hours and two minutes.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we were unfortunately on the losing end (Chiudinelli and Wawrinka went down 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 7-6(7-3), 22-24 to Lukáš Rosol and Tomáš Berdych). It was definitely special to be out there for seven hours&#8230; it is a one time thing and unfortunately we lost it; it won’t happen again and that is the only regret, there won’t be a chance to make it better in a similar match,” he says.</p>
<p>For Chiudinelli, the tryst with Swiss tennis is something that has dogged him through his career, not least when journalists repeatedly bring it up. His best result in an ATP tournament came when he made the semifinal at the Swiss Indoor in Basel in 2009. He had a set point in the semifinal, but went on to lose 7-6, 6-3 to &#8211; you guessed right &#8211; Federer.</p>
<p>That was his best year on the circuit, when his ranking soared from 884 (November 2008) to 54 (November 2009), a run that saw him awarded the ATP Comeback Player of the Year for 2009. It was Federer who handed him the award. “I never had the chance to win big titles. It was a big thing for me, bigger than it would be for a top-ten guy who would have had many other trophies, which I don’t. It was very special to win whoever gave it to you. Roger was around to give it, it doesn’t matter to me who I received the trophy from, the main thing was that I received it,” he says.</p>
<p>Through the conversation, it is just once that Chiudinelli substitutes ‘Federer’ with a pronoun. “The game at Basel (against Federer), my hometown, was my most special match ever. I hadn’t gone that far before in a big tournament. Against him at the tournament where we both used to be ball boys was definitely a dream come true. Unfortunately for me, I came out with the wrong outcome,” he says.</p>
<p>Then, he adds: “But it was just nice to be a part of it.”</p>
<p><strong>Somdev progresses</strong></p>
<p>Somdev Devvarman put his scrappy performance from Tuesday behind him to register a straight-forward 6-2, 6-2 win over China’s Di Wu in just over an hour. It was only once in the second round game that Devvarman faced a break point, which he managed to save. Unlike Tuesday, Devvarman’s serve was in working against Di as he pounded down five aces. The second-seed will face China’s Ze Zhang, who beat Marco Chiudinelli, in the next round. Despite having a few match points, Yuki Bhambri and Michael Venus lost their quarterfinal clash with Vishnu Vardhan and Jeevan Nedunjezhian 6-3, 5-7, 11-9.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988844&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Mauled by Australia in first Test, South Africa will look to avoid losing their first series in five years.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988832&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mjohnsonm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988840" alt="In the form of his life, Mitchell Johnson took a career-best 12/127 in the first Test at Centurion." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mjohnsonm.jpg" /></a> In the form of his life, Mitchell Johnson took a career-best 12/127 in the first Test at Centurion.
<p>Michael Clarke was tempted by the question. Australia has a chance to mark its first Test in Port Elizabeth since 1997 with an era-changing series victory over top-ranked South Africa, something that would underline his team&#8217;s revival.</p>
<p>Had that been in the Aussie skipper&#8217;s mind at all in the buildup to the second Test at St. George&#8217;s Park?</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Clarke said on Wednesday, the day before the Test. But the seed had been planted. “It&#8217;s very exciting, there&#8217;s no doubt,” he added.</p>
<p>Then catching himself again, Clarke returned to reality. You can&#8217;t think about winning the series just one Test in. And anyway, Australia always took it match by match.  “Against such a good team, if you&#8217;re not concentrating on the job at hand, you&#8217;ll find yourself behind in the game and we can&#8217;t afford that,” Clarke said, reluctant to talk up a possible first series win by anyone over South Africa in five years. “I said the same in Australia in the summer. People ask me did you ever imagine you were going to win (the Ashes) 5-0 and you never think about that. We&#8217;re so focused on each Test match.”</p>
<p>The bigger picture is pretty clear, though. Probably to Clarke as much as anyone else.</p>
<p>Off the back of a 281-run mauling of the hosts at Centurion, where the South Africans are normally near-invincible and had won five of their six previous Tests by an innings, Australia is in strong contention to end the Proteas&#8217; unbeaten run.</p>
<p>In Mitchell Johnson, the tourists have the most feared fast bowler in the world and his career-best 12-127 in the first test shook the South Africans to their core no matter what their own positive spin on it is. And Australia has a good history at St. George&#8217;s Park.</p>
<p>Australia won its last Test at the seaside venue 17 years ago when Ian Healy hit a six to wrap up a come-from-behind win after conceding a first-innings deficit of 101. That game has gone down in Australian legend.</p>
<p>Clarke may not like to look too far forward, but he definitely reflected on Australia&#8217;s previous success at St. George&#8217;s, and mentioned it on Wednesday. South Africa, meanwhile, has a pretty shaky recent record at the venue.</p>
<p>So on Thursday and the first day of the second Test, Australia hopes to “run with the momentum,” after the victory at Centurion, Clarke said, because there&#8217;s no guarantee it&#8217;ll keep going the Aussies&#8217; way.</p>
<p>“In this game, it doesn&#8217;t last forever,” Clarke said. “I&#8217;m thrilled that we won the first Test. It&#8217;s a fantastic achievement to beat South Africa on their home soil. That&#8217;s something we should be very proud of. But that&#8217;s gone.”</p>
<p>South Africa has started some of its recent series slowly. But few as bad as this one. Beaten and beaten up at Centurion, and now without allrounder Ryan McLaren because of the concussion he sustained after being hit on the helmet by a Johnson bouncer, South Africa had one of its worst recent outings at Centurion.<br />
It needed to forget about it pretty quickly, captain Graeme Smith said.</p>
<p>“(We&#8217;re) not carrying too much baggage from Pretoria,” Smith said. “It&#8217;s important knowing Centurion is behind us, that we&#8217;re now in Port Elizabeth. That&#8217;s going to be the crucial mindset.”</p>
<p>Smith said South Africa&#8217;s plans were in place and it wasn&#8217;t becoming obsessed with the “hype” of Johnson&#8217;s wicket-taking and raw pace and hostility at SuperSport Park.<br />
“Obviously Mitchell has bowled extremely well, bowled aggressively. We all know that creates headlines, creates stories and creates fanfare,” Smith said. “And certainly there&#8217;s a huge amount of respect in our team for someone who&#8217;s performing well. But it&#8217;s important not to get caught up in that.”</p>
<p>Forced into at least one change, South Africa is considering batsman Dean Elgar or allrounder Wayne Parnell for McLaren&#8217;s spot at No. 7.  Australia must judge if allrounder Shane Watson is fit enough to return from a calf injury. Watson was due to train with the squad on Wednesday, Clarke said.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pakistan Cricket Board has formed a three-member fact finding committee to probe allegations made by former Test cricketer, Basit Ali that a fixed match was played in the just-concluded national T20 championship in Rawalpindi. A official of the board said that the three-member committee would include security manager, Colonel Waseem, Shafiq Ahmed, who is GM domestic cricket and independent member, Ali Naqvi.</p>
<p>Basit had alleged that the match between Sialkot Stallions and Karachi Dolphins was fixed. Karachi went on to win the low scoring match. Afterwards Sialkot captain, Shoaib Malik and his players made a public display of their anger with Basit&#8217;s allegations by wearing black armbands in their next match of the tournament.</p>
<p>The Sialkot team also refused to take the field if Basit was on the commentary team for the match. A reliable source said that Pakistan Cricket Board  Chairman, Najam Sethi had taken the allegations seriously and pushed for the formation of the three member committee.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988828&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/newzealandteamapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1989218" alt="The New Zealand squad seems a happy unit with Brendon McCullum and coach Mike Hesson sharing a good rapport from their days at Otago (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/newzealandteamapm.jpg" /></a> The New Zealand squad seems a happy unit with Brendon McCullum and coach Mike Hesson sharing a good rapport from their days at Otago (AP)
<p>It’s been a hot summer, both on and off the field, for the New Zealand cricket team, with the home calendar for international assignments concluding with a resounding draw — enough to secure a rare Test series win against one of the best Test teams in the world.</p>
<p>It has been an ‘Indian Summer’ for Brendon McCullum and the Black Caps, with the Indian and West Indian sides visiting New Zealand.</p>
<p>Much to the delight of every cricket fan in New Zealand, McCullum and his team have come out on top in both Test series, performing with a consistency not seen by watchers of New Zealand cricket for decades.</p>
<p>Success in the shorter formats against both sides also bodes well for the ICC World Cup next year, when New Zealand will enjoy home advantage while co-hosting the tournament with Australia.</p>
<p>But the talk of the summer really has been the side’s much improved performances in Tests and it has come with McCullum leading from the front — with newfound self-control and a sense of calm. This has brought some balance to a character who has never backed down from a challenge and has played high-risk high return cricket in the past.</p>
<p>McCullum, the number-one ranked batsman in the ICC’s ratings for T20, has curbed his natural strokeplay and accepted the responsibility to lead the side. He has bailed them out of several difficult positions this summer — none more perilous than during the last Test, when he strode in the team were 94/5 in the 2nd innings, still 152 runs shy of making India bat again.</p>
<p><strong>Knuckling down</strong></p>
<p>That’s when McCullum really knuckled down. In BJ Watling, he found a partner with who he could temper his natural aggression and inhibit his instinctive desire to destroy the bowling attack in a very public display of disdain. His 775-minute stay is the longest innings on record in Tests by a New Zealander. He also became the first Black Cap to score a Test triple-century — two amazing feats made even more impressive because they were achieved by the man who is currently the world’s best batsman in the shortest form of the game.</p>
<p>The signs are there that McCullum has come of age and has an understanding of his game that, hopefully, sets him up to achieve the greatness many bestowed upon him at an early age. He has always been a leader, regardless of whether he had the Captain’s “c” next to his name. Unfortunately, the controversy that surrounded Ross Taylor’s removal from the top spot tainted the new regime and quite possibly, stunted McCullum’s and the Black Caps’ growth at a time when a raft of young talent was coming through.</p>
<p>Now, with all that behind them, we are seeing what can happen when a motivated captain works closely with a well-organised coaching staff to create a style of play and a team ethos that everyone believes in, and the captain lives by.</p>
<p>Mike Hesson, the current Black Caps coach, has a long history of working closely with McCullum. Having come through Otago’s coaching system, it is no surprise that they’ve continued to build on that rapport with the national team. Hesson is a meticulous planner and in a country obsessed by many of it’s former sports-men and women, he has done exceptionally well to make it to the top without having played international cricket. There were many doubters before his appointment, but there was only one choice for captain once he was confirmed as coach.</p>
<p><strong>Generating momentum</strong></p>
<p>The Otago connection is strong and I have no doubt some serious thought and planning is going into the upcoming ICC World T20 to try and build on the momentum the team have generated, and secure a rare trophy on the world stage.</p>
<p>New Zealand has a young, dynamic and talented side that will be capable of upsetting anyone when they perform to potential. So, the New Zealand public has every right to be excited about what lies ahead.  With individuals like McCullum, Corey Anderson, Jimmy Neesham and Ross Taylor in the side, any one of them could take a game by the scruff of the neck and get New Zealand across the line.</p>
<p>The challenge that lies ahead for McCullum is how to harness that power and create an environment that gets the best out of all his players in a way that conforms to the team’s strategy and has the end goal in sight. McCullum need only look in the mirror to see the best example of what can be achieved when you harness raw power and put it in a space where it can capitalise on its talents, delivering on what the team is trying to achieve.</p>
<p>It has undoubtedly been a spectacular summer for McCullum and the BlackCaps but New Zealand fans, worn down and skeptical after years of frustration, will want to see this progress continue before they buy in to the Cricket World Cup hype and excitement that awaits them next summer. Just the type of challenge McCullum relishes.</p>

<p><em><strong>Following India’s winless streak, Daksh Panwar catches up with a nation on a celebration overdrive.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Jan 17-19, Napier</strong></p>
<p>Arrive in Auckland. Depart from Auckland. On board a fragile-looking single-engine aircraft. From 10,000 feet, New Zealand looks picture perfect, like a never-ending golf course. It&#8217;s very windy at Napier. The plane dives from one stream into the other. Hearts are beating faster. What would Rainman Dusting Hoffman have said of Air New Zealand, I think. It lands safely. The high-flying Indians crash-land in the tour opener, however. Lose despite a Virat Kohli century.</p>
<p><strong>Jan 20-22</strong></p>
<p>Catch a bus from Napier to Hamilton. Naked Bus, they call it. Only the name is suggestive, otherwise it&#8217;s a &#8216;family&#8217; bus. It&#8217;s a journey into the heart of Middle Earth. Every hamlet looks like the Shire, every tree seems like the Party Tree. Reach the laidback Hamilton. Walk past a slew of Indian restaurants to reach Seddon Park, the most Indian of all venues, thanks to a slow surface and turn. Corey Anderson hits five monstrous sixes. One of those is caught singlehandedly by Jatinder Singh in the embankment. Jatinder&#8217;s friend, who is wearing a India&#8217;s old Sahara logo shirt, was going for the catch before deciding against it. Sahara pulls out, (a) &#8216;star&#8217; steps in, a colleague puns on Team India&#8217;s sponsorship. India lose the rain-affected match.</p>
<p><strong>Auckland Jan 23-25</strong></p>
<p>Duncan Fletcher gives batting tips to Ravindra Jadeja in the nets. Jadeja gives batting classes to the top-order in the match. Take a bow, Bapu, it&#8217;s a tie.</p>
<p><strong>Hamilton Jan 26-28</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bumper summer for New Zealand in literature, arts and music. After Eleanor Catton&#8217;s Man Booker, now Lorde has won two Grammys. After Catton&#8217;s The Luminaries, the interest in astrology here seems to have shot up. For, the &#8216;stars are in alignment&#8217; is an oft-used phrase. The Indian team&#8217;s stars are in rearrangement, though. Shikhar Dhawan, Suresh Raina and Ishant Sharma are dropped; Ambati Rayudu, Stuart Binny and Varun Aaron are in. It brings no luck, India still lose.</p>
<p><strong>Wellington Jan 29-31</strong></p>
<p>India&#8217;s practice is at the Basin Reserve, one of the most beautiful cricket stadiums. But their match is at the hideous-looking monstrosity that is the WestPac Stadium. Looks like an ideal setting for Prison Break. No escaping for Dhoni, though, who went back to a conventional line-up in an inconsequential match. This too was lost.</p>
<p><strong>Whangarei: Feb 1 and 3</strong></p>
<p>Pleasantly warm weather. Exceptionally warm people, even by the NZ standards. The warm-up game. Any more &#8216;warm&#8217; and we can boil eggs. Ishwar Pandey comes good with three wickets. The future is promising. The immediate future is not so, though. He sits out for the Tests, predictably.</p>
<p><strong>Auckland Test Feb 4-10</strong></p>
<p>Back to Auckland. Meet Jesse Ryder. Looks like changed man. Stays off the bottle at the party later that night. Two days later new breaks he has been reprimanded for breaking the team protocol and partying hard on the night before the match. Somethings never change. If it were a Hindi movie, Dhoni, too, would have hit the bottle after all these losses to drown the hurt. McCullum is clean shaven, gets a second chance after being put in. He makes it count with a double. India&#8217;s winless streak continues.</p>
<p><strong>Wellington test 14-18</strong></p>
<p>India have New Zealand on the ropes. Brendon walks out. He is dropped by Kohli on 9. India are left to rue again. Dhoni looks at the positives. The team has improved, he says. Can&#8217;t pinpoint the shortcomings, he adds. &#8216;Three plus One&#8217; is the only bowling option we have abroad, he insists. It&#8217;s an unconvincing performance, at the press conference as well.</p>
<p><strong>Wellington, Feb 19</strong></p>
<p>Fish out the check list. LOTR tour, cross. Bungee jumping, cross. Queenstown visit, cross. Milford Sound cruise, cross. What have you seen in New Zealand in a month and half, I ask myself.  Something that even New Zealand hadn&#8217;t seen before: a Kiwi 300.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988817&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kuldeepyadavicclm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988689" alt="Kuldeep Yadav, who is registered with Mumbai Indians, returned impressive figures of 4/10 in 8.2 overs (ICC)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kuldeepyadavicclm.jpg" /></a> Kuldeep Yadav, who is registered with Mumbai Indians, returned impressive figures of 4/10 in 8.2 overs (ICC)
<p>Sanju Samson and Kuldeep Yadav stole the limelight with individual brilliance as a strong India continued their unbeaten run with a crushing 245-run win over minnows Papua New Guinea in the Under-19 World Cup.</p>
<p>Opting to bat in their last league match, the defending champions posted a mammoth 301 for six, before bowling out their hapless opponents for just 56 in 28.2 overs at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.</p>
<p>The convincing win ensured India topped the group.</p>
<p>Samson, who plays for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL), led the way with a blistering 85 off 48 balls, smashing eight fours and four sixes during his stay at the crease.</p>
<p>Defending a big total on what did not seem like the best of batting surfaces, left-arm spinner Yadav, who is registered with Mumbai Indians, returned impressive figures of 4/10 in 8.2 overs.</p>
<p>The Indians were off to a sedate start with openers Ankush Bains (59) and Akhil Herwadkar (37) sharing 58 runs in just under 12 overs.</p>
<p>Skipper Vijay Zol contributed 35 off 68 balls, but the momentum that the holders were looking for came only after the arrival of Samson at the crease.</p>
<p>Samson found an able ally in Shreyas Iyer, who scored 36 off 38 balls during a fourth-wicket stand of 116 runs that came off just 12.4 overs. He found the fence three times during the crucial partnership and by the time he fell to Alei Nao, he had already done his job, leaving his side at a comfortable 255 for 4 in the 46th over.</p>
<p>Sarfaraz Khan consolidated towrads the end, smashing his way to a brisk 34 off only 19 balls with the help of three fours and a six. Sarfaraz&#8217;s knock only made it worse for the minnows.</p>
<p>Nao was the best bowler for PNG, returning figures of three for 46 from his 10 overs.</p>
<p>When their turn to bat came, Papua New Guinea proved to be no match to their formidable Indian bowling unit, led admirably by Yadav and right-arm medium pacer Monu Kumar, who picked up 3/13 in six overs. Bowling off-spin, Deepak Hooda took 2/5 in five overs.</p>
<p>Barring opener Riley Hekure (20) and middle-order batsman Hiri Hiri (13), the only two batsmen to have crossed the double figures, it tuned out to be a disastrous outing for PNG.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988683&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dhoni-480.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1981807" alt="Dhoni-480" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/dhoni-480.jpg" /></a> Mahendra Singh Dhoni has produced good results at home, but away results don&#8217;t make a decent reading (File)
<p>Former India cricketer Mohinder Amarnath says the time has come to remove Mahendra Singh Dhoni from captaincy as his &#8220;defensive approach&#8221; has resulted in the country&#8217;s prolonged failure on foreign soil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dhoni is a defensive captain who allows opposition to make a comeback in the game. His record is good at home pitches only like any other Indian captain. There is nothing special about it. We need aggressive captains like Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi to win matches abroad,&#8221; said Amarnath.</p>
<p>India had lost successive overseas Test rubbers in England (0-4) in 2011 and Australia (0-4) in 2011-12 and more recently in South Africa (0-1) and New Zealand (0-1).</p>
<p>India&#8217;s last overseas Test win came against the West Indies at Kingston in June 2011. Dhoni&#8217;s dismal away record stands at five wins out of 23 Tests, while losing 11 games.</p>
<p>&#8220;A captain has to lead from the front. Not a single Test captain in the world bats at number seven. What kind of example you are going to set. I sincerely feel that this is high time to relieve him from Test captaincy and although he is a match winner in ODIs, they should look at an option in shorter format as well,&#8221; said the hero of India&#8217;s 1983 World Cup triumph.</p>
<p>Asked about his choice for future captain, he said Virat Kohli looked good to shoulder the responsibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gautam (Gambhir) was an option who had the experience but since he is out of contention now, Virat is an obvious choice. He has shown leadership qualities at various levels. I think there should be different captains for different formats,&#8221; the 63-year-old said.</p>
<p>Amarnath also lashed out at India coach Duncan Fletcher whose appointment, he thinks, hasn&#8217;t yielded desired results.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what is the use of having him (Fletcher) if he is not delivering. Everyone is talking about the players, captain but nobody is raising questions on coach and support staff. I think Indian team needs an Indian coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;A coach&#8217;s job is to help players to play to their potential and in the past we have achieved laurels with our own coaches,&#8221; the former selector said.</p>
<p>Amarnath blamed the poor technique of batsmen and lack of practice matches for the flop show in South Africa and New Zealand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our batsmen found it difficult to adjust outside the subcontinent and their poor technique is responsible for this. They carry on playing the same shots which they play in the subcontinent. Barring Virat, no one was impressive but they will learn from experience. Virat&#8217;s footwork and technique is superb,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;I also feel that it is must to have some practice matches on every tour so that the players could adapt.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the World Cup less than a year away, Amarnath feels the team should be picked according to playing conditions for the quadrennial event.</p>
<p>&#8220;Selectors should choose those players who can make runs or take wickets in those conditions. It is not necessary that those who are performing well in India will do the same there. Apart from fitness, form and experience, they should also keep the playing condition in mind while selecting the team,&#8221; he insisted.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988652&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kevinpietersenm1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988614" alt="Kevin Pietersen will now play the complete season of this edition of the Indian Premier League (File)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/kevinpietersenm1.jpg" /></a> Kevin Pietersen will now play the complete season of this edition of the Indian Premier League (File)
<p>TA Sekhar, a director on the board of the Delhi Daredevils, talks to <em><strong>The Indian Express</strong> </em>why the Indian Premier League team didn’t retain any players going into the auction and how they went about rebuilding the team after a poor 2013 season.</p>
<p><strong>What was the thinking at the end of the previous IPL?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the last season, we had a team review. The thinking ahead of the auction was that we should build the team from scratch. That is why we decided to go to the auction with our full purse, which meant that we could get the players we wanted. Though I may sound biased as I am with the Delhi Daredevils, I think we have a well-balanced squad.</p>
<p><strong>What were your problem areas in the previous season when the Daredevils won just three games?</strong></p>
<p>We were lacking in quality India-International players, as we had only Virender Sehwag in that category. Last year, our fast bowlers were also coming off injury, be it Varun Aaaron, Umesh Yadav or Irfan Pathan. Kevin Pietersen too was injured, so our best players were not always available and also were not 100 per cent fit. Plus, we also needed quality India-International players to build a strong team.</p>
<p><strong>Your foundation for the rebuilding of the Delhi Daredevils is the Kevin Pietersen-Gary Kirsten combination.</strong></p>
<p>We started off by roping in Gary Kirsten (head coach). He didn’t renew his contract with Cricket South Africa and it presented us with an opportunity. Coaching in the IPL is very different from coaching a national team as there are players from different countries and cultures. Gary, with his man-management skills and proven credentials as a coach with India, was the best option for us. He has the ability to communicate his coaching philosophy to a budding Indian player as well as he does with an international star. Aashish Kapoor (sports administrator), Eric Simons (assistant coach) and I, along with Gary, decided on the kind of players we must target during the auction. We wanted 16 players and I can say we got 13 of them.</p>
<p><strong>With regard to Pietersen, did the happenings in the England dressing room force you to have a rethink on him?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, once he was no longer part of the England set-up, it was clear that he would be available for the entire season and that made it even more important to have Pietersen in the team. For us, what happened in the England dressing room didn’t change our opinion of Pietersen. When it comes to the Delhi Daredevils, KP has been fantastic. Two seasons ago, he won matches for us off his own bat. But what was equally important, was his contribution when it came to working with the younger players. Even when he was injured, he made it a point to help out Unmukt Chand in the nets. KP brings a lot to the table, on the field and in the dressing room.</p>
<p><strong>The Daredevils went all out to bag Dinesh Karthik for Rs 12.5 crores. Why did you break the bank for Karthik?</strong></p>
<p>Karthik has a lot going for him. He is one of the three to four Indian players, the others being Yuvraj Singh and Robin Uthappa, who has played in all editions of the IPL. The rest of the Indian players, who have played all six seasons of the IPL, had already been retained. The IPL experience cannot be discounted because decisions have to be made in the middle very quickly. Also, Karthik has a very sharp cricketing brain and we felt that he could contribute immensely to the leadership group. Karthik also has the ability to shift gears. He can hit big sixes as well as bat right through an innings. He also plays spin very well.</p>
<p><strong>Talking about the bigger names in the squad, why did you choose to buy Ross Taylor only on the second day, after he went unsold on the first?</strong></p>
<p>In 2017, I think teams may not retain as many players as they did after seeing how we assembled our team by going into the auction with a full purse. We didn’t go for Ross Taylor in the first round because we knew that when he came up for bidding again on the second day, most other teams would have run out of money and we could get him for a steal. That is what exactly happened. To get Ross Taylor, who is in the form of his life, for Rs 2 crore is a great deal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988600&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Defending champions West Indies will be without Kieron Pollard for next month&#8217;s World Twenty20 in Bangladesh after the big-hitting all-rounder failed to recover from a knee injury.</p>
<p>A shoulder injury has also ruled fast bowler Kemar Roach out of the 15-man squad, which will be led by all-rounder Darren Sammy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither Kieron Pollard nor Kemar Roach were considered for selection due to continued rehabilitation from injury,&#8221; the West Indies Cricket Board said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pollard continues to recover from a knee injury sustained late last year and Roach is still trying to get over a shoulder injury that forced him to return home from the tour of India without playing and required surgery.&#8221;</p>
<p>West Indies won the last edition of the tournament in 2012 after beating hosts Sri Lanka in the final in Colombo.</p>

<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mahendrasinghdhonireutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988558" alt="Mahendra Singh Dhoni's India have not won a test overseas since June 2011 (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mahendrasinghdhonireutersm.jpg" /></a> Mahendra Singh Dhoni&#8217;s India have not won a Test overseas since June 2011 (Reuters)
<p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni&#8217;s India left New Zealand still seeking an overseas Test victory after more than two and a half years&#8217; frustration on tour.</p>
<p>New Zealand won the Test series 1-0 on Tuesday after the second match at the Basin Reserve ended in a draw highlighted by captain Brendon McCullum&#8217;s triple century.</p>
<p>India have not won a Test overseas since June 2011, when they beat West Indies in the first match in Jamaica and clinched the series after the next two games were drawn.</p>
<p>They have since lost nine and drawn two of their 11 overseas matches and with a team in transition after the retirement of greats Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman, are struggling to find consistency on foreign shores.</p>
<p>The visitors did not win a single game on their shortened tour of New Zealand, losing the five-match one-day series 4-0 with one game tied, and while they had chances to win both Tests, were unable to take their opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were instances where we could have capitalised on the kind of start we got or if we had a good partnership in the middle but we failed to do that,&#8221; Dhoni told reporters in Wellington.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw a glimpse of that in the Test match here and the last Test also in the second innings, we bowled fantastically to come back into the series.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then when we were batting I felt we had a good partnership going then we lost wickets at the wrong time and that put pressure back on ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the four innings, India&#8217;s bowlers played well in two and their batsmen performed well in two. Unfortunately for their passionate supporters who created a carnival atmosphere at both games, they were unable to string the performances together in the same match.</p>
<p>Ishant Sharma took six wickets twice, including a career-best 6-51 in the first innings in Wellington, but he also went for 0-164 in the second innings as New Zealand compiled a record 680-8 declared.</p>
<p>Mohammed Shami was a bustling presence who threatened on occasion, while Zaheer Khan&#8217;s pace was down, even if his control and swing were still dangerous.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s real problem in their bowling was a lack of a stand-out attacking spinner, however.</p>
<p>Ravindra Jadeja was given the opportunity to establish himself but his batting was more threatening than his bowling on New Zealand wickets.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s batsmen also struggled to stamp themselves for a full match though Virat Kohli underlined his class in both the one-day series and Tests.</p>
<p>Opener Shikhar Dhawan top-scored with 215 runs in the two Tests and managed to bat his way out of a slump by grabbing his second test century in the first match and then 98 in Wellington.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think our bowling performance was really good, still we can improve our batting,&#8221; Dhoni added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as a batting unit, we have done well, we have shown improvement but we have to be more consistent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe all the batsmen have one got one good innings in the last four Test matches.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can improve that and make it two or three innings, then the situation of the team really improves.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Dhoni was disappointed, he still felt that his side had taken a step forward in their two overseas tours to South Africa and New Zealand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have been improving and if you compare those two series with the last few that we have played there&#8217;s plenty of improvement,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about, you want to keep improving to a stage where you start converting those good situations or good starts into better starts and start capitalising on it.</p>

<p>Owing to his decent performance in the just-concluded two-Test series against New Zealand, India batsman Virat Kohli rose to his career-best ninth position in the latest ICC Test rankings issued on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kohli, who made 214 runs in four innings, broke into top-10 for the first time in his career and joined compatriot Cheteshwar Pujara, who slipped a rung to be on seventh spot.</p>
<p>Kohli jumped two places following his knocks of 38 and 105 not out in the Wellington Test, which ended in a draw.</p>
<p>Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin slipped two places to be at number 10 and is still the highest-ranked Indian bowler ahead of left-arm tweaker Pragyan Ojha (12th) in Test bowlers rankings.</p>
<p>New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum&#8217;s spectacular match-saving knock of 302 helped him jump eight places to a career-best 12th.</p>
<p>McCullum, who became the first Kiwi batsman to score a triple hundred, helped draw the second and final, to clinch the series 1-0.</p>
<p>McCullum&#8217;s partner in a world record sixth-wicket stand worth 352, BJ Watling, has also moved up the rankings, jumping three places to 45th as a result of his knock of 124.</p>
<p>Two other centurions in the Wellington Test have also made upward moves in the latest table. While Ajinkya Rahane is now 46th (up by 15), New Zealand&#8217;s debutant century-maker Jimmy Neesham has entered the rankings in 59th place.</p>
<p>New Zealand&#8217;s Tim Southee moved up a place to a career-best ninth in the bowlers&#8217; list following his match haul of five for 143 in the Wellington Test against India.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Australia&#8217;s Mitchell Johnson has continued to storm through the charts in the bowlers rankings.</p>
<p>Johnson jumped five places to fourth following his spectacular match-winning haul of 12 for 127 in the Centurion Test against South Africa.</p>
<p>Vernon Philander has ceded the number-one position in the bowlers&#8217; table to teammate Dale Steyn after a 55-day reign at the top.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988513&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lionelmessiapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988281" alt="Barcelona's Lionel Messi, left, scores the first goal of the game for his side from a penalty during their Champions League Round of 16 soccer match against Manchester City (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lionelmessiapm.jpg" /></a> Barcelona&#8217;s Lionel Messi, left, scores the first goal of the game for his side from a penalty during their Champions League Round of 16 soccer match against Manchester City (AP)
<p>Barcelona virtually ended 10-man Manchester City&#8217;s dreams of European glory when they dominated their Champions League last 16 first leg and finished deserved 2-0 winners at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Billed as the biggest match in City&#8217;s recent history, it all went wrong for Manuel Pellegrini&#8217;s side after 53 minutes when defender Martin Demichelis was sent off for a last-man lunge on fellow Argentine Lionel Messi who scored from the resulting penalty to put Barca ahead.</p>
<p>It was the first goal he had scored in an away European tie in England &#8211; his goal in the 2011 Champions League final against Manchester United having come at neutral Wembley &#8211; and set the Spanish champions on the way to their first win in an away European tie in England for six matches.</p>
<p>Their second goal came in the last minute when Dani Alves collected a pass from substitute Neymar and fired through goalkeeper Joe Hart&#8217;s legs to give City an almost impossible task of rescuing the tie in the second leg on March 12.</p>
<p>The defeat sparked an out-of-character attack from Pellegrini who accused Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson of favouring Barca and the Chilean risks a reprimand and possible severe punishment from soccer&#8217;s European governing body UEFA.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke to him at the end and told him he should be very happy because he decided the match,&#8221; Pellegrini told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Barcelona had no chance to score until the penalty against Demichelis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The referee was not impartial. He did not have any control of the game. I think it was not a good idea to have a referee from Sweden in such an important match.</p>
<p>Asked why it was relevant that the referee was Swedish, he replied: &#8220;More important football is played in Europe than in Sweden so a big game with two important teams &#8211; that kind of game needs a referee with more experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eriksson, a FIFA referee since 2002 who is on the list for this year&#8217;s World Cup finals in Brazil, has refereed 86 UEFA matches and this was his 22nd Champions League game.</p>
<p>It was also City&#8217;s first in the knockout rounds of the competition and they rarely showed the kind of form that has brought them 117 goals in all matches this season and prompted talk of a quadruple haul of trophies before this setback.</p>
<p>Barca, with a three-pronged attack of Messi, Andres Iniesta and Alexis Sanchez in front of a typically fluid three-man midfield, dominated the first 20 minutes, allowed City back in the game briefly, then took control again after the dismissal.</p>
<p><strong>Dangerous opponent</strong></p>
<p>Their coach Gerardo Martino said he was delighted with the win but was not taking anything for granted for the return.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not so confident yet for the second leg. Our intention was to win and I think it&#8217;s a fair result.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when we allowed City to have the advantage for 10 minutes in the first half and 10 in the second they made it risky for us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have had a good away win and now we have to repeat the performance at home. But City lost at home to Bayern Munich in the group stage and then won away. They are a very dangerous opponent.&#8221;</p>
<p>City had few chances, with the best falling to David Silva in the 77th minute when he chested the ball down and then volleyed at Victor Valdes who saved well.</p>
<p>But on the whole Barcelona silenced the home fans and blunted City&#8217;s attacks which were few and far between.</p>
<p>The two sides, who had scored 228 times between them this season heading into the game, failed to produce the goalfest that many expected.</p>
<p>However, the estimated global audience of 250 million would have enjoyed seeing Barca reproducing their trademark passing game and winning after a relatively tricky season by their own exalted standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have been saying this is not the same Barcelona of previous years but we&#8217;ve got a great a result tonight and we&#8217;ve proved a point to some people,&#8221; Barca midfielder Cesc Fabregas said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not there yet, though. They are a good team and we still have to work hard to get through.&#8221;</p>
<p>The balance tipped Barca&#8217;s way with Demichelis&#8217;s dismissal, which will keep him out of the second leg at the Nou Camp.</p>
<p>The defender appeared to have fouled Messi outside the area but Eriksson had no doubt, pointing to the spot, and showed Demichelis a red card, allowing Messi to stroke the ball past Hart to put the visitors ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two-nil is very tough on us. When it was 11 versus 11 we were in the game but with a man less and with their individual quality which is so high it was very hard,&#8221; Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany told ITV.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they play as they can in the second leg it will be very hard but we still have a chance.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988274&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sri Lanka Cricket has finally decided to back the controversial ICC revamp plan proposed by India, England and Australia, saying that it&#8217;s satisfied with the revised resolutions tabled at the Board Meeting of the world body early this month.</p>
<p>SLC arrived at the decision at its Executive Committee meeting on Monday, a few days after it had refrained from voting on the revised proposals at the ICC Board meeting in Singapore on February 8. SLC had then said it needed more time to discuss them. “The Executive Committee met today (February 17th) at SLC headquarters to converse regarding the revised resolutions forwarded by the ICC at the ICC Board meeting held on 8th February 2014 in Singapore,” the SLC said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Subsequent to the committee members assessing the revised resolutions in detail, all members were satisfied with the amendments made in the areas of governance and competition models and thus unanimously decided to support the paper,” it said.</p>
<p><strong>Cash cow</strong></p>
<p>“Further the Executive Committee proposed the relevant officials to engage in discussions with other member nations to negotiate bi-lateral tours in the FTP (Future Tour Programme) which are in a favorable manner to SLC,” the statement added</p>
<p>SLC Secretary Nishantha Ranatunga said that supporting the &#8216;Big Three&#8217; would benefit Sri Lankan cricket. The SLC would earn a revenue of around “USD 47-48 million” through series with the three countries in the next seven years. </p>
<p>“When you calculate, a series with these three countries will bring us a revenue of USD 47-48m. People who talk about principles will not give us the money. We have to make our money from these tours so that our cricket does not suffer,” Ranatunga said.</p>
<p>India is due to tour Sri Lanka in 2017 and Ranatunga was hopeful that the FTP drawn up till 2018 will not be affected.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988234&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hockeyindialeaguekeeperm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988261" alt="Kalinga Lancers’ Harjot Singh is the only Indian keeper to get significant playing time in the HIL this season" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hockeyindialeaguekeeperm.jpg" /></a> Kalinga Lancers’ Harjot Singh is the only Indian keeper to get significant playing time in the HIL this season
<p>It&#8217;s been a season where goals saved have been more remarkable than the ones scored and goalkeepers have got as much due as the strikers, a rare occurrence. But even as three Indians &#8211; all drag-flickers &#8211; sit comfortably in the top-five scorer&#8217;s list of this Hockey India League, the same cannot be said of the goalkeepers.</p>
<p>All six teams have preferred employing a foreign custodian over their desi counterparts, another indication towards the emptying goalkeeping cupboard of Indian hockey.</p>
<p>The country&#8217;s No.1 shot-stopper, PR Sreejesh, too has been left warming the bench by Mumbai Magicians for a major part this season. He has lost his place to little-known Irishman David Harte, who has turned quite a few heads with his performances. Sushant Tirkey, Bharat Chetri and Sreenivas Rao too have all fallen down the pecking order in their respective teams with Harjot Singh being the only exception.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old Kalinga Lancers keeper has been one of the few the bright spots as far as Indian goal-keeping is concerned by giving an option apart from Sreejesh to the Indian team selectors.</p>
<p>But still, he is considered far too young and inexperienced to be thrown into the deep end of international hockey.</p>
<p>The rest, including Sreejesh, have alas been pretty average.</p>
<p>The franchisees, who have spent loads of money in acquiring services of top international shot-stoppers, have not hesitated in getting their monies worth, while sacrificing relatively weaker Indian goalies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The clubs are spending a lot of money and they want results. So when you have the option of employing a world-class goalkeeper, why would they settle for an Indian who is not as good as them? We need to be practical in these matters,&#8221; says Sreejesh, as a matter-of-fact.</p>
<p>Sreejesh and Harte played alternate matches for the Magicians this season but it was the Irishman who featured in crunch matches. Other franchisees too have adopted a similar philosophy apart from Delhi Waveriders, who do not have a single Indian goalkeeper in their squad, opting for German Nicolas Jacobi and Dutchman Pirmin Blaak instead.</p>
<p>Jacobi has arguable been the best custodian so far along with Holland&#8217;s Jaap Stockman. Despite being more than 6-foot tall with beefy frames, the two goalkeepers have shown remarkable agility. &#8220;India does not have very strong goalkeepers,&#8221; says Ajitpal. &#8220;The foreign keepers are quick to bend and move despite being so huge. They cover all angles in front of the goal. If you look at Indian goalkeepers who are tall, they are very slow to react and are not able to balance their body,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>The national team has suffered the most in recent times due to poor goalkeeping. While Sreejesh has been a constant in the playing XI for last few years, touring without an experienced second goalkeeper has had a severe impact on the team.</p>
<p>Chetri has been shown the door after the Olympics debacle while youngster Tirkey has failed to live up to the expectations.</p>
<p>In the inaugural season, teams chose to put an Indian in front of the goal and use an extra foreign hand in the outfield. That, however, hasn&#8217;t been the case this year as the teams have stressed on having a strong player under the bars, even if it means sacrificing on the quality up front. &#8220;That also shows they are better than us even in the outfield! They are better than us in all departments, technically and physically. We should be humble enough to acknowledge that and use HIL to learn new things from them,&#8221; Ajitpal says.</p>
<p>Australian goalkeeper George Bazeley, who plays for UP Wizards, says India needs to be patient in grooming the custodians. &#8220;Sreejesh won&#8217;t hit his peak until he is 30. Take Jaap for example, he is 29 and is starting to hit his peak now. Now he is really dominant in the goal. Give Sreejesh (25) his time and he will come out really good,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I am impressed with Harjot. He is getting opportunities and is taking his chances. He did well at the Junior World Cup. Though he was unlucky at times, he is a prospect coming through.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988068&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mumbai Magicians stunned Uttar Pradesh Wizards 3-2 on the latter&#8217;s home turf at the Dhyan Chand Stadium, Lucknow, on Tuesday. Though the result was inconsequential given that the Wizards had already entered the semifinal before this game, but losing to the Magicians, who  moved from lowly sixth to fifth after Tuesday&#8217;s win, was not the ideal way to finish off the league phase. Incidentally, of the Wizards&#8217; four losses this season, three have come at home.</p>
<p>This was Magicians&#8217; second consecutive win after having registered a 3-2 victory against Kalinga Lancers in their previous match.</p>
<p>Though the Magicians had an upper hand in the first quarter, they could not score.  Wizards striker Nithin Thimmaiah broke the stalemate in the 22nd minute through a field goal. However, Gurjinder Singh made full use of a penalty corner awarded to the Magicians nine minutes later to level the scores. Then Prabhjot Singh collected a well-timed pass from the right in the 56th minute and sent the ball into the goal to give the visitors a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p><strong>Crucial Strike</strong></p>
<p>Magicians skipper Glenn Turner sounded the board five minutes later to consolidate the lead further. Just a minute later UP Wizards captain VR Raghunath succeeded in bringing down the margin to 3-2 off a penalty-corner but no goals were added till the final hooter.</p>
<p>Mumbai Magicians coach MK Kaushik said, “We dominated the match today. Our attack as well as our defence was good. Team captain Glenn Turner&#8217;s performance was commendable.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988063&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/somdevdevvarmanmie.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988238" alt="Somdev Devvarman is the only Indian left in the draw after a 6-2 7-5 win over Karunuday Singh (IE Photo Tashi Tobgyal)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/somdevdevvarmanmie.jpg" /></a> Somdev Devvarman is the only Indian left in the draw after a 6-2 7-5 win over Karunuday Singh (IE Photo Tashi Tobgyal)
<p>It was a day of mixed results for India at the Delhi Challenger, where the best news perhaps came from a loss than a win. Somdev Devvarman laboured past wildcard Karunuday Singh and, by the end of the day, was the only Indian left in the men&#8217;s singles draw.</p>
<p>Still, it was 19-year old Ramkumar Ramanathan&#8217;s tight loss to Ilija Bozoljac that proved to be the most entertaining game, and was certainly the one to take the most positives from for a fan of Indian tennis, especially after Yuki Bhambri was upset just hours previously.</p>
<p>It could not have been set up better for Devvarman in the first round. The slowness of the center court and his opponent&#8217;s inability to find either depth or consistency on his groundstrokes meant that most points were determined by unforced errors, with Karunuday blinking first. Devvarman bossed the first set 6-2 but inexplicably faded thereafter.</p>
<p>Devvarman was broken thrice but managed to break Karunuday four times in a second set where the tennis was poor and the umpiring worse. Eventually, Devvarman crawled over the line in the second with a last gasp break, nicking the set 7-5 and with it the match.</p>
<p>Next up on Court One was Bhambri, who took on 19-year old French talent Lucas Pouille, ranked 187 in the world. All seemed well in the early stages as Bhambri comfortably picked up the first set 6-2 but he went flat immediately after.</p>
<p>Pouille ran up a 3-0 lead in the second and though Bhambri broke back, it was apparent that the fizz had gone out of his game. Bhambri later admitted that an abdominal strain meant that he was only serving at &#8217;60 per cent&#8217; right through the game and that fatigue was a factor for he had been playing non-stop for a few months until Delhi. The drop in quality of his service game cost him the set 7-5.</p>
<p>There was something of a recovery for Bhambri in the third as he dug deep to cull out a break but the sixth seed botched his attempt to serve out the match. Pouille saved three match points, broke Bhambri and held his own serve to turn the table on Bhambri. One last break of service gave Pouille the match.</p>
<p>A fairly clamorous crowd had watched local lad Bhambri play but the 2-6, 7-5, 7-5 loss seemed to have disheartened most spectators. Those who stayed on, though, were treated to an exhibition of hitting from Ramkumar and Ilija Bozoljac. It was more or less expected that Ramkumar would not hold back on two of his primary weapons, the serve and the forehand and that is how it proved to be.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Raw Talent</strong></p>
<p>Still, for all the power Ramkumar was imparting &#8211; he clearly has the bigger serve and forehand as compared to Devvarman or Bhambri &#8211; his talent is quite raw. As powerful as his forehand can become, Ramkumar still mostly employs the sliced backhand, a defensive option at best.<br />
His movement too was perhaps a little clumsy, evidenced mostly when he rushed the net, dunking several volleys into the net mainly because he was not balanced when making the shot. He also needed little invitation to unwind on his forehand side, which keeps the opponent honest, but also becomes a bit predictable.<br />
Bozoljac, at 28, is a veteran of the Challenger circuit. The six feet four inches tall Serb combined power-hitting with a canniness that comes from preying on the lopsided game of the players that populate the nether rungs of the tennis hierarchy.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Form Player</strong></p>
<p>To add to that, Bozoljac is in red hot form too, having won the Kolkata Challenger last week.</p>
<p>Expectedly, Bozoljac made all the right moves. He directed traffic to Ramkumar&#8217;s backhand. He served big to ensure he wouldn&#8217;t be drawn into rallies. He invited Ramkumar to the net with drop shots and passed him with ease. It worked like a charm as Bozoljac went 6-2, 4-2 up in little time. Ramkumar didn&#8217;t switch playing styles or back down despite the scoreline and Bozoljac, little by little, began to feel the heat. Ramkumar levelled and then took the set in the tie-break 7-5.</p>
<p>Though he went a break down in the third, Ramkumar kept unreeling the big serves and crunching forehands. He would draw level and even have a few break point opportunities of his own.</p>
<p>Eventually Bozoljac proved just a little too powerful, a little too experienced, nicking the contest 6-2, 6(5)-7, 6-4. But the Serbian had seen something. He stopped to applaud his opponent, almost 10 years his junior, after the win.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988061&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em><a title="Brendon McCullum’s 300: Rise of a nation" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/brendon-mccullums-300-rise-of-a-nation/">Brendon McCullum</a>, scorer of New Zealand’s first ever triple century in its 84-year history, reflects with humour and honesty on what has been a<a title="Brendon McCullum’s 302 seals series 1-0" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/brendon-mccullums-302-seals-series-1-0/" target="_blank"> historic series for the nation</a>. Excerpts from his press conference.</em></p>
<p><strong>How big was it for New Zealand to have somebody in the 300 club?</strong></p>
<p>Without being disrespectful I probably didn’t know the magnitude of it until the last 24 hours. I grew up and watched the New Zealand cricket team for years on end. I saw Martin Crowe score his 299 and thought it would have been an amazing feat if he scored 300 but probably didn’t quite understand how much it meant to the whole country who support this team and the media and support that has started to gain momentum last night and this morning with everyone willing a New Zealander to finally break that 300 barrier. And Martin as well.</p>
<p>I saw him this morning and he was discussing how significant it would be. I guess that was one of the things that made me realise how big a moment it was. I also spoke to Stephen Fleming last night and he also said the same thing and those are the two guys who sat at 1 and 2 on the table. I feel a little bit embarrassed because I’m not anywhere near the calibre of players that those two in particular are but I think in terms of New Zealand cricket and moving forward for this team, we have finally broken that 300 barrier.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Crowe had said that he got a little ahead of himself on 299 and started to think about what will happen and the adulation. Did you, during those last 19 runs, get ahead of yourself?</strong></p>
<p>I definitely wanted to get 300 so I guess I was thinking in front of myself. That was one thing I tried to do this summer is just play that moment and worry about that ball. After the first couple of runs today when I started feeling a little bit nervous which isn’t always normal, one of the things I had to tell myself was get back to the simple things that work and give the ball as much respect as it deserves.</p>
<p><strong>How were you feeling this morning when you got up and walked through the gate to go out?</strong></p>
<p>I wasn’t too bad till I saw the size of the crowd. Every ball that I defended, left or got a single they would start cheering and it made me a little bit more nervous, to be honest. That’s probably when I understood the magnitude and how much joy it gives fans to see guys succeed and see records broken. It was the moment when 300 came up and the applause was ongoing for quite a while is really when it hit home to me that it was quite a significant achievement for a New Zealander.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Talk us through the emotions then.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve never experienced anything like that. That’s something I’ll hold onto for the rest of my life. At that moment I realised how much satisfaction you can bring people.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Were there tears in your eyes?</strong></p>
<p>No tears. I’m from South Dunedin.</p>
<p><strong>How much do you think the captaincy has contributed to this change in batting approach?</strong></p>
<p>You want to lead from the front as captain and I haven’t always done that. I hope that’s what I’m starting to do. The hardest time to captain the team is when you’re not scoring runs and that’s when your character and the kind of person and leader you are outweighs your own form.</p>
<p><strong>Beer last night with dad?</strong></p>
<p>I did go for a beer with my old man. He was up and booked his flight for a month late which everyone says was a bit silly, I just think he’s quite cunning. Just caught up with him for a beer and tried to keep it as relaxed and as normal as possible.</p>
<p><strong>What’s going to happen to that bat?</strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure. It will go in the cupboard for a little while since we’re off to T20 cricket. That will bring out one of my old favourites  that can handle a bit more of the swashbuckling swings.</p>
<p><strong>How about a bottle of wine for Kohli (who dropped him on 9)?</strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure what sort of wine he drinks but he got his little bit of karma back (he was given not out after nicking one).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988045&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

Brendon’s father Stu (Right) was the beneficiary of a booking error
<p><strong>Pa watches son only due to airline faux pas</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Brendon McCullum’s father Stu wouldn’t have been sitting in the Cricket Wellington pavilion and watching his son make a triple hundred had an airline not goofed up his reservation.</p>
<p>Stu, a former first-class cricketer himself, was at the Basin Reserve for the first three days, but was supposed to fly out to Christchuch on Sunday. However, at the airport he found out the staff had booked him for next month.<br />
“I went for a beer with my old man. He was up and booked his flight for a month late which was a bit silly. I just think he’s quite cunning,” McCullum joked.</p>
<p>I reach out for my tickets to double check, just in case. No such luck. No staying back in New Zealand for an extra month.</p>
<p><strong>A bowler immortalised for his batting</strong></p>
<p>The curator of New Zealand Cricket’s museum at the Basin Reserve, Jamie Bell, turned out to be much younger — 31 — than his job profile would make you imagine. Of course, it was wrong to assume on my part but there was some sound logic behind that assumption. Here’s that logic: the guy who runs a museum better be ancient himself, otherwise he would run the risk of not being taken too seriously. Doesn’t quite sound logical? Never mind.</p>
<p>“Not everything about a museum is old,” Bell says. “We keep having new additions. The latest addition is Chris Martin’s batting pads.” Why would the museum want to display Martin’s pads, I ask? “That’s the thing. He is our third highest wicket taker in Tests. And yet people remember him for not being able to bat. So I thought it would be a nice addition.”</p>
<p>Next to the fast bowler’s batting pads is a trophy, an out of shape one. It is the ICC Knockout trophy, the only major event that New Zealand have ever won. But why is out of shape? “The earthquake in Christchurch also harmed NZC’s offices. It was there that it fell. NZC, who were moving their office, gave it to us so that it could be safe here,” says Bell.</p>
<p>All this stuff might get relegated to some corner, however, should Mccullum decide to give his 300 bat to the museum.</p>
<p>The bat is indeed going into a cupboard, McCullum admits later, only it is going to the one in his home.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988031&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/newzealandfansmap.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988231" alt="The Basin Reserve stands as one after Brendon McCullum cut Zaheer Khan to the fence to move from 298 to 302 on Tuesday morning (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/newzealandfansmap.jpg" /></a> The Basin Reserve stands as one after Brendon McCullum cut Zaheer Khan to the fence to move from 298 to 302 on Tuesday morning (AP)
<p><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:1.5em;">These were scenes you wouldn’t normally expect in New Zealand. The Kiwis do like their cricket and they did turn up in good numbers on the first three days of the <a title="Brendon McCullum’s 302 seals series 1-0" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/brendon-mccullums-302-seals-series-1-0/" target="_blank">Wellington Test</a>. But snaking queues of expectant spectators at the Basin Reserve’s gates on a weekday is something unusual in these parts.</span></p>
<p>There were people in formals, and you could tell they had skipped work — taking a longer bathroom/coffee break if not really calling in sick. It’s a fairly regular occurrence in India; in New Zealand it’s unprecedented. At least for a sport that doesn’t involve an oval-shaped ball and pinning your opponents down.</p>
<p>But then this wasn’t ‘just another day’.<a title="I wasn’t feeling nervous until I saw size of crowd: Brendon McCullum" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/i-wasnt-feeling-nervous-until-i-saw-size-of-crowd-brendon-mccullum/" target="_blank"> Brendon McCullum</a> was standing on the brink of a<a title="Didn’t know this would mean so much to our country: Brendon McCullum" href="http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/didnt-know-this-would-mean-so-much-to-our-country-brendon-mccullum/" target="_blank"> triple century</a> and life in Wellington was standing still.</p>
<p>Triple hundreds, they are commonplace these days, aren’t they, you thought. Kumar Sangakkara hit one only a couple of weeks ago. Two Indian players on the pitch on Tuesday have three each to their credit — albeit in first-class matches. What’s the big deal, you wondered.</p>
<p>But then you saw Sunil Gavaskar in the press box adjusting his tie. You thought of Martin Crowe, too, who was here the other day — and who was here, too, at 299 twenty-three summers ago. You thought of Sachin Tendulkar. You thought of all those greats who never reached 300.</p>
<p>And you also considered the fact that in 391 previous Tests, in 83 preceding years, no New Zealander had scaled that summit. In which time, one of them had scaled Mount Everest before anyone else could.<br />
All right, you said, 300 for New Zealand is a big deal. But just how big?</p>
<p><strong>The Long Wait</strong></p>
<p>It was difficult to quantify the magnitude of the impending achievement. Let’s just say there were people out there who were risking their lives and limbs to get a glimpse of it. Beyond the stands, beyond the packed embankments, you spotted a 60-year-old man precariously holding onto a branch from his vantage point on a tree.</p>
<p>If that man had a fraction of the weight McCullum, overnight unbeaten on 281, was carrying on his shoulder at the beginning of Day Five, the branch would have come crashing down. Safe to say, then, that on Tuesday morning, there was nothing that mattered more to this rugby mad nation than 19 cricketing runs.<br />
Even the Indian fans, who showed up in large numbers, wouldn’t have begrudged McCullum or New Zealand those runs. After all, they knew the pain of having to wait for a triple. They had waited for 72 years for theirs — until Virender Sehwag’s 309 in 2004.</p>
<p>Like Sehwag, McCullum is a see-ball, hit-ball batsman. Unlike Sehwag, however, he kept a counter-intuitive vigil here for a majority of the 13 hours that he spent in the middle, battling against himself, the situation and the Indian bowlers.</p>
<p>Today, he was batting against history as well. To further make it difficult, the conditions in the morning were more difficult to bat than they had been at any point during the previous three days. The sun was behind a thick cover of grey, pregnant clouds. The famous Wellington wind was finally blowing. McCullum took his guard to face Zaheer Khan.</p>
<p><strong>Those 19 Runs</strong></p>
<p>The first ball, pitched up and across, was an invitation for a drive, but it was respectfully declined. In this manner, the over was negotiated and the nerves were settled. At the other end, a surer Jimmy Neesham, without any such burden, played freely. With a flick off the pads for a couple and a cover drive for three, he put McCullum on strike to face Ishant Sharma. McCullum played one past mid off and ran for his first single of the morning. Applause.</p>
<p>Every single was cheered as if it were a boundary, every boundary lauded as if it were a hundred.<br />
Yes, there were boundaries. Ironically enough, in his otherwise restrained innings, McCullum brought up milestones with a flourish. The 50, 150 and 200 came off fours, the 100 and 250 with sixes.</p>
<p>His flicked Ishant past the deep mid-wicket boundary to move from 284 to 288. In the next over, a cracking pull shot off Zaheer past mid on took him to 293.</p>
<p>‘Oohs’ rang out in the stands and the Basin Reserve crowd had their hearts in their mouths when an Ishant delivery took off from a length and took McCullum’s outside edge. It fell inches short of Dhoni. A country exhaled. After that McCullum decided he wasn’t going to play a waiting game. In Ishant’s next over, he swatted the bowler away for a four and took a single to reach 298.</p>
<p>A landmark came in that over but it wasn’t the one the crowd was waiting for — Neesham pulled Ishant over deep square leg to bring up a century on Test debut.</p>
<p>The moment finally came off the first ball of the next over.</p>
<p>Zaheer gave McCullum a little width outside the off-stump and McCullum’s eyes lit up. He cut the ball past gully and despite knowing well it would be a four, he ran. He ran with both arms aloft in celebration. The weight was off his shoulder. The wait was over.</p>
<p>The Basin sprang on its feet and roared. Strangers high-fived each other. Those in the traffic outside (it’s a busy roundabout after all) were surely tuned in to the radio, for they honked collectively. McCullum’s teammates were jumping up and down in the dressing room. He hugged Neesham, took off his helmet and raised his bat to all corners. Every Indian player walked up to him to shake hands.</p>
<p>The roar subsided, but the applause didn’t. It looked like it wouldn’t end, just like the innings. But it ended, and two balls later, so too the innings when the batsman nicked Zaheer behind the wicket to Dhoni.</p>
<p>Those who has settled in their seats were back up. The slow ‘thank-you’ claps began and didn’t stop till his tiny frame had disappeared in the narrow passage leading to the dressing room.</p>
<p>The spectators in suits started trickling out. McCullum did his job, now it was their turn to go back to theirs. The old man finally climbed down from the tree to his relieved wife. Normalcy restored, New Zealand went back to being New Zealand again, albeit with a smile on the face.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Kohli again</strong></p>
<p>The match wandered aimlessly. The Blackcaps kept batting for a while before declaring at 680/8. Zaheer completed his five wicket haul, but not before bowling 51 excruciating overs. India came out, lost early wickets before Kohli hit a century. He ended the tour the way he had began in Napier a month and a day ago.<br />
The match ended early, at 5 pm. For all practical purposes, however, it was done and dusted much earlier. At quarter to 12, when McCullum played that cut shot.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988023&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Del Piero to play Juventus</strong><br />
Alessandro Del Piero will play against former club Juventus for the first time when he joins an A-League All Stars side for a friendly against the Serie A champion in August. Del Piero, who is now playing for Australian A-League side Sydney FC, spent 19 years with Juventus — including 11 seasons as captain — where the former Italy star scored 290 goals in 705 matches. Football Federation Australia chief David Gallop said Tuesday that “to have a club of the caliber of Juventus FC come to Sydney is a massive coup for football in Australia”.</p>
<p><strong>Sociedad beat Malaga 1-0</strong><br />
Carlos Vela scored early and Real Sociedad hung on for a 1-0 win at Malaga on Monday to move in on the Spanish league’s last Champions League qualifying place. The Mexican striker continued perhaps the best season of his career by guiding Jose Angel Valdes’ cross into the area past goalkeeper Willy Caballero with his left foot, as the visitors went ahead after 10 minutes at the Rosaleda. Sociedad joined Villarreal on 40 points just three behind Athletic Bilbao in the race to clinch the Champions League<br />
last spot.</p>
<p><strong>Almagro upset in first round</strong><br />
Fifth-seeded Nicolas Almagro made a shock exit from the first round of the Rio Open on Tuesday, losing 2-6, 6-3, 6-0 to Alexandr Dolgopolov of Ukraine. The Spaniard has won 12 ATP tournaments — all on clay, and six on the annual Latin American swing. Eighth-seeded countryman Pablo Andujar had better luck, advancing against Julian Reister of Germany 6-4, 6-3. In the combined ATP-WTA event, top-seeded Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic won her first-round match, beating Colombia’s Mariana Duque-Marino 6-4, 6-4. Top-seeded Rafael Nadal of Spain was due to face countryman Daniel Gimeno-Traver in a late match. No. 2 David Ferrer of Spain was also to play late against Jeremy Chardy of France.</p>
<p><strong>Perera stuns Bangladesh</strong><br />
Thisara Perera’s brilliant counter-attack inspired Sri Lanka to a 13-run victory over Bangladesh in the first one-day international in Dhaka, giving the tourists the lead in the three-match series.  Perera smashed an unbeaten 80 off 57 balls to lift the tourists from a hopeless 67-8 in the 22nd over to 180 all out after Bangladesh elected to field.  Sri Lanka hit back to bowl out the hosts for 167 in the 40th over of the rain-curtailed match at the Sher-e-Bangla stadium. Bangladesh were cruising at 114-2 in the 20th over when the batting came apart.<br />
Brief scores:  SL 180 all out in 40 overs  (T Perera 80 n.o, S Al Hasan 2-29, A Sunny 2-31, R Hossain 2-37); Ban167 in 39.2 overs  (S Rahman 62,A Mathews 3-21)</p>
<p><strong>Moin not worried over contract</strong><br />
Pakistan coach Moin Khan is not worried about his short-term contract. Last week, Khan was appointed for the Asia Cup this month and World Twenty20 next month, both in Bangladesh. The Pakistan Cricket Board said Khan’s performance will be reviewed after those events. Khan says contracts are always “performance-oriented and if the team performs you get the continuation”. Pakistan will be led by Misbah-ul-Haq, under whom the team defeated Bangladesh in the Asia Cup final in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>Halep retires injured in Dubai</strong><br />
Seventh-seeded Simona Halep of Romania retired with a right Achilles injury and fatigue while trailing Alize Cornet of France 6-1, 1-1, in her opening match at the Dubai Championships on Tuesday. The ninth-ranked Halep, who won the Qatar Open on Sunday, complained of an inflamed Achilles during her run to the Doha title. The WTA physiotherapists recommend Halep take 10 days off to heal the injury. Halep held serve in the first game of the second set. But after Cornet evened the score to 1-1 the Romanian determined she couldn’t play on.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988020&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few sports that take place on skis have less to do with skiing than aerials. Think of aerialists more like divers who got lost on the way to the swimming pool, gymnasts who spent too much time at a winter clothing clearance sale. Their heart-stopping routines of flips, twists, spins, somersaults and tucks are more like cold weather inversions of diving and gymnastic meets than they are skiing competitions.</p>
<p>That is not to take anything away from the 12 aerialists who competed on Monday night — these were very brave men. For example, the least ambitious jump of the final round was a triple backward somersault with several twists.</p>
<p>Anton Kushnir of Belarus won the gold medal for successfully landing the most ambitious routine, called a back double full-full-double full, which translates as several somersaults with five twists.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for a winter sport, aerials do not involve a lot of winter. “You just need to ski straight and brake,” said Renato Ulrich of Switzerland who finished 12th. “It’s actually pretty simple.”</p>
<p>At least, the skiing portion of it is relatively simple. Nothing else is.</p>
<p>The aerial competition works like this: You start halfway down a very steep slope. Then you speed up a ramp and soar into the air, pulling off an incredible combination of tricks while you are flying. Then, hopefully, you land in one piece and ski to the bottom of the steep slope.</p>
<p>You commit your routine to memory and submit it to the judges beforehand &#8211; first back flip this way, then back flip that way; flip clockwise, flip clockwise, flip clockwise; and land. You are scored on how well you execute your plan. With all that to keep track of, skiing is generally an afterthought.</p>
<p>“There’s more of an acrobatic element and less of a skiing element,” said Jeff Bean, a Canadian aerialist who competed in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 Games.</p>
<p>Because of that, aerials feels different from other sports on the mountain. If there is a single cliché of the Winter Olympics, it is that the competitor from pick-your-cold-country learned to ski before he or she learned to walk.<br /> That is not the case in aerials. Many aerialists have backgrounds in acrobatics, gymnastics, diving, trampolining — sports where snow and ski boots are conspicuously absent. Mac Bohonnon, an 18-year-old American prodigy who came in fifth, grew up on skis but said most of his competitors from around the world did not. “Those guys who came from a gymnastic background are very acrobatic,” Bohonnon said as his competitors who defeated him twirled through the night sky.</p>
<p>But putting gymnasts on skis also carries risks. Brazil planned to send Lais da Silva Souza, a former Olympic gymnast, to Sochi to compete in aerials even though she had never been on skis before last July. While training in Salt Lake City in January, she crashed and sustained a serious spinal injury. Few countries have embraced the acrobatic side of aerials more heartily than China, which had three men among the final 12 on Monday. Only Jia Zongyang, who does not have a background in skiing, won a medal, finishing third.</p>
<p>Even experienced aerialists will say there is something fundamentally insane about their sport. “No one goes out and says ‘I want to drop out of a third-story balcony at 35 m.p.h.,’ “ Bean said. “But it’s the coolest feeling to be in complete control of what’s going on while you’re flying through the air.”</p>
<p>The feeling of incomplete control is another story, however, and a painfully common one. Bean is probably most famous for a jump in the Turin Olympics in 2006 where his skis popped off as soon as he soared. Somehow, he was not badly hurt. There were some dramatic crashes on Monday as well. On his final run, Zongyang did a face-in-the-snow somersault upon landing and still finished third.</p>
<p>Although aerialists may perform as if they are without conscience, many struggle to keep the fear of grave injury at bay. It usually does not work. “Fear is present all the time,” said Travis Gerrits of Canada, who finished seventh. “We deal with fear on a daily basis. It’s definitely a big aspect of our sport.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988016&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Olympic medallist grapplers Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt will not be a part of the next month’s Freestyle Wrestling World Cup as the two have been given further rest by the federation from national duties.</p>
<p>Sushil and Yogeshwar haven’t taken the mat since their medal winning feat at London Olympics in 2012 and now the two are eyeing return at the Commonwealth Games in July this year.</p>
<p>“The federation (WFI) has shortlisted important tournaments for senior wrestlers. The federation wants to give other wrestlers a chance. We have been asked to focus on our training keeping the Commonwealth Games in mind,” Sushil said.</p>
<p>World Championship silver medallist Amit Kumar will lead the Indian contingent to its maiden World Cup in Los Angeles, USA from March 15-16.</p>
<p>WFI general secretary Raj Singh said both Sushil and Yogeshwar have been asked to concentrate on their training.</p>
<p>“We have asked Sushil and Yogeshwar to prepare for the Commonwealth Games. We have a strong team and hopefully they will do us proud in our first appearance,” said Singh.</p>
<p>Other wrestlers shortlisted after the trials at SAI Centre, Sonepat today include Bajrang, the world championship bronze medallist, in the 61kg category.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iocm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988320" alt="IOC president Thomas Bach has launched a review of the Olympics" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/iocm.jpg" /></a> IOC president Thomas Bach has launched a review of the Olympics
<p>Future Olympic bidders may have to abide by a specific anti-discrimination rule modelled on the Olympic Charter’s Principle 6 if they are to be awarded the Games, the International Olympic Committee said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Principle 6 says sport does not discriminate on any grounds, including race, religion, politics or gender.</p>
<p>The IOC had to fend off criticism in the run-up to the Sochi Winter Olympics over Russia’s anti-gay propaganda law, which critics say curtailed the rights of homosexuals in the country.</p>
<p>They say the IOC has turned a blind eye to the controversial law, which was passed last year. The law triggered a wave of reaction from athletes and politicians with several world leaders opting not to travel to Russia for the Games.</p>
<p>The IOC has said it cannot dictate laws in a sovereign state but said it had received assurances from Russian President Vladimir Putin there would be no discrimination against homosexuals.</p>
<p>“We have made it absolutely crystal clear that Principle 6 covers all forms of discrimination,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams told reporters when asked whether it could become a pre-condition for cities campaigning to host the Games.</p>
<p>“Could it be changed? It can be changed,” he said. “We are, as you know, in the middle of Agenda 2020 which is looking at just about everything on how Olympics are run,” Adams said.<br />
“It (Principle 6) is not something that is specifically looked at but if there is a groundswell of opinion it could be.”</p>
<p><strong>Learning Lessons</strong></p>
<p>Pressure has grown to include such a clause in the bid rules for future Olympics that would block nations from getting the Games if discriminatory laws existed. Current and former athletes, including Martina Navratilova as well as pop star Rihanna, are among the big names to have publicly spoken out in favour of Principle 6.</p>
<p>Lviv, Beijing, capital Oslo, Poland’s Krakow and Almaty are in the running for the 2022 Winter Olympics.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988010&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/seedorfreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988330" alt="Seedorf won the Champions League once with Ajax Amsterdam and once with Real Madrid (File/Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/seedorfreutersm.jpg" /></a> Seedorf won the Champions League once with Ajax Amsterdam and once with Real Madrid (File/Reuters)
<p>Clarence Seedorf will need to tap into all the experience he gained as the only player to win the Champions League with three different clubs if his AC Milan side are to get past Atletico Madrid into the quarter-finals.</p>
<p>Milan host the Spanish club for their last 16, first leg on Wednesday, when Seedorf will make his coaching debut in Europe’s elite club competition after taking over from Massimiliano Allegri.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old former Netherlands midfielder won the Champions League once with Ajax Amsterdam and once with Real Madrid before a decade playing at Milan yielded two more continental titles.</p>
<p>However, the seven-times European champions have fallen on hard times and sit ninth in Serie A, 31 points behind leaders Juventus, and Seedorf has taken on the task of lifting them out of their slump and reviving past glories.</p>
<p>“The match against Atletico will be a great chance to take a big step forward,” Seedorf said. “We’ll play our game as Milan always have something extra in the Champions League,” he added. “I’m confident that the stadium will be full as it was in the old days. The fans and the stadium will give the players what they need.”</p>
<p>Seedorf will be going head to head with a man he knows well from his playing days, Atletico’s Argentine coach Diego Simeone, who had stints at Italian clubs including Inter Milan and Lazio and Spanish sides Atletico and Sevilla.</p>
<p>Simeone has transformed the Madrid side into genuine contenders in Spain and Europe since taking over at the end of 2011 and they are joint top of La Liga with heavyweights Barcelona and Real Madrid.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Limiting Damage</strong></p>
<p>Seedorf will need time to fix what has been ailing Milan in recent seasons but has already said he wants his players to exert more control. “You need time to create your style of play and a bit of luck too,” he said on Friday. “It’s in the club’s DNA to have control of the game. If you’re in control, the adversary can do less damage. I ask the players to stick together and to show fighting spirit to get out of the difficult situation that we find ourselves in.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1988006&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sports-med.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1988005" alt="Bayern are aware of the threat that the Germans at Arsenal — Lukas Podolski (L), Serge Gnabry (2nd R), Mesut Ozil (R) and Per Mertesacker (not in picture) — pose in the two-leg tie. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sports-med.jpg" /></a> Bayern are aware of the threat that the Germans at Arsenal — Lukas Podolski (L), Serge Gnabry (2nd R), Mesut Ozil (R) and Per Mertesacker (not in picture) — pose in the two-leg tie (Reuters)
<p>Arsenal will be out to show they have learnt the lessons of last season’s painful home defeat by Bayern Munich when the sides meet again in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie in London on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Holders Bayern were utterly dominant in 3-1 victory at the Emirates Stadium, and although Arsenal went on to salvage pride with a 2-0 win in Munich in the return leg, it was not enough to prevent the Gunners going out of the competition in the round of 16 for the third consecutive season.</p>
<p>They face a daunting task to avoid making it four years in a row, however, with the Bayern juggernaut showing little sign of slowing under Pep Guardiola, who led Barcelona to victory over Arsenal at this stage in the 2010-11 season.</p>
<p>Despite recent wobbles, Arsenal are a sterner proposition this time as they mount their first serious Premier League challenge for years, and should be boosted by a 2-1 FA Cup victory over Liverpool, eight days after the same opponents thrashed them 5-1.</p>
<p>German defender Per Mertesacker acknowledged that it would take “two perfect games” for Arsenal to progress, but that it was important not to show Bayern too much respect.</p>
<p>“We have to go for two perfect games against them,” he told reporters.</p>
<p>“We know we can beat them now, so maybe mentally we are in a better condition than last year. We respected them too much in the first leg then, so it was too easy for them.</p>
<p>“Maybe we have learned something from those lessons and will do better this time. Now we have another chance and an opportunity to beat the champions. We want to achieve something exceptional this season, so we have to beat the best.</p>
<p>“That is not only Manchester City and Chelsea, that is Bayern Munich in the Champions League.”</p>
<p>Midfielder Mikel Arteta is suspended after being sent off in the group stage loss to Napoli, while Jack Wilshere and Bacary Sagna, who remained on the bench against Liverpool, Kieran Gibbs and Santi Cazorla, who were second half substitutes and Tomas Rosicky, who was rested, were expected to return.</p>
<p>Bayern’s domestic dominance shows no sign of slowing, with Saturday’s 4-0 win over Freiburg coming despite Jerome Boateng, David Alaba, Thiago and Mario Goetze being rested.</p>
<p><strong>Bayern Dominance</strong></p>
<p>Their Bundesliga winning streak is 13 matches and victory extended their unbeaten run to 46. Their only loss in this season’s Champions League group stage came at home to Manchester City, with qualification already assured.</p>
<p>They will be without France winger Franck Ribery, who is suffering with a buttock injury, and his potential replacement Xherdan Shaqiri, who scored twice against Freiburg, is also out with a thigh strain.</p>
<p>Despite the comprehensive nature of last season’s victory in London, where early goals by Toni Kroos and Thomas Mueller put the visitors 2-0 up after only 21 minutes, Bayern captain Philipp Lahm remained wary of Arsenal.</p>
<p>“That game is a warning sign to us,” Lahm said.</p>
<p>“We had been very good in London, we thought nothing can happen to us in the return leg. All of a sudden you are 2-0 down and there are still some minutes to play. It shows that things can go really quickly in the Champions League. We will have that in the back of our minds.”</p>
<p><strong>German Connection</strong></p>
<p>Lahm said he kept a close eye on Arsenal given their strong German contingent of Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski, as well as uncapped youngster Serge Gnabry</p>
<p>“They’re fighting for the championship, that’s not a coincidence: I believe they have developed as a team. They have become much stronger, the squad is more balanced,” he said.</p>
<p>“And they still play the way Arsenal always play. They want to have the ball, they like playing it short, and they have outstanding individuals.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mukulmudgaliephotoravikanoj.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987786" alt="Justice Mukul Mudgal at the Idea Exchange on Tuesday (IE Photo Ravi Kanojia)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mukulmudgaliephotoravikanoj.jpg" /></a> Justice Mukul Mudgal at the Idea Exchange on Tuesday (IE Photo Ravi Kanojia)
<p>Days after submitting his report on the IPL spot-fixing scandal, Justice Mukul Mudgal said the much-talked-about event is not a problem child for India&#8217;s cricket board, but a cash cow.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Idea Exchange programme of the The Indian Express, Justice Mudgal said, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say IPL is a problem child for the BCCI, but it&#8217;s a cash cow. Yes, it does pester with controversies. It started with after match parties, which I believe now are being reduced. That&#8217;s where, many times, the contact with undesirable people happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the former Chief Justice, the tournament does give youngsters a lot of lucrative opportunities, but it is important to channelise the money and ensure the younger lot keeps composure.</p>
<p>&#8220;IPL does make the youngsters rub shoulders with the celebrities in cricket, teaches them temperament and gives them money. I have nothing against players getting money, it&#8217;s a good thing. Only thing is it should be channelised.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you see the situation of a youngster who is suddenly exposed to glamorous people, who he has only seen on the television, it is not easy to keep composure. This is where we need some stability. So yes there are issues with the IPL, and I&#8217;m sure they can be improved,&#8221; points out Mudgal.</p>
<p>Still looking for the romance in the gentlemen&#8217;s game, Mudgul feels the shorter format has severely affected the Tests.</p>
<p>&#8220;IPL format has hurt Test cricket. I don&#8217;t think players can play even proper session today, let alone a whole day. So I think we need to learn from Brendon McCullum and from Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman who played the entire day without getting out during the famous Kolkata Test,&#8221; said Mudgul.</p>
<p>An alumnus of the Modern Barakhamba Road, where sports is a must in the curriculum, Mudgul, though by the compulsory after-school routine, started his love-affair with sports early in his life. Despite being embroiled in all sorts of controversies, he still believes that the sports will have the last laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;My interest for sports will never go. I can get disappointed by certain factors, but I&#8217;m an optimistic by nature. I think sports will triumph over all the obstacles. That&#8217;s the way I look at it. Contrary to popular perception, I don&#8217;t think matches are routinely fixed,&#8221; said Mudgal.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987777&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mccullumapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987774" alt="Brendon McCullum, center, celebrates with team members after their series win over India on the final day of the second Test at the Basin Reserve in Wellington (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mccullumapm.jpg" /></a> Brendon McCullum, center, celebrates with team members after their series win over India on the final day of the second Test at the Basin Reserve in Wellington (AP)
<p>Brendon McCullum became the first New Zealand batsman to score a triple hundred and the New Zealand skipper said the epic innings will be etched in his memory for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>McCullum spoke at length about his record-breaking 302 runs against India in the second Test, preventing the visitors from drawing level in the series. The Black Caps won the first Test in Auckland by 40 runs, and with it the series 1-0.</p>
<p>&#8220;My innings was what was required at that stage (94/5). We were obviously scrapping to save the Test and therefore win the series, and we managed to get some partnerships under pressure. And then kept batting and batting and batting. So it was pretty satisfying to get us out of trouble and claim the series win,&#8221; said McCullum after the match ended.</p>
<p>McCullum&#8217;s innings was the highest score for a New Zealand batsman in a Test innings, overtaking Martin Crowe&#8217;s 299 against Sri Lanka, also scored at the same ground in 1991.</p>
<p>He became the 24th batsman in the history of Test cricket to score a triple-hundred and join this exclusive club.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t feeling nervous until I saw the size of the crowd. That&#8217;s probably when I understood the magnitude of the task at hand and the immense joy it gives fans of this cricket team to see guys succeed and see records broken,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a moment, when the 300 came up and the applause was ongoing for quite a while, it is really when it hit home to me that it was quite a significant achievement for a New Zealander and I&#8217;ll certainly remember them for the rest of my life,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Despite the achievement, McCullum was humble at his success and said that he was not as talented as the legends of New Zealand cricket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without being disrespectful I probably didn&#8217;t know the magnitude of it until the last 24 hours. I grew up and watched the New Zealand cricket team for years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I watched Martin Crowe score his 299 and thought it would have been an amazing feat if he scored 300 but probably didn&#8217;t quite understand how much it meant to the whole country who support this team. I also spoke to Stephen Fleming last night. I feel a little bit embarrassed because I&#8217;m nowhere near the calibre of players they were.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCullum became the second-ever New Zealand batsman to cross the 200-run mark in a Test innings thrice, after Fleming.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old shared a record 352-run partnership for the sixth wicket with BJ Watling and then James Neesham smacked a maiden Test hundred on debut to further rub salt on the Indian wounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully I had partners at the other end who also played brilliant innings. I thought BJ and Neesh, their innings were outstanding. BJ&#8217;s in particular because he came in when we were five down for 90-odd and he obviously came off a duck in the first innings as well. To play an innings like that is testament to how strong a character he is,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Neesh in his first Test match, with the game still reasonably poised to come out and play his natural game, which is aggressive, takes a lot of courage, so I was pretty lucky to have those guys there. Then I had to fight the emotion when I hit the ball a bit harder than I was trying to hit and make sure of the team goal first and foremost.&#8221;</p>
<p>New Zealand didn&#8217;t declare until late into the first session on day five, leaving 435 runs for India to get in two sessions, an impossible task and one that sealed their fate in this series.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were 1-0 up in the series and, two and a half days ago we were staring down the barrel of an early finish on day three. We didn&#8217;t want to pass up all that good work we had done to try and give India a sniff back into the series.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always try and win but at some point you&#8217;ve got to acknowledge the game was out of your reach and then you fought your way back into it. Hence we made sure we got a score where we knew we were going to lose and then we could be as aggressive as we wanted, and hopefully if we got some early wickets then some pressure might set in. But they&#8217;re class players and they stood up,&#8221; said McCullum.</p>
<p>McCullum would be thankful to Virat Kohli too as he celebrates the achievement, given that the triple century couldn&#8217;t have happened if the Indian hadn&#8217;t dropped him when he was on 9 runs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what sort of wine Kohli drinks but he probably got his bit of karma back this afternoon (scoring a hundred after given not out off a visible edge). I very much appreciated him putting that one down but thankfully I didn&#8217;t offer too many chances after that,&#8221; said the star batsman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have a quiet beer with my team-mates. Just catch up with the boys and pledge up in the changing room and just reflect on a season that&#8217;s been pretty important for us and the game in New Zealand,&#8221; McCullum signed off.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987764&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/graemesmithapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987752" alt="Aside from AB, the top six South African batsmen managed just 57 runs in the first innings in Pretoria and 68 in the second (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/graemesmithapm.jpg" /></a> Aside from AB, the top six South African batsmen managed just 57 runs in the first innings in Pretoria and 68 in the second (AP)
<p>Whether to stick with an all-rounder at number seven or play an extra batsman to counter Australia&#8217;s fiery bowling attack is the vexed question for South Africa ahead of the second Test at St George&#8217;s Park in Port Elizabeth starting on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Australians were clearly superior in all three disciplines in their crushing 281-run victory in the first Test in Pretoria last week, the excellent Ashes form of fast bowler Mitchell Johnson repeated at SuperSport Park as he literally hurt the South African batsmen with 12 wickets and numerous body blows.</p>
<p>One of those was to the side of the head of all-rounder Ryan McLaren, who has subsequently been ruled out of the second Test with concussion meaning there will be at least one change to the Proteas line-up.</p>
<p>It is possible McLaren might have lost his position in any event as South Africa admit they are considering replacing an all-rounder with a seventh batsman in Dean Elgar.</p>
<p>Aside from AB de Villiers&#8217; 91 and 48, the top six South African batsmen managed just 57 runs in the first innings in Pretoria and 68 in the second.</p>
<p>The left-handed Elgar&#8217;s Test career, which started with a pair of ducks on debut against Australia in Perth in 2012 when he was bagged both times by Johnson, has been mediocre with a single unbeaten century against New Zealand and a next highest score of 27 in nine innings.</p>
<p>Having chosen not to call up a replacement for McLaren to their Test squad, Elgar is the only specialist batsman available for selection.</p>
<p>&#8220;There (has been) debate around playing an extra batter,&#8221; Proteas convener of selectors Andrew Hudson told reporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Australia went in batting-heavy, relying on their three seamers and their spinner, which they did successfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to consider putting in a batter at seven. Then we can go in with the three quicks and Robbie P (Peterson).&#8221;</p>
<p>Should they opt for another all-round option then Wayne Parnell will get the nod on his home ground, the left-arm quick unlucky to lose out to McLaren in the first Test.</p>
<p>Australia, who have not lost a Test series in South Africa since 1970, also have a selection poser in the lead-up to the Port Elizabeth game if all-rounder Shane Watson returns to fitness in time.</p>
<p>Watson exacerbated a persistent calf injury on the eve of the first Test and watched from the stands as new two players both made significant contributions to Australia&#8217;s cause in Pretoria.</p>
<p>Shaun Marsh scored a century in his first Test appearance in two years while debutante Alex Doolan came within 11 runs of a debut Test ton as Australia dominated their hosts to bat them inside four days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously we&#8217;ll have to see what the wicket is like; whether we need the extra bowling option. You&#8217;d like him to bowl,&#8221; Australia coach Darren Lehman said on Monday, suggesting Watson would not be selected for his batting alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Firstly we&#8217;ve got to get him fit, and then we&#8217;ll see what happens from there. He&#8217;s pretty close; he was running on Sunday, but at the end of the day we&#8217;ve got to get him fit and ready to play Test cricket at this level.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third and final Test will be played in Cape Town from Mar 1.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987747&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At home, our national cricket team is a lion. Outside India, we are a mix of a timid mouse and a guest being interviewed by Arnab, with the incompetence of the Sochi organizers thrown in. The latest debacle in New Zealand is more of the same: win, lose or draw, we have managed to turn victory into something very like defeat.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the funniest pictures from the internet, bemoaning Team India’s lack of consistency.</strong></p>
<p><em>Some numbers, to give you the bigger picture</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mahendrasinghdhonizaheerapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987687" alt="India looked like winning the second Test, as they reduced New Zealand to 94 for five in their second innings (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mahendrasinghdhonizaheerapm.jpg" /></a> India looked like winning the second Test, as they reduced New Zealand to 94 for five in their second innings (AP)
<p>Despite his team being overwhelmingly crushed by New Zealand during the tour, India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni put up a brave front, saying it was &#8220;quite a good performance&#8221; by his team in the Test matches.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a disastrous tour for India as they remained winless, losing the ODI series 0-4 and the Test series 0-1. The visitors ended the ignominious tour of New Zealand by drawing the second and final Test.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, quite a good performance. We have been improving right from South Africa. We have shown that we are a side that&#8217;s very talented,&#8221; said Dhoni at the post match presentation ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did well in the series, in this Test because we fought back pretty well ourselves. We bowled the right areas, which I think is very important on the flat wickets,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Having bundled out the Black Caps for 192 in the first innings and taken a 246-run lead, India looked like winning the second Test, as they reduced New Zealand to 94 for five in their second innings.</p>
<p>But Brendon McCullum (302) staged a remarkable fightback and together with BJ Watling shared a world record partnership of 352 runs for the sixth wicket to take the hosts to safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first Test our second innings was brilliant. And then we came here won the toss and bowled really well in the first innings. In the second innings also we got a good start till Brendon and Watling came in. I don&#8217;t think it was bad bowling but it is just that they kept the good deliveries out,&#8221; the Indian skipper explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Appreciate what Brendon and Watling did, soak up the pressure when we were bowling well and score freely once the bowlers tired,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Despite the bowlers failing to wrap up the innings after reducing the New Zealanders to 94 for five, Dhoni chose not to be too critical.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to field for two and a half days and I must appreciate the way the bowlers took the challenge. Even when the third new ball was taken, they ran in hard and looked for wickets. They were willing to go on. I think they did whatever they could. At the end of the day we will accept the result.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot always put pressure on our batsmen and bowlers, saying that they did badly. It was fantastic to see how our bowlers bowled, especially the fact that when they took the second and the third new ball, they put in a lot of effort,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>Dhoni praised his counterpart McCullum for his triple-hundred, saying that his side tried everything to get him out but couldn&#8217;t succeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We bowled for two and a half days. We tried everything &#8212; all fielding positions, three new balls &#8212; and after that you have to appreciate that they batted well. We had to break that partnership (between McCullum and Watling) to get to the lower order batsmen.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you bowl to a set of batsmen for two days, you try everything from catching in slips to catching cover to deep square leg to deep point to bowling on pads to bowling outside off. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#8217;t work,&#8221; said Dhoni.</p>
<p>&#8220;They kept on playing, and playing 500-odd deliveries itself is very tough, forget the amount of runs scored. It was one of the good innings we saw,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Asked if it was a lack of killer instinct on the Indians&#8217; part to not able to seal the match then, Dhoni replied: &#8220;We were trying. It is very difficult to pinpoint one thing. To maintain pressure, it becomes very difficult with a three fast bowlers and one spinner combination. That was one area where our fast bowlers did really well. They were able to hit consistent line and length throughout.</p>
<p>&#8220;We bowled close to 200-odd overs and still they were able to hit the same spot with good intensity, which itself means a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>India have now lost back-to-back overseas tours, thereby lengthening their poor performances on foreign soil.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ODIs loss was disappointing to some extent. In South Africa we didn&#8217;t get much time to prepare. Here we didn&#8217;t capitalise on good starts or didn&#8217;t have good partnerships in the middle. We saw a glimpse of that in Test matches too.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Test series, we knew would be slightly tough here because there are not many players who have played more than five, six or seven Tests, which means it is always a good exposure for all of them,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first Test we bowled well in the second innings to come back into the game. Then when we were batting we had a good partnership going but we lost wickets and that put pressure back on us. That&#8217;s an area where we need to improve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overall, our performances have been good. The wickets in both Test matches turned out to be on the flatter side, especially this one. It kept getting better and better for batting. We bowled well. If we compare to South Africa, there are a lot of positives to take along from this series,&#8221; Dhoni said.</p>
<p>Trailing by 246 runs, the Black Caps were struggling in their second innings as well before McCullum and Watling came to the hosts&#8217; rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t look too much ahead. What was important was that one wicket at a time, said Dhoni, talking about that situation when the hosts looked set for defeat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once New Zealand had a lead of over 300, I told my team from this point on there is only one winner in this game. If somebody will win this Test, it will be New Zealand, if we don&#8217;t bat well. A day earlier I told my team, as of now where we stand, there is only one winner, and that is the Indian team, if we bowl well, if we get couple of wickets then we can definitely win this Test.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being in the current scenario more often really helps you assess the real condition as to what it is and where you need to be,&#8221; the skipper pointed out.</p>
<p>In the long run it means a hard jog for India as they will tour England and Australia later this year. But there would be some respite as they will play in the Asia Cup and World T20 in Bangladesh, followed by the Indian Premier League.</p>
<p>&#8220;The IPL is actually a relief for us because that is when our season ends and we get a month&#8217;s break after playing all these tournaments. But even then it is important to remember what we have learnt from these two tours in South Africa and New Zealand, and gain from this exposure. England and Australia will be big tours for us,&#8221; Dhoni said.</p>
<p>The Indian captain said he was also looking forward to coming back to New Zealand for the World Cup next year, which will be jointly hosted by Australia.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fantastic country, the atmosphere was very good. Wickets in the ODIs were on the flatter side, good bounce, small outfield, so it&#8217;s entertaining for the fans. They\ appreciate good cricket, enjoy the opposition&#8217;s success too.</p>
<p>Overall, a fantastic venue to play cricket and enjoy cricket. A bit tough at time but that&#8217;s what international cricket is all about.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always loved New Zealand and we are looking forward to coming here next year for the World Cup,&#8221; Dhoni signed off.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987673&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/brendonmccullumapm.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1987575" alt="BrendonMcCullumAPM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/brendonmccullumapm.jpg" /></a> Brendon McCullum&#8217;s triple-century was the 28th in Test cricket and the New Zealand skipper became the 24th player to score one (AP)
<p>New Zealand recorded their first Test series victory over India since 2002 when the second match ended in a draw on Tuesday after Brendon McCullum had become the first New Zealander to score a Test triple century.</p>
<p>Captain McCullum&#8217;s 302 anchored New Zealand&#8217;s record 680 for eight declared, setting the visitors the impossible task of scoring 435 runs in 67 overs to achieve the victory they needed after the hosts won the first Test at Eden Park by 40 runs.</p>
<p>New Zealand had India in trouble early in their second innings with the sniff of an unlikely victory in their nostrils but once Virat Kohli knuckled down to record his sixth Test century, McCullum and Mahendra Singh Dhoni decided to call the game off with 15 overs remaining.</p>
<p>Tim Southee took two wickets after lunch to reduce India to 54 for three before Kohli (105 not out) and Rohit Sharma (31 not out) batted out the remainder of the day&#8217;s play to take their side through to 166 for three.</p>
<p>Having driven New Zealand to safety by the end of the fourth day, the big question before play began on Tuesday was whether McCullum had declared overnight, 19 runs short of his personal milestone but giving his bowlers the chance to attack as India attempted to score 326 in 90 overs.</p>
<p>McCullum, however, returned with debutant Jimmy Neesham (67 overnight), as the queues formed outside the ground to see what many in the small crowd hoped would be history in the making.</p>
<p>He scored his first run of the day when he pushed an Ishant Sharma delivery wide of mid-off and strolled through for a single, which was warmly applauded, and pulled the bowler to the midwicket fence for his first boundary.</p>
<p>Ishant caused a collective intake of breath when he comprehensively beat McCullum on 293, though the batsman did not get a nick.</p>
<p>Neesham, however, was not getting caught up in the emotion as the tension ramped up with every delivery, every over that McCullum was still at the crease being applauded.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old temporarily stole his captain&#8217;s thunder with his first Test century when he tucked Ishant off his hip for two runs.</p>
<p>Neesham&#8217;s century came from 123 balls, including 15 boundaries, and was greeted with a massive cheer from the crowd as he raised his arms and celebrated.</p>
<p>McCullum then reached the milestone many had been waiting for when he dabbed Zaheer Khan behind square for his 32nd four and received a sustained round of applause that went on for more than a minute, while his father Stu jumped to his feet in celebration.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old&#8217;s innings lasted just two more balls when he feathered a catch off Zaheer to Dhoni.</p>
<p>His triple-century was the 28th in Test cricket and the New Zealand skipper became the 24th player to score one.</p>
<p>Brian Lara, Virender Sehwag, Chris Gayle and Don Bradman all struck two triple-tons.</p>
<p>McCullum scored 535 runs in the two-match series, having also scored 224 in the first game in Auckland.</p>
<p>Neesham was 137 not out when McCullum declared at New Zealand&#8217;s highest Test score, surpassing the 671-4 they scored against Sri Lanka in 1991 at the same ground.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987571&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ramkumarm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987637" alt="Ramkumar was granted a wildcard here, something that spared him from going through the qualifiers" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ramkumarm.jpg" /></a> Ramkumar was granted a wildcard here, something that spared him from going through the qualifiers
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ramkumar Ramanathan had a good season last year, moving up close to 400 spots on the ATP rankings list. But as is the case with almost all young talent — Ramkumar turned 19 last November — the question is not how much ground he has covered until now, but how far he can go.</span></p>
<p>Despite the promising run in 2013 and a bright start this year, Ramkumar is still ranked only 407 as of now, a rating that won’t get him a direct entry even into a fifth-tier tennis tournament — like the Challenger series event currently going on in Delhi. Ramkumar was granted a wildcard here, something that spared him from going through the qualifiers, which is a bit of a bonus.</p>
<p>At the Kolkata Challenger, needing to win three qualifying matches to even get into the main draw, he was knocked out in the first. The wildcard here, though it spared Ramkumar from slogging it out on the outside courts against other journeyman tennis players who populate the lower rung of the tennis ladder, pits him first up against one of the tournament favourites in Ilija Bozolijac, who won the Kolkata challenger last week.</p>
<p>Still, the Serbian (currently ranked 204, but with a career-high 101 in 2007) will not be a shoo in for a second round spot. At the Chennai Open this year, Ramkumar gave the first big sign of his talent when he stunned Somdev Devvarman, ranked more than 400 spots above him, in the first round. It was as much the result as the aggressive tennis Ramkumar played that caught the eye. He served big — at 6 feet 2 inches he can put a fair bit of thump on the ball — and climbed into forehands. When he missed, the point ended rather prematurely, but when he hit, it looked good.</p>
<p>The win over the top-100 player was surely not expected?</p>
<p>“If I felt it was unexpected, then I could not have won,” he says. “It was a good week. It gave me a lot of confidence.”<br />
Confidence is one of the very few things Ramkumar packs in his bag before a contest. He usually goes into a game with little baggage, choosing not to clog his mind with details about his approach regarding a particular opponent or the specifics of his game plan.</p>
<p>“I just play aggressive tennis, that is how I have always played,” he says. “You can’t really think between games, you just play to win every point.”</p>
<p>There is certainly something to be said for tactical flexibility and construction of a point in tennis, aspects of the game Ramkumar will probably figure out over time. Right now, though, the former junior national champion is busy tooling his game and concentrating on fitness.</p>
<p>“Other players mature fast physically. For Indians, it takes a while. Right now, I am working on my upper body and back. I play tennis for around four hours a day and then we have about two hours of stretching and exercises,” he says, about his routine at the Sanchez-Casal academy in Barcelona, where he has spent close to two years.</p>
<p>He stresses on the not-overdoing-things bit once more.</p>
<p>“The coaches there know when you are stressed out. They are former players themselves. They don’t push you like crazy. If you’ve had a hard week they give you a day off, sometimes two. We all go out for a dinner or to a movie, the players and the coaches,” he says.</p>
<p>The uncomplicated approach and uncompromising aggression Ramkumar brings to his game may not light up the tournament beyond the first round, but it will surely make for very watchable tennis.</p>
<p><strong>Sanam loses</strong></p>
<p>Sanam Singh, who was one of the few Indian singles players in action on Monday, made the higher-ranked Illya Marchenko dig deep, but was eventually beaten 2-6, 6-3, 4-6. Sanam inexplicably refused to approach the net, keeping one of his better suits locked firmly in the closet until midway through the second set. His baseline battles with the bigger, harder-hitting opponent yielded little, as the 140th-ranked Marchenko claimed the first set 6-2 in about 20 minutes and was up a break in the second.</p>
<p>No sooner did Sanam (ranked 352) start venturing forward than Marchenko began to lose a bit of rhythm. The Indian claimed the second set and despite going a break down early in the decider, levelled soon and at 4-4 had several break point opportunities to serve for the match. However, Marchenko held on and broke Sanam in the next game to move to the second round.</p>
<p>Somdev, Ramkumar and Yuki Bhambri will play their first-round matches on Tuesday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987340&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/barcelonaplayersapm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987635" alt="Barcelona's players train in the rain at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium, Manchester (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/barcelonaplayersapm.jpg" /></a> Barcelona&#8217;s players train in the rain at Manchester City&#8217;s Etihad Stadium, Manchester (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Free-scoring Manchester City will face the toughest test yet of their European credentials when they face European aristocrats Barcelona in the first leg of the standout tie of the Champions League round of 16 on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>Both teams will start what promises to be a memorable duel at the Etihad Stadium boosted by superb wins on Saturday, with City returning to their best form in beating Chelsea 2-0 in the FA Cup and Barcelona crushing Rayo Vallecano 6-0 in La Liga.</p>
<p>Both were also boosted by the return of important players after injury.</p>
<p>Samir Nasri came on as a second-half substitute for City after missing seven games and scored City’s second against Chelsea within minutes of his arrival while Neymar also returned as a substitute in the second half for the Spanish champions to score a stunning goal after four matches out to complete Barca’s scoring.</p>
<p>Neymar is likely to be on the bench at the start on Tuesday, which may offer some relief for the home team, who will probably have to raise their already impressive game to even greater heights if they are to knock out the four-times European champions.</p>
<p>City coach Manuel Pellegrini is well aware of what Barca are capable of from his time with Villarreal, Malaga and Real Madrid in Spain, while City’s free-ranging midfielder Yaya Toure spent three years at the Nou Camp and won ever major honour with them, including the Champions League in 2009.</p>
<p>In an interview with Champions Magazine, Toure said he expected City to win the first leg to show how far the club have come since the injection of Sheikh Mansour’s cash totally transformed them from domestic also-rans to potential European champions.</p>
<p>City are in uncharted waters as far as the Champions League is concerned, having been knocked out at the group stage in their two previous appearances.</p>
<p>But they are the highest scoring team in this season’s competition with 28 goals.</p>
<p>City gave a hint of their growing strength with a 3-2 win away to champions Bayern Munich in the group stage, and they have scored 117 goals in all competitions this season.</p>
<p>The Spanish champions had the perfect warm-up on Saturday when Messi, who looks to be back to his best after returning in early January from a two-month injury layoff, scored twice to overtake Alfredo di Stefano in La Liga scoring history. Messi’s 228 goals in 263 games took him to joint third on the all-time list with Raul, behind Telmo Zarra (251) and Hugo Sanchez (234). Messi has now scored 337 goals for Barcelona, a record for one club.</p>
<p>As well as Messi having an outstanding game on Saturday, midfielders Cesc Fabregas and Andres Iniesta turned in scintillating displays and in-form forwards Pedro and Alexis also scored as Barca totally overwhelmed second-from-bottom Rayo at the Nou Camp.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>bullish bayer</strong></p>
<p>Bayer Leverkusen are confident their recent poor form will not stop them overcoming Zlatan Ibrahimovic-led Paris St Germain in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie in Germany on Tuesday. It will be the first time the sides have met in Europe and the Germans have an excellent home record against French opposition in European competition, winning four out of six matches.</p>
<p>Domestically, however, Leverkusen have struggled recently and have lost five of their last seven matches.<br />
With Edinson Cavani recovering from a thigh problem and expected to return before the end the month, the talismanic Ibrahimovic will lead the attack. The Swede, who scored a personal best eight goals in the group stage, said he was determined to help PSG win the Champions League.<br />

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A senior adviser to the Sochi Olympics convened an emergency meeting late last week with top winter sports officials at the Park Inn hotel in the Alpine village here. A situation had grown dire. It was not security, attendance or doping that was the problem. It was salt.</span></p>
<p>Four months earlier, Hans Pieren, one of the world&#8217;s leading experts on salt and snow, had told Sochi officials that the Alpine skiing events required more than 19 tons of salt, a crucial ingredient for melting soft snow so it can refreeze into a hard surface. But the organizers did not listen, to their great regret. Now, with 10 days of competition remaining, many of the Games&#8217; signature events were in jeopardy of being compromised, and even canceled.</p>
<p>Tim Gayda, a Canadian consultant who is a senior adviser to the Sochi organizers, called the meeting on Thursday night, according to some people who were there. He told the group that the strongest kind of salt, the large-grain variety, was simply not available in Russia. Mr. Gayda asked the group an urgent question: Does anyone know how we can get 25 tons of salt &#8211; tonight?</p>
<p>From there, a confidential international mission unspooled &#8211; a mountaintop “Ocean&#8217;s Eleven” &#8211; that just may have prevented a major Olympic embarrassment. This Sochi salt accord involved a Swiss salt salesman working late into the night; a rerouted airplane that may or may not have come from Bulgaria; an Olympian turned salt savant; and Russians powerful enough to clear months of customs bureaucracy overnight.</p>
<p>It began with Mr. Pieren, 52, a ruddy Swiss skier who works as a senior race director for F.I.S., the international ski federation. He discusses the merits of different salt grains with the precision of a jeweler and often carries plastic sandwich bags with grains of salt &#8211; fine, medium and large.</p>
<p>Last September, Mr. Pieren made a final inspection of the Alpine skiing courses and told Sochi organizers that he needed 19 tons of salt for the Games: two tons of fine-grain salt, seven tons of medium and, most important, 10 tons of large-grain Himalayan-style salt. This was the heavy-duty salt that sinks deep into the snow, lasts longer and is most effective in warm weather.</p>
<p>But Sochi organizers did not listen. After spending more than $50 billion on the Games, they did not order the full amount of salt recommended, which would have cost perhaps a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Sochi had hardly any large salt crystals, less than a ton &#8211; nowhere near enough to harden expanses of soft snow, according to Mr. Pieren. And temperatures on the mountain were rising.</p>
<p>It was not just the Alpine skiing races that were in trouble. Mr. Pieren fielded frantic calls from colleagues across the mountain &#8211; at cross-country, the halfpipe, Nordic combined. All were in need of salt. Prominent athletes began to complain about the conditions.</p>
<p>When Mr. Gayda asked about arranging an emergency infusion of salt, Mr. Pieren knew where to turn. He called Schweizer Rheinsalinen, a 160-year-old company near Basel, Switzerland, that sits on the banks of the river (the Rhine) for which it is named.</p>
<p>Mr. Pieren said Olympic officials would buy 24 tons if it could be shipped immediately. At roughly $150 a ton, the bill would be more than $3,500.</p>
<p>Once Schweizer Rheinsalinen agreed to the sale, the international ski federation helped reroute a plane to Zurich.</p>
<p>When the plane landed in Sochi, Russian officials expedited the customs process, according to the Sochi organizing committee. “The importation of the salt was done with full cooperation of all of the relevant authorities who treated this as a priority,” the organization said in a statement.</p>
<p>After the salt passed a security check Friday, Olympic vehicles took the load straight to the mountain, and about 24 hours after the emergency salt meeting, workers stood on the mountain, sprinkling the soft snow with big-grained salt, fresh from Switzerland.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987321&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[FIH was earlier named as a party in the HC since it had asked the IOA to take a decision on the recognition. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987317&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">In a setback for the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF), the Supreme Court on Monday gave its approval for keeping International Hockey Federation (FIH) out of a legal battle between IHF and Hockey India (HI) over recognition of the sole body to run the game in the country.</span></p>
<p>A bench of Justices HL Dattu and SA Bobde dismissed a plea by the IHF to have the international body as a party to the case since dropping their name would take them out of the ambit of the court&#8217;s final decision. The bench upheld the Delhi High Court order whereby FIH&#8217;s prayer to be deleted from the array of parties was allowed.</p>
<p>The development is significant in view of the recent amendment in the rules by the FIH, which has now decided to rule by its own as to whether the IHF or HI has to be recognised as the sporting body to manage the game of hockey in India.</p>
<p>FIH was earlier named as a party in the High Court since it had asked the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to take a decision on the recognition. IOA had accepted a decision by its special committee that HI should be the official body in the country. But the</p>
<p>High Court, on a petition by IHF, had ordered to maintain status quo till the case is finally disposed off.<br />
change of rules</p>
<p>Subsequently, the FIH changed its rules and took it upon itself to pronounce over the recognition of the body. It then moved the High Court and got its name deleted as a party, saying it had withdrawn its directive to the IOA for deciding on the recognition.</p>
<p>On Monday, senior advocate UU Lalit, appearing for the IHF, urged the bench to keep FIH as a party since the change in rules was an attempt to run away from the jurisdiction of an Indian Court. He said that the order of the IOA on recognising HI was liable to be challenged in an Indian court but if FIH now recognises HI, the IHF may have no legal remedy since it was an international body with its office in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The bench however responded: “Will an order by a high court be enforceable on an international body? Jurisdiction of this court will not go to the FIH, which is in Switzerland. What would the High Court do if an international body comes up and says we don&#8217;t want to be a party to a case? We don&#8217;t think the High Court did not anything wrong.”</p>
<p>It added that the IHF should think of appearing before the FIH to present its case and tell the international body that there were court orders favouring its recognition.</p>
<p>“Its a matter between the FIH and the IOA. You will have to look for an appropriate remedy in law if the FIH passes an order not in consonance with what the High Court has said. But presently we cannot do anything,” said the court while dismissing the IHF&#8217;s plea.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987317&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[The Wizards are placed third in the points table with 27 points from nine matches.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987313&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Uttar Pradesh Wizards&#8217; will play their last home match when they meet Dabur Mumbai Magicians at the Dhyan Chand Stadium, Lucknow, on Tuesday. This will be their fifth match at the venue and in the four games played here so far, they have lost in two, drawn one and won one. The victory came when they beat Kalinga Lancers 3-1 a little over a week ago.</span></p>
<p>Their performance on home turf might not be very impressive but they had defeated the Mumbai Magicians in Mumbai 5-3 in their second league encounter. The Wizards are placed third in the points table with 27 points from nine matches, while Mumbai Magicians are at the bottom of the table with 13 points from the same number of outings.</p>
<p>Though the teams are coming off contrasting results &#8211; the Mumbai team had registered a 3-2 victory against Kalinga Lancers on Sunday while UP Wizards lost 1-2 to Punjab Warriors on Saturday &#8211; their respective positions on the points table makes the home side favourites.</p>
<p>Wizards coach Roelant Oltmans felt that Tuesday&#8217;s match was crucial because it was their final league game before the semifinals. VR Raghunath, the captain UP Wizards team, also echoed similar sentiments. &#8220;It&#8217;s our last league match. We need to make sure that we don&#8217;t make the mistakes that we made in our last game. After this match we can&#8217;t afford to make mistakes because we will be playing the knockouts,&#8221; Raghunath said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987313&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/chayankgosainiccm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987602" alt="Chayank Gosain had sent back Akhil Herwadkar, captain Vijay Zol and Ankush Bains with the total on just 19 (ICC)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/chayankgosainiccm.jpg" /></a> Chayank Gosain had sent back Akhil Herwadkar, captain Vijay Zol and Ankush Bains with the total on just 19 (ICC)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Being the son of a restaurant manager at Khushi&#8217;s in Edinburgh, Chayank Gosain is used to requests from his teammates for the occasional Indian curry take-aways. On-the-house. His answer is always &#8216;No&#8217;. But still, much to his chagrin, the requests never stop. Not surprising, considering how popular the curries on Antigua Street are among the locals.</span></p>
<p>“I just ask them to go get a life. It&#8217;s too much a hassle,” he says.</p>
<p>For a brief yet manic half-hour at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium (DICS), however, it looked like Gosain would be in line to buy dinner for the entire Scotland U-19 team on Monday night. That too, without any reservations. The 18-year-old left-arm spinner had after all held his Indian opponents captive during that time.</p>
<p>The defending world champions had come out chasing a paltry sum of 89. But within the space of 24 deliveries, their top-order had been spun out by Gosain. Opening the bowling, like he has done for the last 10 matches in Scotland colours, the lanky tweaker had sent back Akhil Herwadkar, captain Vijay Zol and Ankush Bains with the total on just 19. Beanpole pacer Gavin Main then added to their woes, reducing the Indians to 22/5 and leaving them staring at a potentially humiliating upset. And ironically, it was a Delhi-born expat teen who looked set to pull the rug from under the Indian feet.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, Sarfaraz Khan and Deepak Hooda did save India the blushes. But not before Gosain had finished with impressive figures of 3/31 in his 10-over spell.</p>
<p>“It was like a daze. The total was not huge. But Ross (McLean) asked me to stick to my strengths. I naturally do not flight the ball much and focus on holding good lines and lengths. I did just that, and the wickets just happened,” Gosain said, speaking to this paper.</p>
<p>Though he sounds quintessentially Scottish now, Gosain, or Cheeky as he&#8217;s fondly known in the Scotland dressing-room, only moved to Edinburgh when he was nine, when father Madan got the managerial job at the eatery. He had already started playing cricket by then, although he was then a left-arm seamer.</p>
<p>“My mother (Surabhi) and I moved over only a year later. It took me some time to get used to the totally different lifestyle but within a month my dad enrolled me in a club and I started playing as a spinner,” recalls Gosain, who took no time in making it to the junior hall-of-fame of the Carlton Club. The half Punjabi-half Gujarati teen though is quick to admit that the shift from pace to spin had nothing to do with the stereotype of Indian-origin cricketers representing other countries. But more to do with the physical challenges of fast bowling.</p>
<p>While nobody in his family before him played sport at a competitive level, Gosain reveals that his parents have over time accepted the fact that their son is representing Scotland and not his land of birth. While Cheeky was the star with the ball when Scotland won their opening encounter against Papua New Guinea two days ago with figures of 3/17, he had his parents cheering him on vociferously from the stands.</p>
<p><strong>Family support</strong></p>
<p>“They were there today as well and cheering as loudly. But the Indian boys supporting their team were just too much for them and dwarfed their voices,” adds Gosain. Despite his background, Gosain is very much the typical Scottish youth, preferring to spend time with his friends, when not at school, exploring teen hang-outs around Edinburgh. He also insists on having been to Khushi&#8217;s only once in the last few years. While he has made three visits to India since his family shifted base, he hasn&#8221;t retained any significant Indian influence in his life. Except of course his knowledge of Hindi, which he speaks at home.</p>
<p>Though he didn&#8217;t get involved in any banter with his Indian opponents at DICS while the watch was on, Gosain does admit to have been tempted to break away from his clipped Scottish tone while the two teams were shaking hands at the end of it. “I wanted to tell them,” he says, “Mere khyaal se toh hume match jeetna chahiye tha.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987311&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Ask Ratnesh Mishra, the Uttar Pradesh Under-19 coach, what special skill his ward, the chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav, has and he says, “wake him up from his sleep and ask him to bowl and he will bowl on the same spot again and again”.</span></p>
<p>On Monday, Kuldeep struck once and then again and again to take a hat-trick against Scotland. His figures of 4 for 28 were matched by off-spinner Aamir Gani as Scotland were bowled out for just 88 in 29.4 overs. In reply, India were reduced to 22 for five but Sarfaraz Khan and Deepak Hooda added an unbeaten 70 for the sixth wicket as India won with 165 balls to spare.</p>
<p>Though Scotland were to be easy pickings for the Indians, it was the three deliveries from Kuldeep — the last two of the nineteenth over and the first of the 20th over — which ensured that Scotland would not punch above their weight.</p>
<p>“During the last match things didn&#8217;t go as expected for me but today I just backed myself and concentrated on my line and variations,” Yadav said after his four-wicket haul. The pitch at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium was on the slower side, a completely different surface from the one on which Kuldeep made a shift from a medium-pacer to a spinner.</p>
<p>His coach Kapil Pandey realised that Kuldeep wasn&#8217;t going to be tall enough to be a fast bowler so he convinced him to turn to spin.</p>
<p>Kuldeep recalls that he was reluctant initially but in hindsight the decision proved to be life-changing rare art.</p>
<p>On a cemented track, Pandey asked Kuldeep to bowl spin. His ward came up with the chinaman variety, rare for a bowler from the sub-continent.</p>
<p>“My coach was happy with what he saw of me. Soon I discovered that the Chinaman came naturally to me. When I went to play for my state many thought I will have a style similar to Paul Adams but they all were all surprised to see that I had a side-on action,” Kuldeep recalled.</p>
<p>Against Scotland, Kuldeep was effective but he will face tougher tests in the competition. Kuldeep, who was picked by the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL auction, hopes to remain focussed on the task at hand. “I&#8217;m happy to get a contract but this is not the time to think about it. We all want to win the World Cup,” he said.</p>
<p>When India plays Papua New Guinea next, Kuldeep hopes he bowls another dream spell. Just like his coach says he does if he is woken up and asked to deliver the cricket ball.</p>
<p><strong>Half the total</strong></p>
<p>On Monday, meanwhile, opener Andrew Umeed scored half of Scotland’s runs with a 77-ball 44 before the rest capitulated miserably. Gavin Main was the only other Scottish batsman to touch the double-figure mark with a 22-ball 16.</p>
<p>Kuldeep and Aamir Gani were the pick of Indian bowlers with four wickets apiece. But Kuldeep shone brighter with his historic feat, which came in the 19th and 21st over. Nick Farrar (0), Kyle Stirling (0) and Alex Baum (5) were the batsmen to fall to Kuldeep in the spectacular spell.</p>
<p>The tweaker had Farrar caught by Deepak Hooda at square leg, before trapping Stirling LBW off his last delivery in the 19th over. Kuldeep completed the hat-trick in the 21st over when he crashed through the stumps of Baum to notch up a historic feat.</p>
<p>Kuldeep was brilliantly backed by off-spinner Gani, who ended Umeed&#8217;s resistance by piercing his bat and pad to rattle his stumps. Later he cleaned up the tail to complete a dominating bowling display by the Indians.</p>
<p>All of the bowlers’ efforts was soon negated as the defending champions came in for a shock when they took the field for what looked like an easy chase. Their first wicket fell with just one run on the board when Chayank Gosain got opener Akhil Herwadkar (0) to edge one to wicketkeeper Baum.</p>
<p>Skipper Vijay Zol went back without disturbing the scorer, while the rest of the top half failed to touch the double-digit mark before the middle order stepped in to arrest the slide and save the embarrassment. Gosain was the wrecker-in-chief for Scotland and ended with impressive figures of three for 31 in his 10 overs.</p>
<p>Sarfaraz Khan was the saviour for India with an unbeaten 51-ball 45, which included five fours and a six. He was well-supported by Hooda, who also chipped in with an unbeaten 40-ball 24 to help steer the team home. Hooda struck two fours during his stay at the crease.</p>
<p><strong>Brief scores: </strong>Scotland: 88 in 29.4 overs (Andrew Umeed 44, Kuldeep Yadav 4/28, Aamir Gani 4/28); India: 92/5 in 22.3 overs (Sarfaraz Khan 45, Chayank Gosain 3/31).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987306&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the time you unfold this newspaper, Brendon McCullum would’ve, in all likelihood, become New Zealand’s first triple centurion in his country’s 84-year Test history. But long before the paperboy slipped today’s edition under your front door, McCullum had already achieved a milestone of great significance. A milestone far greater than fantastic feats or soaring statistics. A milestone that has transformed the image of a nation.</p>
<p>While you slept on either side of your lazy Sunday, the Kiwi skipper woke New Zealand cricket up from a snoring slumber and trained it to fight. So much so that now, regardless of how this match and the series ends in Wellington by this afternoon, cricket’s favourite underdog no longer resembles the well-manicured pooch that wags its tail from your neighbour’s lawn, but more a mongrel that chases your car down the road and snarls at your children.</p>
<p>This growling metamorphosis was caused by one soft-spoken man, in all of two days. Quite like another shy batsman who placed a spine under Indian cricket’s sagging hide, over the course of a Test match in Kolkata 13 years ago.</p>
<p>The similarities between VVS Laxman’s Eden Gardens epic and McCullum’s under-construction masterclass at the Basin Reserve go well beyond the figure of 281. Both turned around matches that weren’t ever supposed to be turned around (India were following-on against the Aussies in 2001, New Zealand were hurtling towards an innings defeat at 94/5).</p>
<p>Both were involved in 300 plus run stands with the last recognised batsman in the order (Rahul Dravid batting at six and wicketkeeper BJ Watling at seven). Both batted for a good part of the third day and the entirety of the fourth. And both were on the verge of a triple century to begin Day Five.</p>
<p>But the most important parallel between these two epoch-defining knocks is this: Both Laxman and McCullum chose world cricket’s figurehead-of-the-hour to send their respective message across (Incidentally, Laxman scored over third of his centuries against Australia and McCullum has now struck each of his three double centuries against India).</p>
<p>Yes, current-day India are no turn-of-the-century Aussies on the cricket field. But off it, thanks to their brimming coffers and the Position Paper and N Srinivasan and a puppet called ICC, India are the ultimate powerhouse. The team everyone wants to play against. The team everyone wants to beat.</p>
<p>Unlike Laxman’s heroics in March 2001, McCullum’s knock may yet not result in a win. Still, his Wellington effort is a bit like that proverb on fishing. Give a team a win, and you please them for a day; show them how to win, and you please them for a lifetime.<br />

<p><em><span style="line-height:1.5em;">After spending six sessions on the field over two days, including on Monday when only one New Zealand wicket fell for the addition of 319 runs, opener Shikhar Dhawan summed up the mood in the Indian camp and what lies ahead. Excerpts. </span></em></p>
<p><strong>On Day Five</strong></p>
<p>There is still one more day left tomorrow. We will try our best to win but even if we lose, there’s a lot to learn from it. There is disappointment but we have played some good cricket, especially getting them out for a low score in the first innings. Then we batted well in tough conditions and basically dominated the match till yesterday. But today they turned the table on us. Tomorrow in the morning, we will look to get them out and then whatever the target is, we will bat according to the situation.</p>
<p><strong>On the wicket</strong></p>
<p>The wicket has improved a lot. It has gotten slower as the game has gone on. McCullum and Watling batted beautifully of course. They respected the good balls and didn’t give us any chances the whole day. They batted very well.</p>
<p><strong>On missed chances</strong></p>
<p>We wanted McCullum to hit a few shots. But when the slips were there, he wasn’t hitting many shots. When they weren’t there, a nick came and unfortunately I was a bit far. Their run-rate was low but they didn’t give any chances. Once the batsmen get set and they score big runs, it isn’t easy to get them out. Unfortunately we dropped McCullum yesterday and paid a heavy price for that.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987163&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[India seamer Zaheer Khan went wicketless for 36 overs after his three strikes. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987162&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/zaheerkhanreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987587" alt="A fourth fast bowler — an Umesh Yadav — could have brought much-needed edge to the proceedings (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/zaheerkhanreutersm.jpg" /></a> A fourth fast bowler — an Umesh Yadav — could have brought much-needed edge to the proceedings (Reuters)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Zaheer Khan had bowled 43 overs in New Zealand’s second innings by the close of play on Day Four. Only once in his career did he bowl more: 48 overs in St John’s against the West Indies in 2002. But that was over eight and a half sessions as the West Indies batted almost three days. </span></p>
<p>He was 23 years old then. The body could take a lot more workload. Let’s analyse what kind of a workload we are talking about here.</p>
<p>He takes 15 strides in his run up. He doesn’t run in full tilt, therefore, the average stride length, by a conservative estimate, is roughly 1.5 metres. Add another four steps of follow-through. Which means, in an over, he runs about 170 metres. In the second innings, therefore, his 35-year-old body was made to run about approximately 7.3 kilometres just to bowl. No wonder then that towards the end, it looked like he was almost dragging himself around in the field.</p>
<p>Were India a bowler short? Could a fast bowler here have shared the workload that Zaheer, Ishant Sharma and Mohammed Shami carried?</p>
<p>The answer is subjective, and can be argued endlessly.</p>
<p>Another fast bowler in place of the lone spinner doesn’t really lighten the existing burden. Ravindra Jadeja, for example, bowled 49 overs. Had there been an extra fast bowler in his place, all those overs would still have to be bowled. Playing five bowlers (four seamers plus one spinner), meanwhile, is not an option. “The kind of combination we have at the moment, you can’t have four seamers and a spinner. Your batting line-up becomes weak,” says Cheteshwar Pujara.</p>
<p>However, a fourth fast bowler — an Umesh Yadav — could have brought much-needed edge to the proceedings when the things were not going India’s way on Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>But let’s not consider what might have been and focus on what was. Ishant Sharma was one over short of his all-time mark, 40, set in Adelaide in 2008. Though he is 10 years younger than Zaheer, his stride is significantly longer which directly means more kilometres to run.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987162&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mccullum.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1987494" alt="Brendon McCullum finished Day Four unbeaten on 281, his second double century of the series and third over all. Incidentally, all his double tons have come against India. Reuters" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mccullum.jpg" /></a> Brendon McCullum finished Day Four unbeaten on 281, his second double century of the series and third over all. Incidentally, all his double tons have come against India. Reuters
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Immediately after tea on Day Four of the Wellington Test, Mahendra Singh Dhoni took off his wicketkeeping gear, handed it over to Virat Kohli and came on to bowl. After the over, the roles were promptly reversed. Kohli took the pads and gloves off, gave them back to the captain and handed his cap to the umpire. The crowd cheered in amusement as the duo provided a bit of unintended comic relief after what had been another display of intense cricket by Brendon McCullum and BJ Watling.</span></p>
<p>Dhoni usually rolls his arms over in the nets. He is also predisposed to bringing himself on in matches once in a while. Usually it signals that things aren’t quite working and therefore he is trying his luck. That he is hopeful if not quite purposeful. Fair enough. At least the intent is there, of attempting to make things happen.</p>
<p>But on Monday, as the captain and his lieutenant took turns at bowling and keeping just before the new ball was due, they appeared rather hopeless. And McCullum and Watling, who had taken the score to 440/5 — and the lead to 194 — from a precarious 94/5 at one stage on Sunday, would have recognised the situation as such. In Dhoni and Kohli running in to bowl, they would have seen a white flag fluttering.</p>
<p>Bringing himself on was but a culmination of a series of questionable moves by the India captain. True, the partnership was broken as soon as the new ball was taken, with Mohammed Shami trapping Watling (124 off 367 balls), but before that it was allowed to become a world record 352-run stand, thanks to some unimaginative captaincy.</p>
<p>Let’s make things clear: Dhoni is a remarkable batting skipper, as he demonstrated during the Eden Park Test in Auckland, when he and Ravindra Jadeja launched into a stirring counterattack in the fourth innings, nearly pulling off a win.<br />
But it’s as a fielding captain that the 32-year-old is prone to brain fades.</p>
<p><strong>REACTIVE CAPTAINCY</strong></p>
<p>On Sunday, he had a defensive field for McCullum and Watling for long periods which essentially allowed the batsmen to settle down. It could be argued that it nearly paid off twice when McCullum played uppish drives down the wicket, but was dropped by the silly mid on fielder (Kohli) and the bowler (Ishant Sharma). But that was early on in his innings. Thereafter, his knock was pretty much chanceless.</p>
<p>If Dhoni was stubborn in continuing with a 2-7 field on Sunday, he was surprisingly reactive in changing the positions today. A shot through the covers would see a short extra cover being deployed off the next ball. A flick off the pads would necessitate the short extra cover being taken off and put at short leg. Silly mid on would be become silly mid off depending on where the previous ball was hit. Think of a water pipe with multiple holes. Just as you try to plug one, the other starts leaking. Now think of Dhoni’s captaincy on Day Four.</p>
<p>As a result, the bowlers didn’t know which line to stick to. There was no one line to stick to.</p>
<p>The New Zealand captain gave one half opportunity today, in the 23rd over of the day when a Zaheer Khan ball pitched at length and took off, taking an edge off McCullum’s bat. Shikhar Dhawan, the lone fielder at slip, dived full length but couldn’t hold on to the catch. It raced to the boundary. McCullum was on 157 then and New Zealand’s lead was 81. A more conventional field, with three slips, could have produced a different result.</p>
<p>Any suggestion, however, that the mammoth 571/6 total by New Zealand was all down to Dhoni’s mistakes would be grossly unfair on McCullum and Watling. Last evening, the duo, who were unbeaten on 114 and 55 respectively, has insisted that the job was only half done. They began Monday from scratch, seeing off the early morning threat before slowly starting to assert themselves.</p>
<p>McCullum brought up his 150 with a cracking punch off Zaheer through the covers, while the 200 too came off a boundary when the left-arm pacer was clipped away off the pads. It was McCullum’s second double century of the series and third over all— all of them against India. Watling also played his role to perfection and he too reached his second Test century with a clip to the deep square leg boundary off the same bowler.</p>
<p>At one stage every run that the duo found, scored or took, took them past one record or the other.</p>
<p><strong>McCullum’s marathon</strong></p>
<p>When Watling eventually fell on 124, after making what is the highest score by a New Zealand wicketkeeper in Tests, the team were 200 runs ahead, not really out of trouble given the depth in Indian batting.</p>
<p>But newcomer Jimmy Neesham, who had waited with the pads on for over eight hours, played positively and added 125 runs with McCullum in no time. At the other end, the New Zealand captain brought up his 250 by hooking Shami for a six over deep square leg. Dhoni watched the ball sail over the fence and clapped rather absentmindedly.</p>
<p>“The last hour was a bit of a daze,” McCullum would later say, about slowing down a shade after reaching 250. “I was just trying to get through and thankfully Neesh was playing some shots and ticking the scoreboard over. So I thought I’d just hang in there. I guess I was trying to make sure you get through to the day knowing you have earned the right to get through the day after the pressure we have had to absorb. I am pretty tired at the moment, body is a little bit sore, but when you are scoring runs, your body does not hurt so much.”</p>
<p><strong>On a pedestal</strong></p>
<p>As McCullum walked back to the pavilion to a standing ovation and the Indian players rushed to congratulate him, one couldn’t help but ask: Where does this rearguard stand in New Zealand Cricket’s history? The Test match where Martin Crowe made 299 instantly comes to mind. Interestingly, in that game at the Basin Reserve in 1991, New Zealand were dismissed for 174 in the first innings, following which Sri Lanka amassed 497, courtesy a double century by Aravinda de Silva. In the second innings, the home team were 148/2 but not out of trouble when Crowe and Andrew Jones (186) dropped the anchor and made history.</p>
<p>That was the only match in the country, says New Zealand Cricket Museum’s curator Jamie Bell, where a team dismissed for less that 200 in the first innings went on to save the Test. McCullum and Watling seem to have ensured there will be at least a repeat tomorrow.</p>
<p>Digest that, then consider this. Superstitious Indian fans will spot an omen: McCullum’s is batting on 281.<br />

<p>Three officials from the world governing body of football, FIFA, are arriving in New Delhi on February 20 for a 10-day long visit to the country to inspect the stadia shortlisted for the 2017 Under-17 World Cup.</p>
<p>After reaching Delhi on February 20, the three officials will fly down the next day to Mumbai to take stock of the Cooperage stadium over which an artificial turf has been laid under FIFA&#8217;s Win in India with India&#8217; programme.</p>
<p>The three officials will visit all the eight venues shortlisted by the All India Football Federation for the 2017 Under-17 FIFA World Cup. Only six stadiums will be required for the prestigious event.</p>
<p>The FIFA team will inspect the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and Ambedkar Stadium in Delhi on February 25-26.</p>
<p>&#8220;A FIFA team will be in India from February 20 to March 2 on an inspection visit of eight stadia shortlisted by the AIFF for Under-17 World Cup,&#8221; an AIFF source told PTI.</p>
<p>Besides the J N Stadium in Delhi and Cooperage in Mumbai, the other six shortlisted are Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata, KSFA Stadium in Bangalore, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium at Margao, Kochi and Guwahati and Balewadi Stadium in Pune. Surprisingly, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Chennai, which fulfills maximum number of FIFA criteria, was not included in the list.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is learnt that the Western India Football Association has asked the AIFF to request FIFA chief Sepp Blatter to inaugurate the refurbished Cooperage stadium in Mumbai later this year.</p>
<p>The AIFF source, however, said that nothing has been finalised as yet and any decision concerning the inauguration of the Cooperage will be taken once the facility is ready to host competitive matches.</p>
<p>&#8220;The refurbishment of Cooperage is yet to be completed and now there is no talk about who could be coming to inaugurate it. Let the refurbishment be over first,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Cooperage has not hosted any competitive football match since 2011 and the I-League matches involving Mumbai FC are<br />
being played in Pune for the last few years.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987082&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>Indian batting icon Sachin Tendulkar and Virendra Sehwag will be amongst the nominees for the &#8216;ESPNcricinfo@20 Cricketer of the Generation&#8217; award, with the cricket news website today announcing two more categories to its seventh annual awards.</p>
<p>The two new special awards &#8212; Cricketer of the Generation and Contribution to Cricket &#8212; will add to the six categories announced earlier.</p>
<p>Besides Tendulkar and Warne, West Indian Brian Lara, Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka, Australia&#8217;s Shane Warne and South African Jacques Kallis will also be in fray.</p>
<p>As the closing element of ESPNcricinfo&#8217;s 20th anniversary celebrations, a 50-member jury of current and former cricketers and leading sportswriters will pick the finest player of the last 20 years to honour with this award.</p>
<p>The winner will also be presented with a Renault automobile.</p>
<p>The website last month announced nominees for the annual ESPNcricinfo Awards, sponsored by Renault, which recognise the best cricket performances in 2013.</p>
<p>The winner of the &#8216;Contribution to Cricket&#8217; award will be nominated by former Indian captain Rahul Dravid. This award will consider contributions from all over the cricket ecosystem, from groundsmen to pitch curators, umpires to grassroots organisers, or just about anyone who has made a positive impact on the game.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Contribution to Cricket award was conceived to reward values that are pivotal to the sport &#8212; hard work, commitment, selflessness, fair play, and a dedication to the game. These are attributes embodied by many people across many aspects of the sport who are rarely given credit for the amount they contribute to this great game,&#8221; said Dravid</p>
<p>Speaking on these new categories, Sambit Bal, editor-in-chief, ESPNcricinfo, said: &#8220;The Cricketer of the Generation is a one-time award coinciding with the 20th anniversary of ESPNcricinfo, and with the Contribution to Cricket award, we aim to expand our horizon beyond the playing field.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cricketers and industry leaders from around the world will attend the gala awards event on March 14 in Mumbai.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987066&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/08/m_id_409994_shikhar_dhawan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1909994" alt="M_Id_409994_Shikhar_Dhawan" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/08/m_id_409994_shikhar_dhawan.jpg?w=480&#038;h=267" width="480" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>At a loss of words to explain India&#8217;s poor performance, batsman Shikhar Dhawan today conceded that New Zealand have turned the tables on his side in the ongoing second cricket Test, but insisted that the visitors still have a chance to not just save but win the match.</p>
<p>The hosts took a 325-run lead at the end of the fourth day&#8217;s play at Basin Reserve, with skipper Brendon McCullum scoring an unbeaten 281. But Dhawan chose to stay positive after what was a  disappointing day for Indian bowlers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is still one more day left tomorrow. We will try our best to win but even if we lose, there&#8217;s a lot to learn from it. There is disappointment but we have played some good cricket, especially getting them out for a low score in the first innings,&#8221; Dhawan said after the day&#8217;s play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we batted well in tough conditions and basically dominated the match till yesterday. But today they turned the tables on us. Tomorrow in the morning, we will look to get them out and then whatever the target is, we will bat according to the situation,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>McCullum was involved in a world record stand of 352 runs for the sixth wicket with keeper-batsman BJ Watling (124). The  duo thwarted Indian hopes of victory on the third or fourth day, after the hosts were reduced to 94/5 at one stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wicket has improved a lot. It has gotten slower as the game has gone on. McCullum and Watling batted beautifully of course. They respected the good balls and didn&#8217;t give us any chances the whole day. They batted very well,&#8221; Dhawan said, praising the batsmen.</p>
<p>The pair might not have given any major chances during the day but McCullum did offer an outside edge that zipped past Dhawan at third slip, whilst no one else was present in the slip cordon. He was also dropped twice on the third day by Ishant Sharma and Virat Kohli, the latter a simpler chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;For that moment that&#8217;s what we had planned, to go in with one slip and one gully. We wanted McCullum to hit a few shots. But when the slips were there, he wasn&#8217;t hitting many shots. When they weren&#8217;t there, a nick came and unfortunately I was a bit far,&#8221; Dhawan said about that edge flying past him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We bowled in good areas and were patient. Their run-rate was low but they didn&#8217;t give any chances. Once the batsmen get set and they score big runs, it isn&#8217;t easy to get them out. And they applied themselves very nicely as well. Unfortunately we dropped McCullum yesterday and paid a heavy price for that,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>It was not a great day for Indian cricket as the team was kept on the field for more than six sessions. At times, the game seemed to meander a bit as the players looked out of ideas as to how to get the batsmen out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the same wicket yesterday and then the attack bowled very well. They did a great job on a third day wicket and got half the team out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We planned accordingly to the situation. After bowling all day, the bowlers get tired too. So we were just looking to bowl in the right areas and looking for them to make mistakes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We kept attacking throughout the day, even when McCullum was batting on a big score. At the end of the day, there was a<br />
bit of defensive field because we needed to save runs too,&#8221; added the opening batsman.</p>
<p>It sets up the final day of the tour brilliantly with India still looking for their first win on this trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the first two days we dominated the match. Today it was a totally different day and it was a long day for all of us. In the morning, we came with the mindset that we will get them out and then bat to chase down whatever runs are needed.</p>
<p>But it didn&#8217;t go our way. We have to take it in our stride and see what happens tomorrow,&#8221; Dhawan said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1987024&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/08/m_id_411492_barcelona.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-1911492" alt="M_Id_411492_Barcelona" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2013/08/m_id_411492_barcelona.jpg?w=450&#038;h=250"   /></a></p>
<p>If there&#8217;s one Champions League game that should guarantee goals this week, it&#8217;s Manchester City vs. Barcelona. Anything else would be a letdown from this round-of-16 meeting between two lethal attacking teams. City, with 117 goals in 40 games, hosts a Barcelona side that has netted just six fewer this season.</p>
<p>For City, Tuesday&#8217;s game is a landmark occasion, a first game in the knockout phase of European football&#8217;s elite competition, playing the four-time winners. But the message from Manchester seems clear: Barcelona, champions in 2009 and 2011, is a team in decline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they don&#8217;t play as well as three or four years ago, but that is normal,&#8221; City winger Jesus Navas said.  &#8221;The rivals study the way you play and find a tactic to counteract your strengths. The cycles in football don&#8217;t last forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Will those words backfire at the Etihad Stadium? Here are five things to know about Tuesday&#8217;s match.</p>
<p><strong>Question of style</strong></p>
<p>So Navas thinks the Catalan giants have been found out? Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino still hopes the team&#8217;s ability to retain possession with short, precise passes can unlock City.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoever has the ball for longer will have a better chance to win,&#8221; Martino said.</p>
<p>The players have been encouraged by Martino to vary their attacking strategies with long passes and long-range shots this season, while Barcelona&#8217;s defense continues to be brittle at the back against set pieces.</p>
<p>Six of the 17 goals Barcelona has conceded in the Spanish league this season have come from corner kicks, when its typically shorter players can be exposed over the top.</p>
<p><strong>Messi and Neymar</strong></p>
<p>When Barcelona signed Neymar from Santos last year, it brought one of the world&#8217;s most promising young strikers together with Lionel Messi to form one of the potentially most dangerous attacking duos in Europe.</p>
<p>The problem is they haven&#8217;t both been fit to play together often for the Spanish leaders. They were on the pitch at the same time for just 12 minutes on Saturday in a 6-0 rout of Rayo Vallecano.</p>
<p>Messi came off after scoring twice as he netted in three consecutive games for the first time since September. Neymar only came on for the final half-hour in his first action since a month-long injury layoff with right ankle injury.</p>
<p><strong>New territory</strong></p>
<p>City was mediocre in the previous two seasons in the Champions League, slumping out before the knockout rounds under Roberto Mancini. It&#8217;s taken the arrival of Manuel Pellegrini to establish City as a European force this season, winning five and losing just once  to holder Bayern Munich in the group stage.</p>
<p>Pellegrini has Champions League pedigree, steering Villarreal and Malaga into the quarterfinals while managing in Spain.</p>
<p>City remains in contention for silverware on four fronts. It is third in the Premier League, three points behind leader Chelsea with a game in hand, into the quarterfinals of the FA Cup after beating Chelsea on Saturday and it will contest the League Cup final next month.</p>
<p><strong>First competitive match</strong></p>
<p>A sign of City&#8217;s lack of top-level European heritage is the fact Manchester United&#8217;s less-successful neighbors have never played Barcelona in a competitive match. One of their six friendlies saw Barcelona officially open the Etihad in 2003 when City won.</p>
<p>Eleven years on, thanks to the influx of Abu Dhabi wealth and subsequent success since 2008, City is ready to ready to grow. Planning permission has been granted to expand the venue capacity from almost 48,000 to more to 60,000, anticipating a higher demand from fans.</p>
<p>By contrast, Barcelona is looking to expand the capacity of the Camp Nou by more than 5,000 seats to 105,000 by 2021.</p>
<p><strong>City&#8217;s Spanish connections </strong></p>
<p>Despite City as a club having no competitive experience of Barcelona, the manager and many of the players have. There are four Spaniards in the squad for Tuesday&#8217;s game: Javi Garcia, Alvaro Negredo, Navas and David Silva. And Yaya Toure, the force in City&#8217;s midfield, was signed from Barca.</p>
<p>On top of that, City chief executive Ferran Soriano was a former Barca vice president, and director of football Txiki Begiristain held the same job at Barca after a playing career with the team.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986976&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/brendonmccullumreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986270" alt="New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum has scored a double ton. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/brendonmccullumreutersm.jpg" /></a> New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum has scored a double ton. (Reuters)
<p>India&#8217;s listless bowlers allowed New Zealand off the hook as the home team rode on skipper Brendon McCullum&#8217;s monumental double century to continue their remarkable fightback and take a commanding lead on the fourth and penultimate day of the second cricket Test here today.</p>
<p>McCullum remained unbeaten on 281 runs and shared a world record partnership of 352 runs for the sixth wicket with BJ Watling (124), helping their side reach a formidable 571/6 at stumps and take the game away from India at the Basin Reserve.</p>
<p>India, who had New Zealand in a spot of bother at 94 for five in their second innings yesterday, are now facing the prospect of even losing the match with the hosts swelling their lead to 325 runs. The duo defied the visitors for 123 overs and turned around a 246-run deficit into a massive lead with one day left in the match.</p>
<p>McCullum was still batting after nearly six sessions at the crease, facing 525 balls and hitting 28 fours and 4 sixes. At the other end, James Neesham brought up his maiden Test fifty and was unbeaten on 67 off 93 balls, with 9 fours. For India, Zaheer Khan (3-129), Mohammad Shami (2-136) and Ishant Sharma (0-124) toiled hard on an unresponsive pitch, particularly with the third new ball. Ravindra Jadeja (1-108) was rendered ineffective as well. Part-timers Rohit Sharma (0-40) and Virat Kohli (0-13) were given a go to try something different, while skipper MS Dhoni (0-5) also bowled after the tea-break.</p>
<p>Starting at 440/5 after tea, the set batsmen had another string of batting records coming their way, with the pitch playing perfect foil to them. As Dhoni bowled his gentle medium-pace first up, McCullum and Watling crossed the 350-mark for their partnership in the 159th over. An over later, they brought up the highest ever sixth-wicket partnership in Test cricket breaking the 351-mark by Mahela and Prasanna Jayawardene, also set against India at Ahmedabad in 2009. Their lead also swelled to 200 in the meantime.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986773&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/foo-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986623" alt="Jovetico opened City’s account in the 16th minute. " src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/foo-m.jpg" /></a> Jovetico opened City’s account in the 16th minute.
<p>Arsenal sent Liverpool crashing out of the FA Cup, avenging last weekend&#8217;s rout at Anfield, when they beat Brendan Rodgers&#8217;s high-flyers 2-1 in a full-bloodied fifth round tie at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Londoners, who lost 5-1 to Liverpool in the Premier League on Feb. 8, won with a 16th-minute goal from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and a 47th-minute strike from Lukas Podolski before Steven Gerrard halved the arrears with a penalty on the hour.</p>
<p>Arsenal meet Everton in next month&#8217;s quarter-finals after they beat Swansea City 3-1 at Goodison Park where Roberto Martinez stayed on course to become the first manager to win the FA Cup in successive seasons with different teams.</p>
<p>He led Wigan Athletic to victory over Manchester City in last season&#8217;s final and those two sides will face each other again in the last eight after the draw was made on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>League leaders beaten</strong><br />
On Saturday, Manchester City beat league leaders Chelsea 2-0 while Wigan won 2-1 at Cardiff City. Stevan Jovetic and Samir Nasri provided the goals to avenge a 1-0 league loss this month, with a formidable City in complete control and preventing Chelsea from hitting the target once.</p>
<p>“We can beat everyone,” Jovetic said. “We learnt something (from losing to Chelsea), you could see that on the pitch.”</p>
<p>Although Arsenal&#8217;s victory meant there would be no all- Merseyside clash in the quarter-finals, there could be another derby after League One Sheffield United ended the 16-match unbeaten run of Championship side Nottingham Forest with a 3-1 win at Bramall Lane.</p>
<p>United will face Sheffield Wednesday in the competition for the first time since they met in the 1993 semi-finals if the latter eventually beat Charlton Athletic in a tie that was postponed on Saturday because of bad weather. The other last-eight clash is between Sunderland, who ousted Southampton 1-0 on Saturday, and Brighton and Hove Albion or Hull City who meet on Monday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986618&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Indian flag was unfurled at the Winter Olympics Village in Sochi on Sunday in  a special ceremony, five days after the International Olympic Committee revoked a 14-month suspension on the country.</p>
<p>The ceremony, which lasted around 45 minutes and organised at International Plaza of Mountain Cluster Village, was attended by the three Indian athletes taking part in the Winter Olympics, new IOA President N Ramachandran and European Olympic Committees President Patrick Hickey, nine days into the Sochi Games.</p>
<p>“The Indian flag joined those of 87 other nations flying at Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games today when it was hoisted during a team welcome ceremony for the recently reinstated Indian Olympic Association,” the IOC said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>NATIONAL ANTHEM PLAYED</strong><br />
Luger Shiva Keshavan, alpine skier Himanshu Thakur and cross country skier Nadeem Iqbal and their three coaches stood silent as the tri-colour was hoisted with the national anthem being played at the background.</p>
<p>Winter Games Federation of India Secretary Roshan Lal Thakur, one of the coaches, said. “We were not allowed to fly the tri-colour and wear any dress on which is written India when the Games began due to IOA&#8217;s suspension but after the suspension was lifted, we can now proudly fly our national flag and wear dresses with India written on them,” he said.</p>
<p>Asked about the ceremony, Thakur said, “Six of us along with the IOA President stood in a line. First the IOC flag was raised and then the tri-colour with the national anthem sung at the background.”</p>
<p>The raising of the tri-colour symbolically marked the completion of India&#8217;s return to the Olympic fold, a week after the IOA conducted its elections on the diktat of the IOC. “I am thrilled and delighted. I don&#8217;t look into the past.<br />
“I only look for the future,” Ramachandran said.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986616&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/soch-im.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986613" alt="Charles Hamelin of Canada(C) fell in the 1,000 meters and took out Eddy Alvarez (2nd R) of USA. The skaters in first and second place get a pass after a collision; Alvarez was in third. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/soch-im.jpg" /></a> Charles Hamelin of Canada(C) fell in the 1,000 meters and took out Eddy Alvarez (2nd R) of USA. The skaters in first and second place get a pass after a collision; Alvarez was in third. (AP)
<p>The collision that sent Eddy Alvarez sprawling on the ice and out of the men’s 1,000-meter short-track competition happened so fast that even his description of it, a few minutes later, was barely longer than a haiku.</p>
<p>“I looked down, and he was just between my legs,” said Alvarez, a 24-year-old from Miami. “Next thing I know, my face hurts.”</p>
<p>The “he” in this tale is Charles Hamelin of Canada, who slipped in the early laps of the race, taking Alvarez, who was mere inches behind, down with him. And that was that. The rules of short track hold that a skater who is in first or second place when bodies start flying gets a pass to the next round. Alvarez was in third, which meant that he could do nothing more than nurse a bruise on his lip and ruminate.</p>
<p>“One heck of a sport, isn’t it?” he said, smiling and looking remarkably at peace under the circumstances. “It’s unfortunate for him. It’s more unfortunate for me.”</p>
<p>Luck plays a quiet role in just about every sport, but it is a noisy, snarling beast in short track. The standard relationship between fault and failure is upended.<br />
Athletes can do exactly what they are supposed to — sail about 30 miles per hour around a 364-foot oval, in a pack of rivals — and find themselves out of contention because someone else slipped up.</p>
<p>This gives the sport an anything-goes dimension that can be outlandishly cruel. Short-track races have been won by the only skater still standing, because the rest have been knocked over like duckpins.</p>
<p>Short track has been called Nascar on ice because of how often it ends in pileups, and it has been derided as a kind of X Games take on the more refined and elegant long-track version of the sport.</p>
<p>But short track works pretty well as a metaphor for life. What other contest in the Olympics captures the mix of skill and randomness that is human existence? Getting flattened by a Canadian while minding one’s own business — while in peak form, no less — is a bit like a car crash, or a stroke, or any number of other unforeseeable tragedies that befall people every day.</p>
<p>Short track is not for those who look to sports as a reprieve from existential angst, as a place where practice, discipline and courage prevail, where the best are always anointed. It is more backgammon than chess.</p>
<p>Short-trackers are resigned to the role of luck, or find it exciting in the same way people are excited by lottery tickets. Because, hey, who knows? Anything can happen. Others — and these tend to be the recently victorious — minimize luck, or try to put it in context.</p>
<p>“Luck comes from what you did before,” Russia’s Viktor Ahn said at a news conference after nabbing the gold medal in the 1,000 meters. “Luck is a reward.”<br />
Sjinkie Knegt of the Netherlands, who  had won bronze, seemed eager to etch luck out of the picture. “Most of the time,” he said, looking deadly serious, “the best guy in the world wins.”</p>
<p>Good luck charms<br />
What about the rest of the time? Inevitably, a lot of short-track skaters have prerace rituals, for those occasions when excellence will not suffice. Véronique Pierron, a member of the French team, makes sure to put her left foot on the ice first before every heat. Valérie Maltais of Canada touches her helmet when she enters a rink.</p>
<p>The problem, believe it or not, is that these rituals do not help. Emily Scott, a 24-year-old from Springfield, Mo., always straps on her left skate first. Adhering to that custom did not save her on Friday from a wipeout inflicted by an opponent in the finals of the women’s 1,500.</p>
<p>Through a whole day of competition, it was one calamity after another. Maybe that is why Alvarez, who has an endorsement-ready smile and perfectly trimmed facial hair, opined about his fate with surfer-dude calm. He had gone through an operation to repair torn knee tendons in 2012, which left him in severe pain and immobilized for months. On the upside, he learned the guitar.</p>
<p>But suffering through an ordeal like that, for an end like this? Reporters gathered around him wanted to know: Are you peeved at that Canadian? Are you furious at the injustice of it all? And what did he say to you after the race?</p>
<p>“He’s like, ‘Hey, man, I’m sorry,’ in his French accent,” Alvarez said, chuckling. “I was like, It’s all good, man. It’s part of the race. We all know it just happens sometimes.”</p>
<p>Right behind him came Hamelin himself. What did this man have to say about the cosmic wrongness of this disaster? “The ice break under my blades, and next thing I know, I’m on the boards with the American guy,” he said.</p>
<p>The American guy. You realize that Hamelin has not bothered to learn the name of the man whose race he ended. And you learn the final and most galling way that short track is like life: When catastrophes happen, rarely is anyone around to raise a hand and say, “This is all my fault.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986607&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somdev Devvarman, Yuki Bhambri and Ramkumar Ramanathan will continue their attempt to thresh out where exactly they stand in the country’s tennis singles hierarchy at the ATP Challenger tour event in Delhi, beginning Monday. The Delhi leg is the last of three back-to-back Challenger events in India.</p>
<p>Devvarman, who at one point in his career was ranked high enough (62) to be seeded directly into the ATP 250 series, is still the highest ranked Indian in the fray (and the second seed), but the Challenger series represents a level at which he should not be practicing his trade, had things gone well. Since the return from his shoulder injury in 2012, Devvarman, despite a few encouraging results, has barely broken into the top-100 again. His struggles earlier this year in the Davis Cup tie against the much lower ranked Ti Chen of Chinese Taipei were the most visible, but his status as the top Indian tennis player, for whatever it is worth, has come under scrutiny of late.</p>
<p>Nineteen-year-old Ramkumar, currently ranked 405 in the world, sent Devvarman packing in the first round of the Chennai Open, as did Bhambri, at a career high 145 now, in the semifinal of the Challenger event in Chennai this month. Ramkumar may still have a while to go before his ranking perks up to the levels of Devvarman or Bhambri, but has nevertheless taken big strides in the last year. He began 2013 ranked 794, but in little over 12 months, has climbed 389 places and promises to improve with time. Ramkumar, a wildcard in Delhi, will play the winner of the Kolkata Challenger from last week, Serbian Ilija Bozoljac, in the first round.</p>
<p>As for Bhambri, his stated ambition is to break into the top-100 on the back of his performance in Delhi. A win here would give Bhambri 100 ranking points, taking his season’s tally to 483. This would still not be enough to carry him above the 100th spot, currently occupied by Devvarman with 553 points. Be that as it may, considering he had let his ranking slip to 593 in August 2013, Bhambri will consider a win here as a sign of defenitive progress. The task will not prove straight-forward for Bhambri, who will face 19-year old Frenchman Lucas Pouille (ranked 188) in the first round and potentially, the top-seed Aleksandr Nedovyesov in the quarterfinal.</p>
<p>Devvarman, in the other side of the draw, will play wildcard Karunuday Singh in the first round. The two other tournament wildcards were handed out to Saketh Myneni and Sanam Singh.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986606&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[Scotland have tailored their team to suit the conditions and it was their spinners that did the damage against Papua New Guinea. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986605&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After successive losses in the warmup games, the Indian under-19 side, however, went on to register a comfortable 40-run win over their Pakistani counterparts. Up next for the Indians will be the relatively easier task, as they take on Scotland in a Group A fixture. A win against Scotland will more or less assure India of progress to the knock-out stages. In any case, the win against Pakistan gives India a bit of breathing space, with their remaining group game against minnows Papua New Guinea, scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
<p>Against Pakistan, it was the all-round display of Mumbai’s 16-year old Sarfaraz Khan that helped India first set up and then defend their competitive total. Coming in at 94/4 Sarfaraz top-scored with 74 off 78 balls and put on a crucial 119-run stand for the fifth wicket with Sanju Samson, who made 68. Though it was  off-spinner Deepak Hooda that benefitted the most from the Pakistani batsmen’s aggression in their chase of India’s 262 to end with a five-wicket haul, Sarfaraz pitched in with four catches and a wicket of his own.</p>
<p>The defending champions have come into the tournament also as the favourites, their defeat to the other strong contender, South Africa, in a warm-up game not withstanding. The side has the batsmen to put up or chase down big scores, with the likes of skipper Vijay Zol and Samson a part of a strong middle order. On the slow, low tracks of Dubai, off-spinner Hooda and chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav ought to present the batsmen with a few problems.</p>
<p>New-ball worry<br />
One note of worry, though, would be the form of the new ball bowlers. Both against South Africa in the warm up game, and against Pakistan in their opener, the pacers struggled for penetration up front, going wicket-less. In fact, Pakistan was off to a comfortable start and were in fact favourites at one point in the chase, with their opening pair putting together 109 runs in 23.3 overs before the Indian spinners halted the momentum. Against South Africa, the spinners could not really defend 234, with opener Clyde Fortuin scoring a century.</p>
<p>Against Scotland, who ran up an easy six-wicket win over Papua New Guinea in their opener, there will be opportunities for several of the mis-firing players to raise their game.</p>
<p>Scotland, despite their reputation, have tailored their team to suit the conditions and it was their spinners that did the damage against Papua New Guinea. Left arm orthodox Chayank Gosain, in fact, opened the bowling and was the pick of Scotland’s bowlers, taking 3/17 in 8.3 overs. The next bowler in Scotland’s win was also a spinner — offie Ross McLean picked up three for 15.</p>
<p>It will not be an unfamiliar challenge when India take on Scotland, and as pre-tournament favourites, will be expected to seal qualification as early as on Monday.</p>
<p>Sunday’s results:<br />
South Africa U19 293/6 (Yaseen Valli 102; Nikhil Dutta 3/54) bt Canada U19 248/8 (Sudeepta Aruka 69; Y Valli 4/43).<br />
England U19 230/9 (Jonathan Tattersal 95; Anuk Fernando 3/49) lost to Sri Lanka 231/9 in 48.5 overs (Sadira Samarawickrama 82; Rob Sayer 2/33).<br />
West Indies 275/6 (Tagenarine Chanderpaul 84; Malcolm Lake 2/42) bt Zimbabwe U19 108 in 39.4 overs (Kieran Gayle 45*; Preston McSween 3/14).<br />
New Zealand U19 285/5 (Robert O’Donnel 107; Mooaz Qazi 2/50) bt UAE U19 169 in 49.4 overs (Chirag Suri 57; Jack Hunter 3/32).</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986605&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sa-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986604" alt="Johnson picked up 12 wickets in the first Test against South Africa. (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sa-m.jpg" /></a> Johnson picked up 12 wickets in the first Test against South Africa. (AP)
<p>South Africa will turn their attention to finding a way to negate the formidable threat posed by fiery Australian Mitchell Johnson, captain Graeme Smith said following his team’s comprehensive 281-run defeat in the first Test on Saturday.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt Mitchell Johnson was the difference in this game and we have to find way to curb him and put him under pressure in the next two Tests,” said Smith as South Africa licked their wounds after losing the first of the three-Test series.</p>
<p>Johnson’s 12-wicket haul came as a result of some vicious deliveries, one of which cut Ryan McLaren behind the ear and the other hit Hashim Amla full in the face. The left-arm paceman bowled consistently around the 150km mark and scythed through the home team’s batting to produce career best figures.</p>
<p>“I believe the wicket played a big part,” said Smith, confirming the assertion of the Australian captain Michael Clarke that the surface at SuperSport Park was “nasty”.</p>
<p>The wicket for the second Test at Port Elizabeth, which starts on Thursday, is expected to be docile in comparison.</p>
<p>Smith dismissed media assertions his side had been mentally scarred by aggression of the Australian paceman, whose formidable form continued after being man of the series when they won the Ashes last month after a 5-0 whitewash of England.</p>
<p>“I doubt there is much mental scarring, we have lost a game of cricket and were beaten comprehensively,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s important that we move away from that, there are still two big Test matches left in this series and we need to make sure that we perform really well in the next one, that’s our focus.</p>
<p>“I feel that, even though it’s been disappointing, this game will benefit us going into the next game. I think our bowlers have got good time on their legs and hopefully we will have a higher intensity going into the next game.</p>
<p>“From a batting perspective, I think we have some good things to talk about, if we can post some good totals which we have done in the last period of time we will have the ability to put Australia under pressure,” Smith added.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986603&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Archery Association of India (AAI) has read the riot act to the players who have been staying away from national camps. Minutes after the first National Ranking Archery Tournament concluded on Sunday, AAI secretary general Anil Kamineni made it clear to the archers who made it to the national squad that from now on missing the camps will cost them dear.</p>
<p>Archers from Railways, Steel Plant Promotion Boards (SPSB) and others have been staying away from the camps. Deepika and others from the SPSB, have preferred to train at the TATA Archery Academy, while the Railways Sports Promotion Board (RSPB) archers have been stationed in Kolkata.</p>
<p>In what was embarrassing for the federation, only six archers showed up for the month-long camp at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium that concluded early this wee”Those missing the camps will have to submit valid papers to support their absence. Those who stay away their place will go to the next in the placings,” Kamineni said. “Also, those selected for the Indian teams will have to be part of the camp 15 days before the departure for the international tournament, if not their place will go to the fifth-placed archer,” he added.</p>
<p>Ever since the sports ministry de-recognised the federation for not following the sports code, the AAI has been struggling to discipline the archers. For various reasons, the archers have been staying away. This time though, the AAI had written to all the institutions &#8211; the RSPB, the SPSB, Sports Authority of India (SAI) &#8211; asking them to reign in the absentees. “We had been lenient in the past and also the fact that RSPB was not relieving its players for our tournament was making it harder for us to act tough. But now they will know that only genuine cases will be entertained,” said a source.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tarundeep Rai and Deepika Kumari won the gold medal in the recurve sections on Sunday. Rai beat Atanu Das 6-0, while Deepika saw off Dola Banerjee 6-4. In the compound, Abhishek Verma, who made a new national mark of 709/720 points in the qualifications, beat Rajat Chauhan for gold, while Parveena beat Gagandeep Kaur for gold in women’s category.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986602&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hoc-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986595" alt="Mumbai Magician’s Australian forward Glenn Turner tackles Kalinga Lancer’s Aron Zalewski during his side’s 3-2 win at the Mahindra Stadium in Mumbai on Sunday.  (Kevin D’souza)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/hoc-m.jpg" /></a> Mumbai Magician’s Australian forward Glenn Turner tackles Kalinga Lancer’s Aron Zalewski during his side’s 3-2 win at the Mahindra Stadium in Mumbai on Sunday. (Kevin D’souza)
<p>The post match media interactions with Mumbai Magicians coach MK Kaushik follow a pattern. Before he delves into the details of the match, the coach slumps into his chair and apologises. It’s hard not to sympathise with him; the helplessness on his face became evident with every passing game. Mumbai’s rather listless performance this season has forced him to adopt this ritual.</p>
<p>It was slightly different on Sunday, though. Kaushik was a relieved man. The glum look on his face was replaced with a beaming smile. He leapt in joy as the hooter sounded for the final time and hugged his captain, Glenn Turner. Not only had he managed to outfox national coach Terry Walsh’s side but also because, after eight heartbreaking defeats, Mumbai Magicians had finally managed to win. In a battle of wooden-spooners, Mumbai beat fellow-strugglers and tournament debutantes Kalinga Lancers 3-2 at the Mahindra Stadium to register their maiden win this season.</p>
<p>It’s tough to point out one specific reason for Mumbai’s dismal season; it’s been a collective failure. The team has played well in patches, especially in the first halves of every match. But if there was one area where other teams have outclassed them, it is the midfield. Mumbai have lacked a player in the centre of the turf who can control the game — like Sardar Singh for Delhi Waveriders, Moritz Fuerste for Ranchi Rhinos or Jamie Dwyer for Punjab Warriors. Of course, Glenn Turner has played his heart out but he has been their lone warrior and often isolated up front.</p>
<p>For once, it all came together against the Lancers on Sunday. Yes, the margin of victory was narrow but Mumbai never really looked under pressure and appeared to be in control of the situation even when they had their backs to the wall in the final few minutes. Goalkeeper David Harte made four sharp saves in the final three minutes and young Gurjinder Singh did a decent job defending his line.</p>
<p>The match overall cried for quality and justified both team’s position in the table. Lancers have had their problems but have been better of the two sides through the course of this tournament. Being their debut season, Walsh has been content trying out various combinations, not fretting over the results. But they held the edge over Mumbai going into their final game of the season but looked jaded and lacked ambition.</p>
<p>Struggling for rhythm<br />
Both sides cancelled each other out and happily parked themselves in the middle of the turf in the opening quarter. They struggled to conjure one decent move or put together three good passes. Goalkeepers were hardly disturbed and defenders were happy just to slap the ball as far away from the ‘D’ as they could.</p>
<p>One hoped that Turner’s hit from a goalmouth melee in the 17th minute would open up the game. Alas, that was hardly the case. Mumbai doubled their lead in the 33rd minute via Mark Gleghorne and for the first time in the tournament, went into the half time with a healthy 2-0 lead.</p>
<p>Lancers tried to stage a comeback at the change of ends after Mohammad Nizammudin scored in the 43rd minute. But Mumbai got their grip back and Ravipal Singh restored the two-goal cushion in the 57th minute. Lucas Vila pulled one back for Lancers in the next minute but Mumbai held on for the remaining 12 minutes and Harte’s heroics in the closing stages ensured their win.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Mumbai have a reason to go all out in their final group match against UP Wizards in Lucknow on Tuesday. A win there would help them finish above Lancers in the table. And going by their season has gone, it would be quite an achievement if they managed that.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986590&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Thanks to an unbeaten 158-run stand between skipper Brendon McCullum and wicketkeeper BJ Watling that helped New Zealand nose narrowly ahead, India will have to certainly bat again in this second and final Test match. The focus, hence, turned to the sort of target the visitors will be comfortable chasing during the Cheteshwar Pujara press conference. Excerpts. </span></p>
<p><strong>On suitable target</strong></p>
<p>We don’t want to chase a big target obviously, the lesser the better. But you cannot keep any targets in mind while you are bowling. We want to get them out as early as possible.</p>
<p><strong>On India’s fielding</strong></p>
<p>If you look at both the Test matches we have taken so many good catches. Not only on this trip, but in South Africa also, the Indian fielding has been fantastic. We have effected many run-outs and held many good catches. So you are bound to drop a few catches here and there.</p>
<p><strong>On the Test so far</strong></p>
<p>It has been a fantastic game so far with many turns. But we are still in a very good position. If we can get a couple of quick wickets early on tomorrow, a lot of time is available. We are happy with the way things have shaped up. We could have been happier with a couple of more wickets but we are in a good position and in with a good chance to win this Test match.<br />
On NZ’s fightback</p>
<p>We have to give credit to their batsmen. The way they batted was really good. Brendon batted well and that partnership was very crucial for them. We tried our best but they were the winners in that last session. Like I said earlier, if we can get a couple early wickets then we can go through the tail-enders. The pitch is getting better by the day. Our bowlers did a very good job and bowled in the right areas. They didn’t allow them to score many runs, which is a good sign for us.<br />
On his form</p>
<p>I have learnt from my mistakes. My only regret is the first innings’ dismissal in the first Test match where I played a really bad shot. But apart from that I got a good ball in the second innings there (Auckland) and here also, in the first innings I got a very good ball.</p>
<p><strong>On his Asia Cup call-up</strong></p>
<p>I am confident of playing the ODI format well. It is just that I need to get a couple good scores in that format. I have done really well in the domestic matches I have played.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986549&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Heaping praise on Brendon McCullum and BJ Watling for their spirited batting in the ongoing second Test against India, New Zealand’s assistant coach Bob Carter on Sunday said their effort has given the home team “a lot of heart” to fight the tough battle of survival in the match.</span></p>
<p>The Kiwis are still far from safety but they have wiped off the 246-run first innings deficit and taken a slender six-run lead.</p>
<p>Carter praised McCullum (114 not out) and Watling (52 not out) for their performances on day three, wherein they put on 158 runs for the sixth wicket to defy the visitors.</p>
<p>“After the first hour or so, the mood wasn’t good. But with the wonderful partnership between BJ and the captain, it has given us a lot of heart to take into tomorrow,” he said.</p>
<p>“The key for us was to have a partnership. We were really struggling in the morning. This was a real test of us today and tomorrow is the same — test of our batting to see whether we can put a score on the board in order to put India under pressure.</p>
<p>“They (India) are a fine team, they are going to come out and bowl well again tomorrow. We know we have got a challenge on our hands, and it is something we are really looking forward to,” he added.</p>
<p>In the morning session, New Zealand were reduced to 87/4 at one stage and then lost a further wicket in the post-lunch session, but McCullum and Watling resisted the disciplined Indian bowling after tea, to take the match into a fourth day.</p>
<p><strong>Attack and defence</strong></p>
<p>“Brendon has now combined a lot of his game with defence. Today was a tough day of Test cricket. They didn’t give us anything and they bowled well since they bowled in the second innings in Auckland. They bowled very well in this game. Brendon has really shown his defensive game is to come forward.</p>
<p>“And as well as he still likes to attack. Going from 94 to 100 with a six certainly caught me by surprise. I think he is growing in stature as a Test player and I would like to see him play a lot more,” said Carter.</p>
<p><strong>‘Great day of cricket’</strong></p>
<p>“In the first innings, you saw again how well India bowled. We did well to get 192 in the end. They came at us hard today. No one was really playing loosely, they earned their wickets well. It was a great day of Test cricket.”</p>
<p>Carter said he wants his batsmen to carry on for at least two more sessions. “I would like to bat for another two sessions or more. Effectively we have now got that little lead. We need to build partnerships and we have got five wickets left. If we can get a few more out of this one, it will be fantastic.</p>
<p>“Both are established batsmen. We know that India will come hard at us tomorrow, as the ball is only 20 overs old or so. It will be another battle and hopefully we can reach that again,” he said.</p>
<p>“The wicket is perhaps the best time to bat now than it has been for the whole game and hopefully we can build on that. If we can build on that and we have five wickets to go, partnerships are our key and making sure we keep our score ticking over. We can’t get to a stage where we are not scoring runs.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986545&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jesse Ryder has been omitted from New Zealand’s squad for next month’s World Twenty20 tournament in Bangladesh after being fined for a late-night drinking binge prior to the first Test against India last week.</p>
<p>Ryder was seen drinking in Auckland bars with teammate Doug Bracewell in the early hours of the morning before the Test. Both players accepted a charge of misconduct and were fined.</p>
<p>Ryder was then omitted from the New Zealand squad for the second Test against India that began in Wellington on Friday. His place on the Twenty20 squad taken by the part-time spinner Kane Williamson, who is considered a possible asset on Bangladesh’s slow pitches.</p>
<p>NZcoach Mike Hesson has said that Ryder was likely to face more serious repercussions because he had lost the trust of the New Zealand selectors. The drinking binge was just the latest incident of misconduct involving Ryder in recent years. Both he and Bracewell were suspended for one match in February 2012 after becoming involved in an altercation with bar patrons after a one-day match against South Africa in Napier.</p>
<p>The left hander then took a two-year break from Test cricket to tackle personal and fitness issues, including a continuing battle with alcohol. He returned to the New Zealand team after 22 months for its one-day international series against West Indies in December and January.</p>
<p>Two other spin bowling options were also included in the Twenty20 squad — Roneel Hira and Anton Devcich. —AP</p>
<p><strong>NZ squad: B McCullum (C), C Anderson, T Boult, A Devcich, M Guptill, R Hira, M McClenaghan, N McCullum, K Mills, C Munro, J Neesham, L Ronchi (WK), T Southee, R Taylor, K Williamson.</strong></p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986540&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/macculam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986538" alt="With an unbeaten stand of 158 runs for the sixth wicket with BJ Watling, Brendon McCullum rescued his team with 114 runs. This was the Kiwi captain’s second 3-digit score of the series, after his 224 in Auckland. Reuters" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/macculam.jpg" /></a> With an unbeaten stand of 158 runs for the sixth wicket with BJ Watling, Brendon McCullum rescued his team with 114 runs. This was the Kiwi captain’s second 3-digit score of the series, after his 224 in Auckland. Reuters
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">New Zealand were five wickets down for 94 and needed 151 more runs to make India bat again. They needed an effort that defied belief, and to an extent instinct.</span></p>
<p>Instinct is a powerful evolutionary force, and it controls you more than you can control it. Pure instinct makes a cornered dog attack in self-defence. Similarly, pure instinct makes a batsman like Brendon McCullum search for the big hits when a ball is dug in or pitched up.</p>
<p>For overwhelmingly long periods on Sunday, the New Zealand captain, playing with a sore shoulder and a dodgy back, resisted those instincts and the Indian fast bowlers. He may like to revise his assessment of calling his Auckland double century his finest in the game.</p>
<p>The innings (unbeaten 114) that the Kiwi captain played today is not only his best, but merits a place alongside the very best of Bert Sutcliffe, Glenn Turner and Martin Crowe in the New Zealand Cricket Museum at the Basin Reserve. Irrespective of the result. It was perhaps then symbolic that the six he smacked off Ishant Sharma to bring up his century fell at the doorstep of that very museum.</p>
<p>When McCullum walked in to bat, New Zealand, needing 246 runs to avoid innings defeat, were 52 for three and in deep trouble. Zaheer Khan had taken two wickets in the morning session to swell his tally to three. The wily left-arm pacer, who didn’t have much success in the previous three innings, was at his sharpest.</p>
<p><strong>Initially sharp</strong></p>
<p>Having accounted for Peter Fulton on Saturday evening, Zaheer gave India a massive early break when he removed the dangerous Kane Williamson off a delivery that shaped out a hint, just enough to take the outside edge of New Zealand’s most consistent batsman of this entire tour. Out-of-form opener Hamish Rutherford showed intent and played a few strokes but fell for 35, edging to the ‘keeper a delivery that pitched at length and moved away ever so slightly.</p>
<p>The masters of swing will tell you they don’t need the ball to do too much in air, just a little movement is enough. That’s the movement Zaheer was eliciting when McCullum came out to have his say. He was beaten off the second ball as he dangled the bat out to an outswinger, only to see it miss the outside edge. McCullum would give a couple of more chances. Most notably off Mohammed Shami, a few overs later.</p>
<p>Dhoni had placed Virat Kohli at silly mid-on for McCullum and asked Shami to bowl an off-and-middle line, inviting the batsman to drive. And he drove, uppishly too, but Kohli casually went for the catch with one hand and spilled the chance.</p>
<p>The last time McCullum had got a chance, he went on to make a double hundred. On Sunday, he would get another on 36, off a similar shot, a drive down the wicket, but Ishant Sharma wouldn’t hold on to it either.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, at the other end, on either side of lunch, Tom Latham made way for Corey Anderson who in turn vacated it for the battling batsman, BJ Watling.</p>
<p>In the second session, Dhoni applied the choke, with six fielders on the on side, patiently laying in wait for McCullum to make another mistake. He wouldn’t.</p>
<p>The scorecard crawled. It was like the scene from The Hurt Locker, where the snipers waited with bated breath for each other to make a mistake.</p>
<p>McCullum reached his fifty in 148 balls, the slowest he has ever taken for a half century. His rate of scoring at this stage was half of his career strike-rate of 61. Watling, at the other end, was even slower, batting at a rate of 20. Ravindra Jadeja bowled from one end tirelessly. It was an old-fashioned grind on an old-fashioned ground.<br />
Painkillers</p>
<p>McCullum, who had taken painkillers for his hurting left shoulder, broke the shackles after the fifty, but not recklessly, and took just a run-a-ball from here on to reach his hundred — his second off the series and fourth against India in nine Tests. India took the new ball, and while the pacers did bend their backs, they weren’t really fresh enough to go full tilt. The knocks of McCullum and Watling had taken a toll on them. At times, they even looked one bowler short.</p>
<p>Watling brought up his fifty towards the fag end of the day with a punch off the backfoot. It came off 189 balls. And an edged four off Ishant Sharma by McCullum ensured India would bat again. For all that effort, however, they were still effectively six runs for five wickets at the end of the day.</p>

<p>The Winter Olympics in Sochi have made headlines for all the wrong reasons. After the long homophobia controversy that raged throughout late-2013, they’ve managed to show off some of the most splendidly inadequate infrastructure since Suresh Kalmadi decided to make CWG 2010 a national shame.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cheteshwarpujarareutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986371" alt="India's Cheteshwar Pujara (R) fields a shot from New Zealand's Brendon McCullum (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/cheteshwarpujarareutersm.jpg" /></a> India&#8217;s Cheteshwar Pujara (R) fields a shot from New Zealand&#8217;s Brendon McCullum (Reuters)
<p>New Zealand&#8217;s spectacular fightback in the ongoing third Test was helped to an extent by dropped catches but Indian batsman Cheteshwar Pujara defended his teammates, saying their fielding has been &#8220;fantastic&#8221; for most part of the trip.</p>
<p>After two days of domination at the Basin Reserve, the visitors had a tough day in the field as the pitch flattened out and the hosts rallied to 252/5 in their second innings to wipe off the first innings deficit.</p>
<p>While wickets didn&#8217;t come in the last session, a couple of close chances went down in the field, particularly off centurion Brendon McCullum who benefitted on both occasions. It was, in fact, the difference between the match finishing on Sunday and going into a fourth day.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at both the Test matches we have taken so many good catches. Not only on this trip, but in South Africa also, the Indian fielding has been fantastic. We have effected many run-outs and held many good catches. So you are bound to drop a few catches here and there,&#8221; said Pujara, defending his mates, after the third day&#8217;s play here.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been a fantastic game so far with many turns. But we are still in a very good position. If we can get a couple of quick wickets early on tomorrow, a lot of time is available. We are happy with the way things have shaped up.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could have been happier with a couple of more wickets but we are in a good position and in with a good chance to win this Test match,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>India bowled out New Zealand for 192 runs in their first innings and then went on to score 438 runs in their second essay.</p>
<p>The Kiwis almost lost their way before recovering through a fine partnership of 158 runs for the sixth wicket between McCullum (114 not out) and Watling (52 not out).</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to give credit to their batsmen. The way they batted was really good. Brendon batted well and that partnership was very crucial for them. We tried our best but they were the winners in that last session. Like I said earlier, if we can get a couple early wickets then we can go through the tail-enders,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pitch is getting better day by day. Our bowlers did a very good job and bowled in the right areas. They didn&#8217;t allow them to score many runs, which is a good sign for us. Overall looking at the wicket, they bowled really well,&#8221; Pujara added.</p>
<p>When asked, what sort of target the Indians will like to chase now that the Kiwis have taken a tiny lead, Pujara replied, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to chase a big target obviously, the lesser the better. But you cannot keep any targets in mind while bowling. We want to get them out as early as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, the line of questioning moved to his form, as the batsman has gotten starts in this series but somehow failed to convert them. Even so, he is now part of the Indian ODI team to play in Asia Cup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have learnt from my mistakes. My only regret is the first innings&#8217; dismissal in the first Test match where I played a really bad shot. But apart from that I got a good ball in the second innings there and here also, in the first innings I got a very good ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am confident of playing the ODI format well. It is just that I need to get a couple good scores in that format. I have done really well in the domestic matches I have played. So I am confident of a good showing in this format as well,&#8221; Pujara signed off.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986367&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p>India completed its return to the Olympic family on Sunday when its flag was hoisted at the Sochi Games, five days after the International Olympic Committee lifted its suspension on the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>India had been banned since December 2012 after elections at its Olympic association (IOA) saw a corruption-tainted official voted in as secretary general.</p>
<p>The IOC lifted the ban on Feb. 11 following fresh elections last week, allowing it to be represented at the Olympics and bringing the total number of nations competing at Russia&#8217;s first Winter Games to 88.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very, very emotional,&#8221; new IOA President N. Ramachandran, who is also heading the World Squash Federation, told Reuters Television.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us having been out for 15 months and to come back within two days after our elections is something I could not believe,&#8221; he said, thanking IOC President Thomas Bach for the quick decision.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s three athletes had marched under the Olympic flag at the opening ceremony but can now carry their own standard on Feb. 23 when the Games come to an end.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is now a fresh start for us and hopefully better days will come for Indian winter sports,&#8221; luger Shiva Keshavan told Reuters after the small ceremony that also included a few visiting Indian fans.</p>
<p>Two of the three athletes are currently Olympic scholarship holders.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s second most populous nation became the first to win readmission to the Olympic family during an ongoing Games.</p>
<p>The final athlete to compete in Sochi is Alpine skier Himanshu Thakur, who will take part in the giant slalom.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986346&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/manchestercityreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986278" alt="Manchester City's Stevan Jovetic (C) scores a goal as Chelsea's Petr Cech (L) and Cesar Azpilicueta react during their English FA Cup fifth round soccer match at the Etihad Stadium (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/manchestercityreutersm.jpg" /></a> Manchester City&#8217;s Stevan Jovetic (C) scores a goal as Chelsea&#8217;s Petr Cech (L) and Cesar Azpilicueta react during their English FA Cup fifth round soccer match at the Etihad Stadium (Reuters)
<p>Manchester City rediscovered their swagger to beat Chelsea 2-0 and move into the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday with Manuel Pellegrini winning the battle of tactical wits against Jose Mourinho.</p>
<p>Stevan Jovetic and Samir Nasri scored either side of halftime for City as Pellegrini finally fell upon a winning formula to get one over his managerial rival having lost both Premier League fixtures this season.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted revenge today,&#8221; City captain Vincent Kompany told ITV sport.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the word go we were hard in the challenges and we did not give them anything. It is a good victory from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The result completed a difficult week for Mourinho, whose side drew with West Bromwich Albion in the league on Tuesday, and returned City to winning ways after their defeat by Chelsea 12 days ago was followed by a draw with Norwich City.</p>
<p>City, who had drawn a blank in their previous two games having scored more than 100 goals this season, will be joined in the draw for the last eight by holders Wigan Athletic and Sunderland.</p>
<p>Ben Watson, who grabbed the winner when Wigan shocked Manchester City in last year&#8217;s final, continued his love affair with the competition by firing the second-tier side to a 2-1 upset victory at Premier League strugglers Cardiff City.</p>
<p>Sunderland punished Southampton for taking the competition too lightly and making a raft of changes, with a 1-0 defeat thanks to a stunning strike from Craig Gardner.</p>
<p><strong>Tactical manoeuvring</strong></p>
<p>The Cup was an opportunity for City and Chelsea to enjoy a break from what is becoming an increasingly fraught title race.<br />
Yet the encounter had a pinch of added spice after Mourinho had spent the buildup throwing verbal hand-grenades at all his managerial rivals.</p>
<p>Chelsea&#8217;s success at the Etihad Stadium 12 days previously was hailed as a piece of inspired tactical manoeuvring from their Portuguese coach and laid down the gauntlet to Pellegrini to come up with a response.</p>
<p>So into the City team came workhorse James Milner to shadow Chelsea&#8217;s man-in-form Eden Hazard, while Javi Garcia featured in centre midfield where Martin Demichelis had been exposed in the recent league reverse.</p>
<p>After some tentative probing from both sides, City took the lead with Jovetic making amends for firing over the bar from close range a minute earlier by sliding a precise finish into the corner after being fed by Edin Dzeko.</p>
<p>For Chelsea there were few positives in a poor first half in which they had one shot, a dismal effort from Willian that soared high over the crossbar into the crowd.</p>
<p>Mourinho, so often lauded for his game-changing substitutions, was also outmanoeuvred on that front as Pellegrini brought Nasri off the bench to see him grab a second goal on 66 minutes.</p>
<p>A neat one-two with Silva ended with the Frenchman side-footing into an unguarded goal.</p>
<p>City had the ball in the net for a third time when Joleon Lescott bundled it home late on, but the linesman&#8217;s flag prevented further damage for the visitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The second goal was an offside but we would still have lost 1-0 as we were never close to scaring City in the game,&#8221; Mourinho said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today proved how difficult it is to win here, which shows how well my team did in the last game.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Top corner</strong></p>
<p>Wigan, who dropped out of the top flight after their Wembley success, took the lead after 18 minutes when Chris McCann turned in a low cross.</p>
<p>Cardiff, second bottom in the Premier League, levelled through Fraizer Campbell nine minutes later, but Watson restored the visitors&#8217; lead just before the break, firing into the top corner from 25 metres.</p>
<p>Sunderland, who have already reached the League Cup final, again put their Premier League struggles to one side with Gardner thundering a second-half shot into the top corner from 25 metres.</p>
<p>Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino faced criticism for his team selection, however, after resting players despite being comfortably positioned in mid-table.</p>
<p>Sheffield Wednesday&#8217;s home game with Championship rivals Charlton Athletic was called off because of a waterlogged pitch.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Arsenal host Liverpool, Swansea City travel to Everton and Championship side Nottingham Forest visit third tier Sheffield United.</p>
<p>Championship club Brighton and Hove Albion entertain Hull City on Monday.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986276&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lionelmessireutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986274" alt="Barcelona, chasing a fifth La Liga title in six years, totally outclassed Madrid-based Rayo (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/lionelmessireutersm.jpg" /></a> Barcelona, chasing a fifth La Liga title in six years, totally outclassed Madrid-based Rayo (Reuters)
<p>Lionel Messi overhauled Alfredo Di Stefano&#8217;s La Liga goals tally as Barcelona and Atletico Madrid warmed up for midweek Champions League action with wins on Saturday that put them three points clear of Real Madrid at the top.</p>
<p>Back to his best after returning from a two-month injury layoff in early January, Messi struck twice in Barca&#8217;s 6-0 thrashing of Rayo Vallecano at the Nou Camp to take his total in Spain&#8217;s top flight to 228 goals from 263 matches, one more than Real Madrid great Di Stefano managed in 329 games.</p>
<p>Still only 26, Messi climbed above his Argentine compatriot to joint third on the all-time list behind record marksman Telmo Zarra (251) and Hugo Sanchez (234) and level with Raul.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would like to think that Messi has still not completely recovered (from his injury),&#8221; Barca coach Gerardo Martino told a news conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he wants to, he will break all the records that he likes,&#8221; added the Argentine, who hails from Messi&#8217;s home town of Rosario.</p>
<p>Barcelona, who play their Champions League last 16, first leg match at Manchester City on Tuesday, and Atletico, who visit AC Milan in the competition on Wednesday, have 60 points from 24 matches, ahead of Real who play at Getafe on Sunday.</p>
<p>Atletico&#8217;s Raul Garcia and Diego Costa struck early to set up a 3-0 win over visitors Real Valladolid, while Villarreal&#8217;s match at home to Celta Vigo was suspended for about half an hour when what appeared to be a teargas canister was thrown on to the pitch with about three minutes remaining.</p>
<p>Celta were leading 1-0 and after play restarted Nolito made it 2-0 with a free kick in the 90th minute meaning Villarreal missed a chance to close to within a point of fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao.</p>
<p><strong>Classy Barca</strong></p>
<p>Barca, chasing a fifth La Liga title in six years, totally outclassed Madrid-based Rayo and took the lead in the second minute when fullback Adriano cut inside from the left and his low effort scooted inside the far post.</p>
<p>Messi and Pedro then cracked shots off the frame of the goal before a pinpoint Cesc Fabregas pass sent Messi clear in the 36th minute and he produced a trademark chip over onrushing goalkeeper Ruben.</p>
<p>The four-times World Player of the Year released Alexis on the right to make it 3-0 eight minutes after the break before a moment of inspiration from Andres Iniesta helped create Barca&#8217;s fourth in the 56th.</p>
<p>The Spain playmaker&#8217;s backheel put Fabregas through and he squared for Pedro to tap into an empty net as a dominant Barca turned the screw on their hapless visitors.</p>
<p>Messi scored his second with a precise shot from the edge of the area in the 68th and Neymar crowned a near-perfect night for the home side when he came off the bench and netted a fierce long-range drive in the 89th minute.</p>
<p>The Brazil forward has been out injured for a month and his reappearance suggested he could play a role at Manchester City on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the team is having fun we play better and today a lot of people had fun,&#8221; Martino said. &#8220;If I had to choose I would prefer to go into the match against City playing like this.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Perfect start</strong></p>
<p>Atletico came into the game against Valladolid at their Calderon stadium after resounding losses in both legs of their King&#8217;s Cup semi-final against city rivals Real either side of a surprise 2-0 La Liga reverse at promoted Almeria.</p>
<p>Diego Simeone&#8217;s side needed a convincing performance to lift morale before Wednesday&#8217;s game at the San Siro and Garcia gave them the perfect start.</p>
<p>He picked up Gabi&#8217;s clever free kick in the third minute and netted with a first-time strike from the edge of the area.</p>
<p>A minute later Garcia conjured a fine assist for Costa and the Brazil-born forward lifted the ball over Valladolid keeper Diego Marino for his 21st league goal of the campaign, one behind top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo of Real.</p>
<p>With a two-goal cushion, Atletico played well within themselves for the rest of the match and centre back Diego Godin added a third in the 74th with a header from a Diego corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;The 2-0 did not give me peace of mind, the 3-0 a little more,&#8221; Simeone told a news conference. &#8220;From that point, we made some changes so I could rest some players and above all to give the others a chance,&#8221; added the Argentine.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need everyone who is not playing regularly because when we need them to come on they have to play as well as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Valladolid, who have won only four games this term, are down in 18th on 21 points, one ahead of second-bottom Rayo.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986272&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/brendonmccullumreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986270" alt="Brendon McCullum was 114 not out at stumps (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/brendonmccullumreutersm.jpg" /></a> Brendon McCullum was 114 not out at stumps (Reuters)
<p>New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum stubbornly provided a glimmer of hope for his side on the third day of the second Test against India as he battled to his ninth Test century to thwart the visitors&#8217; push for a series-levelling victory on Sunday.</p>
<p>McCullum, troubled with what appeared to be injuries to his left shoulder and right elbow, blasted the only six of his innings over long on off Ishant Sharma to bring up the milestone about 45 minutes before the end of play.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old McCullum was 114 not out at stumps having shared in an unbroken 158-run partnership with wicketkeeper BJ Watling (52) that guided the hosts to 252 for five and stalled India&#8217;s drive for victory at the Basin Reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was hard work out there,&#8221; McCullum told Radio Sport. &#8220;I thought they bowled brilliantly and at five for 90 (odd), things weren&#8217;t looking so good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thankfully BJ and I put together a partnership which was undefeated at the end of the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corey Anderson was the only wicket to fall during the final two sessions, having joined McCullum at the resumption of play following the lunch break after New Zealand had slumped to 87 for four in the final over of the morning session.</p>
<p>Anderson had tried to work Ravindra Jadeja into the leg-side only to get a leading edge and it ballooned back to the left-arm spinner.</p>
<p>Anderson&#8217;s dismissal reduced the hosts to 94 for five and in danger of not seeing out a sun-drenched day, before Watling and McCullum dropped anchors and took their side through two sessions to ensure they would be back for a fourth day.</p>
<p>The normally free-flowing McCullum faced 237 balls and had been batting for just under six hours while Watling was even more obdurate with his 52 coming from 208 deliveries. He had been at the crease for more than four hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s what the team required and as captain that&#8217;s what you try and achieve,&#8221; McCullum added. &#8220;You&#8217;re not always going to do it, but you have to try and work your game to the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just pleased to get through to the end of the day with five down. We have got a lot more ground to cover tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>New Zealand had resumed the day on 24 for one, a deficit of 222 runs, and slumped further into the mire when Zaheer Khan grabbed two early wickets to put India firmly in charge of the match.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old left-armer had the ball move slightly away off the seam to catch the thinnest of outside edges of both Kane Williamson (seven) and Hamish Rutherford (35) to reduce the hosts to 52 for three inside the first hour.</p>
<p>Debutant Tom Latham was then dismissed by Mohammed Shami in the final over before lunch for 29, having avoided the dreaded pair in his first Test when he punched Zaheer through point for two runs.</p>
<p>India must win the match to level the two-Test series after New Zealand won the first game at Eden Park by 40 runs and McCullum said he felt while the visitors were still in the ascendancy the match could still turn the home side&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being five down was key for us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we had been six or seven down I think the Test was over.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a big couple of hours at the end of the day there.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986268&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ajinkyarahaneapm2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986229" alt="Ajinkya Rahane hit his maiden Test ton on Saturday (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/ajinkyarahaneapm2.jpg" /></a> Ajinkya Rahane hit his maiden Test ton on Saturday (AP)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Abhay Poyarekar never imagined that Ajinkya Rahane would seek his help to be a better batsman. The 58-year-old retired assistant commissioner of Customs &amp; Central Excise had donned the gloves for his college, but he wasn’t equipped to give batting tips to the cricketer. </span></p>
<p>His only connection with top-level cricket was friend Pravin Amre, the former Test batsman who is now Rahane’s batting mentor. It was Amre who wanted Rahane to meet Poyarekar. Amre wanted his student to learn a few things from the former Customs officer’s inspiring story, before he left on a crucial away assignment with the Indian team.</p>
<p>After Rahane’s maiden Test ton at Wellington on Saturday, Amre said the meeting proved fruitful. “Sometimes such small things make a big difference&#8230;. maybe, this is what has happened,” he said.</p>
<p>On September 29, 1993, a few months after the Mumbai serial blasts, Poyarekar seized 18 detonators from a ship during a raid at the Mumbai docks. The action reportedly thwarted a plot to carry out blasts during Ganpati Visarjan.</p>
<p>Poyarekar’s efforts won him a bravery award from the President. But with the recognition came threats, to him and his family. And later, even an alleged attempt to bribe him with Rs 5 crore.</p>
<p>“Pravin wanted me to share my experience with the cricketer. I asked him, ‘are you sure?’ He said, ‘yes, you talk and he will listen’,” recalled Poyarekar. He said Amre also coerced him to divulge details of his encounters with the underworld.</p>
<p>“It’s a mental thing, you can call it confidence building. After that ’93 incident, the next eight years were about overcoming fears. I used to get threatening calls daily, warning that my children would be killed. We were chased daily by unknown people,” said Poyarekar.</p>
<p>“He (Poyarekar) faced a real life and death situation and still didn’t get distracted from his goals. Cricketers have to take quick decisions instinctively. They have so many distractions these days and the key behind such talks is to ascertain how crucial it is to not lose focus. It can have a lasting experience, like it did with Ajinkya,” said Amre.</p>
<p>“It had a very positive effect on me,” Rahane had said before leaving for New Zealand. Batting against pacers in New Zealand is always a challenge. But Rahane held firm and made his mark, just like  Poyarekar.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986041&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mitchelljohnsonbangarm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986327" alt="MitchellJohnsonBangarM" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mitchelljohnsonbangarm.jpg" /></a> Indian Premier League: Sanjay Bangar, who is the coach of the Kings XI Punjab, is delighted to have Mitchell Johnson in the squad (AP)
<p><em>Taking over the reins at Kings XI Punjab, this will be Sanjay Bangar’s first  stint as an  IPL franchise coach. He talks to <strong>Bharat Sundaresan</strong> about the process of reassembling the team from scratch, the hefty pay-cheque handed out to Rishi Dhawan and the rationale behind roping in Sehwag and Pujara.</em></p>
<p><strong>EXCERPTS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ness Wadia had revealed that Kings XI’s strategising had begun in November itself. What was your role during the preparation phase for the auction?</strong></p>
<p>I did a lot of talent scouting by watching Ranji Trophy matches, specially from the quarterfinal stage. What also worked to my advantage was that I was playing till last year. So I knew about the domestic players and how they react under match circumstances. We also were intent on building on the work laid down by former coaches and senior players like Vikram Rathore, Darren Lehmann and Adam Gilchrist. Generally if there’s a change in the coach, he tries to bring in a whole lot many changes. But I was in constant consultation with Rathore, trying to pick his brains about what he thought of certain players. He had selected a whole lot of players who eventually ended up in Kings XI. I also exchanged many mails with Lehmann to get his views.</p>
<p><strong>Did you therefore have a lot to do with the big money spent on Rishi Dhawan and Gurkeerat Mann?</strong></p>
<p>I think what worked in Rishi and Gurkeerat’s favour is that they had performed well at the IPL level. It’s one thing to be a good talent and then to deliver under all the pressure and hype. Rishi did so consistently for Mumbai Indians. Gurkeerat on the other hand is just flowering for Punjab. At the end of the day, one deserves what he’s destined to get. You can’t control the price on anybody on any commodity so I’m glad that he got rewarded. It’s pleasing to see domestic players who toil so hard under tough conditions being acknowledged in the auction. At the same time, a kid in Himachal sees what’s happened to Rishi Dhawan and takes cricket seriously as a career, then there is a paradigm shift in how people think about sport.</p>
<p><strong>You had retained two batsmen in David Miller and Manan Vohra. How did you go about rebuilding the rest of the team?</strong></p>
<p>In most auctions, on both days, the game gets over within the first half. You have to act really fast. We started off by getting a player of Virender Sehwag’s calibre at a very reasonable price (Rs 3.2 crore) and then a few things also went our way and we got lucky on a few occasions.</p>
<p><strong>So was Sehwag always in your plans?</strong></p>
<p>No, I think you can never go into an auction with a pre-set idea. You have to keep your options open and be flexible. Economically, I think we surely wanted someone like Sehwag. And I’m confident that he’ll come to the party. Playing domestic cricket can at times be demotivating for someone who’s played international cricket for so long. This IPL will motivate him to try and just play the way he wants to.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve played limited-overs’ cricket against Pujara (who was bought for Rs 1.9 crore). How do you rate him in the shorter formats?</strong></p>
<p>I’m of the belief that if somebody can play as well as he does at the international level against world-class bowlers, then he has a high chance of succeeding in any other format too. He is a batsman who’s suited to bat in the top-order or as an opener without a doubt, so that is where we will eventually try him to maximise his potential.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve also got someone like Mitchell Johnson who’s really hot right now and a power-player in Glenn Maxwell?</strong></p>
<p>We are delighted to have Johnson, a champion cricketer in the form of his life. We got a bit lucky with him because we were not sure whether we will acquire him with Mumbai keen to hold onto him. In the end it went well for us, considering that the IPL could be played in South Africa. Maxwell is a brilliant package. He is probably the top fielder in the world and also a handy, useful spinner, which adds a lot of value to the team. We also got another bargain buy match-winner in Thisara Perera.</p>
<p><strong>One formula of building a team is picking a captain and building a team around him. Was George Bailey’s purchase in that scheme of things?</strong></p>
<p>We never really went in with the intention of having him (Bailey) captaining the side. We were more intent on getting the best possible players in the mix and look at our captaincy options from that lot later.</p>
<p><strong>Wadia spoke about how a ‘penny saved was a penny earned’ in the auction. Was it a case of aping the Rajasthan Royals model?</strong></p>
<p>We obviously learn from each other. It’s not a big field, and no matter how hard you devise your strategy it’s a level playing field. Most teams are well-balanced. With all the indecisiveness about where the IPL will be played—India, UAE or South Africa—I think we have gotten a balanced outfit.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986040&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

<p><em><strong>First-time IPL coaches Gary Kirsten and Sanjay Bangar are in charge of Delhi Daredevils and Kings XI Punjab — teams that’ve done nothing of note since reaching the semifinals in the inaugural season. Kirsten returns to a country where he has only happy memories while Bangar, a first-time head coach, looks to create happy ones of his own.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>The Gary Kirsten-Eric Simons partnership were hugely successful with Team India. Kirsten as head coach and Simons shepherding and moulding India’s temperamental pacers. The duo have re-united, this time to guide Delhi Daredevils in IPL 7. Their roles have altered though, with Simons, instrumental in bringing in his friend — widely considered to be the world’s best coach — into the IPL fold as they attempt to lift the capital side out of the wooden-spoon depths they plunged to last year. After the IPL auction in Bangalore, the duo spoke to <strong>Shamik Chakraborty. </strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Excerpts:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gary, what was your reaction when you got a call from the Daredevils? You had spoken about missing home when you left India. What did your wife and kids say as you were packing your bags again?</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten: If you’ve seen any of the media around explaining why I didn’t renew my contract with the Proteas, it was on the back of international cricket which is very different to the IPL. The IPL is a two-month tournament. It’s a completely different space from my family’s perspective. You’re committing for two months for a tournament as opposed to the whole year.</p>
<p><strong>Gary, is returning to India for a second stint, a tad less stressful?</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten:  No, I’m looking forward to it. I think it’s going to be an interesting experience. I have very fond memories of my three years with the national team and it’s nice to be back. Cricket-wise I’m excited about the IPL because it’ll be a new experience for me. I’m learning a lot from guys within the Delhi set-up who have already been there and understand how it works.</p>
<p><strong>How wiser are you about India and the Indian mindset this time? Will you tap into your past experience or is it better to start with a clean slate?</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten: I’m not sure. I haven’t been with this sort of a team within a company, within a franchise, and it would be arrogant to think that I could have all the answers regarding the IPL. I’ve learnt a lot in the past in terms of how it operates.</p>
<p><strong>You have Eric by your side once again, but will you miss Paddy Upton?</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten: Paddy’s a quality worker in his sphere. Anyone would miss him. We’ve got five years together and I’ve learnt a lot from him. It’s good to be joining Eric again. I enjoyed having him with us in the Indian team. It’s important to learn new things which is what I’m doing, coming into the IPL. It’s nice that I’ve got a good friend who’s helping me through the process. Otherwise I would be sitting in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>Simons, what do you think about working with Gary?</strong></p>
<p>Simons: I think relationships are very important in the cricketing sphere and my relationship with Gary has always been very good. I think designations are irrelevant in the sense of how it works. Gary is the head coach and he will take the big calls, and I’m there to support him. It’s how it functions. We don’t have an ego in this job and that is one of the reasons we work well together. (It) certainly puts things into perspective about who I want to work with. We complement each other well in terms of personality and thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Paddy will be in the rival camp if he turns up for Rajasthan Royals. Or will he be joining Delhi Daredevils too?</strong></p>
<p>Simons:  I don’t think there’s any chance of him joining DD. Paddy’s had a very successful run with Royals. He’s an integral part of that organisation and I think that’s good for him. That’s where he has found a niche for himself. He has done very well. Obviously we will always have a great relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think your prior association with the Indian team and knowledge of players, many of whom would be leading opposition sides, could help you read their minds since you know their weakness and strengths so well?</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten: No. We live in a world now where guys are playing with and against each other all the time. If you want any information on a player you can get it easily. We live in a dynamic environment in professional cricket. So there’s no added advantage here. Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>Dhoni, Virat, Gambhir, Rohit Sharma — how do you think they’ve evolved as captains?</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten: We’ll try to understand the opposition and prepare accordingly. It’s as simple as that. There’s no hidden secret there. We will do our best to prepare for each game, doesn’t matter who’s in the opposition. Every guy we will plan for and have an understanding for. And that’s it. As far as their batting and captaincy, yes I have been following them from a distance, but it won’t be right for me to make an assessment from this platform. I have very close relationships with all of them.</p>
<p><strong>You once said, “I would go to war with Dhoni by my side”. Now you are slated to go to war against Dhoni with Kevin Pietersen by your side.</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten:  Things do change. Yes. KP has been an integral part of Delhi Daredevils for the last few years. He expressed a real interest to return. Once he was available full-time for the franchise and once we heard that, we got excited. We were prepared to invest in Kevin Pietersen because of the success he had with the franchise in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Do you rate KP really high as a man manager and a cricketer and is that the reason you guys spent Rs 9 crore on him? What does he bring to the side?</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten: &#8211; It’s fairly visible what he brings to the table. He’s a world-class player and a proven match-winner at the highest level.<br />
Simons:  If you’re asking me if a player like him needs an ego boost, I don’t think it’s an ego boost. Every player needs to feel that they’re a part of the family and very important to the team, and have got a role to play. And it’s not just words; it is about believing those words. That’s what man management is. There are different types of players. Massively explosive players, massively talented players but they don’t necessarily like the additional burden of captaincy.</p>
<p>And there are those who enjoy it. KP is a natural leader. Some people influence environments and some don’t. KP is someone who influences environments. He was the informal leader in IPL 5 and played a big role in our leadership structures. Team atmosphere should be such that every player finds his own space. That’s the key.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think Pietersen is the most misunderstood cricketer in the history of the game?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know the answer to that, to be honest. I haven’t worked with him enough to know.</p>
<p><strong>Gary, the Indian team enjoyed a flexible, relaxed regime in your coaching tenure and many believe a similar vibe will help KP blossom?</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten: I don’t like the word coaching. It’s more about managing teams or managing environments and be more of a manager of people rather than a coach. And it’s about the whole team and not an individual. We will do what it takes to prepare these guys and the team as well.</p>
<p><strong>Did you change your approach to coaching when you joined South Africa? Or do the basics stay common to all dressing-rooms?  </strong></p>
<p>Kirsten: My basic philosophy on leadership and creating the proper environment remains unchanged. But they’re different games, so obviously we have a different way of thinking within the team based on the type of game which you’re playing. The IPL is new to me. So I will lean a lot on Eric and the other guys just to understand what type of strategy we’ve used in the past. What has been good and what hasn’t been good. And we will certainly do a lot of work on that and will try to move it forward. But it is different coaching (in the IPL) in many ways.</p>
<p><strong>Why didn’t you retain Sehwag?</strong></p>
<p>Kirsten: It’s a decision which is not made only by me. It is made by a group of people who are part of our management team. Viru has been a fantastic player; I really enjoyed working with him in the Indian team. He had a lot of success at that time. But  the Delhi franchise took the decision to move on.  We were looking for a certain type of player and we were looking for players who fitted a certain role. We believe that was the best decision we could make to take the franchise forward in terms of performance. There can be a bit of emotion around. You don’t want to disappoint people, but at the end of the day, you are taking business decisions that you think are best for the franchise, and that’s how we did it.</p>
<p><strong>Does the spot-fixing controversy in the IPL affect you?</strong></p>
<p>Simons: I think Brendon McCullum was asked a similar question and his answer was perhaps the best — “We move to our play-stations&#8230;we just do our job.” Administrators take care of them (controversies). It’s a genuine answer that I can give. What happens, happens and we will find out.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986032&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New Zealand will begin Day Three needing to get 222 runs to have India bat again, but wicket keeper BJ Watling feels the wicket is best for batting from the third day onwards but considering the amount of time remaining in the game, it would be a huge challenge for the hosts to save the Test.</p>
<p><strong>On Day Two performance</strong><br />
It was not really an ideal day for us. We got ourselves into situations where, if we had taken another wicket or two, we could have been chasing 100 or 150. Obviously, it was a disappointing result in the end but we have still got three days to grind it out here. The pitch is definitely looking a lot better to bat on.</p>
<p><strong>On Indian batting</strong><br />
Credit must go to their batsmen. (Shikhar) Dhawan obviously played really well at the top and got them off to a good start and (Ajinkya) Rahane’s hundred was pretty good. He played very well. Then, (MS) Dhoni’s counter-attack hurt us and that partnership was probably the difference between an okay day and a good day for them. If we had taken a wicket there, we could have been right in the hunt.</p>
<p><strong>On the track</strong><br />
The wicket has definitely improved. On day one, it was pretty green and doing a bit. Today, there was still enough in it for the bowlers but it has browned off and looks a pretty decent batting track now. We are looking forward to getting out there and taking on the challenge and trying to bat for a long time as a group.</p>
<p><strong>On saving Test</strong><br />
It’s going to be a huge challenge. We are going to have to bat long here to get ourselves back in the game. (Ishant) Sharma is bowling really well, so is (Mohammad) Shami and Zaheer (Khan) is an experienced bowler. He will hit some good areas too, so we got to soak it up in the morning for an hour and then bat for a long time. But I don’t think there are too many demons in the wicket at the moment, and it should be at its best tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>On NZ batting</strong><br />
There is still good attitude in the dressing room. The bowlers ran in hard today and bowled well and we appreciated their effort. Now, it’s an opportunity for the batsmen to try and grind out as many runs as they can and bat for a long time. We know what’s ahead of us and now it’s time to try and push back.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1986000&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/fan-m.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985994" alt="Allen Jones, blind since birth, at the  Basin Reserve on Saturday." src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/fan-m.jpg" /></a> Allen Jones, blind since birth, at the Basin Reserve on Saturday (IE Photo Daksh Panwar)
<p>It’s a lazy post-lunch session. The runs have dried up as New Zealand are bowling a defensive line to Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane. A few who may have had a filling meal during the break could be seen catching forty winks. Sitting in one corner of the grandstand with his eye closed, Allen Jones may come across as one of those. Only, he is not. He has a white cane folded underneath his seat. He is blind.</p>
<p>The 72-year-old Jones is a cricket fan unlike most. He can’t watch it, but he enjoys it nonetheless. So much so that he has religiously attended most matches at the Basin Reserve for the last 30 years. “I enjoy very much sitting in this place, it’s good for hearing,” he says, having taken his seat behind long on/third man. “I’ve tried different places, but right above the pitch, here, it’s extremely good.”</p>
<p>Jones has been blind since birth. As a young man, he says, he followed cricket a bit and used to admire the hard-hitting Australian Alan Davidson. Then he attended a few games at the Basin. “And I got very interested in it,” he says.</p>
<p>It was the New Zealand-England Test match in 1984. Ian Botham took a five-for and hit a century in the first innings of that drawn game. After that, cricket became a lifelong passion for Jones. He would travel by bus from his home at Island Bay, Wellington, and be at the Basin whenever there was an international game. “I even went to England and Australia to attend Test matches. I go to Australia to attend every season-opener Test, which is generally played at the Gabba (Brisbane),” he says.</p>
<p>But the Basin is his favourite venue in the world. “I really enjoy the Basin because it’s small and compact. I think it is one of the nicest cricket grounds in the world,” he says.</p>
<p>But how does he make out the aesthetics of a ground despite his disability? “I listen in to the commentary on the radio, and you can hear what the different positions of the ground are. (Right now) I can hear the people on the bank over there. And hear the Indians in crowd here in the stands. Moreover, I have walked around on this ground. So I know the shape of this ground,” he says.</p>
<p>He has been to the WestPac stadium as well for a few One-dayers. “I am not so keen on it. It is too big,” Jones says.</p>
<p>Even those who can see, can see where he is coming from.</p>
<p>Among his favourite players are Richard Hadlee and Jimmy Neesham. Hadlee for obvious reasons, and Neesham because he is from Jones’s alma mater: Auckland Grammar. He attended the match against England where Hadlee dismissed Alan Border for his 300th wicket. He was there when Neesham knocked back Rohit Sharma’s stumps on Saturday for his first wicket in the Test.</p>
<p>However, it’s the commentators —Henry Blofeld, Geoffrey Boycott and Jim Maxwell — that he most admires. For, he sees the games through their eyes. The reason that he doesn’t attend the Plunket Shield games is because there is no broadcast. “I rely on ball description. It is absolutely must for me.”<br />
Jones says he takes a passing interest in rugby, “but it’s cricket that I like. I like the leisurely nature of Test cricket. I am not too keen on One-dayers, but may attend the World Cup next year.”</p>
<p>Does he ever wish he could see, so that could watch cricket?</p>
<p>“Not now, not when you have been blind for 72 years,” Jones replies. “See,” his choice of words is ironic here, “the main thing is to concentrate on what you can do, rather than what you can’t do.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985991&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mitchelljohnsonapt.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986233" alt="Australia and Mitchell Johnson had the home team on the ropes throughout the opening match (AP)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/mitchelljohnsonapt.jpg" /></a> Australia and Mitchell Johnson had the home team on the ropes throughout the opening match (AP)
<p>Australia crushed cricket&#8217;s top-ranked team on Saturday as unstoppable fast bowler Mitchell Johnson took 12 of 20 wickets to send South Africa to a humbling 281-run defeat at home in the first Test.</p>
<p>Already with 7 for 68 from the first innings, Johnson ripped out 5 for 59 in the second to bowl South Africa out for 200, way off the huge target of 482 at SuperSport Park. Johnson finished with match figures of 12 for 127 off 33 brutally hostile overs.</p>
<p>Bowling fast and often short, and too fast for the South Africans to handle, the left-arm Johnson sent back openers Alviro Petersen and Graeme Smith inside four overs. He had JP Duminy out just before tea. For good measure, Johnson struck Ryan McLaren a crunching blow on the helmet with a bouncer, then blasted him out too as a ruthless Australia took the lead in the three-match contest.</p>
<p>The red-hot quick eventually finished with a second five-wicket haul of the match and his third career 10-for in Tests. Fellow fast bowlers Peter Siddle and Ryan Harris had two each as Australia rattled through South Africa&#8217;s top order for the second time in the match and then bruised its lower order.</p>
<p>Johnson&#8217;s destructive start to the series opener already had the Proteas all out for 206 in their first knock.</p>
<p>Sweeping aside South Africa&#8217;s No. 1 ranking, Australia and Johnson had the home team on the ropes throughout the opening match and sealed a commanding win to start the three-match series, where Australia is now far more than just a mere challenger to South Africa&#8217;s status as the top team in the world. Australia has been the best team by some way in this match.</p>
<p>Dominating with bat as well as ball, Australia had earlier declared its second innings on 290-4 in the third over of play for a lead of 481 after a power-packed 115 by David Warner and 89 by debutant Doolan. Warner&#8217;s rapid hundred was the third Australian century of the game, and his double-century partnership in tandem with Doolan the tourists&#8217; second stand of over 200.</p>
<p>Australia made 397 batting first after being put in by South Africa.</p>
<p>In comparison, AB de Villiers was the only South African to pass 50 and deal with the threat of Johnson with his 91 in the first innings. De Villiers made 48 in the second innings as all around him the home team crumbled through four days.</p>
<p><strong>Brief Scores:</strong> Australia 397 (S Marsh 148, S Smith 100; D Steyn 4/78) &amp; 290 for 4 (D Warner 115, A Doolan 89) beat South Africa 206 (AB de Villiers 91; M Johnson 7/68) &amp; 200 (De Villiers 48; Johnson 5/59)</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985984&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/crick-m1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1985982" alt="Ajinkya Rahane made 118 off 158 balls to help India post 438 in the first innings of the second Test in Wellington on Saturday. (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/crick-m1.jpg" /></a> Ajinkya Rahane made 118 off 158 balls to help India post 438 in the first innings of the second Test in Wellington on Saturday. (Reuters)
<p>In the fading light on Saturday evening, as he led the Indian team out of the dressing room to have a crack at the New Zealand batsmen, MS Dhoni might have felt he was approaching the end of a very long tunnel.</p>
<p>They have been in the country for over a month and have never been in this strong a position. Yes they did tie a One-dayer, but looked like losing it until the very last ball. Dhoni often complained of having to do the catching-up on the tour, here, he found his long hooked nose ahead of Brendon McCullum’s straighter, smaller one for the first time, thanks to the 246-run lead his bowlers had behind them at the beginning of the second innings.</p>
<p>In a way, this tunnel stretches even further back than the last one month. To the beginning of the South Africa tour late last year when this current win-less streak cross formats began. In another way, it goes almost three years back, to the summer of 2011 in the West Indies, where India won their last away Test. It has been such a long journey, it must have put doubts in the Indian players’ heads if they would ever come out at the other end of it.</p>
<p>If it was, indeed, a tunnel, and not a bottomless pit.</p>
<p>But the Indian captain is too practical a man to get too ahead of himself. There is nine wickets to take on a track that showed signs of easing out. Instead, Dhoni would have reflected on a rare satisfying day in the office. One that could have gone either way when the team were 165 for five, still 27 runs behind with the Kiwis having their tails up.</p>
<p>It was crucial moment and needed to be clasped at with both hands. And the man who walked out to bat, did precisely that. Ajinkya Rahane struck his maiden Test hundred, a first-patient-then-fluent 118, to signal a turning of the corner for himself and team.</p>
<p>Rahane weathered the initial hostility by the New Zealand bowlers as he added 63 watchful runs with Kohli to take India past New Zealand’s total. Then, with an attacking Dhoni, he shared a 120-run stand to put the team in a commanding position.</p>
<p>When Dhoni half-pulled, half-glanced Trent Boult to wicketkeeper BJ Watling to end his innings at 68, India were 348/7 and Rahane was at 81. Two months ago, at Durban in South Africa, the 25-year-old had missed out on a century by four runs. On Saturday, he was determined to make amends.</p>
<p>“In South Africa, when I got 96, I wanted to get that hundred, because the first hundred is really special,” Rahane said. “Those four runs were really crucial at that time (in Durban). I know how crucial four runs are now, because a hundred is a hundred. When you get out on 96, it’s counted as a fifty.”</p>
<p>It’s an honest admission from a remarkably simple lad. And hard working. Those two values middle-class Maharashtrians take pride in.</p>
<p>The hard work was evident when he was quietly making thousands of runs in the Ranji Trophy, patiently waiting for his turn as the Indian middle-order looked impregnable. The simplicity never deserted him in the glamour of the IPL even as he prolifically scored for the Rajasthan Royals. Even now, as part of the Indian team for sometime —though on an off — his understated demeanor stands out in the crowd of brash youngsters.  He idolises Rahul Dravid, but even Dravid was sophisticated. Rahane is just Rahane, in every way possible.</p>
<p><strong>Different strokes  </strong></p>
<p>What he brings to the table is also unique. Unlike Pujara who is seen as Dravid’s replacement — No.3, methodical and reliable — or unlike Virat Kohli’s prolific run scoring is compared with Sachin Tendulkar, Rahane is not a pound-for-pound replacement of any of the giants. He is, perhaps, a kind of batsman India never had. He can block and assert, and switches between the two almost seamlessly, without the opposition even realising.</p>
<p>On Day Two, he batted with immense patience along side Virat Kohli and freed his arms without being noticed while Dhoni and then Ravindra Jadeja were smashing away.</p>
<p>In the 90s, alongside Zaheer Khan, he betrayed a few nerves when an edge sailed over gully, but cracked an emphatic pull off Neil Wagner to bring up his century. There was no fist-pumping or jump in the air. The helmet came off, the head tilted skywards and a silent prayer was perhaps said. The helmet came back on and Rahane cracked two more fours in the over and a massive six in the next before being caught acrobatically by Boult in the deep.</p>
<p><strong>Dhawan falls two short</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Shikhar Dhawan missed out on a second successive ton by just two runs, when Tim Southee induced an edge with an out-swinger. Dhawan and Ishant shared a fifty run partnership that set the tone for a frustrating day for the hosts. And when they did get three wickets in a space of 24 runs, they ran into a determined Rahane.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985978&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sochiolympicsreutersm.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986260" alt="Sochi Olympics: Bobsleigh, like Formula One, has tightly defined rules and materials to be used (Reuters)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/sochiolympicsreutersm.jpg" /></a> Sochi Olympics: Bobsleigh, like Formula One, has tightly defined rules and materials to be used (Reuters)
<p>Formula One technology has already helped Britain to skeleton gold at the Sochi Olympics and the bobsleigh competition will see McLaren, Ferrari and BMW take their track rivalry onto the ice as well.</p>
<p>Like compatriot Amy Williams before her, Lizzy Yarnold’s gold on Friday owed something to the assistance of McLaren Applied Technologies, part of the Formula One team’s group of companies. McLaren have two employees at Sochi embedded with the skeleton and bobsleigh teams while Formula One rivals Ferrari have been leaning on their boffins and using track-honed know-how to help the Italians.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, BMW &#8211; who quit Formula One in 2009 &#8211; have also worked closely with coaches, athletes and engineers of the USA Bobsled and Skeleton Federation to completely redesign their two-man bobsled.</p>
<p>McLaren Applied Technologies director of performance Caroline Hargrove said her experts had worked on Yarnold’s sled for several years, although exact details were as jealously guarded as anything coming out of the F1 factory.</p>
<p>“We got involved after the last Olympics so that sled had already been started and been very successful with Amy Williams (winner in 2010),” she said. The main areas in which McLaren’s expertise can be harnessed tend to be in aerodynamics, sled dynamics and technical setup and the gains have been incremental not dramatic. Components have been rebuilt and refined for maximum performance, while data gleaned since Vancouver has been processed and applied.</p>
<p>In skeleton, one size does not fit all. In each case we personalise the intervention, so for example the sled dynamics are tailored to the particular athlete,” said Hargrove.</p>
<p>“If you look at Lizzy and you look at Amy Williams, they are very different athletes. They are 20 kilos different. You need something personalised. And we spend a lot of time doing that. So we got performance out of personalising to the athletes.” With Yarnold, the sled was improved as she did got better. “She &#8230; is an extremely talented athlete and therefore changes that we made to the sled that she liked, she took on board,” said Hargrove. “It made a difference but at the same time it made her a better skeleton athlete.”</p>
<p><strong>Serious fun</strong></p>
<p>Yarnold was a favourite in skeleton but the bobsleigh offers a different challenge and the rivalry between Ferrari and McLaren can best be described as ‘serious fun’. “We like that,” Hargrove said of the rivalry. “It’s part of how we are. Everyone working here is seriously competitive and the same on their side. So it adds another element to it, which is quite fun. It’s not more than fun.</p>
<p>“In winter sport, they are in a different position. They have tracks themselves, they are a winter sport nation with snow and mountains &#8211; something we haven’t got. So we have needed to be at times a little bit more creative in ways we could support the team because we haven’t got that and never will have a track.”</p>
<p>Bobsleigh, like Formula One, has tightly defined rules and materials to be used, which makes the scope for finding a big chunk of time on the ice is limited. But components have been rebuilt and refined. “Once the competition starts, a bit like Formula One, there’s not that much you can do,” said Hargrove. “The sleds get inspected and then go into parc ferme overnight. But before that, while they were testing, to make sure they had the best setup for the conditions, we were there to help.”</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985976&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>

		<description><![CDATA[It wasn’t for the first time that Mumbai were unable to handle the Rajpal-Wilson combination. <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985972&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a href="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rajpalsinghiem.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1986244" alt="Rajpal Singh (C) scored two crucial goals in Delhi’s 5-3 win (IE Photo Kevin d’Souza)" src="http://images.indianexpress.com/2014/02/rajpalsinghiem.jpg" /></a> Rajpal Singh (C) scored two crucial goals in Delhi’s 5-3 win (IE Photo Kevin d’Souza)
<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">For a few moments, Rajpal Singh rolled back the years. Positioned near the half line on the left blank, the former India captain received a ball from Rupinderpal Singh. Rajpal trapped cleanly — his first touch had disappointed him so far this evening — turned and with a sudden burst of energy, darted towards the Mumbai Magicians goal.</span></p>
<p>Not so long ago, his electric heels had tormented several defences. But fallout with the administrators and subsequent association with the breakaway World Series Hockey cut short his India career. On Saturday, he showed what he is still capable of as the Mumbai defenders were unable to keep up with the blinding pace. He laid the ball off for Jason Wilson at the byline and finished off the move with a diving effort, slotting home the return pass past PR Sreejesh.</p>
<p>It wasn’t for the first time that Mumbai were unable to handle the Rajpal-Wilson combination. In the 12th minute, the duo came together again to give Delhi Waveriders a 2-1 lead. Barring the two goals, Rajpal had a pretty average game. But the twin strikes came at crucial junctures in the match, when the hosts looked like staging a comeback, and eventually helped his side post a commanding 5-3 win in their final league outing against the bottom-placed side at the Mahindra Stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>The win cemented Delhi Waveriders’s position at the top of the table. More importantly, by finishing their league stage commitment with a victory, Delhi have ensured they carry the momentum into next Saturday’s semifinal.</p>
<p>Delhi ticked almost all boxes on the offensive front &#8211; they were quick in counter attacks, incisive with build-up play in the attacking third and scored from penalty corner (Rupinderpal Singh) as well. Sardar Singh, as always, was flawless along with New Zealander Simon Child and Australian Matt Ghodes. Together, they controlled the flow of the game. Akashdeep Singh, Yuvraj Walmiki — both found back of the net — and Gurbaj Singh too were impressive.</p>
<p>However, the table-toppers were caught napping defensively on a couple of occasions which nearly cost them the win. Mumbai have lacked teeth up front this season. But they came up with an improved performance against Delhi, perhaps their most cohesive so far, and took advantage of their tired opponents. Glenn Turner scored twice for Mumbai and provided an assist to Timothy Deavin for the third. .</p>
<p><strong>Sandeep wins it for punjab</strong></p>
<p>Mohali: BEFORE the beginning of the second edition of HIL, Punjab Warriors coach Barry Dancer had shared how the poor conversion rate of penalty corners had affected his team’s chances in the first season of the league. The inclusion of drag-flicker Sandeep Singh seems to have sorted that problem out for them this season. Out of the 27 goals scored by the team, nine have come from penalty corners with Sandeep scoring six of them.</p>
<p>Apart from coming up with goals, Sandeep has emerged as a vital cog in the team’s defence. In their match against Uttar Pradesh Wizards, Sandeep was in top form, scoring once and making a couple of good saves in the team’s 2-1 win. Not only did he keep Teun de Nooijer out, Sandeep also showed his creative streak, setting up two clear chances for Simon Orchard and Shivedra Singh to score goals.</p>
<p>Coming into their match, Punjab Warriors had managed just one win against Uttar Pradesh Wizards in five matches spread across both the seasons of the league. Captain Jamie Dwyer tried setting the record straight, as he gave the home side the lead despite the Wizards having most of the possession in the first half. The Wizards clearly missed VR Raghunath, their top scorer, who was rested for the match.</p>
<p>It was Sandeep, however, that proved the difference on the day. From the two penalty corners that were awarded to Punjab on Saturday, Sandeep managed to convert one from a rebound after his shot had hit keeper Srinivas Rao Katharu. The goal gave the side a 2-0 lead. Even though Hugo Reid pulled one back one for Wizards, the Punjab defenders, specially Sandeep, to ensure a spot in the last four.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Deepak Hooda, who plays for Baroda, has always been a very accurate bowler according to his coach.<img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985969&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height:1.5em;">A spinner is not expected to cause too much trouble to teams from the sub-continent, but Deepak Hooda, whose five-for was instrumental in the 40-run win over Pakistan, is not all that easy to play.</span></p>
<p>Hooda, who plays for Baroda, has always been a very accurate bowler according to his coach, former Baroda batsman Sanjiv Sawant. A bowler who concentrates on hitting a designated spot continuously, Hooda gets results. “He won’t turn the ball too much, but his accuracy ensures that batsmen have to play in certain areas. That allows him time to work on batsmen and he manages to extract spin and bounce suddenly, and that works for him,” says Sawant.</p>
<p><strong>Giving nothing away</strong></p>
<p>Despite being introduced early, in the 11th over, Hooda just went for 23 runs in his first eight overs for three wickets. Seventy per cent of his deliveries were concentrated in a tight channel around the good-length area, outside the off-stump. The son of a serving Air Force sergeant, Hooda says that he just wanted to bowl as many dot balls as possible.</p>
<p>“On this wicket, which was getting a little slow, I had to contain the batsmen at first. Once, I managed to do that, I started bowling slower through the air and also going wide of the crease to create some different angles,” he says. Hooda bowled 32 dot balls in his 10 overs, bowling to his field and preying on the batsmen’s urge to hit their way out of trouble.</p>
<p>Hooda, who played for Haryana in age-group cricket, seeks out India all-rounder Irfan Pathan, before every big tournament. “He has helped me with the mental aspect as well as with methods on working out batsmen and utilizing different conditions,” he says.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=indianexpress.com&#038;blog=53855017&#038;post=1985969&#038;subd=indianexpressonline&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
